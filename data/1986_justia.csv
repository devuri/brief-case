No. 85-1088
Argued Nov. 4, 1986
Decided Feb. 24, 1987
480 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
An Alabama statute requires an appellate court, upon affirming a money judgment without substantial modification, to impose a 10% penalty on any appellant who had obtained a stay of that judgment by executing a bond.  The statute's purposes are to penalize frivolous appeals and those interposed for delay, and to provide appellees with additional compensation for having to suffer the ordeal of appeal.  Upon affirming without modification a judgment for respondents in their federal diversity action arising from a motorcycle accident, the Eleventh Circuit imposed the Alabama statute's penalty on petitioner, which had posted bond to stay the judgment pending appeal.
Held:  The Alabama mandatory affirmance penalty statute has no application to judgments entered by federal courts sitting in diversity.  Pp.  480 U. S. 3-8.
(a) Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure affords federal courts of appeals plenary discretion to award damages to an appellee upon determining that the appeal is frivolous.  Federal Rule 38's discretionary mode of operation conflicts with the Alabama statute's mandatory operation.  Furthermore, the purposes underlying Rule 38 -- to penalize frivolous appeals and to compensate injured appellees for the delay and added expense inherent therein -- are sufficiently coextensive with the statute's purposes to indicate that the Rule occupies the statute's field of operation.  The fact that Alabama has a similar Appellate 
Page 480 U. S. 2
 Rule coexisting with the statute does not mean that a federal court could impose the mandatory statutory penalty while remaining free to exercise its Federal Rule 38 discretionary authority, since the statute would improperly limit the exercise of that discretion in instances in which the court wished to impose a penalty of less than 10%.  Pp.  480 U. S. 4-8.
(b) Rule 38 must be applied under the analysis set forth in Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, since (a) it is a constitutional exercise of rulemaking authority in that it regulates matters that can reasonably be classified as procedural, and (b) it affects only the process of enforcing litigants' rights, and not the rights themselves, and therefore does not violate the Rule Enabling Act's prohibition against affecting substantive rights (28 U.S.C. 2072).

No. A-480
Decided Dec. 31, 1986
479 U.S. 1312

JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.
Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc., has filed with me as Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit an ""Application to Stay Mandate of United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Pending Certiorari,"" seeking an order under 28 U.S.C.  2101(f) staying the fullpower operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant located near Cleveland, Ohio.  The order sought would remain in effect until the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issues its final decision in the pending suit filed by the applicant against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and, should the applicant be unsuccessful in that suit, until disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court.
The application must be denied.  Section 2101(f) provides:
""In any case in which the final judgment or decree of any 
Page 479 U. S. 1313
 court is subject to review by the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari, the execution and enforcement of such judgment or decree may be stayed for a reasonable time to enable the party aggrieved to obtain a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court.""
(Emphasis added.)  It is clear from this language that even though certiorari review of interlocutory orders of federal courts is available, see 28 U.S.C.  1254(1) and 1292, it is only the execution or enforcement of final orders that is stayable under  2101(f).  See Twentieth Century Airlines Inc. v. Ryan, 74 S.Ct. 8, 10, 98 L.Ed. 1143, 1145 (1953) (Reed, J., in chambers).  In this case, the only extant order which, if stayed, could conceivably affect the fullpower operation of the Perry plant is the Sixth Circuit's order of December 23, 1986, lifting the stay of fullpower operation that it imposed on November 13, 1986.  That order, however -- like the stay itself -- is interlocutory.

Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.
No. 85-701
Argued October 7, 1986
Decided December 15, 1986
479 U.S. 238

Syllabus 
Section 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations from using treasury funds to make an expenditure ""in connection with"" any federal election, and requires that any expenditure for such purpose be financed by voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund.  Appellee is a nonprofit, nonstock corporation, whose purpose is to foster respect for human life and to defend the right to life of all human beings, born and unborn, through educational, political, and other forms of activities.  To further this purpose, it has published a newsletter that has been distributed to contributors and to noncontributors who have expressed support for the organization.  In September, 1978, appellee prepared and distributed a ""Special Edition"" exhorting readers to vote ""pro-life"" in the upcoming primary elections in Massachusetts, listing the candidates for each state and federal office in every voting district in the State, and identifying each one as either supporting or opposing appellee's views.  While some 400 candidates were listed, the photographs of only 13 were featured, all of whom were identified as favoring appellee's views.  The publication was prepared by a staff that had prepared no regular newsletter, was distributed to a much larger audience than that of the regular newsletter, most of whom were members of the general public, and was financed by money taken from appellee's general treasury funds.  A complaint was filed with appellant Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that the ""Special Edition"" violated  316 as representing an expenditure of funds from a corporate treasury to distribute to the general public a campaign flyer on behalf of certain political candidates.  After the FEC determined that there was probable cause to believe that appellee had violated the statute, the FEC filed a complaint in Federal District Court, seeking a civil penalty and other relief.  The District Court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, holding that  316 did not apply to appellee, but that, if it did it, was unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals held that the statute applied to appellee and, as so applied, was unconstitutional. 
Page 479 U. S. 239

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
769 F.2d 13, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II, III-B, and III-C, concluding that:
1. Appellee's publication and distribution of the ""Special Edition"" violated  316.  Pp.  479 U. S. 245-251.
(a) There is no merit to appellee's contention that preparation and distribution of the ""Special Edition"" does not fall within  316's definition of ""expenditure"" as the provision of various things of value ""to any candidate, campaign committee, or political party or organization, in connection with any election,"" especially since the general definitions section of the FECA broadly defines ""expenditure"" as including provision of anything of value made ""for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.""  Moreover, the legislative history clearly confirms that  316 was meant to proscribe expenditures in connection with an election.  That history makes clear that Congress has long regarded it as insufficient merely to restrict payments made directly to candidates or campaign organizations.  Pp.  479 U. S. 245-248.
(b) An expenditure must constitute ""express advocacy"" in order to be subject to  316's prohibition.  Here, the publication of the ""Special Edition"" constituted ""express advocacy,"" since it represented express advocacy of the election of particular candidates distributed to members of the general public.  Pp.  479 U. S. 248-250.
(c) Appellee is not entitled to the press exemption under the FECA reserved for any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through any ""periodical publication,"" since even assuming that appellee's regular newsletter is exempt under this provision, the ""Special Edition"" cannot be considered comparable to any single issue of the newsletter, in view of the method by which it was prepared and distributed.  Pp.  479 U. S. 250-251.
2. Section 316's restriction of independent spending is unconstitutional as applied to appellee, for it infringes protected speech without a compelling justification for such infringement.  The concern underlying the regulation of corporate political activity -- that organizations that amass great wealth in the economic marketplace not gain unfair advantage in the political marketplace -- is absent with regard to appellee.  Appellee was formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass capital.  It has no shareholders or other persons having a claim on its assets or earnings, but obtains its funds from persons who make contributions to further the organization's political purposes.  It was not established by a business corporation or a labor union, and its policy is not to accept contributions from such entities.  Pp.  479 U. S. 256-265. 
Page 479 U. S. 240

JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part III-A that the practical effect of applying  316 to appellee of discouraging protected speech is sufficient to characterize  316 as an infringement on First Amendment activities.  As a corporation, appellee is subject to more extensive requirements and more stringent restrictions under the FECA than it would be if was not incorporated.  These include detailed recordkeeping and disclosure obligations, the requirement of a complex and formalized organization, and a limitation on whom can be solicited for contributions, all of which create a disincentive for such an organization to engage in political speech.  Pp.  479 U. S. 251-256.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, agreeing that  316 is unconstitutional as applied to appellee's conduct at issue, concluded that the significant burden on appellee comes not from the statute's disclosure requirements that appellee must satisfy, but from the additional organizational restraints imposed upon it by the statute.  These restraints do not further the Government's informational interest in campaign disclosure, and cannot be justified by any of the other interests identified by the FEC.  Pp.  479 U. S. 265-266.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Parts I and II, an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III-B and III-C, in which MARSHALL, POWELL, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III-A, in which MARSHALL, POWELL, and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

Decided Dec. 10, 1986
479 U.S. 157

Syllabus 
Respondent approached a Denver police officer and stated that he had murdered someone and wanted to talk about it.  The officer advised respondent of his Miranda rights, and respondent said that he understood those rights, but still wanted to talk about the murder.  Shortly thereafter, a detective arrived and again advised respondent of his rights.  After respondent answered that he had come all the way from Boston to confess to the murder, he was taken to police headquarters.  He then openly detailed his story to the police and subsequently pointed out the exact location of the murder.  He was held overnight, and the next day he became visibly disoriented during an interview with the public defender's office and was sent to a state hospital for evaluation.  Interviews with a psychiatrist revealed that respondent was following the ""voice of God"" in confessing to the murder.  On the basis of the psychiatrist's testimony that respondent suffered from a psychosis that interfered with his ability to make free and rational choices and, although not preventing him from understanding his rights, motivated his confession, the trial court suppressed respondent's initial statements and custodial confession because they were ""involuntary,"" notwithstanding the fact that the police had done nothing wrong or coercive in securing the confession.  The court also found that respondent's mental state vitiated his attempted waiver of the right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination.  The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the Federal Constitution requires a court to suppress a confession when the defendant's mental state, at the time he confessed, interfered with his ""rational intellect"" and his ""free will,"" the very admission of the evidence in a court of law being sufficient state action to implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court further held that respondent's mental condition precluded his ability to make a valid waiver of his Miranda rights, and that the State had not met its burden of proving a waiver by ""clear and convincing evidence.""
Held:
1. Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that a confession is not ""voluntary"" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.  Here, the taking of respondent's statements and their admission into evidence constituted no violation of that Clause.  While a defendant's mental condition may be a ""significant"" factor in the ""voluntariness"" 
Page 479 U. S. 158
 calculus, this does not justify a conclusion that his mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry into constitutional ""voluntariness.""  Pp.  479 U. S. 163-167.
2. Whenever the State bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement allegedly obtained in violation of the Miranda doctrine, the State need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.  Lego v. Twomey,, 404 U. S. 477, reaffirmed.  Thus, the Colorado Supreme Court erred in applying a ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard.  That court also erred in its analysis of the question whether respondent had waived his Miranda rights.  Notions of ""free will"" have no place in this area of constitutional law.  Respondent's perception of coercion flowing from the ""voice of God"" is a matter to which the Federal Constitution does not speak.  Pp.  479 U. S. 167-171.

No. 85-656
Argued October 7, 1986
Decided December 10, 1986
479 U.S. 189

Syllabus 
A Washington statute ( 29.18.110) requires that a minor party candidate for office receive at least 1% of all votes cast for that office in the State's primary election before the candidate's name will be placed on the general election ballot.  Appellee Peoples qualified to be placed on the primary election ballot as the nominee of appellee Socialist Workers Party (Party) for United States Senator.  At the primary, he received less than 1% of the total votes cast for the office, and, accordingly, his name was not placed on the general election ballot.  Peoples, the Party, and appellee registered voters then brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that  29.18.110 violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  29.18.110, as applied to candidates for statewide offices, was unconstitutional.
Held:  Section 29.18.110 is constitutional.  Pp.  479 U. S. 193-199.
(a) States have a right to require candidates to make a preliminary showing of substantial support in order to qualify for a place on the ballot.  Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431; American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U. S. 767.  Pp.  479 U. S. 193-194.
(b) The fact that Washington's political history evidences no voter confusion from ballot overcrowding does not require invalidation of  29.18.110.   A State is not required to prove actual voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, or the presence of frivolous candidates as a predicate to imposing reasonable ballot access restrictions.  In any event, the record in this case discloses that enactment of  29.18.110 was, in fact, linked to the legislature's perception that the general election ballot was becoming cluttered with minor party candidates who did not command significant voter support, and the State was clearly entitled to raise the ante for ballot access, to simplify the general election ballot, and to avoid the possibility of unrestrained factionalism at the general election.  Pp.  479 U. S. 194-196.
(c) The burdens imposed on appellees' First Amendment rights by  29.18.110 are not too severe to be justified by the State's interest in restricting access to the general ballot.  Pp.  479 U. S. 196-197. 
Page 479 U. S. 190

(d) The differences between requiring primary votes to qualify for a position on the general election ballot and requiring signatures on nominating petitions are not of constitutional dimension.  Pp.  479 U. S. 197-198.
(e) There is no merit to appellees' argument that, since voter turnout at primary elections is generally lower than the turnout at general elections,  29.18.110 has reduced the pool of potential supporters from which appellee Party candidates can secure 1% of the vote.  The statute creates no impediment to voting at primary elections, and does no more than require a candidate to show a ""significant modicum"" of voter support in primary elections.  P.  479 U. S. 198.
(f) Section 29.18.110 serves to promote the very First Amendment values that are threatened by overly burdensome ballot access restrictions.  Washington's voters are not denied freedom of association because they must channel their expressive activity into a campaign at the primary as opposed to the general election.  Pp.  479 U.

Republican Party of Connecticut
No. 85-766
Argued October 8, 1986
Decided December 10, 1986
479 U.S. 208

Syllabus 
A Connecticut statute ( 9-431), enacted in 1956, requires voters in any political party primary to be registered members of that party.  In 1984, appellee Republican Party of Connecticut (Party) adopted a Party rule that permits independent voters -- registered voters not affiliated with any party -- to vote in Republican primaries for federal and statewide offices.  The Party and the Party's federal officeholders and state chairman (also appellees) brought an action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of  9-431 on the ground that it deprives the Party of its right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter into political association with individuals of its own choosing, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment in appellees' favor, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held.
1. Section 9-431 impermissibly burdens the rights of the Party and its members protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  479 U. S. 213-225.
(a) The freedom of association protected by those Amendments includes partisan political organization.  Section 9-431 places limits upon the group of registered voters whom the Party may invite to participate in the ""basic function"" of selecting the Party's candidates.  The State thus limits the Party's associational opportunities at the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power in the community.  The fact that the State has the power to regulate the time, place, and manner of elections does not justify, without more, the abridgment of fundamental rights, such as the right to vote or, as here, the freedom of political association.  Pp.  479 U. S. 213-217.
(b) The interests asserted by appellant Secretary of State of Connecticut as justification for the statute -- that it ensures the administrability of the primary, prevents voter raiding, avoids voter confusion, and protects the integrity of the two-party system and the responsibility 
Page 479 U. S. 209
 of party government -- are insubstantial.  The possibility of increases in the cost of administering the election system is not a sufficient basis for infringing appellees' First Amendment rights.  The interest in curtailing raiding is not implicated, since  9-431 does not impede a raid on the Republican Party by independent voters; independent raiders need only register as Republicans and vote in the primary.  The interest in preventing voter confusion does not make it necessary to burden the Party's associational rights.  And even if the State were correct in arguing that  9-431, in providing for a closed primary system, is designed to save the Party from undertaking conduct destructive of its own interests, the State may not constitutionally substitute its judgment for that of the Party, whose determination of the boundaries of its own association and of the structure that best allows it to pursue its political goals is protected by the Constitution.  Pp.  479 U. S. 217-225.
2. The implementation of the Party rule will not violate the Qualifications Clause of the Constitution -- which provides that the House of Representatives ""shall be composed of Members chosen . . . by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature"" -- and the parallel provision of the Seventeenth Amendment, because it does not disenfranchise any voter in a federal election who was qualified to vote in a primary or general election for the more numerous house of the state legislature.  The Clause and the Amendment are not violated by the fact that the Party rule establishes qualifications for voting in congressional elections that differ from the qualifications in elections for the state legislature.  Where state law, as here, has made the primary an integral part of the election procedure, the requirements of the Clause and the Amendment apply to primaries as well as to general elections.  The achievement of the goal of the Clause to prevent the mischief that would arise if state voters found themselves disqualified from participating in federal elections does not require that qualifications for exercise of the federal franchise be precisely equivalent to the qualifications for exercising the franchise in a given State.  Pp.  479 U. S. 225-229.

Syllabus 
Section 16 of the Clayton Act entitles a private party to sue for injunctive relief against ""threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.""  Respondent, the country's fifth-largest beef packer, brought an action in Federal District Court under  16 to enjoin the proposed merger of petitioner Excel Corporation, the second-largest packer, and Spencer Beef, the third-largest packer.  Respondent alleged that it was threatened with a loss of profits by the possibility that Excel, after the merger, would lower its prices to a level at or above its costs in an attempt to increase its market share.  During trial, Excel moved for dismissal on the ground that respondent had failed to allege or show that it would suffer antitrust injury, but the District Court denied the motion.  After trial, the District Court held that respondent's allegation of a ""price-cost squeeze"" that would severely narrow its profit margins constituted an allegation of antitrust injury.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that respondent's allegation of a ""price-cost squeeze"" was not simply one of injury from competition, but was a claim of injury by a form of predatory pricing in which Excel would drive other companies out of the market.
Held:
1. A private plaintiff seeking injunctive relief under  16 must show a threat of injury ""of the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.""  Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U. S. 477,  429 U. S. 489.  Pp.  479 U. S. 109-113.
2. The proposed merger does not constitute a threat of antitrust injury.  A showing, as in this case, of loss or damage due merely to increased competition does not constitute such injury.  And while predatory pricing is capable of inflicting antitrust injury, here respondent neither raised nor proved any claim of predatory pricing before the District Court, and thus the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting respondent's allegations as equivalent to allegations of injury from predatory conduct.  Pp.  479 U. S. 113-119.
3. This Court, however, will not adopt in effect a per se rule denying competitors standing to challenge acquisitions on the basis of predatory

No. 85-1021
Argued Oct. 6, 1986
Decided Dec. 9, 1986*
479 U.S. 130

Syllabus 
Appellant, a New Jersey corporation with its principal office and only manufacturing facilities located in North Carolina, blends tobacco imported from foreign countries with domestic tobacco in producing finished tobacco products virtually all of which are consumed in the United States.  Upon importation, the foreign tobacco is placed under customs bond given by appellant, and is stored in one or more of the customs-bonded warehouses owned and maintained by appellant in appellee Forsyth and Durham Counties, N. C., usually for a 2-year period to permit aging.  Appellant pays the required customs duties upon withdrawal of the tobacco from the warehouses.  Under North Carolina statutes, tobacco present in the State on January 1 of each year is subject to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax levied and collected by counties and municipalities.  In listing its taxable personal property for 1983 in appellee counties, appellant claimed that, under the ruling in Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, 459 U. S. 145, its imported tobacco in customs-bonded warehouses was immune from state taxation on federal constitutional grounds.  The counties' tax supervisors denied the claim, and the denials were upheld on administrative appeals.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting appellant's contentions that the tax violated the Import-Export and Due Process Clauses, and distinguished Xerox, reasoning that it prohibited state taxation only of imported goods stored under bond and awaiting export, not of those destined for domestic manufacture and consumption.  Appellant filed with the North Carolina Supreme Court both a notice of appeal and a petition for discretionary review.  The court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of a substantial constitutional question and denied appellant's petition.  Appellant then filed with this Court an appeal from the North Carolina Supreme Court and another appeal from the North Carolina Court of Appeals. 
Page 479 U. S. 131

Held:
1. This Court has appellate jurisdiction as to the North Carolina Supreme Court's judgment, under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2), which extends such jurisdiction to review a ""final"" judgment
""rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.  Pp.  479 U. S. 136-139.""
(a) Appellant properly challenged on federal constitutional grounds the validity of North Carolina's ad valorem property tax, and there was a final judgment in favor of validity.  Cf. Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434.  Pp.  479 U. S. 136-138.
(b) The appeal from the North Carolina Supreme Court, not the North Carolina Court of Appeals, is the proper one under  1257(2).  A North Carolina statute gives a litigant an appeal of right to the State Supreme Court from any Court of Appeals decision that ""directly involves a substantial question arising under the Constitution of the United States.""  In the absence of positive assurance to the contrary by the North Carolina Supreme Court, its grant of appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of a substantial federal constitutional question constitutes a decision on the merits affirming the Court of Appeals' judgment, not a determination that the State Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.  Pp.  479 U. S. 138-139.
2. Consistent with the Supremacy Clause, a State may impose a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported goods stored in a customs-bonded warehouse and destined for domestic manufacture and sale.  The holding in Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, supra, is limited to its factual situation, that is, where taxed imported goods in customs-bonded warehouses are intended for transshipment in foreign commerce.  North Carolina's taxation of appellant's goods does not contradict the purposes of the federal statutory scheme governing customs-bonded warehouses to promote foreign commerce and to aid certain sectors of American economic life.  To invalidate the North Carolina tax would place domestic tobacco, which is subject to the ad valorem property tax while aging, at a distinct disadvantage to the imported tobacco; domestic producers and local taxpayers would ""subsidize"" the growers of imported tobacco.  Nor does the taxation here conflict with the central purpose behind customs-bonded warehouses:  to ensure that federal customs duties are collected. The federal statutes and regulations that guide monitoring the movement of imported goods and the warehouse proprietor's conduct with respect to such goods both guarantee the collection of federal revenues and are not so comprehensive as to leave no room for North Carolina's assessment of ad valorem taxes.  Pp.  479 U. S. 139-152. 
Page 479 U. S. 132

3. Application of the North Carolina tax to appellant's imported tobacco does not violate the Import-Export Clause.  The focus of Import-Export Clause cases is on the nature of the tax at issue, not the nature of the goods as imports.  North Carolina's tax does not offend the policies behind the Clause:  concern that a state tax might interfere with federal regulation of foreign commerce; fear that on account of such state taxation the Federal Government will lose an important source of revenue; and a desire to maintain harmony among the States, which would be disturbed if seaboard States could tax goods merely flowing through their ports to other States not so favorably situated.  Cf. Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276.  Pp.  479 U. S. 152-155.
4. North Carolina's tax does not violate the Due Process Clause.  A state tax comports with the Clause if the taxing power exerted by the State bears a ""fiscal relation"" to protection, opportunities, and benefits given by the State.  In light of the police, fire, and other services provided to appellant's imported tobacco by North Carolina counties and cities, such a ""fiscal relation"" clearly exists in this case.  P.  479 U. S. 156.

			"|"R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Durham County, North Carolina
No. 85-1021
Argued Oct. 6, 1986
Decided Dec. 9, 1986*
479 U.S. 130

Syllabus 
Appellant, a New Jersey corporation with its principal office and only manufacturing facilities located in North Carolina, blends tobacco imported from foreign countries with domestic tobacco in producing finished tobacco products virtually all of which are consumed in the United States.  Upon importation, the foreign tobacco is placed under customs bond given by appellant, and is stored in one or more of the customs-bonded warehouses owned and maintained by appellant in appellee Forsyth and Durham Counties, N. C., usually for a 2-year period to permit aging.  Appellant pays the required customs duties upon withdrawal of the tobacco from the warehouses.  Under North Carolina statutes, tobacco present in the State on January 1 of each year is subject to a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax levied and collected by counties and municipalities.  In listing its taxable personal property for 1983 in appellee counties, appellant claimed that, under the ruling in Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, 459 U. S. 145, its imported tobacco in customs-bonded warehouses was immune from state taxation on federal constitutional grounds.  The counties' tax supervisors denied the claim, and the denials were upheld on administrative appeals.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting appellant's contentions that the tax violated the Import-Export and Due Process Clauses, and distinguished Xerox, reasoning that it prohibited state taxation only of imported goods stored under bond and awaiting export, not of those destined for domestic manufacture and consumption.  Appellant filed with the North Carolina Supreme Court both a notice of appeal and a petition for discretionary review.  The court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of a substantial constitutional question and denied appellant's petition.  Appellant then filed with this Court an appeal from the North Carolina Supreme Court and another appeal from the North Carolina Court of Appeals. 
Page 479 U. S. 131

Held:
1. This Court has appellate jurisdiction as to the North Carolina Supreme Court's judgment, under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2), which extends such jurisdiction to review a ""final"" judgment
""rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.  Pp.  479 U. S. 136-139.""
(a) Appellant properly challenged on federal constitutional grounds the validity of North Carolina's ad valorem property tax, and there was a final judgment in favor of validity.  Cf. Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434.  Pp.  479 U. S. 136-138.
(b) The appeal from the North Carolina Supreme Court, not the North Carolina Court of Appeals, is the proper one under  1257(2).  A North Carolina statute gives a litigant an appeal of right to the State Supreme Court from any Court of Appeals decision that ""directly involves a substantial question arising under the Constitution of the United States.""  In the absence of positive assurance to the contrary by the North Carolina Supreme Court, its grant of appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of a substantial federal constitutional question constitutes a decision on the merits affirming the Court of Appeals' judgment, not a determination that the State Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.  Pp.  479 U. S. 138-139.
2. Consistent with the Supremacy Clause, a State may impose a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported goods stored in a customs-bonded warehouse and destined for domestic manufacture and sale.  The holding in Xerox Corp. v. County of Harris, supra, is limited to its factual situation, that is, where taxed imported goods in customs-bonded warehouses are intended for transshipment in foreign commerce.  North Carolina's taxation of appellant's goods does not contradict the purposes of the federal statutory scheme governing customs-bonded warehouses to promote foreign commerce and to aid certain sectors of American economic life.  To invalidate the North Carolina tax would place domestic tobacco, which is subject to the ad valorem property tax while aging, at a distinct disadvantage to the imported tobacco; domestic producers and local taxpayers would ""subsidize"" the growers of imported tobacco.  Nor does the taxation here conflict with the central purpose behind customs-bonded warehouses:  to ensure that federal customs duties are collected. The federal statutes and regulations that guide monitoring the movement of imported goods and the warehouse proprietor's conduct with respect to such goods both guarantee the collection of federal revenues and are not so comprehensive as to leave no room for North Carolina's assessment of ad valorem taxes.  Pp.  479 U. S. 139-152. 
Page 479 U. S. 132

3. Application of the North Carolina tax to appellant's imported tobacco does not violate the Import-Export Clause.  The focus of Import-Export Clause cases is on the nature of the tax at issue, not the nature of the goods as imports.  North Carolina's tax does not offend the policies behind the Clause:  concern that a state tax might interfere with federal regulation of foreign commerce; fear that on account of such state taxation the Federal Government will lose an important source of revenue; and a desire to maintain harmony among the States, which would be disturbed if seaboard States could tax goods merely flowing through their ports to other States not so favorably situated.  Cf. Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276.  Pp.  479 U. S. 152-155.
4. North Carolina's tax does not violate the Due Process Clause.  A state tax comports with the Clause if the taxing power exerted by the State bears a ""fiscal relation"" to protection, opportunities, and benefits given by the State.  In light of the police, fire, and other services provided to appellant's imported tobacco by North Carolina counties and cities, such a ""fiscal relation"" clearly exists in this case.  P.  479 U. S. 156.
No. 86-1021, 314 N.C. 540, 336 S.E.2d 21, affirmed.  No. 85-1022, appeal dismissed; reported below:  73 N.C.App. 476, 326 S.E.2d 911.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 1, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held below that petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel was not violated when he was refused counsel at his preliminary hearing on a capital murder charge, because the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing was harmless error. 
Page 479 U.S. 996 , 997
 I 
 Petitioner Donald Wayne Thomas was convicted of murder and sentenced to death after jury trial. The State of Georgia charged petitioner, who was then nineteen years old, with the murder of a nine-year-old boy. At the preliminary hearing held ten days after petitioner's arrest, petitioner requested an opportunity to retain private counsel, indicating that he did not wish to be represented by the public defender. The court denied petitioner's request, excused the public defender, and held the preliminary hearing in the absence of any defense counsel. The State's main witness, a fifteen-year-old mentally retarded girl, then testified without cross-examination that petitioner had told her he had committed the murder, and had shown her the body. This testimony differed in various material respects from the later testimony given by this witness at trial. 
 On direct appeal from petitioner's subsequent conviction, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Thomas v. State, 245 Ga. 688, 266 S.E.2d 499 (1980). This Court granted certiorari, vacated the sentence of death, and remanded for reconsideration in light of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980). Thomas v. Georgia, 449 U.S. 988 (1980). On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated the death sentence, without benefit of further briefing or oral argument. Thomas v. State, 247 Ga. 233, 275 S.E.2d 318, cert. denied, 452 U.S. 973d 984 (1981). Having exhausted in state post-conviction proceedings claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct at the sentencing phase of the trial, petitioner's counsel brought a federal habeas corpus action raising those issues. 
 During the pendency of the federal petition, counsel, who had not represented petitioner at trial, first discovered the preliminary hearing transcript in the files of the public defender's office, and realized that petitioner had been denied counsel at his preliminary hearing. Counsel notified the District Court that Thomas would move to amend his federal habeas petition as soon as the new claim could be presented to the state courts for exhaustion. Relief on this claim was denied in new state proceedings, and petitioner's counsel moved to amend the federal petition. The District Court vacated petitioner's death sentence on the ground that petitioner had not received effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial, but denied the motion to amend the petition as untimely.

No. 85-495
Argued Oct. 14, 1986
Decided Nov. 17, 1986
479 U.S. 60

Syllabus 
Respondent Philbrook (hereafter respondent), a teacher employed by petitioner school board (Board), is a member of a church whose tenets require members to refrain from secular employment during designated holy days, a practice that has caused respondent to miss approximately six schooldays each year.  Under pertinent collective bargaining agreements between the Board and the teachers' union, teachers were granted three days' annual leave for observance of religious holidays, but could not use for religious observance any accumulated sick leave, three days of which were otherwise available for ""necessary personal business.""  Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements, respondent used the three days granted for religious holidays each year, and then either took unauthorized unpaid leave, scheduled required hospital visits on church holy days, or worked on those days.  Respondent repeatedly asked the Board either to adopt the policy of allowing use of the three days of personal business leave for religious observance or, in the alternative, to allow him to pay the cost of a substitute and receive full pay for additional days off for religious observances.  The Board consistently rejected both proposals, and respondent ultimately filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the Board had violated the prohibition against religious discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, particularly the Board's obligation under  701(j) of the Act to
""reasonably accommodate to an employee's . . . religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.  
Page 479 U. S. 61
 After trial, the District Court concluded that respondent had failed to prove a case of religious discrimination because he had not been placed by the Board in a position of violating his religion or losing his job.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that respondent had established a prima facie case of discrimination.  The court then assumed that the Board's leave policy constituted a reasonable accommodation to respondent's belief, but held that where the employer and the employee each propose a reasonable accommodation, Title VII requires the employer to accept the employee's proposal unless that accommodation causes undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.  The case was remanded for consideration of the hardship that would result from respondent's suggestions.""
Held:
1. This case presents no issue that requires, for purposes of Title VII religious accommodation claims, the establishing of a proof-scheme delineating a plaintiff's prima facie case and the shifting production burdens.  The ultimate Title VII question of discrimination vel non was directly before the District Court, because the Board failed to persuade the court to dismiss the action for want of a prima facie case, and the case was fully tried on the merits.  Thus, the issue whether respondent made out a prima facie case was no longer relevant.  Cf. United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711.   479 U. S.  67-68.
2. Neither the terms nor the legislative history of  701(j) supports the Court of Appeals' conclusion that an employer's accommodation obligation includes a duty to accept the employee's proposal unless that accommodation causes undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.  An employer has met its obligation under  701(j) when it demonstrates that it has offered a reasonable accommodation to the employee.  The employer need not further show that each of the employee's alternative accommodations would result in undue hardship.  The extent of undue hardship on the employer's business is at issue only where the employer claims that it is unable to offer any reasonable accommodation without such hardship.  Pp.  479 U. S. 68-69.
3. Because both of the courts below applied an erroneous view of the law, neither explicitly considered the question whether the Board's leave policy constituted a reasonable accommodation of respondent's religious beliefs.  There are insufficient factual findings as to the manner in which the collective bargaining agreements have been interpreted in order for this Court to make that judgment initially.  On remand, the District Court should make the necessary findings as to past and existing practice in the administration of the collective bargaining agreements.  Pp.  479 U. S. 70-71.

No. 86-21
Decided November 17, 1986
479 U.S. 85

Syllabus 
Respondent, a native and citizen of Dominica, West Indies, remained in the United States illegally after her authorization to stay expired in 1975.  Two of her minor nieces, United States citizens, came from Dominica to live with her in 1983 to attend school.  In deportation proceedings instituted against her in 1983, respondent conceded deportability, but applied for suspension of deportation pursuant to  244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to suspend deportation and to adjust the illegal alien's status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if, inter alia, deportation would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to ""his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.""  An Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals found that respondent could not demonstrate extreme hardship to herself or to the specified persons.  The Board also determined, as a factual matter, that respondent's separation from her nieces would not constitute extreme hardship to herself, and, as a legal matter, that a niece is not a ""child"" within  244(a)(1)'s meaning.  On review, the Court of Appeals held that the Board erred in not giving sufficient consideration to whether respondent's relationship with her nieces was the functional equivalent of a parent-child relationship.  Remanding the case, the court instructed the Board to determine whether there was such a relationship, and, if so, whether respondent's nieces would experience extreme hardship as a result of her deportation.
Held:  The Board is not required under  244(a)(1) to consider the hardship to a third party other than a spouse, parent, or child, as defined by the Act.  The definition of the term ""child"" in  101(b)(1) of the Act is particularly exhaustive.  Even if respondent's relationship with her nieces closely resembles a parent-child relationship, Congress, through the statute's plain language, precluded the functional approach to defining the term ""child.""

Decided Nov. 17, 1986
479 U.S. 92

Syllabus 
The City Commission of Newport, Ky., enacted an ordinance prohibiting nude or nearly nude dancing in local establishments licensed to sell 
Page 479 U. S. 93
 liquor for consumption on the premises.  Respondents, proprietors of Newport liquor establishments that offered nude or nearly nude entertainment, filed an action in Federal District Court contending that the ordinance deprived them of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional under the doctrine of New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714, which upheld a state law imposing an almost identical prohibition on nude dancing as being within the State's broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to regulate the sale of liquor within its boundaries.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held: The ordinance is constitutional.  This case is controlled by Bellanca.  The States' broad regulatory authority conferred by the Twenty-first Amendment in the context of liquor licensing includes the power to ban nude dancing and outweighs any First Amendment interest in nude dancing.  The Court of Appeals misperceived this broad base for the Bellanca decision by concluding that because, under the Kentucky Constitution, a city cannot ban the sale of alcohol without approval by local election, it similarly cannot regulate nude dancing in bars.  Generally, States may delegate their power under the Twenty-first Amendment as they see fit, and the fact that Kentucky has delegated one portion of its power to the electorate -- the power to decide if liquor may be served in local establishments -- does not differentiate this case from Bellanca.
Certiorari granted; 786 F.2d 1364, reversed and remanded.

 AMOCO OIL CO.v. JIM HEILIG OIL & GAS, INC. and Harmer OilNo. 85-2107 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 17, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 This case concerns an application of the ""separate document"" requirement for judgments contained in Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [Footnote 1] I dissent from the denial of certiorari because I am persuaded that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit misconstrued our prior cases having to do with the requirement. [ Amoco Oil Co. v. Jim Heilig Oil & Gas, Inc 479 U.S. 966 (1986) ][966-Continued.] 
 Petitioner Amoco Oil Co. took an appeal from an order issued by the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. On May 21, 1985, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling by a memorandum and order consisting of a single document. Petitioner moved for reconsideration. The motion was denied on June 28 in a similar single- document memorandum and order. [Footnote 2] 

 On July 25, 1985, Amoco filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Sixty Circuit. That court issued an order directing Amoco to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed. It suggested that, because the District Court had issued 
Page 479 U.S. 966 , 967
 its initial memorandum opinion and order on May 21, Amoco's filing would be 35 days late under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a) and 26(a). App. to Pet. for Cert. C-1. In response, Amoco contended that, rather than being untimely, its appeal actually was premature, given that the District Court had never entered a judgment separate from the May 21 memorandum and order as Rule 58 requires. The Court of Appeals rejected this contention. It observed that in Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381 (1978) (per curiam), this Court had adopted a common-sense, rather than a technical, approach to the requirements of Rule 58 so long as no party was misled. App. to Pet. for Cert. D-1. The Court of Appeals further noted that Amoco's motion for reconsideration of the May 21 memorandum and order demonstrated that Amoco considered that opinion to be the final decision. Accordingly, the court concluded, ""The mere technicality that the district court failed to file a separate judgment should not be used to give jurisdiction to this Court of an untimely filed appeal in which the parties were not misled by the lack of a separate judgment."" App. to Pet. for Cert. D-1 to D-2. 
 Rule 58 provides in pertinent part: ""Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document."" See n. 1, supra. The genesis and purpose of this ""separate document"" requirement, which was added to Rule 58 by amendment in 1963, are explained in the Advisory Committee Notes. Prior to the amendment difficulties had arisen in situations where a court had "" written an opinion or memorandum containing some apparently directive or dispositive words, e.g., 'the plaintiff's motion [for summary judgment] is granted.' "" 28 U.S.C.App., p. 627. At times court clerks had viewed these documents as a sufficient basis for entering a judgment. Problems occasionally arose, however, when the documents did not provide all the necessary elements of the judgment or when the court later would issue a formal judgment. Parties were thus uncertain as to when the judgment was effective and as to when the time began to run for purposes of filing post- judgment motions and appeals. The Advisory Committee observed: ""The amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that there be a judgment set out on a separate document-distinct from any opinion or memorandum-which provides the basis for the entry of judgment."" Id., at 628. 
 This Court already has been concerned with the interpretation of Rule 58. In United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U.S. 216d 202 (1973) [479 U.S. 966 , 968]

 Chester Levon MAXWELLv. FLORIDANo. 86-5541 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 17, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 ( 1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed under certain circumstances, I would nevertheless grant certiorari because petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel required that he be given access to his trial counsel's work files for use in his state habeas corpus hearing in which he alleged that trial counsel's representation was constitutionally deficient. 
 I  
 Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death after a jury trial. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. 443 So.2d 967 (1983). Fol- 
Page 479 U.S. 972 , 973
 lowing the issuance of a death warrant, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in state court. After a hearing, the habeas petition was denied; the Supreme Court of Florida again affirmed. 490 So.2d 927 (1986). 
 The petition stated a claim for ineffective assistance of trial counsel, challenging counsel's failure to make certain motions and objections in the course of petitioner's defense. The habeas petition also alleged that trial counsel, engaged in his first attempt to defend a client on capital charges, inadequately investigated petitioner's background in preparation for the penalty phase of the trial. 490 So.2d, at 932-933. 
 Prior to the hearing, petitioner's trial counsel refused habeas counsel's informal request to produce work files pertaining to petitioner's defense. Time constraints did not permit habeas counsel to subpoena these materials before filing petitioner's motion for habeas corpus relief. [Footnote 1] When the trial attorney testified at the hearing, he admitted denying access to the requested files and again refused production. He offered this justification for his refusal: 
 ""It is my reason and belief that . . . if I'm going to divulge or reveal or to allow people to inspect my files it should be done by court order from either side and the reason for that belief is that I think and believe wholeheartedly that if an attorney who's a trial attorney is preparing his case for trial that if its going to be subject to review a couple of years later it may put a chilling effect on an attorney making notes or work product or whatever have you. 
 ""In other words, that attorney may not be as free to express himself within his own confines of his file and, consequently, until a court orders me to do so and that's determined to be a lawful order, I have refused permission to turn it over to you."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 19-20. 
 Habeas counsel then moved to compel production of the trial attorney's entire file. The state court denied this motion ""based upon [ trial counsel's] rationale."" Id., at 20. 
 Without the file, petitioner was unable to demonstrate the alleged deficiency of trial counsel's representation, particularly with respect to his preparation for the penalty phase of petitioner's trial. [479 U.S. 972 , 974]

|479 u.s. 36|"Kelly v. Robinson
No. 85-1033
Argued Oct. 8, 1986
Decided Nov. 12, 1986
479 U.S. 36

Syllabus 
In 1980, respondent pleaded guilty in a Connecticut state court to a larceny charge based on her wrongful receipt of welfare benefits from the Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance.  She was sentenced to a prison term, but the court suspended execution of the sentence and placed her on probation for five years.  As a condition of probation, the court ordered respondent to make restitution through monthly payments to the Connecticut Office of Adult Probation until the end of her probation period.  Under Connecticut statutes, restitution payments are sent to the Probation Office, and are then forwarded to the victim.  In 1981, respondent filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in Bankruptcy Court, listing the restitution obligation as a debt.  The Connecticut agencies, although notified, did not file proofs of claim or objections to discharge, and the Bankruptcy Court subsequently granted respondent a discharge.  She made no further restitution payments.  After the Probation Office informed her that it considered the restitution obligation nondischargeable, she filed a proceeding against petitioner state officials in the Bankruptcy Court, seeking a declaration that the restitution obligation was discharged.  The court concluded that, even if the restitution obligation was a debt subject to bankruptcy jurisdiction, it was automatically nondischargeable under  523(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a discharge in bankruptcy does not affect any debt that
""is for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.""
The District Court adopted the Bankruptcy Court's proposed disposition of the case, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 523(a)(7) preserves from discharge in Chapter 7 any condition a state criminal court imposes as part of a criminal sentence.  Thus, restitution obligations, imposed as conditions of probation in state criminal proceedings, are not dischargeable.  Pp.  479 U. S. 43-53.
(a) Despite the language of the earlier Bankruptcy Act of 1898 that apparently allowed criminal penalties to be discharged, most courts refused to allow a discharge to affect a state criminal court's judgment.  When the present Bankruptcy Code was enacted in 1978, there was a 
Page 479 U. S. 37
 widely accepted judicial exception to discharge for criminal sentences, including restitution obligations imposed as part of such sentences.  In construing the scope of bankruptcy codifications, this Court has followed the rule that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.  Midlantic National Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S. 494.  Pp.  479 U. S. 43-47.
(b) The basis for the judicial exception here is the deep conviction that federal bankruptcy courts should not invalidate the results of state criminal proceedings.  Although it might be true that Connecticut officials could have ensured continued enforcement of the criminal judgment against respondent by objecting to discharge under the Code, that fact does not justify an interpretation of the Code that is contrary to the long-prevailing view that fines and penalties are not affected by a discharge.  Moreover, reliance on a right to appear and object to discharge would create uncertainties and impose undue burdens on state officials.  The prospect of federal remission of judgments imposed by state criminal judges would hamper the flexibility of those judges in choosing the combination of imprisonment, fines, and restitution most likely to further the rehabilitative and deterrent goals of state criminal justice systems.  Pp.  479 U. S. 47-49.
(c) On its face,  523(a)(7) does not compel the conclusion that a discharge voids restitution orders imposed as conditions of probation by state courts.  Nothing in the House and Senate Reports indicates that this language should be read so intrusively.  Section 523(a)(7) protects traditional criminal fines.  Although restitution, unlike traditional fines, is forwarded to the victim and may be calculated by reference to the amount of harm the offender has caused, neither of the statute's qualifying clauses -- namely, the fines must be ""to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,"" and ""not compensation for pecuniary loss"" -- allows the discharge of a criminal judgment that takes the form of restitution.  The decision to impose restitution generally does not turn on the victim's injury, but on the penal goals of the State and the defendant's situation.  Pp.  479 U. S. 50-53.
776 F.2d 30, reversed.
POWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, BLACKMUN, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined.  MARSHALL, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which STEVENS, J., joined, post, p.  479 U. S. 53.

 In this case, the District Court permitted a thirteenth, alternate juror to participate in the jury's deliberations, a procedure to which petitioner's counsel stipulated. The thirteen jurors unanimously found petitioner guilty. On appeal, petitioner argued that the use of a thirteen-member jury violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c), that the Rule is not waivable, and that even if it is, it can only be waived by a defendant personally and not by counsel. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner, through his counsel, had waived compliance with Rule 24(c). It concluded that ""[b]ecause the waiver herein was neither prejudicial nor of constitutional magnitude and was made in the presence of the defendant in open court, . . . the failure to obtain appellant's personal assent . . ., [if erroneous,] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."" 790 F.2d 208 (CA2 1986). This decision conflicts with United States v.

Syllabus 
The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. 1988, provides that ""[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce"" certain enumerated civil rights laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party, other than the United States.  Title VI prohibits ""any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance"" from discriminating on the basis of race, color, or national origin.  Respondents filed an administrative complaint with the United States Department of Transportation, challenging petitioner North Carolina Department of Transportation's proposed extension of a largely federally funded major expressway through an established, predominantly black neighborhood in the city of Durham as violative of Title VI.  Subsequent negotiations resulted, after five years, in a Final Mitigation Plan executed by petitioners, respondents, and the city that resolved the controversy.  In the meantime, construction of the highway extension had been enjoined by the Federal District Court in an unrelated action alleging violations of certain federal statutes that did not include any civil rights laws.  Respondents in the instant case moved to intervene in that action and filed a proposed complaint asserting Title VI violations.  The District Court subsequently entered a consent judgment dissolving the injunction and dismissing the action and also respondents' Title VI claims on the condition that petitioners implement the Final Mitigation Plan.  The following day, that Plan was executed.  Respondents then filed an action in District Court for attorney's fees under 1988 for services performed by their counsel in preparing the administrative complaint and in negotiating resolution of the dispute.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners and dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that 1988 covered the actions taken by respondents subsequent to the filing of the administrative complaint, and that 1988 allowed a separate action for attorney's fees.
Held:
1. Under 1988's plain language and legislative history, only a court in an action to enforce one of the civil rights laws listed in 1988 may

Section 1 of Article XV of the Agreement in Implementation of Article III of the Panama Canal Treaty provides that the Panama Canal Commission and its contractors ""are exempt from payment in the Republic of Panama of all taxes . . . on their activities or property.""  The first sentence of  2 of Article XV provides that ""United States citizen employees . . . shall be exempt from any taxes . . . on income received as a result of their work for the Commission,"" and the second sentence exempts such employees ""from payment of taxes . . . on income derived from sources outside the Republic of Panama.""  Section 3 provides that such employees
""shall be exempt from taxes . . . on gifts or inheritance or on personal property, the presence of which within the territory of the Republic of Panama is due solely to the stay therein of such persons on account of their . . . work with the Commission.""
Petitioners, United States citizen employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their spouses, sought refunds of United States income taxes collected on salaries paid by the Commission for certain years, contending that  2 of Article XV constitutes an express exemption of those salaries from both Panamanian and United States taxation.  The Claims Court agreed, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Article XV applies only to Panamanian taxes, and hence petitioners are not entitled to refunds of United States income taxes paid.  Section 1 of Article XV establishes the context for the discussion of tax exemption in the entire Article, so that when  2 and 3 state that ""United States citizen employees . . . shall be exempt"" from taxes they are understood to be dealing only with taxes payable in Panama.  If the first sentence of  2 were interpreted to refer to United States as well as Panamanian taxes, then the second sentence and  3 would also do so, with the implausible consequence that United States citizen employees would be exempt not only from United States income taxes on their earnings from the Commission but also from such taxes on income from sources outside Panama and from all United States gift and inheritance taxes.

After an Arkansas State Trooper was killed in the line of duty, his widow (petitioner) received a $50,000 benefit from the Federal Government pursuant to the Public Safety Officers' Death Benefits Act.  The Act provides that its benefits ""shall be in addition to any other benefit that may be due from any other source,"" with certain exceptions not applicable here.

 David J. BROWNv. NORTH CAROLINANo. 86-5234 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 3, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, concurring. 
 I write briefly in support of the Court's denial of the petition for certiorari in this case, and to respond to Justice BRENNAN's suggestion that the limits on the prosecutor's right to peremptorily challenge jurors found in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. ___ ( 1986), 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 941
 apply outside the context of racial discrimination forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause. Batson does not touch, indeed, it clearly reaffirms, id., at ___, 106 S.Ct., at ___. The ordinary rule that a prosecutor may exercise his peremptory strikes for any reason at all. Batson, in my view, depends upon this Nation's profound commitment to the ideal of racial equality, a commitment that refuses to permit the State to act on the premise that racial differences matter. It is central to Batson that a "" person's race simply 'is unrelated to his fitness as a juror.' "" Id., at ___, 106 S.Ct. at 1718 (citation omitted). 
 There is no basis for declaring that a juror's attitudes towards the death penalty are similarly irrelevant to the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. Indeed, Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), upon which Justice BRENNAN's dissent so heavily relies, itself recognizes the relevance of this attitudinal factor . Categorical exclusion of jurors with moral qualms over capital punishment is forbidden precisely because such a practice would produce ""a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die."" Id., at 521. 
 Moreover, Justice BRENNAN's dissent ignores a fundamental distinction between peremptory challenges of jurors and challenges for cause. Challenges for cause permit the categorical and unlimited exclusion of jurors exhibiting an inability to serve fairly and impartially in the case to be tried, as noted in Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985). In Witherspoon, the Court held that the Constitution does not tolerate such a categorical exclusion of jurors who merely express moral scruples about or general objections to capital punishment unless it would "" 'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.' "" Wainwright v. Witt, supra, at 424, 105 S.Ct. at 852. ( citation omitted). 
 Peremptory challenges are limited in number. Each party, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel, must balance a host of considerations in deciding which jurors should be peremptorily excused. Permitting prosecutors to take into account the concerns expressed about capital punishment by prospective jurors, or any other factor, in exercising peremptory challenges simply does not implicate the concerns expressed in Witherspoon. 
 We ought not delude ourselves that the deep faith that race should never be relevant has completely triumphed over the painful social reality that, sometimes, it may be. That the Court will not tolerate prosecutors' racially discriminatory use of the pe- 942] 
remptory challenge, in effect, is a special rule of relevance, a statement about what this Nation stands for, rather than a statement of fact. In my view, that special rule is a product of the unique history of racial discrimination in this country; it should not be divorced from that context. Outside the uniquely sensitive area of race the ordinary rule that a prosecutor may strike a juror without giving any reason applies. Because a juror's attitudes towards the death penalty may be relevant to how the juror judges, while, as a matter of law, his race is not, this case is not like Batson. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the decision below insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because the petitioner presents strong evidence that the state used its peremptory challenges in this case to exclude jurors that it was forbidden to excuse for cause under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). 
 In Witherspoon, this Court held that, in a capital case, the prosecution may not exclude for cause those jurors who indicate that they have scruples about the death penalty, but who nonetheless state that such beliefs would not prevent them from performing their duties as jurors according to law. Exclusion of such jurors, we said, denies a capital defendant the right to sentencing by an impartial jury that is representative of the community, for it ""produce[s] a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die."" 391 U.S., at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776. We underscored the importance of this right in Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38 (1980), which held unconstitutional the exclusion of jurors who acknowledged that their concerns about capital punishment might affect their ability to find facts that would lead to its automatic imposition. Texas could not, we said, bar jurors who stated that they would honestly find the relevant facts if convinced of their existence beyond a reasonable doubt, 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 943
 be or what they may deem to be a reasonable doubt. Such assessments and judgments by jurors are inherent in the jury system, and to exclude all jurors who would be in the slightest way affected by the prospect of the death penalty or by their views about such a penalty would be to deprive the defendant of the impartial jury to which he or she is entitled under the law."" Id., at 50, 100 S.Ct. at 2528.
 The petitioner in the case before us, David J. Brown, was convicted of the first-degree murder of two women and given two death sentences. At voir dire, the prosecutor had sought to determine not merely if prospective jurors had any scruples about the death penalty that might impair their performance, but if they had any scruples about it at all. The prosecutor was remarkably candid about this objective in addressing the venire at the start of voir dire: 
 As the voir dire reveals, the prosecutor diligently pursued his goal of seating only those jurors rigidly committed to the death penalty: 
 A.: I am for it. 
 Q.: I didn't understand you. 
 A.: I said I'm for it. 
 Q.: How long have you been in favor of capital punishment in some cases, Mr. Caldwell? 
 A.: All my life, every time I hear tale of something like that, about all my life, I guess. 
 Q.: That's what I wanted to hear, Mr. Caldwell. 
 * * * * * 
 Q.: Mrs. Pope, do you know your mind to the extent of saying whether or not you believe in capital punishment? 
 A.: I do. 
 Q.: Have all of your adult life? 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 944
 A.: Yes, sir. 
 Q.: And if ultimately you are called upon after a proper instruction by the Judge to carefully consider what should happen to, to determine life or death, that wouldn't bother you unduly, will it? 
 A.: No, sir."" Pet. at 7, 9-10. 
 In another exchange, after juror Williams stated that he believed in capital punishment, the prosecutor continued to question him to establish that he had the ""strength and fortitude"" to render a death verdict "" without any doubt."" Pet. at 10. 
 Those jurors who indicated the slightest uncertainty about the death penalty were excused by peremptory challenge, without inquiry into whether their convictions would render them incapable of performing their duties as jurors: 
 Q.: Mrs. Beaver, having sat here for some several minutes in this courtroom today, you know what we are here for? 
 A.: Yes. 
 Q.: Having thoughts about capital punishment, at least I would assume here today, and no doubt having thought about it in the past, do you know your mind about that question? 
 A.: I'm afraid I don't. 
 Q.: Afraid you don't? 
 A.: No. 
 Prosecutor: The State will excuse Mrs. Beaver with our thanks. Pet. at 9. 
 The State concedes that it could not have excused for cause those jurors failing the prosecutor's litmus test. It maintains, however, that since it used peremptory challenges to accomplish this end, its conduct is immune from scrutiny. The State reads our recent decision in Batson v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___ (1986), as significant only in that it proscribes racially discriminatory peremptory challenges. It insists that, since the challenges were exercised in this case in a racially neutral manner, they are free from constitutional infirmity. 
 The implication of the State's position is that it is free to use its peremptory challenges to violate any constitutional command other than the Equal Protection Clause. The state, however, misses the wider significance of Batson: that the broad discretion 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 945
 afforded prosecutors in the exercise of peremptory challenges may not be abused to accomplish any unconstitutional end. In Batson, we said that "" counsel's effort to obtain possibly relevant information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the practice at issue here."" --- U.S . ___, at ___, n. 12, at 1718, n. 12 (emphasis added). 
 Justice O'CONNOR's concurrence observes that, as an unfortunate matter of fact, race may be relevant in that it may actually influence a juror's decision. The concurrence correctly notes that such factual relevance is insufficient to justify the exercise of a peremptory challenge on the basis of a juror's race, because race has been deemed irrelevant as a matter of law. The concurrence, however, fails to recognize that precisely the same situation obtains with respect to scruples about the death penalty. Such scruples may be relevant as a matter of fact. Nonetheless, that is insufficient to justify the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors with such scruples, for Witherspoon and Adams make clear that this characteristic is irrelevant as a matter of law. It does not the minimize the tragic history of race discrimination in this country to insist that we enforce the Witherspoon proscription just as faithfully as that forbidding reliance on race, for we may not pick and choose which constitutional rights we will and will not vindicate in monitoring the jury selection process. 
 Peremptory challenges may be used for reasons that may not comport completely with rational analysis, or that may resist coherent articulation. Such latitude has for practical reasons required a presumption that these challenges are exercised in a constitutionally responsible fashion. As Batson makes clear, however, that presumption is rebuttable. In this case, the Court is presented with evidence from the voir dire that plainly indicates that the prosecutor used its peremptory challenges to obtain the ""hanging jury,"" Witherspoon, 391 U.S. at 523, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, that he could not obtain through challenges for cause. We therefore cannot maintain the usual presumption that these challenges were properly used. 
 Agents of the State enjoy considerable discretion in performing certain functions within the criminal justice system. With great discretion, however, comes great responsibility. When a court has evidence that the state has not lived up to that responsibility, its refusal to intervene converts discretion into a license for constitutional violation. For this reason, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.

 I write briefly in support of the Court's denial of the petition for certiorari in this case, and to respond to Justice BRENNAN's suggestion that the limits on the prosecutor's right to peremptorily challenge jurors found in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. ___ ( 1986), 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 941
 apply outside the context of racial discrimination forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause. Batson does not touch, indeed, it clearly reaffirms, id., at ___, 106 S.Ct., at ___. The ordinary rule that a prosecutor may exercise his peremptory strikes for any reason at all. Batson, in my view, depends upon this Nation's profound commitment to the ideal of racial equality, a commitment that refuses to permit the State to act on the premise that racial differences matter. It is central to Batson that a "" person's race simply 'is unrelated to his fitness as a juror.' "" Id., at ___, 106 S.Ct. at 1718 (citation omitted). 
 There is no basis for declaring that a juror's attitudes towards the death penalty are similarly irrelevant to the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. Indeed, Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), upon which Justice BRENNAN's dissent so heavily relies, itself recognizes the relevance of this attitudinal factor . Categorical exclusion of jurors with moral qualms over capital punishment is forbidden precisely because such a practice would produce ""a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die."" Id., at 521. 
 Moreover, Justice BRENNAN's dissent ignores a fundamental distinction between peremptory challenges of jurors and challenges for cause. Challenges for cause permit the categorical and unlimited exclusion of jurors exhibiting an inability to serve fairly and impartially in the case to be tried, as noted in Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985). In Witherspoon, the Court held that the Constitution does not tolerate such a categorical exclusion of jurors who merely express moral scruples about or general objections to capital punishment unless it would "" 'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.' "" Wainwright v. Witt, supra, at 424, 105 S.Ct. at 852. ( citation omitted). 
 Peremptory challenges are limited in number. Each party, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel, must balance a host of considerations in deciding which jurors should be peremptorily excused. Permitting prosecutors to take into account the concerns expressed about capital punishment by prospective jurors, or any other factor, in exercising peremptory challenges simply does not implicate the concerns expressed in Witherspoon. 
 We ought not delude ourselves that the deep faith that race should never be relevant has completely triumphed over the painful social reality that, sometimes, it may be. That the Court will not tolerate prosecutors' racially discriminatory use of the pe- 942] 
remptory challenge, in effect, is a special rule of relevance, a statement about what this Nation stands for, rather than a statement of fact. In my view, that special rule is a product of the unique history of racial discrimination in this country; it should not be divorced from that context. Outside the uniquely sensitive area of race the ordinary rule that a prosecutor may strike a juror without giving any reason applies. Because a juror's attitudes towards the death penalty may be relevant to how the juror judges, while, as a matter of law, his race is not, this case is not like Batson. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the decision below insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because the petitioner presents strong evidence that the state used its peremptory challenges in this case to exclude jurors that it was forbidden to excuse for cause under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968). 
 In Witherspoon, this Court held that, in a capital case, the prosecution may not exclude for cause those jurors who indicate that they have scruples about the death penalty, but who nonetheless state that such beliefs would not prevent them from performing their duties as jurors according to law. Exclusion of such jurors, we said, denies a capital defendant the right to sentencing by an impartial jury that is representative of the community, for it ""produce[s] a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die."" 391 U.S., at 521, 88 S.Ct. at 1776. We underscored the importance of this right in Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38 (1980), which held unconstitutional the exclusion of jurors who acknowledged that their concerns about capital punishment might affect their ability to find facts that would lead to its automatic imposition. Texas could not, we said, bar jurors who stated that they would honestly find the relevant facts if convinced of their existence beyond a reasonable doubt, 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 943
 be or what they may deem to be a reasonable doubt. Such assessments and judgments by jurors are inherent in the jury system, and to exclude all jurors who would be in the slightest way affected by the prospect of the death penalty or by their views about such a penalty would be to deprive the defendant of the impartial jury to which he or she is entitled under the law."" Id., at 50, 100 S.Ct. at 2528.
 The petitioner in the case before us, David J. Brown, was convicted of the first-degree murder of two women and given two death sentences. At voir dire, the prosecutor had sought to determine not merely if prospective jurors had any scruples about the death penalty that might impair their performance, but if they had any scruples about it at all. The prosecutor was remarkably candid about this objective in addressing the venire at the start of voir dire: 
 As the voir dire reveals, the prosecutor diligently pursued his goal of seating only those jurors rigidly committed to the death penalty: 
 A.: I am for it. 
 Q.: I didn't understand you. 
 A.: I said I'm for it. 
 Q.: How long have you been in favor of capital punishment in some cases, Mr. Caldwell? 
 A.: All my life, every time I hear tale of something like that, about all my life, I guess. 
 Q.: That's what I wanted to hear, Mr. Caldwell. 
 * * * * * 
 Q.: Mrs. Pope, do you know your mind to the extent of saying whether or not you believe in capital punishment? 
 A.: I do. 
 Q.: Have all of your adult life? 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 944
 A.: Yes, sir. 
 Q.: And if ultimately you are called upon after a proper instruction by the Judge to carefully consider what should happen to, to determine life or death, that wouldn't bother you unduly, will it? 
 A.: No, sir."" Pet. at 7, 9-10. 
 In another exchange, after juror Williams stated that he believed in capital punishment, the prosecutor continued to question him to establish that he had the ""strength and fortitude"" to render a death verdict "" without any doubt."" Pet. at 10. 
 Those jurors who indicated the slightest uncertainty about the death penalty were excused by peremptory challenge, without inquiry into whether their convictions would render them incapable of performing their duties as jurors: 
 Q.: Mrs. Beaver, having sat here for some several minutes in this courtroom today, you know what we are here for? 
 A.: Yes. 
 Q.: Having thoughts about capital punishment, at least I would assume here today, and no doubt having thought about it in the past, do you know your mind about that question? 
 A.: I'm afraid I don't. 
 Q.: Afraid you don't? 
 A.: No. 
 Prosecutor: The State will excuse Mrs. Beaver with our thanks. Pet. at 9. 
 The State concedes that it could not have excused for cause those jurors failing the prosecutor's litmus test. It maintains, however, that since it used peremptory challenges to accomplish this end, its conduct is immune from scrutiny. The State reads our recent decision in Batson v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___ (1986), as significant only in that it proscribes racially discriminatory peremptory challenges. It insists that, since the challenges were exercised in this case in a racially neutral manner, they are free from constitutional infirmity. 
 The implication of the State's position is that it is free to use its peremptory challenges to violate any constitutional command other than the Equal Protection Clause. The state, however, misses the wider significance of Batson: that the broad discretion 
Page 479 U.S. 940 , 945
 afforded prosecutors in the exercise of peremptory challenges may not be abused to accomplish any unconstitutional end. In Batson, we said that "" counsel's effort to obtain possibly relevant information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the practice at issue here."" --- U.S . ___, at ___, n. 12, at 1718, n. 12 (emphasis added). 
 Justice O'CONNOR's concurrence observes that, as an unfortunate matter of fact, race may be relevant in that it may actually influence a juror's decision. The concurrence correctly notes that such factual relevance is insufficient to justify the exercise of a peremptory challenge on the basis of a juror's race, because race has been deemed irrelevant as a matter of law. The concurrence, however, fails to recognize that precisely the same situation obtains with respect to scruples about the death penalty. Such scruples may be relevant as a matter of fact. Nonetheless, that is insufficient to justify the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors with such scruples, for Witherspoon and Adams make clear that this characteristic is irrelevant as a matter of law. It does not the minimize the tragic history of race discrimination in this country to insist that we enforce the Witherspoon proscription just as faithfully as that forbidding reliance on race, for we may not pick and choose which constitutional rights we will and will not vindicate in monitoring the jury selection process. 
 Peremptory challenges may be used for reasons that may not comport completely with rational analysis, or that may resist coherent articulation. Such latitude has for practical reasons required a presumption that these challenges are exercised in a constitutionally responsible fashion. As Batson makes clear, however, that presumption is rebuttable. In this case, the Court is presented with evidence from the voir dire that plainly indicates that the prosecutor used its peremptory challenges to obtain the ""hanging jury,"" Witherspoon, 391 U.S. at 523, 88 S.Ct. at 1777, that he could not obtain through challenges for cause. We therefore cannot maintain the usual presumption that these challenges were properly used. 
 Agents of the State enjoy considerable discretion in performing certain functions within the criminal justice system. With great discretion, however, comes great responsibility. When a court has evidence that the state has not lived up to that responsibility, its refusal to intervene converts discretion into a license for constitutional violation. For this reason, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.

 Oct. 23, 1986. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, Circuit Justice. 
 Applicant requests that I issue a stay pending the filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari to review the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Three. The California Court of Appeal judgment granted Phillip William Feiock's petition for habeas corpus, holding that the United States Constitution requires that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt in a civil contempt proceeding that Mr. Feiock was able to comply with a previous court order. The Orange County Superior Court had ordered Mr. Feiock to make child support payments, and after Mr. Feiock failed to comply with this court order, he was held in civil contempt. He was sentenced to a 25- day suspended sentence, placed on probation, and ordered to begin making his child support payments or prepare himself for incarceration. At the civil contempt hearing, the 
Page 479 U.S. 1305 , 1306
 trial court applied Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. 1209.5 (West 1982), which provides that proof that a court of competent jurisdiction had issued a child support order which was filed and served on a parent, together with proof of noncompliance, constitutes prima facie evidence of a contempt of court. 
 On petition of Mr. Feiock, the California Court of Appeal granted a writ of habeas corpus and annulled the judgment of contempt. In re Feiock, 180 Cal.App.3d 649, 225 Cal.Rptr. 748 (1986). The court held that 1209. 5 was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it created a mandatory presumption that shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, requiring him to prove that he was unable to comply with the child support order. The court relied on this Court's decisions involving the use of mandatory presumptions in criminal prosecutions. See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 61 L. Ed.2d 39 (1979); Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140 (1979). The Supreme Court of California denied the State's petition for review. 
 My obligation as a Circuit Justice in considering a stay application under 28 U.S.C. 2101(f) and Rule 44 of this Court is ""to determine whether four Justices would vote to grant certiorari, to balance the so- called 'stay equities,' and to give some consideration as to predicting the final outcome of the case in this Court."" Gregory-Portland Independent School District v. United States, 448 U.S. 1342 (1980) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). These factors lead me to conclude that the request for a stay should be granted. 
 I have serious doubts about the validity of the California Court of Appeal's conclusion in light of this Court's nearly unanimous decision in United States v. Rylander, 460 U.S. 752 ( 1983). In Rylander, this Court held that an alleged contemner has the burden of showing a current inability to comply with a court order, and that a contemner must overcome a presumption of ability to comply with a court order.

 Oct. 15, 1986. 

 Justice SCALIA, Circuit Justice. 
 I doubt the conclusion of the Kentucky Supreme Court that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment gives an accused child molester the right to be present at the hearing inquiring into the competency of his child victim to testify. I see, moreover, at least a "" fair prospect"" that a majority of this Court would find that conclusion erroneous. See Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U.S. 1306, 1308, 2 (1980) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers).

Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because this petition presents an important issue concerning the application of this Court's decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed.2d 674 (1984). 
 Petitioner Donald Dufour was convicted of capital murder occurring in the course of a robbery. His appointed counsel presented no evidence in mitigation of sentence at the penalty phase of his trial. The jury found that the State had established two aggravating circumstances and recommended a sentence of death. The State Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence. Dufour v. State, 453 So.2d 337 (Miss.1984). This Court denied certiorari. Dufour v. Mississippi, ___ U.S. ___ (1985). Petitioner then instituted a post-conviction proceeding to vacate judgment and sentence in the State trial court, contending that he 
Page 479 U.S. 891 , 892
 had received ineffective assistance of counsel in that his appointed trial counsel had failed to request appointment of a psychiatrist to assist the defense in developing psychological evidence to be submitted to the jury in mitigation of sentence. The trial court summarily denied this and petitioner's other claims, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Dufour v. State, 483 So.2d 307 (Miss.1985). 
 It appears that in his post-conviction application, petitioner again requested appointment of a psychiatrist to assist counsel in showing that petitioner's defense at the penalty phase of his trial was prejudiced by the absence of psychological evidence. He submitted the affidavit of Dr. Stanley, the court-appointed psychiatrist who had previously examined him for the purpose of determining his competency to stand trial. Dr. Stanley stated that the limited examination he had conducted for purposes of determining competency bore no relation to the more extensive and qualitatively different investigation required to present useful assistance to trial counsel on the subject of mitigation. Pet. for Cert. 7. Both the trial court and State Supreme Court denied relief without ruling on petitioner's renewed request for the appointment of a psychiatrist; no evidentiary hearing was held on petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance. The State Supreme Court affirmed the denial of relief, stating that: 
 II  
 In Strickland, supra, this Court established a two-part standard for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. ""First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed [479 U.S. 891 , 893]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 14, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. His conviction was based on evidence the Florida Supreme Court found constitutionally suspect. The Florida Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that admission of the evidence was harmless constitutional error . I would grant certiorari to review the Florida Supreme Court's application of Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427d 340 (1972) and Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85d 171 (1963).

 Petitioner became a suspect in the disappearance of Kimberly Leach after local authorities learned that he was suspected in a number of murders in the northwestern United States. Leach was reported missing from school on February 9, 1978 and her body was found two months later, after a highly-publicized search. The only eyewitness to the abduction was Clarence Anderson. He came forward on July 18, after seeing petitioner on a television newscast. At that time, Anderson was unable to identify the date of his observation, although he thought it was ""around April,"" and he could not provide a detailed description of the man or the girl he had observed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a-21a. At the request of the Assistant State Attorney, Anderson underwent two hypnotic sessions designed to refresh his recollection. 
 Petitioner moved to suppress Anderson's testimony due to the lapse of time between Leach's disappearance and his initial statement, the massive publicity surrounding her disappearance and petitioner's arrest and indictment and an alleged misuse of hypnosis by the persons conducting the sessions. He maintained that these factors rendered Anderson's identification unreliable under the rule established by this Court's decision in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 ( 1972). At the suppression hearing, several experts testified that a witness whose recollection has been hypnotically refreshed is unable to distinguish between what he recollected before hypnosis and any ""details"" added during hypnosis. 
 The trial court denied petitioner's motion to suppress. At trial, Anderson testified that he had observed a man leading a young girl into a white van near Leach's junior high school on February 9, 1978. He identified the man as petitioner and the girl as Kimberly Leach. Anderson's testimony was vital to the State's case; it supplied ""the crucial link in the chain of circumstantial evidence of [petitioner's] guilt."" Bundy v. State, 471 So.2d 9, 23 (Fla.1985) (Boyd, C.J., concurring specially). 
 On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court agreed with petitioner's arguments against the use of hypnotically refreshed testimony. Id., at 18 . The court noted that the highest courts of several other states have categorically excluded hypnotically refreshed testimony. E.g., People v. Shirley, 31 Cal.3d 18, 723 P.2d 1354, 181 Cal.Rptr. 243, cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1125 (1982); People v. Gonzales, 415 Mich. 615, 329 N.W.2d 743 (1982).

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 I would grant this petition for certiorari to consider the extent of the obligations our decision in Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), imposes on a trial judge confronted with a claim of juror bias. 
 I  
 Petitioner Anthony Porter was convicted of two murders committed in the course of an armed robbery and was sentenced to death. During voir dire, the trial judge read a list of potential witnesses, including the mother of Marilyn Green, one of the victims. He did not ask whether any of the prospective jurors knew any of the persons on the list, and none of them volunteered that they did. After the jury returned a guilty verdict, petitioner waived his right to a jury at the penalty proceeding. Before the judge dismissed the jurors, however, he addressed them as follows: 
 ""THE COURT: It was brought to my attention before I actually formally dismissed you that one of the jurors stated that he knew that some other juror purportedly or allegedly went to church-to the same church as one of the decedent's mother. Is that right, was that you-please identify yourself. MRS. TRICKLET: * Yes, but that didn't make any difference to me about that. THE COURT: Thank you, ma'am. It didn't make any difference? MRS.

 Janice Marie BUTTRUMv. Gary BLACK, WardenNo. 85-7071 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 14, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Her conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and this Court denied certiorari. Buttrum v. State, 249 Ga. 652, 293 S.E.2d 334 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1156 (1983). The present petition seeks review of a subsequent denial of state habeas corpus relief in state court. [ Buttrum v. Black 479 U.S. 902 (1986) ][902-Continued.] 
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 ( 1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would, at the very least, delay the disposition of this petition until California v. Brown, No. 85-1563, is decided. 
 I  
 In closing argument at the sentencing phase of petitioner's trial, the prosecutor incorporated statements from an 1873 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court that appears with some regularity in contemporary capital sentencing proceedings in that state. See Eberhart v. State, 47 Ga. 598, 609-610 (1873); Ruffin v. State, 243 Ga. 95, 105, 252 S.E.2d 472, 479-480 (1979). The effect of these statements was to lead the jury to believe that mercy was not a permissible component of their sentencing determination: 
Page 479 U.S. 902 , 903
 crime. Society demands that the crime be punished and criminals warned. The false humanity that starts and shudders when the axe of justice is about to fall is a dangerous element for the peace of society. We have had too much of this mercy. It is not true mercy. It only looks to the criminal. . . . A stern, unbending, unflinching administration of justice is the surest way to prevent the commission of other heinous and horrible acts like the one committed by that Defendant. We are a society of Laws, not of sentiment."" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-4, pp. 17-18.
 On more than one occasion, the Georgia Supreme Court has condemned use of the statements employed by the prosecutor in petitioner's sentencing hearing-at least where they are attributed to a Justice of that court-though it has generally found their effect insufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal of the death sentences imposed. See, e.g., Ruffin, supra, at 105, 252 S.E.2d, at 479-480; Hawes v. State, 240 Ga. 327, 335-336, 240 S.E.2d 833, 840 (1977). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has rejected use of this same language, regardless of the spokesman, because its content does not relate to the particular circumstances of the defendant whose sentence is being determined, but rather implies that considerations of mercy can have no part in jury deliberations in capital sentencing proceedings. See, e.g., Wilson v. Kemp, 777 F.2d 621, 624, 626-628 (1985), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ (1986); Drake v. Kemp, 762 F.2d 1449, 1458- 1461 (1985), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986). These divergent opinions from the Eleventh Circuit and the Georgia Supreme Court raise serious questions as to the constitutionally permissible scope of prosecutorial comment on the role of mercy in the jury's sentencing decision. Because we granted certiorari in California v. Brown, supra, to decide a closely related issue, I dissent from the present denial of this petition.

State, 249 Ga. 652, 293 S.E.2d 334 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1156 (1983). The present petition seeks review of a subsequent denial of state habeas corpus relief in state court. [ Buttrum v. Black 479 U.S. 902 (1986) ][902-Continued.] 
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 ( 1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would, at the very least, delay the disposition of this petition until California v. Brown, No. 85-1563, is decided. 
 I  
 In closing argument at the sentencing phase of petitioner's trial, the prosecutor incorporated statements from an 1873 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court that appears with some regularity in contemporary capital sentencing proceedings in that state. See Eberhart v. State, 47 Ga. 598, 609-610 (1873); Ruffin v. State, 243 Ga. 95, 105, 252 S.E.2d 472, 479-480 (1979). The effect of these statements was to lead the jury to believe that mercy was not a permissible component of their sentencing determination: 
Page 479 U.S. 902 , 903
 crime. Society demands that the crime be punished and criminals warned. The false humanity that starts and shudders when the axe of justice is about to fall is a dangerous element for the peace of society. We have had too much of this mercy. It is not true mercy. It only looks to the criminal. . . . A stern, unbending, unflinching administration of justice is the surest way to prevent the commission of other heinous and horrible acts like the one committed by that Defendant. We are a society of Laws, not of sentiment."" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-4, pp. 17-18.
 On more than one occasion, the Georgia Supreme Court has condemned use of the statements employed by the prosecutor in petitioner's sentencing hearing-at least where they are attributed to a Justice of that court-though it has generally found their effect insufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal of the death sentences imposed. See, e.g., Ruffin, supra, at 105, 252 S.E.2d, at 479-480; Hawes v. State, 240 Ga. 327, 335-336, 240 S.E.2d 833, 840 (1977). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has rejected use of this same language, regardless of the spokesman, because its content does not relate to the particular circumstances of the defendant whose sentence is being determined, but rather implies that considerations of mercy can have no part in jury deliberations in capital sentencing proceedings. See, e.g., Wilson v. Kemp, 777 F.2d 621, 624, 626-628 (1985), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ (1986); Drake v. Kemp, 762 F.2d 1449, 1458- 1461 (1985), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986). These divergent opinions from the Eleventh Circuit and the Georgia Supreme Court raise serious questions as to the constitutionally permissible scope of prosecutorial comment on the role of mercy in the jury's sentencing decision. Because we granted certiorari in California v. Brown, supra, to decide a closely related issue, I dissent from the present denial of this petition.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri insofar as it left undisturbed the death

However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because this petition presents an important issue concerning the application of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. 
 Petitioner William Theodore Boliek, Jr., was charged with the murder of Jody Harless. The State alleged that Boliek shot Harless twice, once in the stomach and once in the head, in order to prevent her from testifying about a robbery in which she had been an accomplice. Boliek admitted that he had fired the first, non-fatal shot, which he claimed was an accident; he contended that the second and fatal shot had been fired by Vernon Wait, another of the participants in the robbery. At petitioner's trial the State produced two witnesses to whom Jody Harless had said, in the days immediately preceding her death, that she was afraid petitioner was going to kill her. In his summation, the prosecutor told the jury, ""Jody Harless, one of her last words was 'Ted Boliek's gonna blow my head off.' And he did it."" Pet. for Cert. 5. 
 The Missouri Supreme Court rejected petitioner's contention that it was reversible error to admit this evidence. State v. Boliek, 706 S.W.2d 847 (Mo.1986). The Court held the evidence admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of the declarant's present mental condition. Id., at 850. One judge dissented from this holding, taking the position that the statements were not admissible because the victim's state of mind was not material to the State's case. Petitioner contends that the admission of this hearsay violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. 
 In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980 ), this Court held that the statement of an unavailable declarant ""is admissible only if it bears adequate 'indicia of reliability.' Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness."" Id., at 66. The State contends that the challenged evidence met this standard because the statements were admitted under a recognized hearsay exception. Missouri has not codified its law of evidence, and while it has been said that ""[u] nder Missouri law the declarations of a decedent in a homicide case are admissible to prove the decedent's state of mind where that is relevant,"" Lenza v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 14, 1986
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 1, 1986. See ___U.S.___. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was sentenced to death by a jury whose sentencing determination was biased impermissibly in favor of death. Because I believe that, under this Court's decisions in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420 (1980) and Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862 (1983), the fact that a murder was committed during the course of a robbery cannot serve both as an element of the capital offense and as the factual predicate for two statutory aggravating circumstances, I would grant certiorari in this case. [ Wiley v. Mississippi 479 U.S. 906 (1986) ][906-Continued.] 
 Petitioner William Wiley was convicted of a murder committed during a robbery and was sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed the jury's determination of guilt, but remanded for resentencing due to the prosecutor's improper references to appellate review. Wiley v. State, 449 So.2d 756 (Miss.1984). At the second sentencing proceeding, petitioner once again received a sentence of death. The jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances and insufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, with three justices concurring in the judgment. Wiley v. State, 484 So.2d 339 ( Miss.1986). 
 Under Mississippi law, all murder is not capital murder. The death sentence may be imposed only where the murder falls into one of seven narrowly defined classes. Miss. Code Ann. 97-3-19(2)(a)-(g) (Supp.1985 ). Petitioner was convicted under a section of the statute that classifies murder committed by a person engaged in a robbery as capital murder. Miss. Code Ann. 97-3-19(2)(e) (Supp.1985). Once the jury found him guilty of the capital offense, it then had to find at least one aggravating circumstance, in order to impose the death penalty. See Miss. Code Ann. 99-19-101(5)(a)-(h) (Supp.1985) (listing aggravating circumstances). In this case, the jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances: ""[t]he capital offense was committed while the defendant was engaged . . . in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, any robbery,"" ""[t]he capital offense was committed for pecuniary gain,"" and ""[ t]he capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel."" Miss. Code Ann. 99-19-101(5)(d), (e) and (h) (Supp.1985). Two of these circumstances-that the offense was committed while petitioner was engaged in a robbery, and that it was committed for pe- 
Page 479 U.S. 906 , 907
 cuniary gain-would automatically be present in any killing that took place during a robbery. 
 Under Mississippi's sentencing scheme, as applied in this case, all persons convicted of robbery-murder enter the sentencing phase with two built-in aggravating circumstances, creating a strong presumption in favor of death. In cases where no mitigating or additional aggravating evidence is introduced, these aggravating circumstances have not narrowed the class of death-eligible persons at all. See Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 337, 3008 (1976) (plurality opinion) ( mandatory death sentences even for narrowly defined category of murders held unconstitutional). I believe that the use of aggravating factors which repeat an element of the underlying capital offense creates a substantial risk that death will be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.

 This is an application for a stay of the mandate of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit pending the filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari. The case involves the legal contest between two candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Alabama.* One of the applicants received a majority of the votes cast in a runoff election held on June 24, 1986. A three-judge court found that the applicant had encouraged widespread violations of a state party rule against crossover voting in the runoff, a rule that apparently has the force of state law.

 tion, concluded that the applicant's opponent received a majority of the votes legally cast, and certified the applicant's opponent as the Democratic nominee. The issue, generally stated, is whether the actions of the State Democratic Executive Committee exceeded the bounds of due process. Following state-court litigation, the applicants filed this 42 U. S.C. 1983 action in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The District Court found a constitutional violation and ordered a new election. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. 802 F.2d 1302 (1986). The court found no violation of federal law. 
 This Court rarely grants a stay of mandate pending disposition of the petition for certiorari unless three conditions are met. First, there must be a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari. Second, there must be a significant possibility that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous. Finally, there must be a likelihood that irreparable harm will result if the decision below is not stayed. White v. Florida, 458 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1982) ( POWELL, J., in chambers). This case presents unique facts closely tied to Alabama election law and rules. The applicants concede that this case is unlikely to recur. There is no conflict among the Circuits. It is no doubt true that, absent the runoff election ordered by the District Court, the applicant here will suffer irreparable injury. This fact alone is not sufficient to justify a stay in the unique circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the application is denied.

 Anthony GRANDISONv. MARYLANDNo. 85-7165 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 6, 1986
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 1, 1986. See ___U.S.___. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner Anthony Grandison was sentenced to death by an improperly instructed jury and did not have the benefit of representation at his sentencing hearing. Because I believe that the jury's instructions under the Maryland statute improperly shifted to petitioner the burden of disproving the appropriateness of his death sentence, and that the denial of a request for legal representation in the sentencing phase of a bifurcated capital proceeding constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, I dissent. 
 I  
 Petitioner was tried for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, for hiring someone to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in his trial on federal drug charges. The jury found petitioner guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death. Petitioner claims that the Maryland capital sentencing statute and the verdict sheet provided to the jury improperly imposed upon 
Page 479 U.S. 873 , 874
 him the burden of proof at the sentencing phase. I continue to believe that this issue is worthy of review. See Huffington v. Maryland, --- U.S . ___ (1986) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Stebbing v. Maryland, 469 U.S. 900 (1984) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). 
 The State argues that petitioner's claim is foreclosed by a state court construction of the statute holding that the prosecution bears the burden of persuasion. See Foster v. State, 304 Md. 439, 476-480, 499 A.2d 1236, 1256-1257 (1985). In this case, however, the jury was provided with a verdict sheet that unambiguously directed the jurors to return a sentence of death unless mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances. The Maryland Court of Appeals may construe the statute to avoid any constitutional difficulty. But the trial court's instructions and the verdict form submitted to the jury must reflect that construction. Here, the verdict form did not; the constitutional infirmity therefore remains undiminished. 
 II  
 At his arraignment, petitioner asserted the right to represent himself under Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806d 562 (1975). Petitioner was informed of his right to counsel, the dangers of self-representation, and the advantages of having counsel to assist at trial and sentencing. Petitioner nonetheless chose to proceed pro se. He was granted the right to have ""standby"" counsel, but conducted his own defense. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. 
 At the first scheduled sentencing proceeding, petitioner asked the court to appoint the lawyer who had served as standby counsel to represent him in the sentencing proceeding. He also sought a continuance, since neither he nor his counsel was prepared to go forward. The court refused to terminate petitioner's self-representation, stating:

 Anthony GRANDISONv. MARYLANDNo. 85-7165 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 6, 1986
 Rehearing Denied Dec. 1, 1986. See ___U.S.___. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner Anthony Grandison was sentenced to death by an improperly instructed jury and did not have the benefit of representation at his sentencing hearing. Because I believe that the jury's instructions under the Maryland statute improperly shifted to petitioner the burden of disproving the appropriateness of his death sentence, and that the denial of a request for legal representation in the sentencing phase of a bifurcated capital proceeding constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, I dissent. 
 I  
 Petitioner was tried for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, for hiring someone to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in his trial on federal drug charges. The jury found petitioner guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death. Petitioner claims that the Maryland capital sentencing statute and the verdict sheet provided to the jury improperly imposed upon 
Page 479 U.S. 873 , 874
 him the burden of proof at the sentencing phase. I continue to believe that this issue is worthy of review. See Huffington v. Maryland, --- U.S . ___ (1986) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Stebbing v. Maryland, 469 U.S. 900 (1984) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). 
 The State argues that petitioner's claim is foreclosed by a state court construction of the statute holding that the prosecution bears the burden of persuasion. See Foster v. State, 304 Md. 439, 476-480, 499 A.2d 1236, 1256-1257 (1985). In this case, however, the jury was provided with a verdict sheet that unambiguously directed the jurors to return a sentence of death unless mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances. The Maryland Court of Appeals may construe the statute to avoid any constitutional difficulty. But the trial court's instructions and the verdict form submitted to the jury must reflect that construction. Here, the verdict form did not; the constitutional infirmity therefore remains undiminished. 
 II  
 At his arraignment, petitioner asserted the right to represent himself under Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806d 562 (1975). Petitioner was informed of his right to counsel, the dangers of self-representation, and the advantages of having counsel to assist at trial and sentencing. Petitioner nonetheless chose to proceed pro se. He was granted the right to have ""standby"" counsel, but conducted his own defense. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. 
 At the first scheduled sentencing proceeding, petitioner asked the court to appoint the lawyer who had served as standby counsel to represent him in the sentencing proceeding. He also sought a continuance, since neither he nor his counsel was prepared to go forward. The court refused to terminate petitioner's self-representation, stating: 
 ""Once the decision is made regarding self-representation, if it is properly made prior to trial, the request to change rests solely within the discretion of the trial court. The right must be timely asserted. It must be asserted before the trial starts. Of course, this is not timely asserted. Whether we continue with it or not, what I am inclined to do about self-representation is leave it just like it is, and let [standby counsel] take over and handle the proceeding as standby counsel [479 U.S. 873 , 875]

 Roy Allen STEWARTv. Louie L. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, et alNo. A-252 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 3, 1986
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to JUSTICE POWELL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL dissenting: 
 Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231, 2950, 2973 (1976), we would grant the application for stay in order to give applicant time to file a petition for writ of certiorari, and would grant the petition and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting from the denial of the application for stay of execution. 
 Roy Allen Stewart was convicted of first-degree murder in Dade County circuit court and sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Stewart v. State, 420 So.2d 862 (Fla.1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1103 (1983). The governor signed Stewart's death warrant. Stewart filed a petition for post-conviction relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The court stayed the execution, held an evidentiary hearing, and denied the petition. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed. Stewart v. State, 481 So.2d 1210 (Fla. 1985). 
 The governor signed a second death warrant scheduling the execution for 7:00 A.M. on October 7, 1986. Stewart then filed a post-trial motion and application for stay of execution in the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the State's administration of the death penalty violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend- 
Page 478 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 ments because capital punishment is imposed disproportionately on prisoners whose victims were members of the white race. This question is similar to those presented in McCleskey v. Kemp, No. 84-6811, and Hitchcock v. Wainwright, No. 85-6756, cases that are to be argued before this Court on October 15, 1986. The Florida Supreme Court denied Stewart's motion and application for stay, ruling that ""Stewart did not raise this claim in his previous 3.850 motion, and he is procedurally barred from raising it in this petition."" Stewart v. Wainwright, 494 So. 2d 489, 490 (Fla., 1986). Stewart then filed a second motion for post- conviction relief and application for stay in circuit court, raising the McCleskey/Hitchcock claim. The circuit court denied the petition and stay application. State v. Stewart, No. 79-6621, slip op. at 2 (Sept. 26, 1986 ). The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's finding of a procedural bar, reasoning that Stewart had shown no justification for his failure to raise the McCleskey/Hitchcock claim in his first motion for post-conviction relief. Stewart v. State, 495 So.2d 164, 165 (1986). 
 On October 1, 1986, Stewart filed an application for stay of execution pending filing of a petition for certiorari with this Court. A majority of this Court today denies that application. Because this denial may rest, in part, on an incomplete application of the doctrine of procedural default, as recently set forth in Smith v. Murray, --- U.S . ___ (1986), I respectfully dissent. 
 Smith requires that, before refusing to consider a state prisoner's constitutional challenge to his conviction and sentence on the ground of procedural default, a federal court must answer two separate questions: ( 1) As a matter of state law, is consideration of the claim foreclosed by a valid procedural bar? and (2) As a matter of federal law, notwithstanding the state procedural bar, would rejection of the claim result in a "" fundamental miscarriage of justice?"" Id. at 2668. 
 In Smith, a state prisoner failed to raise, on direct appeal of his conviction and sentence to the Virginia Supreme Court, his constitutional challenge to the prosecution's use of the testimony of a psychiatrist, to whom the prisoner had related information about a prior incident of deviant sexual conduct on a school bus. This Court, reviewing the denial of Smith's petition for federal habeas corpus relief, held that the prisoner had failed to demonstrate cause for his noncompliance with state procedural rules. The Court then proceeded to the second inquiry of whether appli- [478 U.S. 1050 , 1052]

 Supreme Court of the United States

 On applications for stay. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death, presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court, is granted pending the timely filing and disposition by this Court of a petition for writ of certiorari. Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay terminates automatically. In the event the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, this stay shall continue pending issuance of the mandate of this Court. 

 Justice POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring. 
 Allen Davis and Kenneth Hardwick were scheduled to be executed on September 23, 1986. On the morning of September 22, Davis and Hardwick filed habeas corpus petitions in the Florida Supreme Court, that has original jurisdiction to issue extraordinary writs under Fla.Rule App.Proc. 9.030(a)(3). The Florida Court denied both applications by order, stating in each case that it would ""file an opinion at a later date setting forth its reasons for the denial of this Petition."" At 10:25 p.m. on that day, less than nine hours before the scheduled executions, Davis and Hardwick filed applications with me, as Circuit Justice, seeking stays of execution until this Court can consider their petitions for writs of certiorari to review the Florida decisions. The sole basis for their request is a claim that in Florida capital punishment 
Page 478 U.S. 1044 , 1045
 is applied discriminatorily on the basis of the race of the victim. I granted a temporary stay until September 23 at 3 p.m. and referred the applications to the full Court. 
 I  
 The State asks us to deny the applications, claiming that Davis and Hardwick were barred by state law from raising their claims in the Florida Supreme Court. The State asserts that Davis's claim was barred because he did not raise it on direct appeal from his conviction. See Stone v. State, 481 So.2d 478, 479 (Fla.1985). The State also asserts that Hardwick's claim was filed in the wrong forum. See Ford v. Wainwright, 451 So.2d 471 ( Fla.1984) (a claim may not be raised for the first time in original habeas proceedings in the Florida Supreme Court). According to the State, Hardwick's claim should have been filed in a Florida trial court under Fla. Rule Crim.Proc. 3.850. Davis and Hardwick ask us to ignore these procedural questions. 
 We note that Davis filed a habeas petition last night, September 22, in the federal district court for the Middle District of Florida (Black, J .). This morning, that Court denied the petition and refused to grant a certificate of probable cause. Judge Black concluded that Davis had abused the writ by ""intentionally delaying the raising of grounds for relief."" 1 
 Despite this record of unexplained delay, I concur in the Court's decision to grant these applications. They now raise claims similar to the issue presented in Hitchcock v. Wainwright, 476 U.S. ___ (1986) (writ of certiorari granted), to be argued here on October 15, 1986. No Florida court has specifically addressed the State's contentions that the claims are procedurally barred. The Florida Supreme Court decisions may rest on those grounds, but that Court has not published an opinion. In the past I have found procedural bars apparent on the face of a stay application. See Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.S. 377, 378 (1984) (POWELL, J., concurring). I am reluctant to do so here, however, because the alleged bars depend on an interpretation of state law. In these applications, I am unwilling to assume that the Florida Supreme [478 U.S. 1044 , 1046]

 John William ROOKv. Nathan A. RICE, WardenNo. A-211 (86-5500) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 September 18, 1986
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to THE CHIEF JUSTICE and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting from denial of application for stay of execution. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant the stay application and the petition for certiorari and would vacate the sentence in this case. 
 II  
 But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the stay of execution in this case and vote to hold the petition for certiorari pending this Court's disposition of McCleskey v. Kemp, No. 84-6811, and Hitchcock v. Wainwright, No. 85-6756. Rook contends that newly available social science evidence demonstrates unconstitutional, system-wide racial disparities in North Carolina's capital sentencing system. He maintains that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a hearing on his claim. These questions are similar to those presented in McCleskey and Hitchcock, cases that will be argued in October of the 1986 term, and other petitions that are before the Court and upon which the Court has not yet acted. 
 Other petitioners have presented similar claims of system-wide racial disparities in capital sentencing and have requested stays of execution from this Court in light of our grants of certiorari in McCleskey and Hitchcock. This Court has granted stays of 
Page 478 U.S. 1040 , 1041
 execution in Berry v. Phelps, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Wingo v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Watson v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Glass v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Moore v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Brogdon v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986), and most recently, Rault v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ (1986). 
 In this case, the district court and the Fourth Circuit have refused to grant a stay of execution on the ground that Rook's petition for habeas corpus relief is successive and therefore barred pursuant to Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. foll. 2254. Rook concedes that his arguments regarding the unconstitutional application of the death penalty in North Carolina were presented in his previous federal petition; he maintains, however, that his petition should be heard pursuant to the ""ends of justice"" exception recognized by this Court in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 (1963). He contends that a new study, Arbitrariness of the Capital Death Penalty, authored by Professors Nakell and Hardy of the University of North Carolina does not suffer from the inadequacies which the district court found in the evidence submitted in support of his first petition. Moreover, the study was not available at the time Rook filed his initial petition for habeas relief. He further argues that the new study provides substantial support for his theory that the administration of the death penalty in North Carolina suffers from a systemic unconstitutional flaw. 
 The Fourth Circuit held that Rook had not made the necessary showing that he did not receive a ""full and fair"" hearing on the question and found that the new evidence did not ""bear on the constitutionality of the applicant's detention."" See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct.745 (1963). This Court evidently agrees that the petition is successive, and I therefore dissent.

 John William ROOKv. Nathan A. RICE, WardenNo. A-211 (86-5500) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 September 18, 1986
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to THE CHIEF JUSTICE and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting from denial of application for stay of execution. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant the stay application and the petition for certiorari and would vacate the sentence in this case. 
 II  
 But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the stay of execution in this case and vote to hold the petition for certiorari pending this Court's disposition of McCleskey v. Kemp, No. 84-6811, and Hitchcock v. Wainwright, No. 85-6756. Rook contends that newly available social science evidence demonstrates unconstitutional, system-wide racial disparities in North Carolina's capital sentencing system. He maintains that the evidence is sufficient to warrant a hearing on his claim. These questions are similar to those presented in McCleskey and Hitchcock, cases that will be argued in October of the 1986 term, and other petitions that are before the Court and upon which the Court has not yet acted. 
 Other petitioners have presented similar claims of system-wide racial disparities in capital sentencing and have requested stays of execution from this Court in light of our grants of certiorari in McCleskey and Hitchcock. This Court has granted stays of 
Page 478 U.S. 1040 , 1041
 execution in Berry v. Phelps, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Wingo v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Watson v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Glass v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Moore v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986); Brogdon v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ ( 1986), and most recently, Rault v. Blackburn, ___ U.S. ___ (1986). 
 In this case, the district court and the Fourth Circuit have refused to grant a stay of execution on the ground that Rook's petition for habeas corpus relief is successive and therefore barred pursuant to Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b), 28 U.S.C. foll. 2254. Rook concedes that his arguments regarding the unconstitutional application of the death penalty in North Carolina were presented in his previous federal petition; he maintains, however, that his petition should be heard pursuant to the ""ends of justice"" exception recognized by this Court in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 (1963). He contends that a new study, Arbitrariness of the Capital Death Penalty, authored by Professors Nakell and Hardy of the University of North Carolina does not suffer from the inadequacies which the district court found in the evidence submitted in support of his first petition. Moreover, the study was not available at the time Rook filed his initial petition for habeas relief. He further argues that the new study provides substantial support for his theory that the administration of the death penalty in North Carolina suffers from a systemic unconstitutional flaw. 
 The Fourth Circuit held that Rook had not made the necessary showing that he did not receive a ""full and fair"" hearing on the question and found that the new evidence did not ""bear on the constitutionality of the applicant's detention."" See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct.745 (1963). This Court evidently agrees that the petition is successive, and I therefore dissent. 
 Initially, I note that Rule 9(b) is phrased in permissive, and not mandatory terms: 
 A second or successive petition may be dismissed if the judge finds that it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits or, if new and different grounds are alleged, the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constituted an abuse of the writ.

No. A-195
Decided September 17, 1986
478 U.S. 1306

Syllabus 
An application to stay the District Court's order (and the Court of Appeals' mandate) requiring that applicant report for custody pursuant to the District Court's earlier order finding him in contempt for refusing to testify at a deposition hearing in connection with denaturalization proceedings in another District Court against a third person -- applicant having refused to testify despite a grant of immunity and an order sealing his deposition -- is granted.  Applicant contended that his testimony would tend to prove that he cooperated with the Nazi Government, committed war crimes, and engaged in treasonous activity against the Soviet Union during World War II; that his testimony could be used by the Soviet Union in a criminal proceeding against him if he were denaturalized and deported there and his testimony came to the Soviet Government's attention; and that, because the grant of immunity and the sealing order did not adequately protect against the use of his testimony in a foreign criminal prosecution, he had a Fifth Amendment privilege against testifying.  The question raised by this application, concerning the adequacy of the sealing order is sufficiently similar to the question identified in Araneta v. United States, ante, p. 1301 (BURGER, C.J., in chambers), to make it appropriate for the full Court to consider this application at the same time it decides whether or not to grant certiorari in Araneta.

An application by a daughter and son-in-law of former President Marcos of the Philippines to stay the District Court's contempt order, requiring their incarceration if they failed to testify on July 22, 1986, before a federal grand jury investigating alleged corruption relating to arms contracts made with the Philippine Government, is granted, conditioned upon applicants' filing a petition for certiorari by August 5, 1986.  Applicants contended that requiring them to testify would violate their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because their testimony might be used against them in related criminal proceedings currently pending in the Philippines.  The District Court granted the United States' motion to give applicants use and derivative use immunity as to criminal prosecutions in the United States, and also entered a restrictive order to protect the secrecy of their testimony, holding that the constitutional question was not presented because they had not demonstrated a real and substantial danger of prosecution abroad.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on different grounds, finding that applicants faced a substantial possibility of prosecution in the Philippines; that the District Court's restrictive order was insufficient to protect against disclosures to the Philippine Government; that therefore the constitutional question was presented; and that the Fifth Amendment privilege was not violated simply because compelled testimony might be used in a foreign prosecution.  The application for a stay is granted because (1) there is a reasonable probability that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari to consider the issue whether the Fifth Amendment privilege protects a witness from being compelled to give testimony that may later be used against him in a foreign prosecution; (2) there is a fair prospect that a majority of the Justices will decide the issue in applicants' favor; and (3) a balancing of the equities weighs in applicants' favor.

No. 84-1667
Argued March 3, 1986
Decided July 7, 1986
478 U.S. 675

Syllabus 
Respondent public high school student (hereafter respondent) delivered a speech nominating a fellow student for a student elective office at a voluntary assembly that was held during school hours as part of a school-sponsored educational program in self-government, and that was attended by approximately 600 students, many of whom were 14-year-olds.  During the entire speech, respondent referred to his candidate in terms of an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor.  Some of the students at the assembly hooted and yelled during the speech, some mimicked the sexual activities alluded to in the speech, and others appeared to be bewildered and embarrassed.  Prior to delivering the speech, respondent discussed it with several teachers, two of whom advised him that it was inappropriate and should not be given.  The morning after the assembly, the Assistant Principal called respondent into her office and notified him that the school considered his speech to have been a violation of the school's ""disruptive conduct rule,"" which prohibited conduct that substantially interfered with the educational process, including the use of obscene, profane language or gestures.  Respondent was given copies of teacher reports of his conduct, and was given a chance to explain his conduct.  After he admitted that he deliberately used sexual innuendo in the speech, he was informed that he would be suspended for three days, and that his name would be removed from the list of candidates for graduation speaker at the school's commencement exercises.  Review of the disciplinary action through petitioner School District's grievance procedures resulted in affirmance of the discipline, but respondent was allowed to return to school after serving only two days of his suspension.  Respondent, by his father (also a respondent) as guardian ad litem, then filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech and seeking injunctive relief and damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  The court held that the school's sanctions violated the First Amendment, that the school's disruptive conduct rule was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the removal of respondent's name from the graduation speaker's list violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court awarded respondent monetary relief and enjoined the 
Page 478 U. S. 676
 School District from preventing him from speaking at the commencement ceremonies.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The First Amendment did not prevent the School District from disciplining respondent for giving the offensively lewd and indecent speech at the assembly.  Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, distinguished.  Under the First Amendment, the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point, but it does not follow that the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school.  It is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgar and offensive terms in public discourse.  Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the states from insisting that certain modes of expression are inappropriate and subject to sanctions.  The inculcation of these values is truly the work of the school, and the determination of what manner of speech is inappropriate properly rests with the school board.  First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes an interest in protecting minors from exposure to vulgar and offensive spoken language, FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, as well as limitations on the otherwise absolute interest of the speaker in reaching an unlimited audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may include children.  Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629.  Petitioner School District acted entirely within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions upon respondent in response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech, which had no claim to First Amendment protection.  Pp.  478 U. S. 680-686.
2. There is no merit to respondent's contention that the circumstances of his suspension violated due process because he had no way of knowing that the delivery of the speech would subject him to disciplinary sanctions.  Given the school's need to be able to impose disciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, the school disciplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code which imposes criminal sanctions.  The school disciplinary rule proscribing ""obscene"" language and the prespeech admonitions of teachers gave adequate warning to respondent that his lewd speech could subject him to sanctions.  P.  478 U. S. 686.

Syllabus 
A New York statute authorizes closure of a building found to be a public health nuisance because it was being used as a place for prostitution and lewdness.  After a county Deputy Sheriff's undercover investigation of respondents' ""adult"" bookstore disclosed that illicit sexual activities, including solicitation of prostitution, occurred on the premises, a civil complaint was filed against respondents seeking closure of the premises under the statute.  Respondents answered by alleging, inter alia, that a closure would impermissibly interfere with their First Amendment right to sell books on the premises, and that the closure statute was not intended to apply to establishments other than houses of prostitution.  The New York trial court denied respondents' motion for a summary judgment, holding that the statute applied to respondents.  The Appellate Division affirmed.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed on First Amendment grounds.  Applying the test of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, for determining the validity of a statute regulating conduct that has an expressive element, the court held that the closure statute failed the part of the O'Brien test that requires the statute to be no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose, because the closure order was much broader than necessary to achieve the restriction against illicit sexual activities and because an injunction against continuing those activities could achieve the same effect without restricting respondents' bookselling activities.
Held:  The First Amendment does not bar enforcement of the closure statute against respondents' bookstore.  United States v. O'Brien, supra, has no relevance to a statute directed at imposing sanctions on nonexpressive activity, and the sexual activities carried on in this case manifest absolutely no element of protected expression.  The closure statute is directed at unlawful conduct having nothing to do with books or other expressive activity.  Bookselling on premises used for prostitution does not confer First Amendment coverage to defeat a statute aimed at penalizing and terminating illegal uses of premises.  Pp.  478 U. S. 702-707.

Syllabus 
In order to eliminate the federal budget deficit, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Act), popularly known as the ""Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,"" which sets a maximum deficit amount for federal spending for each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1991 (progressively reducing the deficit amount to zero in 1991).  If in any fiscal year the budget deficit exceeds the prescribed maximum by more than a specified sum, the Act requires basically across-the-board cuts in federal spending to reach the targeted deficit level.  These reductions are accomplished under the ""reporting provisions"" spelled out in  251 of the Act, which requires the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to submit their deficit estimates and program-by-program budget reduction calculations to the Comptroller General, who, after reviewing the Directors' joint report, then reports his conclusions to the President.  The President in turn must issue a ""sequestration"" order mandating the spending reductions specified by the Comptroller General, and the sequestration order becomes effective unless, within a specified time, Congress legislates reductions to obviate the need for the sequestration order.  The Act also contains in  274(f) a ""fallback"" deficit reduction process (eliminating the Comptroller General's participation) to take effect if  251's reporting provisions are invalidated.  In consolidated actions in the Federal District Court, individual Congressmen and the National Treasury Employees Union (Union) (who, along with one of the Union's members, are appellees here) challenged the Act's constitutionality.  The court held, inter alia, that the Comptroller General's role in exercising executive functions under the Act's deficit reduction process violated the constitutionally imposed doctrine of separation of powers because the Comptroller General is removable only by a congressional 
Page 478 U. S. 715
 joint resolution or by impeachment, and Congress may not retain the power of removal over an officer performing executive powers.
Held:
1. The fact that members of the Union, one of whom is an appellee here, will sustain injury because the Act suspends certain scheduled cost-of-living benefit increases to the members, is sufficient to create standing under a provision of the Act and Article III to challenge the Act's constitutionality.  Therefore, the standing issue as to the Union itself or Members of Congress need not be considered.  P.  478 U. S. 721.
2. The powers vested in the Comptroller General under  251 violate the Constitution's command that Congress play no direct role in the execution of the laws.  Pp.  478 U. S. 721-734.
(a) Under the constitutional principle of separation of powers, Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment.  To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control of the execution of the laws.  The structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Congress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it does not possess.  Cf. INS v Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.  Pp.  478 U. S. 721-727.
(b) There is no merit to the contention that the Comptroller General performs his duties independently and is not subservient to Congress.  Although nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Comptroller General is removable only at the initiative of Congress.  Under controlling statutes, he may be removed not only by impeachment but also by joint resolution of Congress ""at any time"" for specified causes, including ""inefficiency,"" ""neglect of duty,"" and ""malfeasance.""  The quoted terms, as interpreted by Congress, could sustain removal of a Comptroller General for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will.  Moreover, the political realities do not reveal that the Comptroller General is free from Congress' influence.  He heads the General Accounting Office, which, under pertinent statutes, is ""an instrumentality of the United States Government independent of the executive departments,"" and Congress has consistently viewed the Comptroller General as an officer of the Legislative Branch.  Over the years, the Comptrollers General have also viewed themselves as part of the Legislative Branch.  Thus, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.  Pp.  478 U. S. 727-732.
(c) Under  251 of the Act, the Comptroller General has been improperly assigned executive powers.  Although he is to have ""due regard"" for the estimates and reductions contained in the joint report of 
Page 478 U. S. 716
 the Directors of the CBO and the OMB, the Act clearly contemplates that, in preparing his report, the Comptroller General will exercise his independent judgment and evaluation with respect to those estimates, and will make decisions of the kind that are made by officers charged with executing a statute.  The Act's provisions give him, not the President, the ultimate authority in determining what budget cuts are to be made.  By placing the responsibility for execution of the Act in the hands of an officer who is subject to removal only by itself, Congress, in effect, has retained control over the Act's execution, and has unconstitutionally intruded into the executive function.  Pp.  478 U. S. 732-734.
3. It is not necessary to consider whether the appropriate remedy is to nullify the 1921 statutory provisions that authorize Congress to remove the Comptroller General, rather than to invalidate  251 of the Act.  In  274(f), Congress has explicitly provided ""fallback"" provisions that take effect if any of the reporting procedures described in  251 are invalidated.  Assuming that the question of the appropriate remedy must be resolved on the basis of congressional intent, the intent appears to have been for  274(f) to be given effect as written.  Pp.  478 U.

No. 85-1377
Argued April 23, 1986
Decided July 7, 1986*
478 U.S. 714

Syllabus 
In order to eliminate the federal budget deficit, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Act), popularly known as the ""Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,"" which sets a maximum deficit amount for federal spending for each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1991 (progressively reducing the deficit amount to zero in 1991).  If in any fiscal year the budget deficit exceeds the prescribed maximum by more than a specified sum, the Act requires basically across-the-board cuts in federal spending to reach the targeted deficit level.  These reductions are accomplished under the ""reporting provisions"" spelled out in  251 of the Act, which requires the Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to submit their deficit estimates and program-by-program budget reduction calculations to the Comptroller General, who, after reviewing the Directors' joint report, then reports his conclusions to the President.  The President in turn must issue a ""sequestration"" order mandating the spending reductions specified by the Comptroller General, and the sequestration order becomes effective unless, within a specified time, Congress legislates reductions to obviate the need for the sequestration order.  The Act also contains in  274(f) a ""fallback"" deficit reduction process (eliminating the Comptroller General's participation) to take effect if  251's reporting provisions are invalidated.  In consolidated actions in the Federal District Court, individual Congressmen and the National Treasury Employees Union (Union) (who, along with one of the Union's members, are appellees here) challenged the Act's constitutionality.  The court held, inter alia, that the Comptroller General's role in exercising executive functions under the Act's deficit reduction process violated the constitutionally imposed doctrine of separation of powers because the Comptroller General is removable only by a congressional 
Page 478 U. S. 715
 joint resolution or by impeachment, and Congress may not retain the power of removal over an officer performing executive powers.
Held:
1. The fact that members of the Union, one of whom is an appellee here, will sustain injury because the Act suspends certain scheduled cost-of-living benefit increases to the members, is sufficient to create standing under a provision of the Act and Article III to challenge the Act's constitutionality.  Therefore, the standing issue as to the Union itself or Members of Congress need not be considered.  P.  478 U. S. 721.
2. The powers vested in the Comptroller General under  251 violate the Constitution's command that Congress play no direct role in the execution of the laws.  Pp.  478 U. S. 721-734.
(a) Under the constitutional principle of separation of powers, Congress cannot reserve for itself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by impeachment.  To permit the execution of the laws to be vested in an officer answerable only to Congress would, in practical terms, reserve in Congress control of the execution of the laws.  The structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute the laws; it follows that Congress cannot grant to an officer under its control what it does not possess.  Cf. INS v Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.  Pp.  478 U. S. 721-727.
(b) There is no merit to the contention that the Comptroller General performs his duties independently and is not subservient to Congress.  Although nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Comptroller General is removable only at the initiative of Congress.  Under controlling statutes, he may be removed not only by impeachment but also by joint resolution of Congress ""at any time"" for specified causes, including ""inefficiency,"" ""neglect of duty,"" and ""malfeasance.""  The quoted terms, as interpreted by Congress, could sustain removal of a Comptroller General for any number of actual or perceived transgressions of the legislative will.  Moreover, the political realities do not reveal that the Comptroller General is free from Congress' influence.

Thus, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.  Pp.  478 U. S. 727-732.

No. 85-588
Argued April 21, 1986
Decided July 7, 1986
478 U.S. 788

Syllabus 
When petitioner University of Tennessee informed respondent, a black employee, that he would be discharged for inadequate work performance and misconduct on the job, he requested an administrative hearing.  Prior to the commencement of the administrative proceedings, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court against the University and others (also petitioners), alleging that his proposed discharge was racially motivated and seeking relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Reconstruction civil rights statutes.  The court allowed the administrative proceedings to go forward, resulting in a ruling by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) (affirmed by a University Vice President on appeal) that respondent's proposed discharge was not racially motivated.  Instead of seeking state court review of the administrative proceedings, respondent returned to the District Court, which granted summary judgment for petitioners on the ground that the ALJ's ruling was entitled to preclusive effect.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's Title VII claim was governed by Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U. S. 461, which held that final state court judgments are entitled to full faith and credit in Title VII actions, but indicated that unreviewed determinations by state agencies do not preclude trial de novo in federal court on Title VII claims.  As regards respondent's claims under the other civil rights statutes, the court held that 28 U.S.C.  1738, which accords a state court judgment the same full faith and credit in federal courts as it would have in the State's courts, does not require that federal courts be bound by the unreviewed findings of state administrative agencies.  The court also declined to fashion a federal common law of preclusion.
Held:
1. Title 28 U.S.C.  1738 is not applicable to the unreviewed state administrative factfinding at issue here.  However, federal common law rules of preclusion have been frequently fashioned in the absence of a governing statute.  Because  1738 antedates the development of administrative agencies, it does not represent a congressional determination that state administrative agency decisions should not be given preclusive effect.  Pp.  478 U. S. 794-795. 
Page 478 U. S. 789

2. The Court of Appeals correctly held that Congress did not intend unreviewed state administrative proceedings to have preclusive effect on Title VII claims, and thus a federal common law rule of preclusion would not be appropriate.  The analysis in Kremer, supra, and Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U. S. 840, of the language and legislative history of Title VII supports this conclusion.  Pp.  478 U. S. 795-796.
3. However, when a state agency acting in a judicial capacity resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, federal courts in actions under the Reconstruction civil rights statutes must give the agency's factfinding the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts (a matter for resolution on remand here).  In enacting those statutes, Congress did not intend to create an exception to general rules of preclusion, or to foreclose the adaptation of those rules to such subsequent developments as the use of administrative adjudication.  Giving preclusive effect in federal courts to the factfindings of state administrative bodies acting in a judicial capacity serves both the value of enforcing repose, which underlies general principles of collateral estoppel, and the value of federalism.

Syllabus 
Respondent residents of Canada and respondent residents of Scotland filed separate complaints in an Ohio state court against petitioner Ohio corporation, the manufacturer and distributor of the drug Bendectin, alleging that children were born with deformities as a result of their mothers' ingestion of the drug during pregnancy.  Damages were sought on common law theories of negligence, breach of warranty, strict liability, fraud, and gross negligence, and also on the ground that the alleged ""misbranding"" of the drug in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) represented a ""rebuttable presumption"" of negligence and the ""proximate cause"" of the injuries.  Petitioner filed a petition for removal of the actions to Federal District Court, alleging that they were founded, in part, on a claim ""arising under the laws of the United States.""  After removal, the cases were consolidated, and the Federal District Court denied respondents' motion to remand to the state court and granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Noting that the FDCA does not create or imply a private right of action, the court held that the causes of action did not arise under federal law, and therefore were improperly removed to federal court.
Held:  A violation of a federal statute as an element of a state cause of action, when Congress has determined that there should be no private federal cause of action for the violation, does not state a claim ""arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1331.  Thus, here, determining the question of removal jurisdiction by reference to the ""well-pleaded complaint,"" and assuming that there is no federal cause of action for FDCA violations, the cases were improperly removed to the Federal District Court.  The assumed congressional determination to preclude federal private remedies for violations of the FDCA is tantamount to a congressional conclusion that a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently ""substantial"" to confer federal question jurisdiction.  The asserted federal interest in federal review and the novelty of the question whether the FDCA applies to sales in Canada

||"Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor
No. 85-621
Argued April 29, 1986
Decided July 7, 1986*
478 U.S. 833

Syllabus 
Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that any person injured by a commodity broker's violation of the Act or regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may apply to the CFTC for an order directing the offender to pay reparations to the complainant, and may enforce that order in federal district court.  The CFTC promulgated a regulation that allows it in a reparations proceeding to adjudicate counterclaims ""aris[ing] out of the transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences set forth in the complaint.""  Respondents filed separate reparations complaints (later consolidated) with the CFTC against petitioner commodity futures broker (petitioner) and one of its employees, alleging that a debit balance in their accounts with petitioner, resulting from respondents' futures trading losses and expenses being in excess of the funds deposited in the accounts, was the result of petitioner's violations of the CEA.  In the meantime, petitioner filed a diversity action in Federal District Court to recover the debit balance, but, after respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that the reparations proceeding would resolve all rights of the parties, petitioner voluntarily dismissed the action and presented its debit balance claims as counterclaims in the CFTC reparations proceeding.  The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in that proceeding ruled in petitioner's favor on both respondents' claims and petitioner's counterclaims.  Respondents then for the first time challenged the CFTC's statutory authority to adjudicate the counterclaims.  The ALJ rejected the challenge, and the CFTC declined to review the decision, allowing it to become final.  Respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, which upheld the CFTC's decision on respondents' claims in most respects, but ordered dismissal of petitioner's counterclaims on the ground that the CFTC lacked authority to adjudicate common law counterclaims.  The court held that, in light of the constitutional problems posed by the CFTC's adjudication of such counterclaims, the CEA should be construed 
Page 478 U. S. 834
 to authorize the CFTC to adjudicate only counterclaims arising from violations of the CEA or CFTC regulations.
Held:
1. The CEA empowers the CFTC to entertain state law counterclaims in reparations proceedings.   478 U. S.  841-847.
(a) While the Court of Appeals' reading of the CEA permitted it to avoid a potential Article III problem, it did so only by doing violence to the statute, for its distinction between common law counterclaims and counterclaims based on violations of the statute cannot be drawn from the statute's language or history, nor reconciled with the congressional purpose in creating reparations proceedings to promote efficient dispute resolution.  Pp.  478 U. S. 841-842.
(b) Section 8(a)(5) of the CEA, which empowers the CFTC to promulgate such regulations as are reasonably necessary ""to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of [the CEA],"" clearly authorizes a regulation providing for adjudication of common law counterclaims.  To require a bifurcated examination of a single dispute would destroy the efficacy of the reparations remedy.  Pp.  478 U. S. 842-844.
(c) The CFTC's longstanding interpretation of the statute as empowering it to take jurisdiction over counterclaims such as petitioner's is reasonable, is well within the scope of its delegated authority, and accordingly is entitled to considerable weight, especially where Congress has twice amended the CEA since the CFTC issued its counterclaim regulation without overruling it, and indeed has explicitly affirmed the CFTC's authority to dictate the scope of its counterclaim jurisdiction.  Pp.  478 U. S. 844-847.
2. The CFTC's assumption of jurisdiction over common law counterclaims does not violate Article III of the Constitution.  Pp.  478 U. S. 847-858.
(a) As a personal right, Article III's guarantee of an impartial and independent adjudication by the federal judiciary is subject to waiver.  Here, respondents indisputably waived any right they may have had to the full trial of petitioner's counterclaims before an Article III court by expressly demanding that petitioner proceed with its counterclaims in the reparations proceedings, rather than before the District Court.  Even if there were no express waiver, respondents' election to forgo their right to proceed in state or federal court and to seek relief in the CFTC constituted an effective waiver.  Pp.  478 U. S. 847-850.
(b) Nor does the CFTC's common law counterclaim jurisdiction contravene the nonwaivable protections Article III affords separation of powers principles.  Examination of the congressional scheme in light of a number of factors, including the extent to which the ""essential attributes of judicial power"" are reserved to Article III courts, and conversely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the 
Page 478 U. S. 835
 range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts, the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article III, yields the conclusion that the limited jurisdiction the CFTC asserts over state law claims as a necessary incident to the adjudication of federal claims willingly submitted by the parties for initial agency adjudication does not impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.  Pp.  478 U. S. 850-856.
(c) Even assuming that principles of federalism are relevant to Article III analysis, those principles do not require invalidation of the CFTC's counterclaim jurisdiction.  The fact that petitioner's counterclaims are resolved by a federal, rather than a state, tribunal is not objectionable, because federal courts can, without constitutional hazard, decide such counterclaims under their ancillary jurisdiction.  Moreover, respondents have identified no historical support for the argument that Article III embodies a compact among the Framers that all state law claims heard in a federal forum be adjudicated by judges possessing the tenure and salary protections of Article III.  Pp.  478 U. S. 856-858.

Section 14 of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that any person injured by a commodity broker's violation of the Act or regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may apply to the CFTC for an order directing the offender to pay reparations to the complainant, and may enforce that order in federal district court.  The CFTC promulgated a regulation that allows it in a reparations proceeding to adjudicate counterclaims ""aris[ing] out of the transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences set forth in the complaint.""  Respondents filed separate reparations complaints (later consolidated) with the CFTC against petitioner commodity futures broker (petitioner) and one of its employees, alleging that a debit balance in their accounts with petitioner, resulting from respondents' futures trading losses and expenses being in excess of the funds deposited in the accounts, was the result of petitioner's violations of the CEA.  In the meantime, petitioner filed a diversity action in Federal District Court to recover the debit balance, but, after respondents moved to dismiss on the ground that the reparations proceeding would resolve all rights of the parties, petitioner voluntarily dismissed the action and presented its debit balance claims as counterclaims in the CFTC reparations proceeding.  The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in that proceeding ruled in petitioner's favor on both respondents' claims and petitioner's counterclaims.  Respondents then for the first time challenged the CFTC's statutory authority to adjudicate the counterclaims.  The ALJ rejected the challenge, and the CFTC declined to review the decision, allowing it to become final.  Respondents filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, which upheld the CFTC's decision on respondents' claims in most respects, but ordered dismissal of petitioner's counterclaims on the ground that the CFTC lacked authority to adjudicate common law counterclaims.  The court held that, in light of the constitutional problems posed by the CFTC's adjudication of such counterclaims, the CEA should be construed 
Page 478 U. S. 834
 to authorize the CFTC to adjudicate only counterclaims arising from violations of the CEA or CFTC regulations.
Held:
1. The CEA empowers the CFTC to entertain state law counterclaims in reparations proceedings.   478 U. S.  841-847.
(a) While the Court of Appeals' reading of the CEA permitted it to avoid a potential Article III problem, it did so only by doing violence to the statute, for its distinction between common law counterclaims and counterclaims based on violations of the statute cannot be drawn from the statute's language or history, nor reconciled with the congressional purpose in creating reparations proceedings to promote efficient dispute resolution.  Pp.  478 U. S. 841-842.
(b) Section 8(a)(5) of the CEA, which empowers the CFTC to promulgate such regulations as are reasonably necessary ""to effectuate any of the provisions or to accomplish any of the purposes of [the CEA],"" clearly authorizes a regulation providing for adjudication of common law counterclaims.  To require a bifurcated examination of a single dispute would destroy the efficacy of the reparations remedy.  Pp.  478 U. S. 842-844.
(c) The CFTC's longstanding interpretation of the statute as empowering it to take jurisdiction over counterclaims such as petitioner's is reasonable, is well within the scope of its delegated authority, and accordingly is entitled to considerable weight, especially where Congress has twice amended the CEA since the CFTC issued its counterclaim regulation without overruling it, and indeed has explicitly affirmed the CFTC's authority to dictate the scope of its counterclaim jurisdiction.  Pp.  478 U. S. 844-847.
2. The CFTC's assumption of jurisdiction over common law counterclaims does not violate Article III of the Constitution.  Pp.  478 U. S. 847-858.
(a) As a personal right, Article III's guarantee of an impartial and independent adjudication by the federal judiciary is subject to waiver.  Here, respondents indisputably waived any right they may have had to the full trial of petitioner's counterclaims before an Article III court by expressly demanding that petitioner proceed with its counterclaims in the reparations proceedings, rather than before the District Court.  Even if there were no express waiver, respondents' election to forgo their right to proceed in state or federal court and to seek relief in the CFTC constituted an effective waiver.  Pp.  478 U. S. 847-850.
(b) Nor does the CFTC's common law counterclaim jurisdiction contravene the nonwaivable protections Article III affords separation of powers principles.  Examination of the congressional scheme in light of a number of factors, including the extent to which the ""essential attributes of judicial power"" are reserved to Article III courts, and conversely, the extent to which the non-Article III forum exercises the 
Page 478 U. S. 835
 range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in Article III courts, the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated, and the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article III, yields the conclusion that the limited jurisdiction the CFTC asserts over state law claims as a necessary incident to the adjudication of federal claims willingly submitted by the parties for initial agency adjudication does not impermissibly threaten the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.  Pp.  478 U. S. 850-856.
(c) Even assuming that principles of federalism are relevant to Article III analysis, those principles do not require invalidation of the CFTC's counterclaim jurisdiction.  The fact that petitioner's counterclaims are resolved by a federal, rather than a state, tribunal is not objectionable, because federal courts can, without constitutional hazard, decide such counterclaims under their ancillary jurisdiction.  Moreover, respondents have identified no historical support for the argument that Article III embodies a compact among the Framers that all state law claims heard in a federal forum be adjudicated by judges possessing the tenure and salary protections of Article III.  Pp.  478 U. S. 856-858.

 John Norman HUFFINGTON v. MARYLAND.No. 85-6648 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 7, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting in this case and in Evans v. Maryland, 478 U.S. 1010 and Foster v. Maryland, 478 U.S. 1010. 
 Petitioners were sentenced to death pursuant to a procedural scheme that they strenuously contend is unconstitutional. The Maryland Court of Appeals, through a highly creative reading of Maryland law and a heavy dose of procedural technicality, managed to affirm petitioners' sentences without reaching their constitutional claim. I consider such evasion repugnant, and I dissent from the Court's denial of certiorari. 
 The dispute in these cases rests on Md.Ann.Code, Art. 27, 413(h) ( 1957). That section, designed to guide the deliberations of the sentencing jury in capital cases, provides: 
 ""(1) If the court or jury finds that one or more of these mitigating circumstances exist, it shall determine whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances. 
 ""(2) If it finds that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the sentence shall be death. 
Page 478 U.S. 1023 , 1024
 ""(3) If it finds that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the sentence shall be imprisonment for life."" 
 The language of these provisions is clear: death shall be imposed whenever mitigating circumstances do not outweigh aggravating circumstances. It follows that death must be imposed when mitigating and aggravating circumstances are in equipoise. Put another way, death must be imposed unless mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances: the burden of proof on the question of whether mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances is on the defendant. 
 This understanding of the statute is confirmed by Maryland Rule 4-343, a recodification of Md.Rules Proc. 772A (superseded), which prescribes the verdict sheet used in Maryland capital sentencing proceedings. In Section I of that verdict sheet, the jury lists the aggravating circumstances it has found. In Section II, it lists the mitigating circumstances it has found. In Section III, it is instructed to answer ""yes"" or 'no' to the following statement: ""Based on the evidence, we unanimously find that it has been proven by A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE that the mitigating circumstances marked 'yes' in Section II outweigh the aggravating circumstances marked 'yes' in Section I."" The jury is further instructed that if Section III is marked ""no,"" it must enter a sentence of death. This rule, enacted contemporaneously with 413, effectuates the plain language of the statute-the jury must return a sentence of death unless the defendant affirmatively proves that mitigating outweigh aggravating circumstances. 
 Despite the apparent clarity of the statutory language and the verdict sheet, the Maryland Court of Appeals in Tichnell v. State, 287 Md. 695, 730, 415 A.2d 830, 848-849 (1980), appeared to read the statute differently. It stated: 
 ""Section 413 does not explicitly specify which party has the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. . . . [I] f the sentencing authority finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the death penalty must be imposed. 413(h)(2). Because the State is attempting to establish that the imposition of the death penalty is an appropriate sentence, the statute places the risk of nonpersuasion [478 U.S. 1023 , 1025]

v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 84-1656
Argued February 25, 1986
Decided July 2, 1986
478 U.S. 421

Syllabus 
In 1975, the District Court found petitioner union and petitioner apprenticeship committee of the union guilty of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against nonwhite workers in recruitment, selection, training, and admission to the union.  The court ordered petitioners to end their discriminatory practices, established a 29% nonwhite membership goal, based on the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant labor pool in New York City, to be achieved by July 1981, and also ordered petitioners to implement procedures designed to achieve this goal under the supervision of a court-appointed administrator.  Thereafter, the administrator proposed and the court adopted an affirmative action program.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, with modifications.  On remand, the District Court adopted a revised affirmative action program, and extended the time to meet the 29% membership goal.  The Court of Appeals again affirmed.  In 1982 and again in 1983, the District Court found petitioners guilty of civil contempt for disobeying the court's earlier orders.  The court imposed a fine to be placed in a special Employment, Training, Education, and Recruitment Fund (Fund), to be used to increase nonwhite membership in the union and its apprenticeship program.  The District Court ultimately entered an amended affirmative action program establishing a 29.23% nonwhite membership goal to be met by August, 1987.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's contempt findings (with one exception), the contempt remedies, including the Fund order, and the affirmative action program with modifications, holding that the 29.23% nonwhite membership goal was proper, and did not violate Title VII or the Constitution.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
753 F.2d 1172, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that:
1. The District Court did not use incorrect statistical evidence in evaluating petitioners' membership practices.  Pp.  478 U. S. 440-442. 
Page 478 U. S. 422

2. The contempt fines and Fund order were proper remedies for civil contempt.  These sanctions were clearly designed to coerce compliance with the District Court's order, rather than to punish petitioners for their contemptuous conduct, and thus were not criminal contempt citations.  Pp.  478 U. S. 442-444.
3. The District Court properly appointed an administrator to supervise petitioners' compliance with the court's orders.  In light of the difficulties inherent in monitoring such compliance, and especially petitioners' established record of resistance to prior state and federal court orders, appointment of an administrator was well within the District Court's discretion.  While the administrator may interfere with petitioners' membership operations, such ""interference"" is necessary to put an end to petitioners' discriminatory ways.  Pp.  478 U. S. 481-482.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Parts IV, V, and VII that:
1. Section 706(g) of Title VII does not prohibit a court from ordering, in appropriate circumstances, affirmative race-conscious relief, such as the District Court ordered in this case, as a remedy for past discrimination.  Pp.  478 U. S. 444-479.
(a) Section 706(g)'s language plainly expresses Congress' intent to vest district courts with broad discretion to award ""appropriate"" equitable relief to remedy unlawful discrimination.  The last sentence of  706(g), which prohibits a district court from ordering a union to admit an individual who was ""refused admission . . . for any reason other than discrimination"" does not say that a court may order relief only for actual victims of past discrimination.  Rather, the provision addresses only the situation where the plaintiff demonstrates that a union has engaged in unlawful discrimination but the union can show that a particular individual would have been refused admission even in the absence of discrimination.  In this case, neither the membership goal nor the Fund order required petitioners to admit to membership individuals who had been refused admission for reasons unrelated to discrimination.  Pp.  478 U. S. 445-447.
(b) The availability of affirmative race-conscious relief under  706 (g) as a remedy for violations of Title VII furthers the broad purposes underlying the statute.  In some circumstances, such relief may be the only effective means available to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights protected by Title VII.  Pp.  478 U. S. 447-451.
(c) The legislative history does not indicate that Congress intended that affirmative relief under  706(g) benefit only the identified victims of past discrimination.  Opponents of Title VII charged that employers and labor unions would be required to implement racial quotas or preferences to avoid liability under the statute.  Supporters insisted that Title VII did not require ""racial balancing.""  The debate in Congress concerning 
Page 478 U. S. 423
 what Title VII did and did not require culminated in the adoption of  703(j), which expressly states that the statute does not require an employer or a union to adopt quotas or preferences simply because of racial imbalance.  But Congress gave no intimation as to whether such measures would be acceptable as remedies for Title VII violations.  An examination of the legislative policy behind Title VII discloses that Congress did not intend to prohibit a court from ordering affirmative action in appropriate circumstances as a remedy for past discrimination.  This interpretation of the scope of a district court's remedial power under  706(g) is confirmed by the contemporaneous interpretation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Justice Department, the two agencies charged with enforcing Title VII, and is also confirmed by the legislative history of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which amended Title VII by, inter alia, modifying  706(g) to empower district courts to order ""any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.""  Pp.  478 U. S. 452-470.
(d) This Court's prior decisions, such as Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747, and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, held only that a court may order relief designed to make individual victims of racial discrimination whole, and did not suggest that individual ""make-whole"" relief was the only kind of remedy available under the statute.  On the contrary, these cases emphasized that a district court's remedial power should be exercised both to eradicate the effects of unlawful discrimination and to make the victims of past discrimination whole.  Nor can Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U. S. 561, be properly read to prohibit a court from ordering any kind of affirmative race-conscious relief that might benefit nonvictims.  Such a reading would distort  706(g)'s language and would deprive the courts of an important means of enforcing Title VII's guarantee of equal employment opportunity.  Pp.  478 U. S. 470-475.
(e) While  706(g) does not foreclose a district court from instituting some sorts of racial preferences where necessary to remedy past discrimination, such relief is not always proper.  The court should exercise its discretion with an eye toward Congress' concern that affirmative race-conscious measures not be invoked simply to create a racially balanced workforce.  In this case, the relief ordered by the District Court was proper.  Both that court and the Court of Appeals agreed that the membership goal and Fund order were necessary to remedy petitioners' pervasive and egregious discrimination.  The District Court established the membership goal as a means by which it can measure petitioners' compliance with its orders, rather than as a strict racial quota.  Moreover, both the membership goal and the Fund order are temporary 
Page 478 U. S. 424
 measures, and do not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white employees.  Pp.  478 U. S. 475-479.
2. The District Court's orders do not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  They were properly and narrowly tailored to further the Government's compelling interest in remedying past discrimination.  Pp.  478 U. S. 479-481.
JUSTICE POWELL concluded that:
1. The District Court acted within the remedial authority granted by  706(g) in establishing the Fund order and numerical goal at issue.  Neither Title VII's plain language nor the legislative history supports a view that all remedies must be limited to benefiting actual victims of discrimination.  In cases such as this, where there is a history of egregious violations of Title VII, an injunction alone may be insufficient to remedy the violations.  Pp.  478 U. S. 483-484.
2. The Fund order and membership goal do not contravene the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The finding of the courts below that petitioners have committed egregious violations of Title VII clearly establishes a compelling governmental interest sufficient to justify the imposition of a racially classified remedy.  Moreover, the District Court's remedy is narrowly tailored to the goal of eradicating petitioners' discrimination.  The Fund order was carefully structured to vindicate the compelling governmental interests.  As to the percentage goal, it is doubtful, given petitioners' history of discrimination, that any other effective remedy was available.  The goal was not imposed as a permanent requirement, and was directly related to the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant workforce.  Neither the Constitution nor Title VII requires a particular racial balance in the workplace, and, indeed, the Constitution forbids such a requirement if imposed for its own sake.  Here, the flexible application of the goal requirement demonstrates that it is not a means to achieve racial balance.  Moreover, it does not appear from the record that nonminorities will be burdened directly, if at all.  Pp.  478 U. S. 484-489.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and VI, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and in Parts II-A, III, and VI of which O'CONNOR, J., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts IV, V, and VII, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

(d) This Court's prior decisions, such as Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U. S. 747, and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, held only that a court may order relief designed to make individual victims of racial discrimination whole, and did not suggest that individual ""make-whole"" relief was the only kind of remedy available under the statute.  On the contrary, these cases emphasized that a district court's remedial power should be exercised both to eradicate the effects of unlawful discrimination and to make the victims of past discrimination whole.  Nor can Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U. S. 561, be properly read to prohibit a court from ordering any kind of affirmative race-conscious relief that might benefit nonvictims.  Such a reading would distort  706(g)'s language and would deprive the courts of an important means of enforcing Title VII's guarantee of equal employment opportunity.  Pp.  478 U. S. 470-475.
(e) While  706(g) does not foreclose a district court from instituting some sorts of racial preferences where necessary to remedy past discrimination, such relief is not always proper.  The court should exercise its discretion with an eye toward Congress' concern that affirmative race-conscious measures not be invoked simply to create a racially balanced workforce.  In this case, the relief ordered by the District Court was proper.  Both that court and the Court of Appeals agreed that the membership goal and Fund order were necessary to remedy petitioners' pervasive and egregious discrimination.  The District Court established the membership goal as a means by which it can measure petitioners' compliance with its orders, rather than as a strict racial quota.  Moreover, both the membership goal and the Fund order are temporary 
Page 478 U. S. 424
 measures, and do not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white employees.  Pp.  478 U. S. 475-479.
2. The District Court's orders do not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  They were properly and narrowly tailored to further the Government's compelling interest in remedying past discrimination.  Pp.  478 U. S. 479-481.
JUSTICE POWELL concluded that:
1. The District Court acted within the remedial authority granted by  706(g) in establishing the Fund order and numerical goal at issue.  Neither Title VII's plain language nor the legislative history supports a view that all remedies must be limited to benefiting actual victims of discrimination.  In cases such as this, where there is a history of egregious violations of Title VII, an injunction alone may be insufficient to remedy the violations.  Pp.  478 U. S. 483-484.
2. The Fund order and membership goal do not contravene the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The finding of the courts below that petitioners have committed egregious violations of Title VII clearly establishes a compelling governmental interest sufficient to justify the imposition of a racially classified remedy.  Moreover, the District Court's remedy is narrowly tailored to the goal of eradicating petitioners' discrimination.  The Fund order was carefully structured to vindicate the compelling governmental interests.  As to the percentage goal, it is doubtful, given petitioners' history of discrimination, that any other effective remedy was available.  The goal was not imposed as a permanent requirement, and was directly related to the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant workforce.  Neither the Constitution nor Title VII requires a particular racial balance in the workplace, and, indeed, the Constitution forbids such a requirement if imposed for its own sake.  Here, the flexible application of the goal requirement demonstrates that it is not a means to achieve racial balance.  Moreover, it does not appear from the record that nonminorities will be burdened directly, if at all.  Pp.  478 U. S. 484-489.

Decided July 2, 1986
478 U.S. 501

Syllabus 
The Vanguards, an organization of black and Hispanic firefighters employed by respondent city of Cleveland, filed a class action in Federal District Court charging the city and various city officials with discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in hiring, assigning, and promoting firefighters in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Petitioner labor union, which represents a majority of the city's firefighters, was permitted to intervene as a party plaintiff. Over petitioner's objection, the court adopted a consent decree that provided for the use of race-conscious relief and other affirmative action in promoting firefighters.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held.  Section 706(g) of Title VII does not preclude entry of a consent decree, such as was entered in this case, that may benefit individuals who were not the actual victims of the defendant's discriminatory practices; whether or not  706(g) precludes a court from imposing certain forms of race-conscious relief after trial, it does not apply to relief awarded in a consent decree.  Pp.  478 U. S. 515-530.
(a) Congress intended that voluntary compliance be the preferred means of achieving Title VII's objectives.  Voluntary action available to employers and unions seeking to eradicate race discrimination may include reasonable race-conscious relief that benefits individuals who are not actual victims of that discrimination.  Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U. S. 193.  Absent some contrary indication, there is no reason why such voluntary action is rendered impermissible by Title VII simply because it is incorporated into a consent decree.  No such contrary indication is provided by  706(g)'s last sentence, which precludes a district court from entering an order requiring the hiring or promotion of an individual who was refused employment or promotion for any reason other than discrimination.  Whatever the extent of the limits Congress placed in  706(g)'s last sentence on the power of federal courts to impose obligations on employers or unions to remedy violations of Title VII,  706(g) by itself does not restrict the ability of employers or unions to enter into voluntary agreements providing race-conscious relief.  Because the voluntary nature of a consent decree is its most fundamental 
Page 478 U. S. 502
 characteristic, it is apparent that consent decrees are not included among the ""orders"" referred to in  706(g).  The party's agreement, rather than the force of law upon which the complaint was originally based, creates the obligations embodied in a consent decree.  Pp.  478 U. S. 515-524.
(b) A federal court is not necessarily barred from entering a consent decree merely because the decree provides broader relief than the court could have awarded after a trial.  Inasmuch as the limits placed by  706(g) on the remedial authority of a federal court -- whatever these may be -- are not implicated by voluntary agreements, there is no conflict with or violation of  706(g) when a federal court enters a consent decree that provides such relief.  Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U. S. 561, and Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, distinguished.  Pp.  478 U. S. 524-528.
(c) The fact that the consent decree in this case was entered without petitioner's consent does not affect its validity.  While an intervenor is entitled to present evidence and have its objections heard at the hearings on whether to approve a consent decree, it does not have power to block the decree merely by withholding its consent.  The consent decree here does not bind petitioner to do or not do anything.  It imposes no legal duties or obligations on petitioner, and does not purport to resolve any other claims petitioner might have under the Fourteenth Amendment,  703 of Title VII, or as a matter of contract.  Whether it is too late to raise such claims, or, if not, whether the claims have any merit, are questions that must be presented in the first instance to the District Court, which has retained jurisdiction to hear such challenges.

No. 85-5
Argued March 3, 1986
Decided July 2, 1986
478 U.S. 546

Syllabus 
Section 304(d) of the Clean Air Act provides that, ""in any action"" to enforce the Act, the court
""may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.""
In 1977, respondent Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air (hereafter respondent) and the United States each filed suit in Federal District Court to compel Pennsylvania to implement a vehicle emission inspection and maintenance program (I/M program) as required by the Act.  Pursuant to a consent decree approved in 1978, the State agreed to establish an I/M program for certain counties.  The decree required the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to seek legislation instituting a franchise I/M program, but, if such legislation was not approved, to promulgate regulations allowing the State to certify private garage facilities to perform the inspections.  Implementation of the I/M program, however, did not proceed smoothly.  The factual developments following entry of the consent decree divided into several phases, including Phase II in which respondent, after PennDOT had published proposed regulations, continued to monitor the State's performance under the consent decree and submitted comments on the proposed regulations; Phase V, in which the Pennsylvania Legislature enacted a statute prohibiting the expenditure of state funds for an I/M program, respondent successfully opposed the State's motion to stay the consent decree, the District Court held the State in contempt and ordered the United States Secretary of Transportation to refrain from approving any projects or award grants for highways in the area covered by the consent decree, with certain exceptions, and the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court; and Phase IX that involved work done by respondent in hearings before the Environmental Protection Agency, during which the State unsuccessfully sought that agency's approval of an I/M program covering a smaller geographic area than was called for in the consent decree.  Respondent, pursuant to  304(d), sought attorney's fees and costs for the work performed after issuance of the consent decree.  The District Court awarded respondent attorney's fees that included time spent by counsel in Phases II and IX, holding, over the State's objection, that, because the proposed regulations would 
Page 478 U. S. 547
 have affected respondent's rights under the consent decree, it had a unique interest in the state and federal administrative proceedings that made its counsel's work sufficiently related to the litigation to be compensable.  As to Phase V, the District Court, based on the ""superior quality"" of counsel's performance in that phase, applied a multiplier of two to adjust the lodestar amount (the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate) of attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the fee awards for Phases II, V, and IX.
Held:
1. Section 304(d) authorizes attorney's fees for time spent by counsel in Phases II and IX.  The fact that the work done by counsel in those phases did not occur in the context of traditional judicial litigation does not preclude an award of reasonable attorney's fees under  304(d) for that work.  Participation in the administrative proceedings was crucial to the vindication of respondent's rights under the consent decree, and compensation for these activities was entirely proper and well within the ""zone of discretion"" afforded the District Court.  Pp.  478 U. S. 557-561.
2. The lower courts erred in increasing the attorney's fee award to respondent for Phase V based on the ""superior quality"" of counsel's performance.  Pp.  478 U. S. 561-568.
(a) The lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a ""reasonable"" attorney's fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling plaintiffs to receive legal assistance.  Pp.  478 U. S. 561-566.
(b) Here, the evidence submitted by respondent to support its petition for attorney's fees does not indicate why the lodestar figure did not provide a reasonable fee award reflecting the quality of representation provided during Phase V.  Respondent presented no evidence as to what made the results it obtained during that phase so ""outstanding,"" or why the lodestar figure was far below awards made in similar cases.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals made findings as to why the lodestar amount was unreasonable.  In the absence of such evidence and findings, there was no reason to increase the fee award in Phase V for the quality of representation.  Pp.  478 U. S. 566-568.

No. 84-1974
Argued March 24.1986
Decided July 2, 1986
478 U.S. 570

Syllabus 
Respondent was charged with the murder of two persons arising from the same incident.  At his trial in a Tennessee state court he defended on the ground, inter alia, that he was either insane or incapable of forming the requisite intent to kill the victims.  The court instructed the jury on both first-degree murder, which requires proof of premeditation and deliberation under Tennessee law, and second-degree murder, which requires proof of malice, but not of planning and premeditation.  The court then instructed the jury that ""[a]ll homicides are presumed to be malicious in the absence of evidence which would rebut the implied presumption,"" and that, ""if the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a killing has occurred, then it is presumed that the killing was done maliciously.""  The jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder of one victim and of second-degree murder of the other.  The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting respondent's argument that the malice instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof as to malice.  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which held that the malice instruction was unconstitutional under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, wherein it was held that a jury instruction creating a presumption of malice that has the effect of either eliminating intent as an issue, or of shifting the burden of proof as to intent to the defendant, violates due process.  The District Court then went on to find that the error could not be deemed harmless, because respondent had ""relied upon a mens rea defense.""  The United States Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The harmless error standard of Chapman v. California. 386 U. S. 18, under which a reviewing court should not set aside an otherwise valid conviction if the court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error in question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, applies to the erroneous malice instruction in this case.  Respondent had an opportunity to present evidence and argue in support of his innocence, he was tried by an impartial jury, supervised by an impartial judge, and, aside from the malice instruction, the jury was clearly instructed that it had to find respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of both first- and second-degree murder.  
Page 478 U. S. 571
 In this context, the erroneous malice instruction does not compare with the kinds of errors that automatically require reversal of an otherwise valid conviction.  The error in the instruction of impermissibly shifting the burden of proof on malice was not ""so basic to a fair trial"" that it could never be harmless.  The purpose behind the Sandstrom rule of ensuring that only the guilty are punished supports this conclusion.  Nor is a Sandstrom error equivalent to a directed verdict for the State, since, when a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  478 U. S. 576-582.
2. Although this Court has authority to decide whether, on the facts of a particular case, a constitutional error was harmless under the Chapman standard, it does so sparingly.  Accordingly, since the United States Court of Appeals has not yet applied Chapman to the facts of this case, the case is remanded to that court to determine whether the error in question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  478 U. S. 583-584.

S. 18, under which a reviewing court should not set aside an otherwise valid conviction if the court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error in question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, applies to the erroneous malice instruction in this case.  Respondent had an opportunity to present evidence and argue in support of his innocence, he was tried by an impartial jury, supervised by an impartial judge, and, aside from the malice instruction, the jury was clearly instructed that it had to find respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to every element of both first- and second-degree murder.  
Page 478 U. S. 571
 In this context, the erroneous malice instruction does not compare with the kinds of errors that automatically require reversal of an otherwise valid conviction.  The error in the instruction of impermissibly shifting the burden of proof on malice was not ""so basic to a fair trial"" that it could never be harmless.  The purpose behind the Sandstrom rule of ensuring that only the guilty are punished supports this conclusion.  Nor is a Sandstrom error equivalent to a directed verdict for the State, since, when a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  478 U. S. 576-582.
2. Although this Court has authority to decide whether, on the facts of a particular case, a constitutional error was harmless under the Chapman standard, it does so sparingly.  Accordingly, since the United States Court of Appeals has not yet applied Chapman to the facts of this case, the case is remanded to that court to determine whether the error in question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  478 U. S. 583-584.

Syllabus 
This litigation arose from serious accidents that occurred in the reservoirs of federal flood control projects in Arkansas and Louisiana.  In both accidents, recreational users (water-skiers in Arkansas and a fisherman in Louisiana) of the reservoirs were injured or drowned when they were swept through retaining structures after those structures were opened by the United States Corps of Engineers to control flooding.  Separate actions were brought in Federal District Court against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  In the Arkansas case, the court held that,  although Government agents had willfully and maliciously failed to warn of a known danger, the Government was immune from damages under 33 U.S.C.  702c, which provides in part that ""[n]o liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place.""  In the Louisiana case, the court similarly granted summary judgment for the United States despite the Government's concession that it negligently failed to warn of the danger from the current caused by open gates.  In a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgments, holding that Congress intended  702c to immunize the Government from liability for damage resulting directly from construction of flood control projects and for flooding caused by factors beyond the Government's control, but had not intended to shield the negligent or wrongful acts of Government employees either in the construction or continued operation of flood control projects, including the failure to warn the public of hazards to their use of reservoirs.
Held:  Section 702c bars recovery against the Government in these cases.  Pp.  478 U. S. 604-612.
(a) On its face,  702c's language covers the accidents at issue.  The ordinary meaning of the word ""damage"" covers injury to both property and person, and cannot be considered ambiguous in that it might refer only to damage to property.  Moreover, the language ""any damage"" and ""liability of any kind"" undercuts a narrow construction.  Nor do the words ""flood"" and ""flood waters"" create any uncertainty in the context of these accidents.  Those words apply to all waters contained in or carried through a federal flood control project for purposes of or related to flood 
Page 478 U. S. 598
 control, as well as to waters that such projects cannot control.  The waters here clearly fall within the statute's ambit.  Pp.  478 U. S. 604-605.
(b) The statute's legislative history fully supports attributing to its unambiguous words their ordinary meaning.  Pp.  478 U. S. 606-608.
(c) There is little in the legislative history or otherwise to support the argument that  702c was meant to bar only claims against the Government for damage to property acquired under  702c's proviso (authorizing purchase of interests in certain properties bordering the Mississippi River) and under  702d (authorizing purchase of ""flowage rights""), and thus would allow recovery for damages to persons or property not connected with these acquisitions.  Nor is there any merit to the argument that, even if  702c is intended to grant immunity in connection with flood control projects, the Government is not entitled to immunity here because the injuries arose from Government employees' alleged mismanagement of recreational activities unrelated to flood control.  The manner in which to convey warnings, including the negligent failure to do so, is part of the ""management"" of a flood control project.  Finally, the legislative history does not support construing  702c as immunizing the Government from liability only for property damage directly resulting from construction of flood control projects, but rather indicates Congress' intention to protect the Government from any liability for damages that might arise out of flood control.  Pp.  478 U. S. 608-612.

Syllabus 
A Michigan statute makes an employee ineligible for unemployment compensation if he has provided ""financing,"" by means other than the payment of regular union dues, for a strike that causes his unemployment.  As authorized by their international union, appellant employees of appellee General Motors Corp. (GM) were required to pay, in addition to their regular union dues, ""emergency dues"" to augment the union's strike insurance fund.  Although the union and GM reached an agreement on national issues at a time when negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement were taking place, three local unions went on strike at GM foundries, and strike fund benefits were paid to the striking employees from the fund in which emergency dues had been deposited.  As a result of the strikes, operations were temporarily curtailed at other GM plants, idling more than 19,000 employees, most of whom are appellants in this case.  Appellants' claims for unemployment benefits were ultimately denied by the Michigan Supreme Court on the ground that the emergency dues payments constituted ""financing"" of the strikes that caused appellants' unemployment, thus making appellants ineligible for unemployment compensation under the Michigan statute.  The court further held that its construction of the state statute was not preempted by federal law on the asserted ground that it inhibited the exercise of rights guaranteed by  7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
Held:  The ""financing"" disqualification from receiving unemployment compensation, as construed by the Michigan Supreme Court, is not preempted by federal law.  While, in financing the local strikes, appellants were exercising associational rights protected by  7 of the NLRA, that protection does not deprive the State of the power to make the policy choice that otherwise would be authorized by Title IX of the Social Security Act, which gives the States a wide range of judgment as to the particular type of unemployment compensation program they may provide.  The employers did nothing to impair the exercise of appellants'  7 rights.  Whether or not appellants were participants in the decision to strike, or to expend funds in support of the local strikes, the fact that their unemployment was entirely attributable to the voluntary use of the union's bargaining resources -- untainted by any unlawful conduct by the employer -- is a sufficient reason for allowing the State to decide whether or not to pay unemployment benefits.  Appellants were not laid off simply 
Page 478 U. S. 622
 because they paid emergency dues, but rather became unemployed because there was a meaningful connection between the decision to pay emergency dues, the strikes that ensued, and ultimately their own layoffs.  While federal law protects the employees' right to authorize a strike, it does not prohibit a State from deciding whether or not to compensate employees who thereby cause their own unemployment.  An employee's decision to participate in a strike, either directly or by financing it, is not only an example of causing one's own unemployment, it is one that furthers the federal policy of free collective bargaining regardless of whether or not a State provides compensation for employees who are furloughed as a result of the labor dispute.

Syllabus 
In 1973, petitioners purchased interests in a limited partnership organized by the individual respondent who, together with a corporation (also a respondent) of which he was the president and sole shareholder, was to be a general partner in the venture of building and operating a motel.  Petitioners purchased their interests on the basis of an offering that marketed the project as a ""tax shelter"" through which individual limited partners could claim deductible partnership losses in substantial amounts and offset those losses against other income.  In 1976, petitioners brought a securities fraud suit against respondents in Federal District Court, tendering return of their securities to respondents shortly before trial.  Petitioners asserted claims under both  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and  12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, which provides that an investor harmed by prospectus fraud may sue
""to recover the consideration paid for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.""
After a jury found respondents liable for fraud, the court held, inter alia, that the remedy of rescission was proper under  12(2), and entered judgment for petitioners in the amount of the consideration paid for their limited partnership units, together with prejudgment interest.  The court rejected respondents' contention that petitioners' recovery should be offset by tax benefits received by petitioners as a result of their investments.  The Court of Appeals sustained respondents' liability under  12(2) and  10(b), but reversed and remanded with regard to the rescissory award, holding that it must be reduced by an amount equal to any tax benefits received by petitioners under an ""actual damages"" principle.  After the District Court, on remand, recalculated each petitioner's damages accordingly, both petitioners and respondents appealed, and the Court of Appeals adhered to its original decision with regard to the tax benefit reduction.  For purposes of liability under  10(b), the court relied on  28(a) of the 1934 Act, which provides that a person suing for damages under that Act shall not recover ""a total amount in excess of his actual damages on account of the act complained of.""  As to liability under  12(2) of the 1933 Act, the court concluded that the rescission remedy 
Page 478 U. S. 648
 of that section should be construed as substantially equivalent to the ""actual damages"" permitted under  28(a) of the 1934 Act.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that  28(a) requires a rescissory recovery under  12(2) or  10(b) to be reduced by tax benefits received from a tax shelter investment.  Pp.  478 U. S. 655-667.
(a) Section 12(2) does not authorize an offset of tax benefits received by a defrauded investor against the investor's rescissory recovery either as ""income received"" or as a return of ""consideration,"" and this is so whether or not the security in question is classified as a tax shelter.  The language of  12(2) requiring a reduction for ""income received"" is sufficiently clear to invoke the ""plain language"" canon of statutory interpretation, because tax benefits received by defrauded investors by virtue of their ownership of the security cannot, under any reasonable definition, be termed ""income.""  Section 12(2)'s legislative history does not establish that Congress intended tax benefits to be treated as ""income received.""  Nor is there merit to the contention that the nature of the equitable remedy of rescission compels petitioners' tax benefits to be offset as a direct product of the security at common law.  Moreover, the word ""consideration"" in  12(2) means what the context would suggest the money or property given by the investor in exchange for the security.  Pp.  478 U. S. 655-660.
(b) Section 28(a) of the 1934 Act does not alter the conclusion that  12(2) of the 1933 Act does not authorize a tax benefit offset.  Nor does  28(a) require such an offset when a rescissory measure of damages is applied to a plaintiff's  10(b) claim.  To read  28(a) as mandating a limit on the rescission remedy created in the earlier enacted  12(2) would be to effect a disfavored partial repeal of  12(2) by implication.  Assuming, arguendo, that rescissory recovery may sometimes be proper on a  10(b) claim, and that this is such a case, Congress did not specify what was meant by ""actual damages"" as used in  28(a), and there is no basis for concluding that  28(a) must be interpreted so as to limit rescissory damages under  10(b) to the net economic harm suffered by the plaintiff.  This Court has never interpreted  28(a) as imposing a rigid requirement that every recovery on claims under the 1934 Act must be limited to the plaintiff's net economic harm.  Thus, the mere fact that the receipt of tax benefits, plus a full recovery under a rescissory measure of damages, may place a  10(b) plaintiff in a better position than he would have been in absent the fraud does not establish that the flexible limits of  28(a) have been exceeded.  Any ""windfall"" gains to plaintiffs emerge more as a function of the Internal Revenue Code's complex provisions than of an unduly generous damages standard for defrauded investors.  Congress' aim in enacting the 1934 Act was not confined solely to compensating defrauded investors, but also included deterrence of fraud and manipulative 
Page 478 U. S. 649
 practices in the securities markets.  These goals would be ill-served by a too rigid insistence on limiting plaintiffs to recovery of their ""net economic loss.""  Section 28(a) cannot fairly be read to require a full-scale inquiry into a defrauded investor's dealings with the tax collector lest the investor escape with anything more than his ""net economic loss.""  Tax benefits should not be treated as a separate asset that is acquired when a limited partner purchases a share in a tax shelter partnership, because tax deductions and tax losses are not a form of freely transferable property created by the promoters of the partnership.

Syllabus 
Federal school land grants to Mississippi in the early 19th century did not apply to lands in northern Mississippi that were held by the Chickasaw Indian Nation, an area that came to be the northern 23 counties in the State.  The Chickasaws thereafter ceded this area to the United States by a treaty under which the lands were sold, but no lands for public schools (Sixteenth Section lands) were reserved from sale.  Congress then provided for the reservation of lands in lieu (Lieu Lands) of Sixteenth Section lands not reserved in the Chickasaw Cession, and for vesting of the title to the Lieu Lands in the State for the use of schools within the Cession.  These Lieu Lands were given to the State.  The state legislature, however, sold the Chickasaw Cession Lieu Lands and invested the proceeds in loans to railroads that were later destroyed in the Civil War, and never replaced.  Under a current Mississippi statute, remaining Sixteenth Section and Lieu Lands ""constitute property held in trust for the benefit of the public schools.""  Another state statute provides that all funds derived from Sixteenth Section or Lieu Lands shall be credited to the school districts of the township in which such Sixteenth Section lands are located or to which any Lieu Lands belong, and shall not be expended except for the education of children of the school district to which the lands belong.  Consequently, all proceeds from Sixteenth Section and Lieu Lands are allocated directly to the township in which the lands are located or to which the lands apply.  With respect to the Chickasaw Cession counties, to which no lands now belong, the state legislature has paid ""interest"" on the lost principal acquired from the sale of those lands in the form of annual appropriations to the Chickasaw Cession schools.  This dual treatment has resulted in a disparity in the level of school funds from the Sixteenth Section lands that are available to the Chickasaw Cession schools as compared to the schools in the rest of the State, the average Sixteenth Section income per pupil in the latter schools being much greater than the average income per pupil in the former schools.  Petitioner local school officials and schoolchildren from the Chickasaw Cession filed suit in Federal District Court against respondent state officials, challenging the disparity in Sixteenth Section funds 
Page 478 U. S. 266
 and alleging (1) that the sale of the Chickasaw Cession school lands and the unwise investment of the proceeds had abrogated the State's trust obligation to hold those lands for the benefit of Chickasaw Cession schoolchildren in perpetuity and (2) that the disparity deprived those schoolchildren of a minimally adequate level of education and of the equal protection of the laws.  Declaratory and other relief was sought.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, holding the claims barred by, inter alia, the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, although the equal protection claim asserted a current ongoing and disparate distribution of state funds for the support of local schools, the remedy for which would not be barred by the Eleventh Amendment, dismissal of the complaint was proper since such differential funding was not unconstitutional under San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1.
Held:
1. Petitioners' trust claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, even if petitioners' characterization of the legal wrong as being a breach of a continuing obligation to comply with the trust obligations is accepted.  There is no substantive difference between a not-yet-extinguished liability for a past breach of trust and the continuing obligation to meet trust responsibilities asserted by petitioners.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651.  In both cases, the trustee is required, because of the past loss of the trust corpus, to use its own resources to take the place of the corpus or the lost income from the corpus.  Thus. petitioners' trust claim, like the claim rejected in Edelman, may not be sustained.  Pp.  478 U. S. 279-281.
2. Petitioners' equal protection claim is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The alleged ongoing constitutional violation -- the State's unequal distribution of the benefits of school lands -- is precisely the type of continuing violation for which a remedy may permissibly be fashioned under Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123.  The essence of the equal protection claim is the present disparity in the distribution of the benefits of state-held assets, and not the State's past actions.  Pp.  478 U. S. 281-282.
3. The assertion in the complaint that petitioners are being deprived of a minimally adequate education is a legal conclusion, rather than a factual allegation that must be accepted as true.  Consequently, focusing only on the funding disparities properly pleaded, the Court of Appeals properly determined that Rodriguez dictates the applicable standard of review:  the alleged differential treatment violates equal protection only if not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  The Court of Appeals incorrectly determined, however, that Rodriguez controlled this case.  Rodriguez did not purport to validate all funding variations that might result from a State's public school funding decisions, but held merely that the variations that resulted from allowing local control over 
Page 478 U. S. 267
 local property tax funding of the public schools were constitutionally permissible in that case.  This case is different from Rodriguez, because here the differential financing is attributable to a state decision to divide state resources unequally among school districts.  Nevertheless, the question remains whether the variations in the benefits received by school districts from Sixteenth Section or Lieu Lands are, on the allegations in the complaint and as a matter of law, rationally related to a legitimate state interest, and this question should be resolved by the Court of Appeals on remand.  A crucial consideration in resolving this question is whether federal law requires the State to allocate the economic benefits of school lands to schools in the townships in which those lands are located.  If, as a matter of federal law, the State has no choice in the matter, whether the complaint states an equal protection claim depends on whether the federal policy is itself violative of the Equal Protection Clause.  If it is, the State may be enjoined from implementing such policy.  But if the federal law is valid and the State is bound by it, then it provides a rational reason for the funding disparity.  Pp.  478 U. S. 283-292.

478 U.S. 310

Syllabus 
After petitioner Library of Congress had rejected respondent black employee's complaints alleging job-related racial discrimination, respondent's counsel pursued administrative relief and settlement negotiations, and eventually reached a settlement with the Library.  The latter agreed to promote respondent retroactively with backpay if the Comptroller General determined that the Library was authorized to do so in the absence of a specific finding of racial discrimination.  The Comptroller General ruled that the Library, under the Back Pay Act, lacked such authority.  Respondent then filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the relief.  The court agreed, and therefore authorized the Library to promote respondent with backpay, and to pay a reasonable attorney's fee and costs pursuant to  706(k) of the Act, which provides that, in any Title VII action, the court may allow the prevailing party a ""reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs,"" and that ""the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.""  In calculating the attorney's fee, the District Court increased the lodestar amount by 30 percent to compensate counsel for the delay in receiving payment for his services.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, although the no-interest rule -- under which no recovery can be had against the Government for interest in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity from an award of interest -- applied, since compensation for delay is functionally equivalent to interest, Congress waived the Government's immunity from interest by making it liable ""the same as a private person.""
Held: The no-interest rule applies here, so as to preclude the award of increased compensation to respondent's counsel for the delay in receiving payment for his services.  Pp.  478 U. S. 314-323.
(a) Section 706(k)'s provision making the United States liable ""the same as a private person"" waives the Government's immunity from attorney's fees, but not interest.  The statute, as well as its history, contains no reference to interest, and thus precludes reading it as the requisite waiver of the Government's immunity from interest.   478 U. S.  318-320.
(b) Nor is that requisite waiver found in  706(k)'s requirement of awarding ""reasonable"" attorney's fees.  There is no basis for reading the term ""reasonable"" as the embodiment of a specific congressional choice 
Page 478 U. S. 311
 to include interest as a component of attorney's fees.  And any congressional policy permitting recovery of a reasonable attorney's fee, no matter how compelling, is insufficient, standing alone, to waive the Government's immunity from interest.  Pp.  478 U. S. 320-321.
(c) Section 706(k)'s provision making the United States liable for ""costs,"" including a reasonable attorney's fee, does not provide the clear affirmative intent of Congress to waive the Government's immunity from interest.  Prejudgment interest is considered as damages, not a component of ""costs.""  P.  478 U. S. 321.
(d) The no-interest rule cannot be avoided by characterizing what is functionally equivalent to interest as compensation for delay.  Both interest and a delay factor are designed to compensate for the belated receipt of money.  Pp.  478 U. S. 321-323.

Syllabus 
Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948 (Act) legalizes certain forms of casino gambling in licensed places in order to promote the development of tourism, but also provides that ""[n]o gambling room shall be permitted to advertise or otherwise offer their facilities to the public of Puerto Rico.""  Implementing regulations prohibit the advertising of gambling parlors to the public in Puerto Rico, but permit restricted advertising through publicity media outside Puerto Rico.  Appellant, a partnership franchised to operate a casino in Puerto Rico, was fined by appellee public corporation, which is authorized to administer the Act, for violating the advertising restrictions in the Act and the regulations.  Appellant then filed suit against appellee in the Puerto Rico Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act and regulations, both facially and as applied by appellee, impermissibly suppressed commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment and the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Federal Constitution.  The court held that the advertising restrictions had been unconstitutionally applied to appellant's past conduct, but the court then adopted a narrowing construction of the Act and regulations, declaring that they prohibited local advertising addressed to inviting residents of Puerto Rico to visit casinos, but not certain local advertising addressed to tourists, even though it might incidentally reach the attention of residents.  The court then held that, based on its construction of the laws, the statute and regulations were facially constitutional.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court dismissed appellant's appeal on the ground that it ""d[id] not present a substantial constitutional question.""
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1258(2), which authorizes an appeal to this Court from a decision of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court that is in favor of the validity of a Puerto Rico statute challenged as being repugnant to the Federal Constitution.  Appellant's federal constitutional claims were adequately raised at every stage of the proceedings below, and under Puerto Rico law appellant had the right to appeal the Superior Court's decision to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court on the 
Page 478 U. S. 329
 ground that the case involved or decided a substantial constitutional question under the Federal Constitution.  Thus, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's dismissal of the appeal for want of a substantial constitutional question constituted a decision on the merits in favor of the validity of the challenged statute and regulations.  This Court's jurisdiction is not affected by appellant's late filing, under Puerto Rico's Rules of Civil Procedure, of its notice of appeal to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, since that court has held the filing requirement to be nonjurisdictional, and its failure to dismiss on timeliness grounds must be viewed as a waiver of the requirement.  Pp.  478 U. S. 337-339.
2. In reviewing the facial constitutionality of the Act and regulations, this Court must abide by the narrowing constructions announced by the Superior Court and approved sub silentio by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.  This would be the rule in a case originating in one of the 50 States, and Puerto Rico's status as a Commonwealth dictates application of the same rule.  P.  478 U. S. 339.
3. The Act and regulations, as construed by the Superior Court, do not facially violate the First Amendment.  The advertising restrictions 
Page 478 U. S. 330
 pass muster under the four-pronged test of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, 447 U. S. 557.  First, the particular kind of commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity, and is not misleading or fraudulent, at least in the abstract, and thus is entitled to a limited form of First Amendment protection.  Second, Puerto Rico's interest in restricting advertising to reduce the demand for casino gambling by Puerto Rico's residents, and thus protect their health, safety, and welfare, constitutes a ""substantial"" governmental interest.  Third, the restrictions on commercial speech ""directly advance"" the government's asserted interest, and are not under-inclusive simply because other kinds of gambling may be advertised to Puerto Rico residents.  And fourth, the restrictions are no more extensive than necessary to serve the government's interest since, as construed by the Superior Court, they do not affect advertising aimed at tourists, but apply only to advertising aimed at Puerto Rico residents.   Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, and Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, distinguished.  There is no merit to appellant's argument that, having chosen to legalize casino gambling for Puerto Rico residents, the legislature is prohibited by the First Amendment from using restrictions on advertising to accomplish its goal of reducing demand for such gambling.  Pp.  478 U. S. 340-347.
4. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court properly concluded that, as construed by the Superior Court, the Act and regulations do not facially violate the due process or equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.  Even assuming that appellant's argument that the advertising restrictions are unconstitutionally vague, in violation of due process requirements, has merit with respect to the bare statutory language, nevertheless this Court is bound by the Superior Court's narrowing construction of the statute.  Viewed in that light, and particularly with the interpretive assistance of the regulations as modified by the Superior Court, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.  478 U. S. 347-348.

 pass muster under the four-pronged test of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, 447 U. S. 557.  First, the particular kind of commercial speech at issue concerns a lawful activity, and is not misleading or fraudulent, at least in the abstract, and thus is entitled to a limited form of First Amendment protection.  Second, Puerto Rico's interest in restricting advertising to reduce the demand for casino gambling by Puerto Rico's residents, and thus protect their health, safety, and welfare, constitutes a ""substantial"" governmental interest.  Third, the restrictions on commercial speech ""directly advance"" the government's asserted interest, and are not under-inclusive simply because other kinds of gambling may be advertised to Puerto Rico residents.  And fourth, the restrictions are no more extensive than necessary to serve the government's interest since, as construed by the Superior Court, they do not affect advertising aimed at tourists, but apply only to advertising aimed at Puerto Rico residents.   Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, and Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, distinguished.  There is no merit to appellant's argument that, having chosen to legalize casino gambling for Puerto Rico residents, the legislature is prohibited by the First Amendment from using restrictions on advertising to accomplish its goal of reducing demand for such gambling.  Pp.  478 U. S. 340-347.
4. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court properly concluded that, as construed by the Superior Court, the Act and regulations do not facially violate the due process or equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.  Even assuming that appellant's argument that the advertising restrictions are unconstitutionally vague, in violation of due process requirements, has merit with respect to the bare statutory language, nevertheless this Court is bound by the Superior Court's narrowing construction of the statute.  Viewed in that light, and particularly with the interpretive assistance of the regulations as modified by the Superior Court, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.  478 U. S. 347-348.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged in an Illinois Circuit Court with committing the crimes of unlawful restraint and deviate sexual assault, and the State filed a petition to have him declared a sexually dangerous person within the meaning of the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act (Act).  Pursuant to the Act, the court ordered petitioner to submit to two psychiatric examinations.  At the bench trial on the petition, the State presented the examining psychiatrists' testimony, over petitioner's objection that they had elicited information from him in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination.  Based on that testimony, as well as that of the victim of the sexual assault, the court found petitioner to be a sexually dangerous person under the Act.  The Illinois Appellate Court reversed, holding that the trial court had improperly relied on testimony in violation of petitioner's privilege against self-incrimination.  The Illinois Supreme Court reversed, holding that that privilege was not available in sexually dangerous person proceedings because they are ""essentially civil in nature.""
Held:
1. Proceedings under the Act are not ""criminal"" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination.  The Act's aim is to provide treatment, not punishment, for persons adjudged sexually dangerous.  That the State cannot file a sexually dangerous person petition under the Act unless it has already filed criminal charges against the person in question, and thus has chosen not to apply the Act to the larger class of mentally ill persons who might be found sexually dangerous, does not transform a civil proceeding into a criminal one.  The State must prove more than just the commission of a sexual assault.  It must prove the existence of a mental disorder for more than one year and a propensity to commit sexual assaults, in addition to showing that propensity through sexual assault.  The fact that the Act provides some of the safeguards applicable in criminal proceedings -- rights to counsel, to a jury trial, and to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and the requirement that sexual dangerousness be proved beyond a reasonable doubt -- cannot itself turn the proceedings under the Act into criminal proceedings requiring the full panoply of rights applicable there.  And the fact that a person adjudged sexually dangerous under the Act is committed to a maximum security institution that also

2. The Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process does not require application of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination to proceedings under the Act.

Syllabus 
The private petitioners -- who include employees of the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service (Extension Service), recipients of its services, members of its Homemaker Clubs, and parents of youths that belong to its 4-H Clubs -- filed suit against various state and local officials in Federal District Court (the United States intervened as a plaintiff), alleging racial discrimination in employment and in provision of services by the Extension Service, in violation of the Constitution and various federal statutes, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court refused to certify various proposed classes and entered judgment for respondents, finding that petitioners had not carried their burden of demonstrating that respondents had engaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. For the reasons stated in the concurring opinion of JUSTICE BRENNAN, the Court of Appeals erred:  in holding that, under Title VII, the Extension Service had no duty to eradicate salary disparities between white and black workers that had their origin prior to the date Title VII was made applicable to public employees; in disregarding petitioners' statistical analysis because it reflected pre-Title VII salary disparities; in holding that petitioners' regressions were unacceptable as evidence of discrimination; in ignoring evidence related to salary disparities presented by petitioners in addition to their multiple regression analyses; and in refusing to certify a class of black employees of the Extension Service, although the Court of Appeals was correct in refusing to certify a class of defendant counties.
2. For the reasons stated in the opinion of JUSTICE WHITE, neither the Constitution nor the applicable Department of Agriculture regulations required more than what the District Court and the Court of Appeals found the Extension Service has done to disestablish segregation in its 4-H and Homemaker Clubs.

Syllabus 
California filed a complaint against a nurse charging him with murdering 12 patients by administering massive doses of the heart drug lidocaine.  The Magistrate granted the defendant's motion to exclude the public from the preliminary hearing on the complaint under a California statute that requires such proceedings to be open unless ""exclusion of the public is necessary in order to protect the defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial.""  At the conclusion of the 41-day preliminary hearing, the Magistrate refused petitioner's request that the transcript of the proceedings be released.  Thereafter, the State, supported by petitioner and opposed by the defendant, moved unsuccessfully in the California Superior Court to have the transcript released.  Petitioner then filed a peremptory writ of mandate with the California Court of Appeal.  Meanwhile, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and the Superior Court released the transcript.  After holding that the controversy was not moot, the Court of Appeal denied the writ.  The California Supreme Court also denied the writ, holding that there is no general First Amendment right of access to preliminary hearings, and that. under the California statute, if the defendant establishes a ""reasonable likelihood of substantial prejudice,"" the burden shifts to the prosecution or the media to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no such reasonable probability of prejudice.

2. The qualified First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings applies to preliminary hearings as conducted in California.   First, there has been a tradition of public accessibility to preliminary hearings of the type conducted in California.  As opposed to grand jury proceedings, preliminary hearings conducted before neutral and detached magistrates have been open to the public.  Second, public access to such preliminary hearings is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.  This proper functioning is not made any less essential by the fact that a preliminary hearing cannot result in a conviction and the adjudication is before a magistrate without a jury.  The absence of a jury makes the importance of public access even more significant.  Pp.  478 U. S. 6-13.
3.

No. 83-1968

478 U.S. 30

Syllabus 
In 1982, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted a legislative redistricting plan for the State's Senate and House of Representatives.  Appellees, black citizens of North Carolina who are registered to vote, brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging one single-member district and six multimember districts on the ground, inter alia, that the redistricting plan impaired black citizens' ability to elect representatives of their choice in violation of  2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  After appellees brought suit, but before trial,  2 was amended, largely in response to Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, to make clear that a violation of  2 could be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone, rather than having to show a discriminatory purpose, and to establish as the relevant legal standard the ""results test.""  Section 2(a), as amended, prohibits a State or political subdivision from imposing any voting qualifications or prerequisites to voting, or any standards, practices, or procedures that result in the denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color.  Section 2(b), as amended, provides that  2(a) is violated where the ""totality of circumstances"" reveals that
""the political processes leading to nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected class] . . . in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice,""
and that the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office is one circumstance that may be considered.  The District Court applied the ""totality of circumstances"" test set forth in  2(b), and held that the redistricting plan violated  2(a) because it resulted in the dilution of black citizens' votes in all of the disputed districts.  Appellants, the Attorney General of North Carolina and others, took a direct appeal to this Court with respect to five of the multimember districts.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
590 F.Supp. 345, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, IV-A, and V, concluding that: 
Page 478 U. S. 31

1. Minority voters who contend that the multimember form of districting violates  2 must prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their preferred candidates.  While many or all of the factors listed in the Senate Report may be relevant to a claim of vote dilution through submergence in multimember districts, unless there is a conjunction of the following circumstances, the use of multimember districts generally will not impede the ability of minority voters to elect representatives of their choice.  Stated succinctly, a bloc voting majority must usually be able to defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive, geographically insular minority group.  The relevance of the existence of racial bloc voting to a vote dilution claim is twofold:  to ascertain whether minority group members constitute a politically cohesive unit and to determine whether whites vote sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.  Thus, the question whether a given district experiences legally significant racial bloc voting requires discrete inquiries into minority and white voting practices.  A showing that a significant number of minority group members usually vote for the same candidates is one way of proving the political cohesiveness necessary to a vote dilution claim, and consequently establishes minority bloc voting within the meaning of  2.  And, in general, a white bloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support plus white ""crossover"" votes rises to the level of legally significant white bloc voting.  Because loss of political power through vote dilution is distinct from the mere inability to win a particular election, a pattern of racial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative of a claim that a district experiences significant polarization than are the results of a single election.  In a district where elections are shown usually to be polarized, the fact that racially polarized voting is not present in one election or a few elections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experiences legally significant bloc voting.  Furthermore, the success of a minority candidate in a particular election does not necessarily prove that the district did not experience polarized voting in that election.  Here, the District Court's approach, which tested data derived from three election years in each district in question, and which revealed that blacks strongly supported black candidates, while, to the black candidates' usual detriment, whites rarely did, satisfactorily addresses each facet of the proper standard for legally significant racial bloc voting.  Pp.  478 U. S. 52-61.
2. The language of  2 and its legislative history plainly demonstrate that proof that some minority candidates have been elected does not foreclose a  2 claim.  Thus, the District Court did not err, as a matter of law, in refusing to treat the fact that some black candidates have 
Page 478 U. S. 32
 succeeded as dispositive of appellees'  2 claims.  Where multimember districting generally works to dilute the minority vote, it cannot be defended on the ground that it sporadically and serendipitously benefits minority voters.  Pp.  478 U. S. 74-76.
3. The clearly erroneous test of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) is the appropriate standard for appellate review of ultimate findings of vote dilution.  As both amended  2 and its legislative history make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution through districting, the trial court is to consider the ""totality of circumstances"" and to determine, based upon a practical evaluation of the past and present realities, whether the political process is equally open to minority voters.  In this case, the District Court carefully considered the totality of the circumstances, and found that, in each district, racially polarized voting; the legacy of official discrimination in voting matters, education, housing, employment, and health services; and the persistence of campaign appeals to racial prejudice acted in concert with the multimember districting scheme to impair the ability of geographically insular and politically cohesive groups of black voters to participate equally in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice.  Pp.  478 U. S. 77-79.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-C that, for purposes of  2, the legal concept of racially polarized voting, as it relates to claims of vote dilution -- that is, when it is used to prove that the minority group is politically cohesive and that white voters will usually be able to defeat the minority's preferred candidates -- refers only to the existence of a correlation between the race of voters and the selection of certain candidates.  Plaintiffs need not prove causation or intent in order to prove a prima facie case of racial bloc voting, and defendants may not rebut that case with evidence of causation or intent.  Pp.  478 U. S. 61-73.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, concluded in Part IV-B, that the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in ignoring the significance of the sustained success black voters have experienced in House District 23.  The persistent proportional representation for black residents in that district in the last six elections is inconsistent with appellees' allegation that black voters' ability in that district to elect representatives of their choice is not equal to that enjoyed by the white majority.  P.  478 U. S. 77.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that:
1. Insofar as statistical evidence of divergent racial voting patterns is admitted solely to establish that the minority group is politically cohesive and to assess its prospects for electoral success, such a showing cannot be rebutted by evidence that the divergent voting patterns may 
Page 478 U. S. 33
 be explained by causes other than race.  However, evidence of the reasons for divergent voting patterns can, in some circumstances, be relevant to the overall vote dilution inquiry, and there is no rule against consideration of all evidence concerning voting preferences other than statistical evidence of racial voting patterns.  Pp.  478 U. S. 100-101.
2. Consistent and sustained success by candidates preferred by minority voters is presumptively inconsistent with the existence of a  2 violation.  The District Court erred in assessing the extent of black electoral success in House District 39 and Senate District 22, as well as in House District 23.  Except in House District 23, despite these errors, the District Court's ultimate conclusion of vote dilution is not clearly erroneous.  But in House District 23, appellees failed to establish a violation of  2.  Pp.  478 U. S. 101-105.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, IV-A, and V, in which WHITE, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, an opinion with respect to Part III-C, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part IV-B, in which WHITE, J., joined.

Appellees, black citizens of North Carolina who are registered to vote, brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging one single-member district and six multimember districts on the ground, inter alia, that the redistricting plan impaired black citizens' ability to elect representatives of their choice in violation of  2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  After appellees brought suit, but before trial,  2 was amended, largely in response to Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, to make clear that a violation of  2 could be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone, rather than having to show a discriminatory purpose, and to establish as the relevant legal standard the ""results test.""  Section 2(a), as amended, prohibits a State or political subdivision from imposing any voting qualifications or prerequisites to voting, or any standards, practices, or procedures that result in the denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color.  Section 2(b), as amended, provides that  2(a) is violated where the ""totality of circumstances"" reveals that
""the political processes leading to nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation by members of a [protected class] . . . in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice,""
and that the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office is one circumstance that may be considered.  The District Court applied the ""totality of circumstances"" test set forth in  2(b), and held that the redistricting plan violated  2(a) because it resulted in the dilution of black citizens' votes in all of the disputed districts.  Appellants, the Attorney General of North Carolina and others, took a direct appeal to this Court with respect to five of the multimember districts.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
590 F.Supp. 345, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, IV-A, and V, concluding that:

1. Minority voters who contend that the multimember form of districting violates  2 must prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their preferred candidates.  While many or all of the factors listed in the Senate Report may be relevant to a claim of vote dilution through submergence in multimember districts, unless there is a conjunction of the following circumstances, the use of multimember districts generally will not impede the ability of minority voters to elect representatives of their choice.  Stated succinctly, a bloc voting majority must usually be able to defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive, geographically insular minority group.  The relevance of the existence of racial bloc voting to a vote dilution claim is twofold:  to ascertain whether minority group members constitute a politically cohesive unit and to determine whether whites vote sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.  Thus, the question whether a given district experiences legally significant racial bloc voting requires discrete inquiries into minority and white voting practices.  A showing that a significant number of minority group members usually vote for the same candidates is one way of proving the political cohesiveness necessary to a vote dilution claim, and consequently establishes minority bloc voting within the meaning of  2.  And, in general, a white bloc vote that normally will defeat the combined strength of minority support plus white ""crossover"" votes rises to the level of legally significant white bloc voting.  Because loss of political power through vote dilution is distinct from the mere inability to win a particular election, a pattern of racial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative of a claim that a district experiences significant polarization than are the results of a single election.  In a district where elections are shown usually to be polarized, the fact that racially polarized voting is not present in one election or a few elections does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experiences legally significant bloc voting.  Furthermore, the success of a minority candidate in a particular election does not necessarily prove that the district did not experience polarized voting in that election.  Here, the District Court's approach, which tested data derived from three election years in each district in question, and which revealed that blacks strongly supported black candidates, while, to the black candidates' usual detriment, whites rarely did, satisfactorily addresses each facet of the proper standard for legally significant racial bloc voting.  Pp.  478 U. S. 52-61.
2. The language of  2 and its legislative history plainly demonstrate that proof that some minority candidates have been elected does not foreclose a  2 claim.  Thus, the District Court did not err, as a matter of law, in refusing to treat the fact that some black candidates have 
Page 478 U. S. 32
 succeeded as dispositive of appellees'  2 claims.  Where multimember districting generally works to dilute the minority vote, it cannot be defended on the ground that it sporadically and serendipitously benefits minority voters.  Pp.  478 U. S. 74-76.
3. The clearly erroneous test of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) is the appropriate standard for appellate review of ultimate findings of vote dilution.  As both amended  2 and its legislative history make clear, in evaluating a statutory claim of vote dilution through districting, the trial court is to consider the ""totality of circumstances"" and to determine, based upon a practical evaluation of the past and present realities, whether the political process is equally open to minority voters.  In this case, the District Court carefully considered the totality of the circumstances, and found that, in each district, racially polarized voting; the legacy of official discrimination in voting matters, education, housing, employment, and health services; and the persistence of campaign appeals to racial prejudice acted in concert with the multimember districting scheme to impair the ability of geographically insular and politically cohesive groups of black voters to participate equally in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice.  Pp.  478 U. S. 77-79.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-C that, for purposes of  2, the legal concept of racially polarized voting, as it relates to claims of vote dilution -- that is, when it is used to prove that the minority group is politically cohesive and that white voters will usually be able to defeat the minority's preferred candidates -- refers only to the existence of a correlation between the race of voters and the selection of certain candidates.  Plaintiffs need not prove causation or intent in order to prove a prima facie case of racial bloc voting, and defendants may not rebut that case with evidence of causation or intent.  Pp.  478 U. S. 61-73.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, concluded in Part IV-B, that the District Court erred, as a matter of law, in ignoring the significance of the sustained success black voters have experienced in House District 23.  The persistent proportional representation for black residents in that district in the last six elections is inconsistent with appellees' allegation that black voters' ability in that district to elect representatives of their choice is not equal to that enjoyed by the white majority.  P.  478 U. S. 77.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that:
1. Insofar as statistical evidence of divergent racial voting patterns is admitted solely to establish that the minority group is politically cohesive and to assess its prospects for electoral success, such a showing cannot be rebutted by evidence that the divergent voting patterns may 
Page 478 U. S. 33
 be explained by causes other than race.  However, evidence of the reasons for divergent voting patterns can, in some circumstances, be relevant to the overall vote dilution inquiry, and there is no rule against consideration of all evidence concerning voting preferences other than statistical evidence of racial voting patterns.  Pp.  478 U. S. 100-101.
2. Consistent and sustained success by candidates preferred by minority voters is presumptively inconsistent with the existence of a  2 violation.  The District Court erred in assessing the extent of black electoral success in House District 39 and Senate District 22, as well as in House District 23.  Except in House District 23, despite these errors, the District Court's ultimate conclusion of vote dilution is not clearly erroneous.  But in House District 23, appellees failed to establish a violation of  2.  Pp.  478 U. S. 101-105.

Syllabus 
The Indiana Legislature consists of a 100-member House of Representatives and a 50-member Senate.  Representatives serve 2-year terms, with elections for all seats every two years.  Senators serve 4-year terms, with half of the seats up for election every two years.  Senators are elected from single-member districts, while representatives are elected from a mixture of single-member and multimember districts.  In 1981, the legislature reapportioned the districts pursuant to the 1980 census.  At that time, there were Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate.  The reapportionment plan provided 50 single-member districts for the Senate and 7 triple-member, 9 double-member, and 61 single-member districts for the House.  The multimember districts generally included the State's metropolitan areas.  In 1982, appellee Indiana Democrats filed suit in Federal District Court against appellant state officials, alleging that the 1981 reapportionment plan constituted a political gerrymander intended to disadvantage Democrats, and that the particular district lines that were drawn and the mix of single-member and multimember districts were intended to and did violate their right, as Democrats, to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.  In November 1982, before the case went to trial, elections were held under the new plan.  Democratic candidates for the House received 51.9% of votes cast statewide, but only 43 out of the 100 seats to be filled.  Democratic candidates for the Senate received 53.1% of the votes cast statewide, and 13 out of the 25 Democratic candidates were elected.  In Marion and Allen Counties, both divided into multimember House districts, Democratic candidates drew 46.6% of the vote, but only 3 of the 21 Democratic candidates were elected.  Subsequently, relying primarily on the 1982 election results as proof of unconstitutionally discriminatory vote dilution, the District Court invalidated the 1981 reapportionment plan, enjoined appellants from holding elections pursuant thereto, and ordered the legislature to prepare a new plan.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
603 F.Supp. 1479, reversed.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that political gerrymandering, such as occurred in this case, is properly justiciable under the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  478 U. S. 127-143.  
Page 478 U. S. 110
 Here, none of the identifying characteristics of a nonjusticiable political question are present.  Disposition of the case does not involve this Court in a matter more properly decided by a coequal branch of the Government.  There is no risk of foreign or domestic disturbance.  Nor is this Court persuaded that there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards by which political gerrymandering cases are to be decided.  The mere fact that there is no likely arithmetic presumption, such as the ""one person, one vote"" rule, in the present context does not compel a conclusion that the claims presented here are nonjusticiable.  The claim is whether each political group in the State should have the same chance to elect representatives of its choice as any other political group, and this Court declines to hold that such claim is never justiciable.  That the claim is submitted by a political group, rather than a racial group, does not distinguish it in terms of justiciability.  Pp.  478 U. S. 118-127.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Parts III and IV that the District Court erred in holding that appellees had alleged and proved a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  478 U. S. 127-143.
(a) A threshold showing of discriminatory vote dilution is required for a prima facie case of an equal protection violation.  The District Court's findings of an adverse effect on appellees do not surmount this threshold requirement.  The mere fact that an apportionment scheme makes it more difficult for a particular group in a particular district to elect representatives of its choice does not render that scheme unconstitutional.  A group's electoral power is not unconstitutionally diminished by the fact that an apportionment scheme makes winning elections more difficult, and a failure of proportional representation alone does not constitute impermissible discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.  As with individual districts, where unconstitutional vote dilution is alleged in the form of statewide political gerrymandering, as here, the mere lack of proportional representation will not be sufficient to prove unconstitutional discrimination.  Without specific supporting evidence, a court cannot presume in such a case that those who are elected will disregard the disproportionally underrepresented group.  Rather, unconstitutional discrimination occurs only when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on the political process as a whole.  The District Court's apparent holding that any interference with an opportunity to elect a representative of one's choice would be sufficient to allege or prove an equal protection violation, unless justified by some acceptable state interest, in addition to being contrary to the above-described conception of an unconstitutional political gerrymander, would invite attack on all or almost all reapportionment statutes.  Pp.  478 U. S. 127-134. 
Page 478 U. S. 111

(b) Relying on a single election to prove unconstitutional discrimination, as the District Court did, is unsatisfactory.  Without finding that, because of the 1981 reapportionment, the Democrats could not in one of the next few elections secure a sufficient vote to take control of the legislature, that the reapportionment would consign the Democrats to a minority status in the legislature throughout the 1980's, or that they would have no hope of doing any better in the reapportionment based on the 1990 census, the District Court erred in concluding that the 1981 reapportionment violated the Equal Protection Clause.  Simply showing that there are multimember districts, and that those districts are constructed so as to be safely Republican or Democratic, in no way bolsters the contention that there has been a statewide discrimination against Democratic voters.  Pp.  478 U. S. 134-137.
(c) The view that intentional drawing of district boundaries for partisan ends, and for no other reason, violates the Equal Protection Clause would allow a constitutional violation to be found where the only proven effect on a political party's electoral power was disproportionate results in one election (possibly two elections), and would invite judicial interference in legislative districting whenever a political party suffers at the polls.  Even if a state legislature redistricts with the specific intention of disadvantaging one political party's election prospects, there has been no unconstitutional violation against members of that party unless the redistricting does, in fact, disadvantage it at the polls.  As noted, a mere lack of proportionate results in one election cannot suffice in this regard.  Pp.  478 U. S. 138-143.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluding that the partisan gerrymandering claims of major political parties raise a nonjusticiable political question, would reverse the District Court's judgment on the grounds that appellees' claim is nonjusticiable.  The Equal Protection Clause does not supply judicially manageable standards for resolving purely political gerrymandering claims, and does not confer group rights to an equal share of political power.  Racial gerrymandering claims are justiciable because of the greater warrant the Equal Protection Clause gives the federal courts to intervene for protection against racial discrimination, and because of the stronger nexus between individual rights and group interests that is present in the case of a discrete and insular racial group.  But members of the major political parties cannot claim that they are vulnerable to exclusion from the political process, and it has not been established that there is a need or a constitutional basis for judicial intervention to resolve political gerrymandering claims.  The costs of judicial intervention will be severe, and such intervention requires courts to make policy choices that are not of a kind suited for judicial discretion.  Nor is 
Page 478 U. S. 112
 there any clear stopping point to prevent the gradual evolution of a requirement of roughly proportional representation for every cohesive political group.  Accordingly, political gerrymandering claims present a nonjusticiable political question.  Pp.  478 U. S. 144-155.
WHITE, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts I, III, and IV, in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.

No. 85-140
Argued March 31, 1986
Decided June 30, 1986
478 U.S. 186

Syllabus 
After being charged with violating the Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy by committing that act with another adult male in the bedroom of his home, respondent Hardwick (respondent) brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it criminalized consensual sodomy.  The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the Georgia statute violated respondent's fundamental rights.
Held:  The Georgia statute is constitutional.  Pp.  478 U. S. 190-196.
(a) The Constitution does not confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.  None of the fundamental rights announced in this Court's prior cases involving family relationships, marriage, or procreation bear any resemblance to the right asserted in this case.  And any claim that those cases stand for the proposition that any kind of private sexual conduct between consenting adults is constitutionally insulated from state proscription is unsupportable.  Pp.  478 U. S. 190-191.
(b) Against a background in which many States have criminalized sodomy and still do, to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition"" or ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" is, at best, facetious.  Pp.  478 U. S. 191-194.
(c) There should be great resistance to expand the reach of the Due Process Clauses to cover new fundamental rights.  Otherwise, the Judiciary necessarily would take upon itself further authority to govern the country without constitutional authority.  The claimed right in this case falls far short of overcoming this resistance.  Pp.  478 U. S. 194-195.
(d) The fact that homosexual conduct occurs in the privacy of the home does not affect the result.  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, distinguished.  Pp.  478 U. S. 195-196.
(e) Sodomy laws should not be invalidated on the asserted basis that majority belief that sodomy is immoral is an inadequate rationale to support the laws.  P.  478 U. S. 196.
760 F.2d 1202, reversed.

(b) Against a background in which many States have criminalized sodomy and still do, to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition"" or ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" is, at best, facetious.  Pp.  478 U. S. 191-194.
(c) There should be great resistance to expand the reach of the Due Process Clauses to cover new fundamental rights.  Otherwise, the Judiciary necessarily would take upon itself further authority to govern the country without constitutional authority.  The claimed right in this case falls far short of overcoming this resistance.  Pp.  478 U. S. 194-195.

Syllabus 
The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) included a Schedule regulating whale harvesting practices of member nations (including the United States and Japan) and setting harvest limits for various whale species.  It also established the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and authorized it to set harvest quotas.  However, the IWC has no power to impose sanctions for quota violations, and any member country may file a timely objection to an IWC amendment of the Schedule and thereby exempt itself from any obligation to comply with the limit.  Because of the IWC's inability to enforce its own quota and in an effort to promote enforcement of quotas set by other international fishery conservation programs, Congress enacted the Pelly Amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, directing the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to certify to the President if nationals of a foreign country are conducting fishing operations in such a manner as to ""diminish the effectiveness"" of an international fishery conservation program.  The President, in his discretion, may then direct the imposition of sanctions on the certified nation.  Later, Congress passed the Packwood Amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, requiring expedition of the certification process and mandating that, if the Secretary certifies that nationals of a foreign country are conducting fishing operations in such a manner as to ""diminish the effectiveness"" of the ICRW, economic sanctions must be imposed by the Executive Branch against the offending nation.  After the IWC established a zero quota for certain sperm whales and ordered a 5-year moratorium on commercial whaling to begin in 1985, Japan filed objections to both limitations, and thus was not bound thereby.  However, in 1984, Japan and the United States concluded an executive agreement whereby Japan pledged to adhere to certain harvest limits and to cease commercial whaling by 1988, and the Secretary agreed that the United States would not certify Japan under either the Pelly Amendment or the Packwood Amendment if Japan complied with its pledges.  Shortly before consummation 
Page 478 U. S. 222
 of the executive agreement, several wildlife conservation groups filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary to certify Japan, and the court granted summary judgment for the groups, concluding that any taking of whales in excess of the IWC's quotas diminished the effectiveness of the ICRW.  The court ordered the Secretary immediately to certify to the President that Japan was in violation of the sperm whale quota.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The political question doctrine does not bar judicial resolution of the instant controversy.  The courts have the authority to construe international treaties and executive agreements and to interpret congressional legislation.  The challenge to the Secretary's decision not to certify Japan presents a purely legal question of statutory interpretation.  The Judiciary's constitutional responsibility to interpret statutes cannot be shirked simply because a decision may have significant political overtones.  Pp.  478 U. S. 229-230.
2. Neither the Pelly Amendment nor the Packwood Amendment required the Secretary to certify Japan for refusing to abide by the IWC whaling quotas.  The Secretary's decision to secure the certainty of Japan's future compliance with the IWC's program through the 1984 executive agreement, rather than to rely on the possibility that certification and imposition of economic sanctions would produce the same or a better result, is a reasonable construction of the Amendments.  Pp.  478 U. S. 231-241.
(a) Under the terms of the Amendments, certification is neither permitted nor required until the Secretary determines that nationals of a foreign country are conducting fishing operations in a manner that ""diminishes the effectiveness"" of the ICRW.  Although the Secretary must promptly make a certification decision, there is no statutory definition of the words ""diminish the effectiveness"" or specification of the factors that the Secretary should consider in making the decision entrusted to him alone.  The statutory language does not direct the Secretary automatically and regardless of the circumstances to certify a nation that fails to conform to the IWC whaling Schedule.  Pp.  478 U. S. 231-234.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history of either Amendment addresses the nature of the Secretary's duty and requires him to certify every departure from the IWC's scheduled limits on whaling.  The history of the Pelly Amendment and its subsequent amendment shows that Congress had no intention to require the Secretary to certify every departure from the limits set by an international conservation program, and that Congress used the phrase ""diminish the effectiveness"" to give the Secretary a range of certification discretion.  Although the Packwood Amendment was designed to remove executive discretion in imposing 
Page 478 U. S. 223
 sanctions once certification had been made, Congress specifically retained the identical certification standard of the Pelly Amendment, and the legislative history does not indicate that the certification standard requires the Secretary, regardless of the circumstances, to certify each and every departure from the IWC's whaling Schedules.

Syllabus 
After the District Court granted respondents' motion to dismiss petitioner's civil rights suit against respondents, and after petitioner abandoned his appeal, the District Court granted respondents' motion for an award of attorney's fees on the ground that petitioner had filed his action in bad faith.  Petitioner then filed a motion, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), to alter or amend the judgment.  After a hearing, the court denied the motion from the bench, and petitioner filed a notice of appeal that same afternoon.  However, the District Court's order denying the Rule 59(e) motion was not entered on the docket until two days later, and petitioner did not file a new notice of appeal following the docket entry.  Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeals ruled that the notice of appeal was premature under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), which provides that, with regard to certain motions in the district court, including motions under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment, the time for appeal shall run from ""the entry of the order . . . granting or denying"" any such motion; that a notice of appeal filed before ""the disposition"" of any such motion shall have no effect; and that ""[a] new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.""  The court concluded that petitioner's notice of appeal must be treated as a nullity, and thus the court had no jurisdiction over the appeal.
Held.  The Court of Appeals' interpretation of Rule 4(a)(4) was correct.
Such interpretation comports with the Rule's plain wording.  Moreover, the plain import of Rule 4(a)(2) -- which provides that,
""[e]xcept as provided in (a)(4) of this Rule 4, a notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision or order but before the entry of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof""
(emphasis added) -- is that, with respect to the particular motions to which it applies, Rule 4(a)(4) constitutes an exception to the general rule that a notice of appeal filed after announcement of an order, but before its entry in the docket, will be deemed timely filed.  Thus, a notice of appeal is ineffective unless filed after entry of judgment on a Rule 59(e) motion or any of the other motions to which Rule 4(a)(4) applies.

Decided June 30, 1986
478 U.S. 255

Syllabus 
At his Illinois state court trial, which resulted in murder convictions, petitioner, a black man, moved unsuccessfully to discharge the jury on the ground that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike black and Hispanic veniremen violated petitioner's right to an impartial jury selected from a cross-section of the community.  Affirming the convictions, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the trial judge's refusal to discharge the jury, since the record did not establish systematic exclusion of minorities by prosecutors in the jurisdiction, as required by Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202.  Petitioner then filed federal habeas corpus proceedings, renewing his argument concerning the State's use of peremptory challenges.  The District Court denied relief, and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's request for a certificate of probable cause to appeal.  In his petition for certiorari, petitioner argued that the Court of Appeals' refusal to issue a certificate of probable cause was erroneous in view of the fact that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, was pending before this Court at the time of the Court of Appeals' decision, and that the Batson rule should be available to him as a ground for relief on remand.  Batson overruled the portion of Swain which held that, although the use of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors on account of race violates the Equal Protection Clause, a defendant cannot establish such a violation solely on proof of the prosecutor's action at his own trial.
Held:  The Batson rule should not be applied retroactively on collateral review of convictions that became final before Batson was announced.  A decision announcing a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is almost automatically nonretroactive where the decision explicitly overrules past precedent.  A traditional factor for consideration is the purpose to be served by the new rule, with retroactive effect being appropriate where the rule is designed to enhance the accuracy of criminal trials.  The Batson rule may have some bearing on the truthfinding function of a criminal trial, but it also serves the purposes of ensuring that the States do not discriminate against citizens who are summoned to sit in judgment against a member of their own race, and of strengthening public confidence in the administration of justice.  The rule in Batson was designed to serve multiple ends, and it does not have such a fundamental 
Page 478 U. S. 256
 impact on the integrity of factfinding as to compel retroactive application.  Moreover, other traditional factors concerning law enforcement authorities' reliance on the old (Swain) rule and the effect of retroactive application of the new (Batson) rule on the administration of justice weigh heavily in favor of nonretroactive effect.

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held that 42 U.S.C. 5851(a),1 which protects employees of nuclear facilities against retaliation by their employers for offering assistance to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,2 prohibits an employer from terminating a quality control inspector because the inspector has filed internal safety complaints-that is, [ Kansas Gas and Elec. Co. v. Brock 478 U.S. 1011 (1986) ][1011-Continued.] 
complaints directed not to the Commission, but only to the employer itself . 780 F.2d 1505 (1985). The Tenth Circuit concluded that although the statutory language does not unambiguously include such cases, the statute's purpose and its legislative history indicate that its extension to purely internal complaints is appropriate. Id., at 1510-1513. In so holding, the Court of Appeals took note that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had considered precisely the same statutory language and legislative history and reached the opposite conclusion in Brown & Root, Inc. v. Donovan, 747 F.2d 1029 (1984). The Tenth Circuit specifically rejected the Fifth Circuit's ruling in Brown & Root and instead aligned itself with an earlier ruling of the Ninth Cir- 
Page 478 U.S. 1011 , 1012
 cuit that internal complaints are covered. Mackowiak v. University Nuclear Systems, 735 F.2d 1159 (1984). 
 This direct conflict among the Courts of Appeals should be resolved by this Court. The issue is one of importance to both employees and operators of nuclear installations, and it is an issue that has surfaced either directly or indirectly in at least five appellate decisions in the past four years. See, in addition to the decision below and the cases cited above, the Second Circuit's decision in Consolidated Edison Co. v.

 June 30, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Michigan. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 Respondent's home began to burn at about 6:20 p.m. on November 27, 1983. Within a short time the fire department responded, extinguished the fire, and departed. An hour and 20 minutes later an arson investigator of the city entered the home to conduct an investigation as to the cause. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that this was a search without a warrant which violated the Fourth Amendment. 146 Mich.App. 315, 380 N.W. 2d 96 (1985). That court relied on the concurrence in Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U.S. 287, 299, 650 (1984) ( STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), since the inspector gave respondent no notice of the inspection.

 Clifford involved a warrantless search following reentry of a home six hours after a fire had been extinguished. We granted certiorari in that case ""to clarify doubt that appears to exist as to the application of our decision in Tyler."" 464 U.S., at 289. Our effort at clarification, however, proved illusive. A plurality held that an administrative warrant was required for a nonconsensual re-entry onto fire- damaged premises. Id., at 291-292 (opinion of POWELL, J.). Justice STEVENS, writing separately, held that a postfire warrantless entry would be reasonable so long as ""the inspector had either given the owner sufficient advance notice to enable him or an agent to be present, or had made a reasonable effort to do so."" Id., at 303, 104 S.Ct ., at 652 (footnote omitted).

 This case provides another opportunity for the Court to clarify the confusion arising out of the opinions in Tyler. Local authorities need direction for their fire inspectors, who are presently left with no clear guidance for conducting important and oft-occurring arson inspections in the wake of Clifford 's divided reasoning. Such inspections must be conducted promptly before vandals or weather conditions blur or destroy relevant evidence. I would grant the State's petition for certiorari and set the case for argument.

 MICHIGANv. Younis Mansi ESSA.No. 85-1514 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 30, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Michigan. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 Respondent's home began to burn at about 6:20 p.m. on November 27, 1983. Within a short time the fire department responded, extinguished the fire, and departed. An hour and 20 minutes later an arson investigator of the city entered the home to conduct an investigation as to the cause. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that this was a search without a warrant which violated the Fourth Amendment. 146 Mich.App. 315, 380 N.W. 2d 96 (1985). That court relied on the concurrence in Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U.S. 287, 299, 650 (1984) ( STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), since the inspector gave respondent no notice of the inspection.

Argued March 26, 1986
Decided June 27, 1986
477 U.S. 556

Syllabus 
Appellee, who had been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital for a period of several days in 1971, was unable to purchase a firearm from a store in 1982 because of the provisions of 18 U.S.C.  922(d) prohibiting sales of firearms to such persons.  Section 922(d) and other federal statutes prohibiting persons who have been committed to mental institutions from possessing, receiving, or transporting firearms also apply to felons.  However, under 18 U.S.C.  925(c), certain felons could apply to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for administrative relief from the disabilities imposed by federal firearms laws, but no such relief was permitted for former mental patients.  After unsuccessfully seeking a special exemption from the Bureau, appellee brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the firearms legislation.  The court held that the statutory scheme was unconstitutional as violating equal protection principles because there was no rational basis for singling out mental patients for permanent disabled status, particularly as compared to convicts.  The court also concluded that the statutory scheme unconstitutionally created an ""irrebuttable presumption"" that one who has been committed, no matter what the circumstances, is forever mentally ill and dangerous.
Held:  The equal protection and ""irrebuttable presumption"" issues are now moot because, after this Court noted probable jurisdiction over this appeal and heard arguments, Congress amended  925(c) to afford the administrative remedy contained therein to former mental patients ineligible to purchase firearms.  Since appellee's complaint appears to raise other issues best addressed in the first instance by the District Court, the case is remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.  477 U. S. 559-560.

No. 85-224
Argued March 31, 1986
Decided June 27, 1986
477 U.S. 561

Syllabus 
Respondents, eight Chicano individuals, attended a party at the home of two of the respondents.  A large number of officers of petitioner city's police force, acting without a warrant, broke up the party by using tear gas and unnecessary physical force, and many of the guests, including four of the respondents, were arrested.  Criminal charges were ultimately dismissed.  Respondents filed suit in Federal District Court against the city, its Chief of Police, and 30 individual police officers under various federal Civil Rights Acts, alleging violations of respondents' First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as numerous state law claims.  Ultimately the jury returned 37 individual verdicts in favor of respondents and against the city and five individual officers, finding 11 violations of 42 U.S.C.  1983, 4 instances of false arrest and imprisonment, and 22 instances of negligence.  Respondents were awarded $33,350 in compensatory and punitive damages.  They also sought attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.  1988, in the amount of $ 245,456.25, based on 1,946.75 hours expended by their two attorneys at $125 per hour and 84.5 hours expended by law clerks at $25 per hour.  Finding both the hours and rates reasonable, the District Court awarded respondents the requested amount, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  This Court remanded for reconsideration in light of the intervening decision in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, and the District Court, after additional hearings and review of the matter, made extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, and again concluded that respondents were entitled to an award of the requested amount of attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals again affirmed, ruling, inter alia, that the fee award was not excessive merely because it exceeded the amount of damages awarded by the jury.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
763 F.2d 1580, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that:
1. Under Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra, which announced certain guidelines for calculating a ""reasonable"" attorney's fee under  1988, the ""lodestar"" figure, obtained by multiplying the number of hours reasonably 
Page 477 U. S. 562
 expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate, is presumed to be the reasonable fee contemplated by  1988, and an important factor, among others, for consideration in adjusting the lodestar figure upward or downward is the ""results obtained.""  Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee, and the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit.  The record here establishes that the District Court correctly applied the factors announced in Hensley, and did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney's fees for all time reasonably spent litigating the case.  Pp.  477 U. S. 567-573.
2. There is no merit to the argument that Hensley's lodestar approach is inappropriate in civil rights cases where a plaintiff recovers only monetary damages, and that, in such cases, fees in excess of the amount of damages recovered are necessarily unreasonable.  Although the amount of damages recovered is relevant to the amount of attorney's fees to be awarded under  1988, it is only one of many factors that a court should consider in calculating an award of attorney's fees.  Pp.  477 U. S. 573-580.
(a) A civil rights action for damages does not constitute merely a private tort suit benefiting only the individual plaintiffs whose rights were violated.  Unlike most private tort litigants, a civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate important civil and constitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms.  Because damages awards do not reflect fully the public benefit advanced by civil rights litigation, Congress did not intend for fees in civil rights cases, unlike most private law cases, to depend on obtaining substantial monetary relief, but instead recognized that reasonable attorney's fees under  1988 are not conditioned upon, and need not be proportionate to, an award of money damages.  Pp.  477 U. S. 574-576.
(b) A rule limiting attorney's fees in civil rights cases to a proportion of the damages awarded would seriously undermine Congress' purpose in enacting  1988.  Congress enacted  1988 specifically because it found that the private market for legal services failed to provide many victims of civil rights violations with effective access to the judicial process.  A rule of proportionality would make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals with meritorious civil rights claims but relatively small potential damages to obtain redress from the courts, and would be totally inconsistent with Congress' purpose of ensuring sufficiently vigorous enforcement of civil rights.  In order to ensure that lawyers would be willing to represent persons with legitimate civil rights grievances, Congress determined that it would be necessary to compensate lawyers for all time reasonably expended on a case.  Pp.  477 U. S. 576-580.
3. Although Congress did not intend that statutory fee awards produce ""windfalls"" to attorneys, neither did it intend that attorney's fees be proportionate to the amount of damages a civil rights plaintiff 
Page 477 U. S. 563
 might recover.  Rather, there already exists a wide range of safeguards that are designed to protect civil rights defendants against the possibility of excessive fee awards, and that adequately protect against the possibility that  1988 might produce a ""windfall"" to civil rights attorneys.  Pp.  477 U. S. 580-581.
JUSTICE POWELL concluded that the District Court's detailed findings concerning the fee award, which were accepted by the Court of Appeals, were not ""clearly erroneous"" for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in making the fee award.  JUSTICE POWELL also concluded that neither the decisions of this Court nor the legislative history of  1988 support a rule of proportionality between fees awarded and damages recovered in a civil rights case, and rejected the argument that the prevailing contingent fee rate charged by counsel in personal injury cases should be considered the reasonable fee for purposes of  1988.  Pp.  477 U. S. 581-586.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against handicapped persons in ""any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""  The United States provides financial assistance to airport operators through grants from a Trust Fund under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 and its successor statute, the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Trust Fund Acts).  The Government also operates a nationwide air traffic control system.  Respondent organizations representing handicapped individuals brought an action in the Court of Appeals challenging, inter alia, the conclusion of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) that its regulatory authority under  504 was limited to those few airlines that receive subsidies under the Federal Aviation Act.  The Court of Appeals held that  504 gave CAB jurisdiction over all air carriers by virtue of the extensive program of federal financial assistance to airports under the Trust Fund Acts, and that the air traffic control system was an additional source of financial assistance to airlines.  The court then vacated the regulations to the extent that their application was limited to carriers receiving funds under the Federal Aviation Act, and instructed the Department of Transportation, CAB's successor, to issue new regulations that would apply to all commercial airlines.
Held:  Section 504 is not applicable to commercial airlines.  Pp.  477 U. S. 603-612.
(a) Section 504's scope is limited to those who actually ""receive"" federal financial assistance.  Congress sought to impose  504 coverage as a condition or obligation tied to the recipient's agreement to accept the federal funds.  By so limiting coverage to recipients, Congress imposed  504's obligations upon those who are in a position to accept or reject those obligations as part of the decision whether or not to ""receive"" federal funds.  In this case, the only parties in that position are the airport operators who are the recipients of federal funds under the Trust Fund Acts.  Pp.  477 U. S. 603-606.
(b) To assert that the economic benefit to airlines from the aid to airports is a form of federal financial assistance ignores the distinction that 
Page 477 U. S. 598
 Congress made in  504 that the statute covers only those who receive the aid, and does not extend to those who benefit from it.  Pp.  477 U. S. 606-607.
(c) To tie  504's scope to economic benefit derived from the Trust Fund expenditures in question here would give  504 almost limitless coverage.  Congress recognized a need to improve airports in order to benefit a wide variety of persons and entities, all of them classified together as beneficiaries, and did not set up a system whereby passengers are the primary or direct beneficiaries and all others, including airlines, benefited by the Trust Fund Acts are indirect recipients of the financial assistance to airports.  Pp.  477 U. S. 608-610.
(d) The Court of Appeals' attempt to fuse airports and airlines into a single program or activity for purposes of  504 is unavailing.  Regulatory coverage tied to the scope of the intended beneficiaries of the Trust Fund Acts is inconsistent with congressional intent in passing  504.  Pp.  477 U. S. 610-611.
(e) Since the air traffic control system is ""owned and operated"" by the United States, it is not ""Federal financial assistance"" within the meaning of  504.  Rather, it is a federally conducted program that has many beneficiaries, but no recipients.  Pp.  477 U. S. 611-612.

(e) Since the air traffic control system is ""owned and operated"" by the United States, it is not ""Federal financial assistance"" within the meaning of  504.  Rather, it is a federally conducted program that has many beneficiaries, but no recipients.  Pp.  477 U. S. 611-612.

Syllabus 
Appellee Dayton Christian Schools, Inc. (Dayton), a private nonprofit corporation that provides elementary and secondary education, requires that its teachers subscribe to a particular set of religious beliefs, including belief in the internal resolution of disputes through the ""Biblical chain of command.""  As a contractual condition of employment, teachers must agree to present any grievance to their immediate supervisor, and to acquiesce in the final authority of Dayton's board of directors, rather than to pursue a remedy in civil court.  After a pregnant teacher was told that her employment contract would not be renewed because of Dayton's religious doctrine that mothers should stay home with their preschool age children, she contacted an attorney, who threatened Dayton with litigation under state and federal sex discrimination laws if it did not agree to rehire the teacher for the coming school year.  Dayton then rescinded its nonrenewal decision, but terminated the teacher because of her violation of the internal dispute resolution doctrine.  The teacher then filed a charge with appellant Ohio Civil Rights Commission, alleging that under Ohio statutes Dayton's original nonrenewal decision constituted unlawful sex discrimination and its termination decision unlawfully penalized her for asserting her rights.  Ultimately, the Commission initiated administrative proceedings against Dayton, which answered the complaint by asserting that the First Amendment prevented the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over it, since its actions had been taken pursuant to sincerely held religious beliefs.  While the administrative proceedings were pending, Dayton and others (also appellees here) filed this action in Federal District Court, seeking an injunction against the state administrative proceedings on the ground that any investigation of Dayton's hiring process or any imposition of sanctions for its nonrenewal or termination decisions would violate the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.  Without addressing the Commission's argument that the court should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction, the District Court refused to issue an injunction, holding, inter alia, that the Commission's proposed action would not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction would violate both

Held:
1. This Court has appellate jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C.  1264(2), which authorizes review of a court of appeals' decision holding a state statute unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case.  Here, the Court of Appeals expressly held that the Ohio statutory provisions relied on by the teacher, as applied to authorize the administrative proceedings, were repugnant to the Religion Clauses.  P.  477 U. S. 626.
2. The District Court should have abstained from adjudicating this case under Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and its progeny.  Younger, which held that a federal court should not enjoin a pending state criminal proceeding except when necessary to prevent great and immediate irreparable injury, was based on concerns for comity and federalism.  Such concerns are equally applicable to other types of state proceedings, including state administrative proceedings, judicial in nature, in which important state interests are vindicated, so long as, in the course of those proceedings, the federal plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to litigate his constitutional claim.  The elimination of prohibited sex discrimination is a sufficiently important state interest to bring the present case within the ambit of the Younger doctrine, and there is no reason to doubt that Dayton will receive an adequate opportunity to raise its constitutional claims.  Even assuming that Ohio law is such that the Commission may not consider the constitutionality of the statute under which it operates, it is sufficient that, under Ohio law, constitutional claims may be raised in state court judicial review of the administrative proceedings.

Syllabus 
Eligibility and benefit levels in the federal food stamp program are determined on a ""household,"" rather than an individual, basis.  The statutory definition of the term ""household,"" as amended in 1981 and 1982, generally treats parents, children, and siblings who live together as a single household, but does not treat more distant relatives, or groups of unrelated persons who live together, as a single household unless they also customarily purchase food and prepare meals together.  Appellees are families who generally buy their food and prepare their meals as separate economic units, and who will either lose benefits or have their food stamp allotment decreased as a result of the 1981 and 1982 amendments to the statute.  They filed actions that were consolidated in Federal District Court, claiming that the statutory distinction between parents, children, and siblings and all other groups of individuals violates the guarantee of equal treatment in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court, applying ""heightened scrutiny,"" invalidated the distinction.
Held:  The statutory distinction is not unconstitutional.  The District Court erred in judging its constitutionality under ""heightened scrutiny,"" since close relatives are not a ""suspect"" or ""quasi-suspect"" class.  The statutory distinction does not ""directly and substantially"" interfere with family living arrangements, and thereby burden a fundamental right.  Judged under the proper standard of review, Congress had a rational basis for making the distinction, since it could reasonably determine that close relatives sharing a home tend to purchase and prepare meals together, while distant relatives and unrelated individuals might not be so inclined.

Syllabus 
At respondent's bench trial in a New Jersey court resulting in his conviction of rape, a police officer testified that, a few hours after the rape, she accompanied the victim to respondent's apartment where the rape had occurred; that he was not there, but another tenant let them into respondent's apartment; and that the officer seized a sheet from respondent's bed.  At such point in the testimony, respondent's counsel sought to suppress introduction of the sheet and any testimony about it on the ground that the officer had seized it without a search warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment, but the judge ruled that counsel's suppression motion was late under the applicable New Jersey Court Rule.  The judge rejected counsel's attempt to justify his omission on the grounds that he had not heard of the seizure until the day before, when the trial began; that it was the State's obligation to inform him of its case, even though he made no pretrial request for discovery, which would have revealed the search and seizure; and that he had not expected to go to trial because he had been told that the victim did not wish to proceed.  Respondent retained new counsel after the trial and, on appeal, alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and error in the trial court's refusal to entertain the suppression motion during the trial.  The appellate court rejected the claims and affirmed respondent's conviction.  Thereafter, respondent unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief from the trial judge on the same grounds.  He then obtained habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which held, inter alia, that he had established his ineffective assistance claim.  The Court of Appeals concluded that Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 -- which held that federal courts should withhold habeas review where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim -- should not be extended to bar federal habeas consideration of Sixth Amendment claims based on counsel's alleged failure competently to litigate Fourth Amendment claims.  Reviewing the District Court's determination of ineffective assistance under the test established by the intervening decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 -- which held that, to establish ineffective assistance, the defendant must prove both incompetence of counsel and prejudice -- the Court of Appeals determined that 
Page 477 U. S. 366
 respondent's trial counsel had been ""grossly ineffective,"" but vacated and remanded for the District Court to consider whether, under the standards set forth in Strickland, respondent had been prejudiced by his attorney's incompetence.
Held:
1. The restriction on federal habeas review of Fourth Amendment claims announced in Stone v. Powell, supra, does not extend to Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims which are founded primarily on incompetent representation with respect to a Fourth Amendment issue.  Federal courts may grant habeas relief in appropriate cases, regardless of the nature of the underlying attorney error.  Pp.  477 U. S. 373-383.
(a) Respondent's Sixth Amendment claim is not in fact a Fourth Amendment claim directly controlled by Stone, as petitioners assert.  The two claims are distinct, both in nature and in the requisite elements of proof.  Pp.  477 U. S. 374-375.
(b) Nor are the rationale and purposes of Stone fully applicable to a Sixth Amendment claim that is based principally on defense counsel's failure to litigate a Fourth Amendment claim competently.  Stone held that the remedy for Fourth Amendment violations provided by the exclusionary rule is not a personal constitutional right, but instead is predominately a judicially created structural remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect; the rule has minimal utility in the context of federal collateral proceedings.  Here, respondent sought direct federal habeas protection of his fundamental personal right to effective assistance of counsel, and collateral review is frequently the only means through which an accused can effectuate that right.  Moreover, there is no merit to the contention that a defendant should not be allowed to vindicate through federal habeas review his right to effective assistance of counsel where counsel's primary error is failure to make a timely request for the exclusion of illegally seized evidence that is often the most probative information bearing on the defendant's guilt or innocence.  The right to counsel is not conditioned upon actual innocence.  Pp.  477 U. S. 375-380.
(c) Petitioners' prediction that every Fourth Amendment claim that fails in state court will be fully litigated in federal habeas proceedings in Sixth Amendment guise, and that, as a result, many state court judgments will be disturbed, is incorrect, because it ignores the rigorous standard which Strickland v. Washington, supra, erects for ineffective assistance claims.  Although a meritorious Fourth Amendment issue is necessary to the success of a Sixth Amendment claim like respondent's, a good Fourth Amendment claim alone will not earn a prisoner federal habeas relief.  Only those habeas petitioners who can prove under Strickland that they have been denied a fair trial by the gross incompetence 
Page 477 U. S. 367
 of their attorneys are entitled to the writ and to retrial without the challenged evidence.  Pp.  477 U. S. 380-382.
2. Respondent satisfied the incompetence prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Strickland, and the Court of Appeals did not err in remanding the case to the District Court for a determination of prejudice under Strickland's standard.  Pp.  477 U. S. 383-391.
(a) While the failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel, the record clearly reveals that respondent's attorney failed to file a timely suppression motion, not due to trial strategy considerations, but because he was unaware of the search, and of the State's intention to introduce the bedsheet into evidence, due to his failure to conduct any pretrial discovery.  Such failure here was not, as required under Strickland, reasonable and in accord with prevailing professional norms.  Pp.  477 U. S. 383-387.
(b) With respect to the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, there is no merit to petitioners' contention that a statement made by the trial judge at a post-trial hearing on respondent's motion for bail pending appeal constituted a finding that, even if the bedsheet had been excluded, he would have found respondent guilty, and that such finding was a subsidiary finding of historical fact that respondent was not prejudiced by his attorney's incompetence, entitled under 28 U.S.C.  2254(d) to a presumption of correctness in federal habeas proceedings.  The record here is not sufficiently complete to enable this Court to apply Strickland's prejudice prong directly to the facts of the case, and the remand to the District Court for redetermination of prejudice was proper.

Syllabus 
In 1974, petitioner was convicted of murder in a Florida state court and sentenced to death.  There is no suggestion that he was incompetent at the time of the offense, at trial, or at sentencing.  But subsequently he began to manifest changes in behavior, indicating a mental disorder.  This led to extensive separate examinations by two psychiatrists at his counsel's request, one of whom concluded that petitioner was not competent to suffer execution.  Counsel then invoked a Florida statute governing the determination of a condemned prisoner's competency.  Following the statutory procedures, the Governor appointed three psychiatrists, who together interviewed petitioner for 30 minutes in the presence of eight other people, including petitioner's counsel, the State's attorneys, and correctional officials.  The Governor's order directed that the attorneys should not participate in the examination in any adversarial manner.  Each psychiatrist filed a separate report with the Governor, to whom the statute delegates the final decision.  The reports reached conflicting diagnoses, but were in accord on the question of petitioner's competency.  Petitioner's counsel then attempted to submit to the Governor other written materials, including the reports of the two psychiatrists who had previously examined petitioner, but the Governor's office refused to inform counsel whether the submission would be considered.  The Governor subsequently signed a death warrant without explanation or statement.  After unsuccessfully seeking a hearing in state court to determine anew petitioner's competency, his counsel filed a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal District Court, seeking an evidentiary hearing, but the court denied the petition without a hearing, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the State from inflicting the death penalty upon a prisoner who is insane.  The reasons at common law for not condoning the execution of the insane -- that such an execution has questionable retributive value, presents no example to others, and thus has no deterrence value, and 
Page 477 U. S. 400
 simply offends humanity -- have no less logical, moral, and practical force at present.  Whether the aim is to protect the condemned from fear and pain without comfort of understanding, or to protect the dignity of society itself from the barbarity of exacting mindless vengeance, the restriction finds enforcement in the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.  477 U. S. 405-410.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Parts III, IV, and V, that Florida's statutory procedures for determining a condemned prisoner's sanity provide inadequate assurance of accuracy to satisfy the requirement of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, and that, having been denied a factfinding procedure ""adequate to afford a full and fair hearing"" on the critical issue, as required by 28 U.S.C.  2254(d)(2), petitioner is entitled to a de novo evidentiary hearing in the District Court on the question of his competence to be executed.  Pp.  477 U. S. 410-418.
(a) No state court has issued any determination to which the presumption of correctness under  2254(d) could attach, and indeed no state court played any role in the rejection of petitioner's claim of insanity.  P.  477 U. S. 410.
(b) The first defect in Florida's procedures is the failure to include the prisoner in the truth-seeking process.  Any procedure that precludes the prisoner or his counsel from presenting material relevant to his sanity or bars consideration of that material by the factfinder is necessarily inadequate.  A related flaw in the procedures is the denial of any opportunity to challenge or impeach the state-appointed psychiatrists' opinions, thus creating a significant possibility that the ultimate decision made in reliance on those experts will be distorted.  And perhaps the most striking defect in the procedures is the placement of the ultimate decision wholly within the Executive Branch.  The Governor, who appoints the experts and ultimately decides whether the State will be able to carry out the death sentence, and whose subordinates have been responsible for initiating every stage of the prosecution, cannot be said to have the neutrality that is necessary for reliability in the factfinding proceedings.  Pp.  477 U. S. 413-416.
JUSTICE POWELL concluded that the test for whether a prisoner is insane for Eighth Amendment purposes is whether the prisoner is aware of his impending execution and of the reason for it.  He further concluded that petitioner's claim falls within this definition, and that, because petitioner's claim was not adjudicated fairly within the meaning of due process or of 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), petitioner is entitled to have his claim adjudicated on remand by the District Court.  Finally, he concluded that the States could satisfy due process by providing an impartial officer or board that can receive evidence and argument from the prisoner's counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence.  Beyond these

Syllabus 
In 1974, petitioner was convicted of murder in a Florida state court and sentenced to death.  There is no suggestion that he was incompetent at the time of the offense, at trial, or at sentencing.  But subsequently he began to manifest changes in behavior, indicating a mental disorder.  This led to extensive separate examinations by two psychiatrists at his counsel's request, one of whom concluded that petitioner was not competent to suffer execution.  Counsel then invoked a Florida statute governing the determination of a condemned prisoner's competency.  Following the statutory procedures, the Governor appointed three psychiatrists, who together interviewed petitioner for 30 minutes in the presence of eight other people, including petitioner's counsel, the State's attorneys, and correctional officials.  The Governor's order directed that the attorneys should not participate in the examination in any adversarial manner.  Each psychiatrist filed a separate report with the Governor, to whom the statute delegates the final decision.  The reports reached conflicting diagnoses, but were in accord on the question of petitioner's competency.  Petitioner's counsel then attempted to submit to the Governor other written materials, including the reports of the two psychiatrists who had previously examined petitioner, but the Governor's office refused to inform counsel whether the submission would be considered.  The Governor subsequently signed a death warrant without explanation or statement.  After unsuccessfully seeking a hearing in state court to determine anew petitioner's competency, his counsel filed a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal District Court, seeking an evidentiary hearing, but the court denied the petition without a hearing, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Syllabus 
After his arraignment on charges arising from a 1970 robbery and murder in New York, respondent was confined in a cell with a prisoner, named Benny Lee, who had previously agreed to act as a police informant.  Respondent made incriminating statements, and Lee reported them to the police.  Prior to trial in a New York court, respondent moved to suppress the statements on the ground that they were obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding that Lee had obeyed a police officer's instructions only to listen to respondent for the purpose of identifying his confederates in the robbery and murder, but not to question respondent about the crimes.  The court also found that respondent's statements to Lee were ""spontaneous"" and ""unsolicited.""  In 1972, respondent was convicted of, and sentenced to imprisonment for, common law murder and felonious possession of a weapon, and the Appellate Division affirmed.  In 1973, respondent sought federal habeas corpus relief, asserting that his statements to Lee were obtained by police investigative methods that violated his Sixth Amendment rights.  The District Court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  After the 1980 decision in United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264 -- which applied the ""deliberately elicited"" test of Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, to suppress statements made to a paid jailhouse informant -- respondent unsuccessfully sought to have his conviction vacated by the state courts on the basis of his Sixth Amendment claim.  In 1982, respondent filed the instant habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, again asserting his Sixth Amendment claim.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  As an initial matter, the Court of Appeals concluded that, under Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, the ""ends of justice"" required consideration of this petition for habeas corpus, notwithstanding the adverse determination on the merits of respondent's Sixth Amendment claim in the earlier federal habeas corpus proceedings.  The court then held that, under Henry, respondent was entitled to relief. 
Page 477 U. S. 437

Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  742 F.2d 741, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IV, and V, concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent was entitled to relief under United States v. Henry, supra, which left open the question whether the Sixth Amendment forbids admission in evidence of an accused's statements to a jailhouse informant who was placed in close proximity but made no effort to stimulate conversations about the crime charged.  Pp.  477 U. S. 456-461.
(a) The primary concern of the Massiah and Henry line of decisions was secret interrogation by investigatory techniques that are the equivalent of direct police interrogation.  Since the Sixth Amendment is not violated whenever -- by luck or happenstance -- the State obtains incriminating statements from the accused after the right to counsel has attached, a defendant does not make out a violation of that right simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to the police.  Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks.  Pp.  477 U. S. 456-459.
(b) Under the circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeals' conclusion that respondent's right to counsel was violated because the police ""deliberately elicited"" incriminating statements was clear error in light of the provisions and intent of 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), which requires that the state trial court's factual findings be accorded a presumption of correctness.  Pp.  477 U. S. 459-461.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II and III, concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the ""ends of justice"" would be served by entertaining respondent's present ""successive"" petition for habeas corpus, and that the District Court and the Court of Appeals should have dismissed this successive petition under 28 U.S.C.  2244(b) on the ground that the prior judgment denying relief on respondent's identical Sixth Amendment claim was final.  Sanders v. United States derived its ""ends of justice"" test directly from language of the then-applicable statute, and left for another day the task of defining the considerations that properly support a decision to entertain a successive petition.  Although  2244(b) makes no reference to the ""ends of justice,"" that phrase still may be used generally to describe the standard for identifying those cases where successive review may be appropriate.  However, specific guidance should be given to the federal courts as to the kind of proof that a state prisoner must offer to establish that the ""ends of justice"" will be served by relitigation 
Page 477 U. S. 438
 of claims previously decided against him.  Balancing the State's interests in finality of convictions and the prisoner's interest in access to a forum compels the conclusion that the ""ends of justice"" are served by successive review only where the petitioner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence.  The prisoner must make his evidentiary showing even though -- as argued in this case -- the evidence of guilt may have been unlawfully admitted.  Here, the Court of Appeals conceded that the evidence of respondent's guilt ""was nearly overwhelming,"" and respondent's constitutional claim did not itself raise any question as to his guilt or innocence.  Pp.  477 U. S. 444-455.

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted by a jury in a Virginia state court of rape and abduction.  The trial judge denied respondent's counsel's pretrial motion to discover the victim's statements to police describing her assailants, their vehicle, and the location of the alleged rape.  Without consulting respondent, counsel filed a petition for appeal that failed to include any claim that the trial judge erred in not permitting counsel to examine the victim's statements, notwithstanding a Virginia Supreme Court Rule providing that only errors assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed, and that no error not so assigned will be admitted as a ground for reversal.  The Virginia Supreme Court refused the appeal, and this Court denied certiorari.  Thereafter, respondent filed a pro se state habeas corpus petition, claiming that he had been denied due process of law by the prosecution's withholding of the victim's statements.  The state court denied the petition on the ground that the claim was barred because respondent failed to raise it on appeal, and the Virginia Supreme Court denied certiorari.  Respondent then filed a pro se habeas petition in Federal District Court, which also held that the discovery claim was barred by procedural default.  On appeal, respondent disavowed any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but asserted that counsel had mistakenly omitted his discovery claim from the state petition for appeal, and that this error was cause for his default.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a federal habeas petitioner need only satisfy the district court that the procedural default resulted from his attorney's ignorance or inadvertence, rather than from a deliberate tactical decision.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded to the District Court to resolve the question of respondent's counsel's motivation for failing to appeal the discovery claim.
Held:  A federal habeas petitioner, such as respondent, cannot show cause for a procedural default by establishing that competent defense counsel's failure to raise a substantive claim of error was inadvertent, rather than deliberate.  Pp.  477 U. S. 485-497.
(a) The mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim, or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it, does not constitute cause for a procedural default.  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 
Page 477 U. S. 479
 107.  The question of cause for a procedural default does not turn on whether counsel erred or on the kind of error counsel may have made.  So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, there is no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.  Instead, the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.  While ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes cause for a procedural default, the exhaustion doctrine generally requires that an ineffective assistance claim be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.  Pp.  477 U. S. 485-490.
(b) There is no merit to respondent's argument that, even if counsel's ignorance or inadvertence does not constitute cause for a procedural default at trial, it does constitute cause for a procedural default on appeal.  A State's procedural rules serve vital purposes on appeal, as well as at trial and on state collateral attack, and the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default.  The frustration of the State's interests that occurs when an appellate procedural rule is broken is not significantly diminished when counsel's breach results from ignorance or inadvertence, rather than from a deliberate decision, tactical or not, to abstain from raising the claim.  Failure to raise a claim on appeal reduces the finality of appellate proceedings, deprives the appellate court of an opportunity to review trial error, and undercuts the State's ability to enforce its procedural rules.  As with procedural defaults at trial, these costs are imposed on the State regardless of the kind of attorney error that led to the procedural default.  Whatever may be the case where counsel has failed to take an appeal at all, counsel's failure to raise a particular claim on appeal is to be scrutinized under the cause and prejudice standard when that failure is treated as a procedural default by the state courts.  Attorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute cause for a procedural default, even when that default occurs on appeal, rather than at trial.  To the contrary, cause for a procedural default on appeal ordinarily requires a showing of some external impediment preventing counsel from constructing or raising the claim.  Pp.  477 U. S. 490-492.
(c) Adherence to the cause and prejudice test in the conjunctive will not prevent federal habeas corpus courts from ensuring the fundamental fairness that is the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.  That test is a sound and workable means of channeling the discretion of federal habeas courts.  However, in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional 
Page 477 U. S. 480
 violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ, even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.  Pp.  477 U. S. 492-497.
(d) Respondent has never alleged any external impediment that might have prevented counsel from raising his discovery claim in his state petition for review, and has disavowed any claim that counsel's performance on appeal was so deficient as to make out an ineffective assistance claim.  Accordingly, respondent's petition for federal habeas review of his procedurally defaulted discovery claim must be dismissed for failure to establish cause for the default, unless it is determined on remand that the victim's statements contain material that would establish respondent's actual innocence.  P.  477 U. S. 497.

On appeal, respondent disavowed any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but asserted that counsel had mistakenly omitted his discovery claim from the state petition for appeal, and that this error was cause for his default.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a federal habeas petitioner need only satisfy the district court that the procedural default resulted from his attorney's ignorance or inadvertence, rather than from a deliberate tactical decision.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded to the District Court to resolve the question of respondent's counsel's motivation for failing to appeal the discovery claim.
Held:  A federal habeas petitioner, such as respondent, cannot show cause for a procedural default by establishing that competent defense counsel's failure to raise a substantive claim of error was inadvertent, rather than deliberate.  Pp.  477 U. S. 485-497.
(a) The mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim, or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it, does not constitute cause for a procedural default.  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 
Page 477 U. S. 479
 107.  The question of cause for a procedural default does not turn on whether counsel erred or on the kind of error counsel may have made.  So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, there is no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.  Instead, the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.  While ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes cause for a procedural default, the exhaustion doctrine generally requires that an ineffective assistance claim be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.  Pp.  477 U. S. 485-490.
(b) There is no merit to respondent's argument that, even if counsel's ignorance or inadvertence does not constitute cause for a procedural default at trial, it does constitute cause for a procedural default on appeal.  A State's procedural rules serve vital purposes on appeal, as well as at trial and on state collateral attack, and the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default.  The frustration of the State's interests that occurs when an appellate procedural rule is broken is not significantly diminished when counsel's breach results from ignorance or inadvertence, rather than from a deliberate decision, tactical or not, to abstain from raising the claim.  Failure to raise a claim on appeal reduces the finality of appellate proceedings, deprives the appellate court of an opportunity to review trial error, and undercuts the State's ability to enforce its procedural rules.  As with procedural defaults at trial, these costs are imposed on the State regardless of the kind of attorney error that led to the procedural default.  Whatever may be the case where counsel has failed to take an appeal at all, counsel's failure to raise a particular claim on appeal is to be scrutinized under the cause and prejudice standard when that failure is treated as a procedural default by the state courts.  Attorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute cause for a procedural default, even when that default occurs on appeal, rather than at trial.  To the contrary, cause for a procedural default on appeal ordinarily requires a showing of some external impediment preventing counsel from constructing or raising the claim.  Pp.  477 U. S. 490-492.
(c) Adherence to the cause and prejudice test in the conjunctive will not prevent federal habeas corpus courts from ensuring the fundamental fairness that is the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.  That test is a sound and workable means of channeling the discretion of federal habeas courts.  However, in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional 
Page 477 U. S. 480
 violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ, even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.  Pp.  477 U. S. 492-497.
(d) Respondent has never alleged any external impediment that might have prevented counsel from raising his discovery claim in his state petition for review, and has disavowed any claim that counsel's performance on appeal was so deficient as to make out an ineffective assistance claim.  Accordingly, respondent's petition for federal habeas review of his procedurally defaulted discovery claim must be dismissed for failure to establish cause for the default, unless it is determined on remand that the victim's statements contain material that would establish respondent's actual innocence.  P.  477 U. S. 497.

Syllabus 
Prior to petitioner's trial in a Virginia state court for murder of a woman, he was examined by a psychiatrist appointed by the court at the request of his counsel.  During the examination, the psychiatrist asked petitioner both about the murder and prior incidents of deviant sexual conduct, and petitioner stated that he once tore the clothes off a girl on a school bus before deciding not to rape her.  Following a jury trial, petitioner was convicted.  At the sentencing phase, the prosecution called the psychiatrist to the stand, and, over the defense's objection, he described the incident on the school bus.  After further evidence was presented both for the prosecution and petitioner, the jury recommended the death sentence.  On appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia, petitioner raised a number of claims, but did not assign any error concerning the admission of the psychiatrist's testimony, his counsel later explaining at a postconviction hearing that he had decided not to pursue that claim after determining that Virginia case law would not support his position at the time.  The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, not addressing any issues concerning the prosecution's use of the psychiatric testimony because, under a rule of the court, only errors assigned by the appellant would be considered.  After exhausting state remedies, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which denied the petition.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner defaulted his underlying constitutional claim as to the admission of the psychiatrist's testimony by failing to press it before the Supreme Court of Virginia on direct appeal.  Murray v. Carrier, ante p.  477 U. S. 478.  Pp.  477 U. S. 533-539.
(a) Petitioner has not carried his burden of showing cause for his noncompliance with Virginia's rules of procedure.  A deliberate, tactical decision not to pursue a particular claim is the very antithesis of the kind of circumstance that would warrant excusing a defendant's failure to adhere to a State's rules for the fair and orderly disposition of its criminal cases.  Here, counsel's decision not to press the claim in question was not an error of such magnitude that it rendered his performance constitutionally deficient under the test of Strickland v. Washington, 466 
Page 477 U. S. 528
 U.S. 668.  Nor can petitioner rely on the novelty of the claim as ""cause"" for noncompliance with Virginia's rules, where it appears that various forms of such a claim had been percolating in the lower courts for years at the time of petitioner's original appeal.  Pp.  477 U. S. 533-537.
(b) It is clear on the record that application of the cause and prejudice test will not result in a ""fundamental miscarriage of justice,"" where the alleged constitutional error neither precluded the development of true facts nor resulted in the admission of false ones.  Thus, even assuming that, as a legal matter, the psychiatrist's testimony should not have been presented to the jury, its admission did not pervert the jury's deliberations concerning the ultimate question of whether, in fact, petitioner constituted a continuing threat to society.

In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, it was held that, in a libel suit brought by a public official (extended by later cases to public figures), the First Amendment requires the plaintiff to show that, in publishing the alleged defamatory statement, the defendant acted with actual malice.  It was further held that such actual malice must be shown with ""convincing clarity.""  Respondents, a nonprofit corporation described as a ""citizens' lobby"" and its founder, filed a libel action in Federal District Court against petitioners, alleging that certain statements in a magazine published by petitioners were false and derogatory.  Following discovery, petitioners moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, asserting that, because respondents were public figures, they were required to prove their case under the New York Times standards, and that summary judgment was proper because actual malice was absent as a matter of law in view of an affidavit by the author of the articles in question that they had been thoroughly researched and that the facts were obtained from numerous sources.  Opposing the motion, respondents claimed that an issue of actual malice was presented because the author had relied on patently unreliable sources in preparing the articles.  After holding that New York Times applied because respondents were limited-purpose public figures, the District Court entered summary judgment for petitioners on the ground that the author's investigation and research and his reliance on numerous sources precluded a finding of actual malice.  Reversing as to certain of the allegedly defamatory statements, the Court of Appeals held that the requirement that actual malice be proved by clear and convincing evidence need not be considered at the summary judgment stage, and that, with respect to those statements, summary judgment had been improperly granted, because a jury could reasonably have concluded that the allegations were defamatory, false, and made with actual malice.
Held:  The Court of Appeals did not apply the correct standard in reviewing the District Court's grant of summary judgment.  Pp.  477 U. S. 247-257.
(a) Summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is ""genuine,"" that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  At the summary judgment stage, the trial judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and 
Page 477 U. S. 243
 determine the truth of the matter, but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.  There is no such issue unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.  In essence, the inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury, or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.  Pp.  477 U. S. 247-252.
(b) A trial court ruling on a motion for summary judgment in a case such as this must be guided by the New York Times ""clear and convincing"" evidentiary standard in determining whether a genuine issue of actual malice exists, that is, whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury might find that actual malice had been shown with convincing clarity.  Pp.  477 U. S. 252-256.
(c) A plaintiff may not defeat a defendant's properly supported motion for summary judgment in a libel case such as this one without offering any concrete evidence from which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in his favor, and by merely asserting that the jury might disbelieve the defendant's denial of actual malice.  The movant has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of fact, but the plaintiff is not thereby relieved of his own burden of producing in turn evidence that would support a jury verdict.

Syllabus 
To supplement state unemployment insurance benefits, the Trade Act of 1974 (Act) provides federally funded trade readjustment allowance (TRA) benefits to workers laid off because of competition from imports.  As authorized by the Act, the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) has contracted out to state unemployment insurance agencies the job of making individual eligibility determinations for the benefits.  To qualify for benefits, a worker must have at least 26 weeks of employment in the 52 weeks immediately preceding his layoff.  In a 1975 policy handbook, the Secretary advised the state agencies that they should not count toward these 26 weeks leaves of absence, sick leaves, vacations, and military leaves.  These guidelines were superseded by a 1981 amendment to the Act that permits inclusion of such periods of nonservice in determining a worker's period of employment, but the amendment was limited to benefits payable for weeks of unemployment beginning after September 30, 1981.  Petitioner union and petitioner union members (some of whom had been denied benefits before October 1, 1981, because of the 1975 guidelines and some of whom were defending the award of benefits against appeals by their respective state agencies) filed an action in Federal District Court against the Secretary, claiming that his interpretation of the Act in the 1975 guidelines was incorrect, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court first rejected the Secretary's argument that the provision of the Act, 19 U.S.C.  231 1(d), that makes entitlement determinations reviewable only ""in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the applicable State law,"" precluded federal jurisdiction over the action.  On the merits, the court held that the 1975 guidelines were inconsistent with the Act, and granted the requested relief.  Without reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the union had no standing to bring the action.  As to the individual union member plaintiffs, who claim to have been denied benefits because of an improper construction of the Act, the court, relying on  2311(d)'s requirement, held that no relief could properly be awarded because the 
Page 477 U. S. 275
 plaintiffs had failed to join as party defendants the state agencies that had denied their claims.
Held:
1. Petitioner union has standing to litigate this action.  Pp.  477 U. S. 281-290.
(a) An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when (1) ""its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right""; (2) ""the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose""; and (3) ""neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.""  Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333,  432 U. S. 343.  All three of these conditions have been met in this case.  As to the first condition,  2311(d) does not preclude a union member or any other aggrieved claimant from challenging the 1976 guidelines.  The question is not whether there are any union members who might have circumvented any state administrative and judicial process in order to bring the claims that the union now seeks to litigate, but rather whether there are union members who have yet to receive either benefits they believe are due or a final state judgment that will preclude further consideration of their claims.  Such individuals would have the live interest in challenging the guidelines that would support standing in this case.  As to the second condition for associational standing, there is little question that the interests the union seeks to protect in this action are ""germane"" to its purpose of obtaining benefits, including unemployment benefits, for its members.  As to the third condition, although the unique facts of each union member's claim will have to be considered by the state authorities before the member can receive the claimed benefits, the union can litigate this action without those individual members' participation, and still ensure that the remedy, if granted, will benefit those members actually injured.  Pp.  477 U. S. 282-288.
(b) The principles of associational standing set out in Hunt, supra, are reaffirmed.  The Secretary's suggestion that members of an association who wish to litigate common questions of law or fact against the same defendant should be permitted to proceed only pursuant to the class action provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 fails to recognize the special features distinguishing suits by associations on behalf of their members from class actions.  While a class action creates an ad hoc union of injured plaintiffs who may be linked only by their common claims, an association suing to vindicate its members' interests can draw upon a preexisting reservoir of expertise and capital that can assist both courts and plaintiffs.  In addition, the doctrine of associational standing recognizes that the primary reason people join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that they share with 
Page 477 U. S. 276
 others.  Here, the Secretary has given no reason to doubt the union's ability to proceed on behalf of its aggrieved members.  Pp.  477 U. S. 288-290.
2. The action can be maintained without the joinder as defendants of the state agencies administering the TRA benefit program.  The action is not an appeal from an adverse benefit determination, removed to federal court, but is a challenge to federal guidelines that required that determination.  Just as  2311(d) cannot be read to bar federal jurisdiction over a challenge to the guidelines, that section does not demand that the state rules governing review of the entitlement decisions bind the federal court entertaining that challenge.  Under circumstances where the state agencies would be bound to comply with the relief ordered here, and are reimbursed by the Federal Government for TRA benefits they pay, the state agencies are not ""indispensable parties"" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b) whose absence from the action rendered the District Court unable to grant the relief sought.  Pp.  477 U. S. 290-293.
241 U.S.App.D.C. 106, 746 F.2d 839, reversed and remanded.

As to the first condition,  2311(d) does not preclude a union member or any other aggrieved claimant from challenging the 1976 guidelines.  The question is not whether there are any union members who might have circumvented any state administrative and judicial process in order to bring the claims that the union now seeks to litigate, but rather whether there are union members who have yet to receive either benefits they believe are due or a final state judgment that will preclude further consideration of their claims.  Such individuals would have the live interest in challenging the guidelines that would support standing in this case.  As to the second condition for associational standing, there is little question that the interests the union seeks to protect in this action are ""germane"" to its purpose of obtaining benefits, including unemployment benefits, for its members.  As to the third condition, although the unique facts of each union member's claim will have to be considered by the state authorities before the member can receive the claimed benefits, the union can litigate this action without those individual members' participation, and still ensure that the remedy, if granted, will benefit those members actually injured.  Pp.  477 U. S. 282-288.
(b) The principles of associational standing set out in Hunt, supra, are reaffirmed.  The Secretary's suggestion that members of an association who wish to litigate common questions of law or fact against the same defendant should be permitted to proceed only pursuant to the class action provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 fails to recognize the special features distinguishing suits by associations on behalf of their members from class actions.  While a class action creates an ad hoc union of injured plaintiffs who may be linked only by their common claims, an association suing to vindicate its members' interests can draw upon a preexisting reservoir of expertise and capital that can assist both courts and plaintiffs.  In addition, the doctrine of associational standing recognizes that the primary reason people join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that they share with 
Page 477 U. S. 276
 others.  Here, the Secretary has given no reason to doubt the union's ability to proceed on behalf of its aggrieved members.  Pp.  477 U. S. 288-290.
2. The action can be maintained without the joinder as defendants of the state agencies administering the TRA benefit program.  The action is not an appeal from an adverse benefit determination, removed to federal court, but is a challenge to federal guidelines that required that determination.  Just as  2311(d) cannot be read to bar federal jurisdiction over a challenge to the guidelines, that section does not demand that the state rules governing review of the entitlement decisions bind the federal court entertaining that challenge.  Under circumstances where the state agencies would be bound to comply with the relief ordered here, and are reimbursed by the Federal Government for TRA benefits they pay, the state agencies are not ""indispensable parties"" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b) whose absence from the action rendered the District Court unable to grant the relief sought.  Pp.  477 U. S. 290-293.

477 U.S. 299

Syllabus 
Respondent, a tenured teacher in the Memphis, Michigan, public schools, was suspended following parents' complaints about his teaching methods in a seventh-grade life science course that included the showing of allegedly sexually explicit pictures and films.  While respondent was later reinstated, he, before being reinstated, brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against petitioner School District, Board of Education, Board Members, school administrators, and parents, alleging that his suspension deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law and violated his First Amendment right to academic freedom.  He sought both compensatory and punitive damages.  The District Court instructed the jury on the standard elements of compensatory and punitive damages and also charged the jury that additional compensatory damages could be awarded based on the value or importance of the constitutional rights that were violated.  The jury found petitioners liable, awarding both compensatory and punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Damages based on the abstract ""value"" or ""importance"" of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory damages in  1983 cases.  Pp.  477 U. S. 304-313.
(a) The basic purpose of  1983 damages is ""to compensate persons for injuries that are caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights.""  Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247,  435 U. S. 254.  The instructions at issue cannot be squared with Carey, or with the principles of tort damages on which Carey and  1983 are grounded.  Damages measured by the jury's perception of the abstract ""importance"" of a constitutional right are not necessary to vindicate the constitutional rights that  1983 protects, and moreover are an unwieldy tool for ensuring compliance with the Constitution.  Pp.  477 U. S. 305-310.
(b) Since such damages are wholly divorced from any compensatory purpose, they cannot be justified as presumed damages, which are a substitute for ordinary compensatory damages, not a supplement for an award that fully compensates the alleged injury.  Pp.  477 U. S. 310-312.
(c) The erroneous instructions were not harmless error where the verdict did not specify how much of the compensatory damages was designed

Syllabus 
In September, 1980, respondent administratrix filed this wrongful death action in Federal District Court, alleging that her husband's death in 1979 resulted from his exposure to asbestos products manufactured or distributed by the defendants, who included petitioner corporation.  In September, 1981, petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that, during discovery, respondent failed to produce any evidence to support her allegation that the decedent had been exposed to petitioner's products.  In response, respondent produced documents tending to show such exposure, but petitioner argued that the documents were inadmissible hearsay, and thus could not be considered in opposition to the summary judgment motion.  In July, 1982, the court granted the motion because there was no showing of exposure to petitioner's products, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that summary judgment in petitioner's favor was precluded because of petitioner's failure to support its motion with evidence tending to negate such exposure, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) and the decision in Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' position is inconsistent with the standard for summary judgment set forth in Rule 56(c), which provides that summary judgment is proper
""if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.""
Pp.  477 U. S. 322-326.
(a) The plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.  In such a situation, there can be ""no genuine issue as to any material fact,"" since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.  The moving party is ""entitled to a judgment as a matter of law"" because the nonmoving party has failed to 
Page 477 U. S. 318
 make a sufficient showing on an essential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof.  Pp.  477 U. S. 322-323.
(b) There is no express or implied requirement in Rule 56 that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar materials negating the opponent's claim.  On the contrary, Rule 56(c), which refers to the affidavits, ""if any,"" suggests the absence of such a requirement, and Rules 56(a) and (b) provide that claimants and defending parties may move for summary judgment ""with or without supporting affidavits.""  Rule 56(e), which relates to the form and use of affidavits and other materials, does not require that the moving party's motion always be supported by affidavits to show initially the absence of a genuine issue for trial.  Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., supra, explained.  Pp.  477 U. S. 323-326.
(c) No serious claim can be made that respondent was ""railroaded"" by a premature motion for summary judgment, since the motion was not filed until one year after the action was commenced, and since the parties had conducted discovery.  Moreover, any potential problem with such premature motions can be adequately dealt with under Rule 56(f).  P.  477 U. S. 326.
2. The questions whether an adequate showing of exposure to petitioner's products was in fact made by respondent in opposition to the motion, and whether such a showing, if reduced to admissible evidence, would be sufficient to carry respondent's burden of proof at trial, should be determined by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.

Syllabus 
Appellant submitted a proposal to the Yolo County Planning Commission to subdivide certain property into 159 single-family and multifamily residential lots.  The Commission rejected the proposal, and the County Board of Supervisors affirmed on the grounds that the proposal failed to provide adequate public street access, sewer services, water supplies, and police protection.  Appellant then filed an action in California Superior Court, alleging that appellee county and city restricted the property in question to agricultural use by denying all subdivision applications, and thereby appropriated the ""entire economic use"" of the property for the sole purpose of providing a public, open-space buffer.  Appellant sought declaratory and monetary relief.  The court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, holding that appellant's factual allegations were insufficient and that monetary damages for inverse condemnation were foreclosed by Agins v.

No. 85-599
Argued April 28, 1986
Decided June 23, 1986
477 U.S. 105

Syllabus 
Respondent American Bar Endowment (ABE), a tax exempt organization, raises money for its charitable work by providing group life, health, accident, and disability insurance policies, underwritten by insurance companies, to its members.  Because the members have favorable mortality and morbidity rates, experience rating results in substantially lower insurance costs than if the insurance were purchased individually.  Since the insurance companies' costs of providing insurance to the group are uniformly lower than the annual premiums paid, the companies pay refunds of the excess (""dividends"") to ABE that are used for its charitable purposes.  Critical to ABE's fundraising efforts is the fact that it requires its members to assign it all dividends as a condition for participating in the insurance program.  ABE advises its insured members that each member's share of the dividends, less ABE's administrative costs, constitutes a tax-deductible contribution.  In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advised ABE that it considered ABE's insurance plan an ""unrelated trade or business,"" and that hence the profits thereon were subject to income tax under  511-513 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, the IRS assessed a tax deficiency on ABE's net revenues from the insurance program for 1979 and 1980.  ABE paid these taxes, as well as taxes on its 1981 revenues, and, after exhausting administrative remedies, brought an action for a refund in the Claims Court, as did the individual respondent ABE members who claimed that they were entitled to charitable deductions for part of the insurance premiums they paid.  The suits were consolidated, and the Claims Court entered judgment for ABE, but found for the Government on the individual respondents' claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to ABE's taxes, but reversed as to the individual respondents and remanded for further factfinding.
Held:
1. ABE's insurance program, as constituting both ""the sale of goods"" and ""the performance of services,"" is a ""trade or business"" for purposes of the unrelated business income tax.  This case presents an example of precisely the sort of unfair competition between tax exempt organizations and taxable businesses that Congress intended to prevent by providing 
Page 477 U. S. 106
 for the unrelated business income tax.  The undisputed facts do not support the inference that the dividends ABE receives are charitable contributions from its members, rather than profits from its insurance program.  Pp.  477 U. S. 109-116.
2. The individual respondent taxpayers have not established that any portion of their premium payments to ABA constitutes a charitable contribution.  To be entitled to a deduction for a charitable contribution where he has made a payment having the ""dual character"" of a purchase and a contribution, a taxpayer must at a minimum demonstrate that he purposely contributed money or property in excess of the value of any benefit he received in return.  Here, the most logical test of the value of the insurance policies the individual respondents received is the cost of similar policies.  None of these respondents have demonstrated that they could have purchased similar policies for a lower cost.  Pp.  477 U. S. 116-118.

To be entitled to a deduction for a charitable contribution where he has made a payment having the ""dual character"" of a purchase and a contribution, a taxpayer must at a minimum demonstrate that he purposely contributed money or property in excess of the value of any benefit he received in return.  Here, the most logical test of the value of the insurance policies the individual respondents received is the cost of similar policies.  None of these respondents have demonstrated that they could have purchased similar policies for a lower cost.  Pp.  477 U. S. 116-118.

Syllabus 
Appellee bait dealer (appellee) arranged to have live baitfish imported into Maine, despite a Maine statute prohibiting such importation.  He was indicted under a federal statute making it a federal crime to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law.  He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the Maine statute unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce, and Maine intervened to defend the validity of its statute.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to dismiss and held the state statute constitutional.  The court found that substantial uncertainties surrounded the effects that baitfish parasites and nonnative species would have on the State's wild fish population, and that less discriminatory means of protecting against those threats were currently unavailable.  Appellee then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the District Court's constitutional ruling.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the state statute was unconstitutional.
Held:
1. Maine is entitled to invoke this Court's jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2).  Nothing in the language or history of  1254(2) suggests that its scope is limited to civil litigation.  The fact that Maine was only an intervenor in the District Court does not deprive it of standing to pursue this appeal, because its stake in the outcome is substantial and the controversy remains live, notwithstanding the Federal Government's decision to abandon its own appeal.  Pp.  477 U. S. 133-137.
2. The Maine statute is constitutional.  The federal statute under which appellee was convicted did not waive the requirement of Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, that where a state statute, such as Maine's import ban, discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect, the State must show both that the statute serves a legitimate local purpose, and that this purpose cannot be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means.  But the evidence amply supports the District Court's findings that Maine has made both showings.  Under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of review applicable to these findings, the Court of Appeals erred in setting them aside.  Pp.  477 U. S. 137-152.

Syllabus 
The Medicaid program of the Social Security Act (Act) provides medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary care and services.  States participating in the program must provide coverage to the ""categorically needy,"" that is, persons eligible for cash assistance under either the Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (SSI) program or the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program.  A participating State also may elect to provide Medicaid benefits to the ""medically needy,"" that is, persons who meet the nonfinancial eligibility requirements for cash assistance under AFDC or SSI, but whose income or resources exceed the financial eligibility standards for those programs.  Under 42 U.S.C.  1396a(a)(17), the medically needy may qualify for Medicaid benefits if they incur medical expenses, i.e., ""spend down,"" in an amount that reduces their income to the eligibility level.  That section provides that a State is to take into account, ""except to the extent prescribed by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services], the costs . . . incurred for medical care,"" and must determine eligibility under standards that are ""reasonable"" and ""comparable for all groups.""  Pursuant to  1396a(a)(17), the Secretary issued a regulation permitting States to employ a maximum spenddown period of six months to compute income of the medically needy.  Under  1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III), a state Medicaid plan must prescribe
""the single standard to be employed in determining income and resource eligibility for all such groups, and the methodology to be employed in determining such eligibility which shall be the same methodology which would be employed under [AFDC or SSI].""
Under the Massachusetts Medicaid plan, persons who lack sufficient income measured on a monthly basis to meet their basic needs automatically qualify for Medicaid.  Massachusetts also provides Medicaid benefits to persons who earn enough to meet their basic needs, but whose medical expenses within a 6-month period consume the amount by which their earnings exceed what is required for basic needs.  The Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare denied respondents Medicaid benefits because their income exceeded the Medicaid eligibility limit, and they incurred insufficient medical expenses within a 6-month period. 
Page 477 U. S. 155
  After the denial was upheld on administrative review, respondents sought injunctive relief from the Massachusetts Superior Court against use of the 6-month spenddown period.  That court held the period invalid, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court agreed, holding that, in providing that the ""same methodology"" be used for both the categorically needy and the medically needy, the Act requires that a l-month period be applied in eligibility calculations for the medically needy.
Held:  Massachussets' 6-month spenddown period for calculating the income of the medically needy does not violate the Act's ""same methodology"" requirement.  Pp.  477 U. S. 161-167.
(a) The Secretary's regulation permitting States to employ a maximum spenddown period of six months plainly permits what Massachusetts has done.  Because that regulation is supported by the Act's plain language and was adopted pursuant to the Act's explicit grant of rulemaking authority, it is entitled to ""legislative effect,"" and is controlling unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the Act.  Pp.  477 U. S. 161-162.
(b) The history of the ""same methodology"" requirement demonstrates that it was never intended to control the length of the spenddown, but rather simply to instruct States to treat components of income similarly for both medically needy and categorically needy persons.  Pp.  477 U. S. 162-166.

Syllabus 
After a jury trial in a Florida court, petitioner was found guilty of murder, robbery, and assault with intent to kill.  Pursuant to Florida's capital sentencing statute, the same jury heard further testimony and argument, and made a nonbinding recommendation that the death penalty be imposed.  The trial judge followed that recommendation, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, rejecting petitioner's contention that the prosecution's closing argument during the guilt phase of the trial rendered the trial fundamentally unfair and deprived the sentencing determination of the reliability required by the Eighth Amendment.  The court also rejected petitioner's contention that the trial court erred in excluding a member of the venire for cause on the basis of his affirmative response to the judge's question during voir dire
""Do you have any moral or religious, conscientious moral or religious principles in opposition to the death penalty so strong that you would be unable without violating your own principles to vote to recommend a death penalty regardless of the facts?""
In subsequent federal habeas corpus proceedings, petitioner raised the same claims, as well as the additional claim that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial.  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed the District Court's judgment in all of its aspects.
Held:
The record of the jury voir dire, viewed in its entirety, shows that the trial court's decision to exclude the juror involved here was proper.  Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, held that the proper test is whether a juror's views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.  Petitioner's argument on this issue rested solely on the wording of the question (quoted above) that the trial court asked the juror before excluding him.  However, a proper determination of the issue requires examination of the context surrounding the juror's exclusion.  The record shows that, prior to individual questioning, the trial court told the entire venire that they would be questioned on this point, and that the juror in question was present while the court repeatedly 
Page 477 U. S. 169
 stated the correct standard when questioning other individual members of the panel.  Pp.  477 U. S. 175-178.
2. The record also supports the rejection of petitioner's contention as to the prosecution's closing argument.  The prosecution's argument included improper remarks that indicated that petitioner was on weekend furlough from an earlier prison sentence when the crime involved here occurred; implied that the death penalty would be the only guarantee against a future similar act; referred to petitioner as an ""animal""; and reflected an emotional reaction to the case.  However, the relevant question is whether the comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.  Viewed under this standard, the prosecution's comments did not deprive petitioner of a fair trial.  The comments did not manipulate or misstate the evidence, or implicate other specific rights of the accused, and much of their objectionable content was responsive to the opening summation of the defense (available under a state procedural rule).  Moreover, defense counsel were able to use their final rebuttal argument to turn much of the prosecution's closing argument against it.  Pp.  477 U. S. 178-183.
3. With respect to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of the trial, petitioner failed to satisfy the first part of the two-part test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, that his trial counsels' performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  There is no merit to petitioner's contention that trial counsel devoted only the time between the close of the guilt phase of trial and the start of the penalty phase -- approximately one-half hour -- to prepare the case in mitigation.  The record indicates that a great deal of time and effort went into the defense of this case; a significant portion of that time was devoted to preparation for sentencing.  Moreover, a defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action of counsel might be considered sound trial strategy.  Petitioner did not overcome that presumption here.  The record shows several reasons why counsel reasonably could have chosen to rely on a simple plea for mercy from petitioner himself, rather than to attempt to introduce mitigating evidence.   477 U. S.  184-187.

477 U.S. 207

Syllabus 
Respondents' husbands were killed when petitioner Air Logistic's helicopter crashed in the high seas 35 miles off the Louisiana coast while transporting the decedents from the offshore drilling platform where they worked to Louisiana.  Respondents each filed a wrongful death action (later consolidated) in Federal District Court, raising claims under the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), and Louisiana law.  Ruling that DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy for death on the high seas, the District Court dismissed respondents' claims based on the Louisiana wrongful death statute.  Petitioner Air Logistics having admitted liability, the trial was limited to the question of damages.  Because DOHSA limits recovery to ""fair and just compensation for . . . pecuniary loss,"" the court's awards to respondents did not include damages for nonpecuniary losses.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of nonpecuniary benefits recoverable under the Louisiana wrongful death statute, holding that state law could apply of its own force by virtue of  7 of DOHSA, which provides that ""[t]he provisions of any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected"" by the Act.  The court concluded, on the basis of  7's legislative history, that the section was intended to preserve the applicability of state wrongful death statutes on the high seas, and that Louisiana had legislative jurisdiction to extend its wrongful death statute to remedy deaths on the high seas, and in fact had intended its statute to have that effect.
Held:  Neither OCSLA nor DOHSA requires or permits the application of the Louisiana wrongful death statute in this case so as to entitle respondents to recover nonpecuniary damages under that statute.  Pp.  477 U. S. 217-233.
(a) Because the fatalities in question did not arise from an accident in the area covered by OCSLA, i.e., ""the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures"" erected thereon, but rather occurred on the high seas, DOHSA, which provides a maritime remedy for wrongful deaths ""occurring on the high seas"" plainly was intended to control.  The character of the decedents as platform workers who had a special relationship with the shore community 
Page 477 U. S. 208
 has no relevance to the resolution of the question of the application of OCSLA to this case.  Pp.  477 U. S. 217-220.
(b) The language of  7 of DOHSA and its legislative history, as well as the congressional purposes underlying DOHSA, mandate that  7 be read not as an endorsement of the application of state wrongful death statutes to the high seas, but rather as a jurisdictional saving clause ensuring that state courts have the right to entertain causes of action and provide wrongful death remedies both for accidents occurring on state territorial waters and, under DOHSA, for accidents occurring on the high seas.  Viewed in this light,  7 serves not to destroy the uniformity of wrongful death remedies on the high seas, but to facilitate the efficient and just administration of those remedies.  Pp.  477 U. S. 220-232.
(c) Once it is determined that  7 does not sanction the applicability of state wrongful death statutes to accidents on the high seas, it must be concluded that state wrongful death statutes are preempted by DOHSA where it applies.   Pp.  477 U. S. 232-233.

 has no relevance to the resolution of the question of the application of OCSLA to this case.  Pp.  477 U. S. 217-220.
(b) The language of  7 of DOHSA and its legislative history, as well as the congressional purposes underlying DOHSA, mandate that  7 be read not as an endorsement of the application of state wrongful death statutes to the high seas, but rather as a jurisdictional saving clause ensuring that state courts have the right to entertain causes of action and provide wrongful death remedies both for accidents occurring on state territorial waters and, under DOHSA, for accidents occurring on the high seas.  Viewed in this light,  7 serves not to destroy the uniformity of wrongful death remedies on the high seas, but to facilitate the efficient and just administration of those remedies.  Pp.  477 U. S. 220-232.
(c) Once it is determined that  7 does not sanction the applicability of state wrongful death statutes to accidents on the high seas, it must be concluded that state wrongful death statutes are preempted by DOHSA where it applies.   Pp.  477 U. S. 232-233.

No. 85-521
Argued April 28, 1986
Decided June 19, 1986
477 U.S. 41

Syllabus 
In 1950, Congress amended the Social Security Act to authorize voluntary participation by States in the Social Security System with respect to old age, disability, and death benefits.  Under 42 U.S.C.  418(a) (1982 ed. and Supp. II), States may obtain coverage for employees of the State and its political subdivisions by executing an agreement ( 418 Agreement) with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) that is required to be ""not inconsistent with the provisions of""  418.  As originally enacted,  418(g) permitted States to terminate their  418 Agreements upon giving at least two years' advance notice in writing to the Secretary.  However, because the increasing rate of state withdrawals was threatening the integrity of the System, Congress amended  418(g) in 1983 to provide that no  418 Agreement ""may be terminated, either in its entirety or with respect to any coverage group, on or after April 20, 1983.""  The amendment expressly prevents States from withdrawing employees from the System even if a termination notice had been filed prior to the amendment's enactment.  In 1951, California and the Secretary entered into a  418 Agreement that covered employees of the State and its political subdivisions.  The Agreement recited that its provisions were ""in conformity with""  418, and included a termination clause mirroring the provisions of  418(g) then in effect.  When the 1983 amendment of  418(g) prevented termination notices that California previously had filed from taking effect, proceedings were instituted in the Federal District Court attacking the validity of amended  418(g).  The court held that  418(g) was unconstitutional, reasoning that the  418 Agreement created a ""contractual right"" in favor of the State and its subdivisions to withdraw from the Social Security System, and that such right constituted ""private property"" within the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Although the court concluded that amended  418(g) effected a taking of that property without providing the requisite just compensation, it held that a damages award would be contrary to Congress' will, and accordingly simply declared  418(g) unconstitutional. 
Page 477 U. S. 42

Held:  Amended  418(g) does not effect a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  477 U. S. 51-56.
(a) In enacting the Social Security Act in 1935, Congress anticipated the need to respond to changing conditions, and therefore included  1304, which expressly reserves to it ""[t]he right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision"" of the Act.  The Act itself, including the original version of  418(g), created no contractual rights, and therefore Congress had the power to amend that section.  In view of the Act's purpose and structure, and of Congress' express reservation of authority to alter its provisions, courts should be extremely reluctant to construe  418 Agreements in a manner that forecloses Congress' exercise of that authority.  Pp.  477 U. S. 61-53.
(b) The conclusion that Congress reserved the authority to amend not only  418 but also  418 Agreements entered into ""in conformity with""  418 is supported by precedent.  Cf. Sinking-Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700; National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 470 U. S. 451.  The language of  1304's reservation expressly notified California that Congress retained the power to amend the law under which the Agreement was executed and, by amending that law, to alter the Agreement itself.  Pp.  477 U. S. 53-54.
(c) The ""contractual right"" at issue in this case bears little, if any, resemblance to rights held to constitute ""property"" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  The termination provision in the  418 Agreement exactly tracked the language of the statute, conferring no right on California beyond that contained in  418 itself.  The termination provision in California's  418 Agreement did not rise to the level of ""property,"" and thus amended  418 did not effect a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  477 U. S. 54-56.

Syllabus 
Respondent former employee of petitioner bank brought an action against the bank and her supervisor at the bank, claiming that, during her employment at the bank, she had been subjected to sexual harassment by the supervisor in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and seeking injunctive relief and damages.  At the trial, the parties presented conflicting testimony about the existence of a sexual relationship between respondent and the supervisor.  The District Court denied relief without resolving the conflicting testimony, holding that, if respondent and the supervisor did have a sexual relationship, it was voluntary, and had nothing to do with her continued employment at the bank, and that therefore respondent was not the victim of sexual harassment.  The court then went on to hold that, since the bank was without notice, it could not be held liable for the supervisor's alleged sexual harassment.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Noting that a violation of Title VII may be predicated on either of two types of sexual harassment -- (1) harassment that involves the conditioning of employment benefits on sexual favors, and (2) harassment that, while not affecting economic benefits, creates a hostile or offensive working environment -- the Court of Appeals held that, since the grievance here was of the second type, and the District Court had not considered whether a violation of this type had occurred, a remand was necessary.  The court further held that the need for a remand was not obviated by the fact that the District Court had found that any sexual relationship between respondent and the supervisor was a voluntary one, a finding that might have been based on testimony about respondent's ""dress and personal fantasies"" that ""had no place in the litigation.""  As to the bank's liability, the Court of Appeals held that an employer is absolutely liable for sexual harassment by supervisory personnel, whether or not the employer knew or should have known about it.
Held:
1. A claim of ""hostile environment"" sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that is actionable under Title VII.  Pp.  477 U. S. 63-69.
(a) The language of Title VII is not limited to ""economic"" or ""tangible"" discrimination.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines fully support the view that sexual harassment leading to non-economic 
Page 477 U. S. 58
 injury can violate Title VII.  Here, respondent's allegations were sufficient to state a claim for ""hostile environment"" sexual harassment.  Pp.  477 U. S. 63-67.
(b) The District Court's findings were insufficient to dispose of respondent's ""hostile environment"" claim.  The District Court apparently erroneously believed that a sexual harassment claim will not lie absent an economic effect on the complainant's employment, and erroneously focused on the ""voluntariness"" of respondent's participation in the claimed sexual episodes.  The correct inquiry is whether respondent by her conduct indicated that the alleged sexual advances were unwelcome, not whether her participation in them was voluntary.  Pp.  477 U. S. 67-68.
(c) The District Court did not err in admitting evidence of respondent's sexually provocative speech and dress.  While ""voluntariness"" in the sense of consent is no defense to a sexual harassment claim, it does not follow that such evidence is irrelevant as a matter of law in determining whether the complainant found particular sexual advances unwelcome.  Pp.  477 U. S. 68-69.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that employers are always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors.  While common law agency principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII, Congress' decision to define ""employer"" to include any ""agent"" of an employer evinces an intent to place some limits on the acts of employees for which employers under Title VII are to be held responsible.  In this case, however, the mere existence of a grievance procedure in the bank and the bank's policy against discrimination, coupled with respondent's failure to invoke that procedure, do not necessarily insulate the bank from liability.

Argued March 4, 1986

477 U.S. 79

Syllabus 
Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act (Act) provides that anyone convicted of certain enumerated felonies is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment if the sentencing judge -- upon considering the evidence introduced at the trial and any additional evidence offered by either the defendant or the Commonwealth at the sentencing hearing -- finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant ""visibly possessed a firearm"" during the commission of the offense.  The Act, which also provides that visible possession shall not be an element of the crime, operates to divest the judge of discretion to impose any sentence of less than five years for the underlying felony, but does not authorize a sentence in excess of that otherwise allowed for the offense.  Each of the petitioners was convicted of one of the Act's enumerated felonies, and in each case the Commonwealth gave notice that at sentencing it would seek to proceed under the Act.  However, each of the sentencing judges found the Act unconstitutional and imposed a lesser sentence than that required by the Act.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court consolidated the Commonwealth's appeals, vacated petitioners' sentences, and remanded for sentencing pursuant to the Act.  The court held that the Act was consistent with due process, rejecting petitioners' principal argument that visible possession of a firearm was an element of the crimes for which they were sentenced, and thus must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, and Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684.
Held:
1. A State may properly treat visible possession of a firearm as a sentencing consideration rather than an element of a particular offense that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  This case is controlled by Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, which rejected a claim that, whenever a State links the ""severity of punishment"" to the ""presence or absence of an identified fact"" the State must prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.  While there are constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard, the applicability of the reasonable doubt standard is usually dependent on how a State defines the offense that is charged in any given case.  Here, the Pennsylvania Legislature has made visible possession of a firearm a sentencing factor that comes into play only after the defendant has been found guilty of one of the 
Page 477 U. S. 80
 enumerated crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, and the constitutional limits to a State's power are not exceeded by the Act, which only raises the minimum sentence that may be imposed and neither alters the maximum sentence nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty.  Specht v. Patterson, 386 U. S. 605, distinguished.  Pp.  447 U. S. 84-91.
2. There is no merit to petitioners' contention that, even though States may treat visible possession of a firearm as a sentencing consideration, rather than an element of a particular offense, due process nonetheless requires that visible possession be proved by at least clear and convincing evidence.  The preponderance standard satisfies due process.  Sentencing courts have traditionally heard evidence and found facts without any prescribed burden of proof at all.  Nothing in Pennsylvania's scheme warrants constitutionalizing burdens of proof at sentencing.  Pp.  477 U. S. 91-93.
3. Nor is there merit to petitioners' claim that the Act denies them their Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury.  There is no Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing, even where the sentence turns on specific findings of fact.  P.  477 U. S. 93.

No. 84-902
Argued March 31, 1986

477 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
During the time period in question, Florida law imposed a tax on all aviation fuel sold within the State to airlines regardless of whether the fuel was used to fly within or without the State, or whether the airline engaged in a substantial or a nominal amount of business within the State.  Shortly after the law was enacted, appellant, a Canadian airline that operates charter flights to and from the United States, filed a state court action attacking the law's validity insofar as it authorized assessment of a tax on fuel used by foreign airlines exclusively in foreign commerce.  Granting injunctive relief, the trial court held that an agreement between Canada and the United States expressed a ""federal policy"" to exempt foreign airlines from fuel taxes and precluded individual States from acting in such area.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed in part, holding that the agreement did not preempt state sales taxes, and that the Florida tax was not invalid under the Foreign Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Held:
1. The Federal Aviation Act does not occupy the field of international aviation, and thus does not preempt all state regulation.  Where a federal statute does not expressly declare that state law is preempted, and where there is no actual conflict between what federal and state law prescribe, there must be evidence of a congressional intent to preempt the specific field covered by the state law.  In the present case, not only is there no indication that Congress wished to preclude state sales taxation 
Page 477 U. S. 2
 of airline fuel, but, to the contrary, the Federal Aviation Act expressly permits States to impose such taxes.   477 U. S.  5-7.
2. The Florida tax does not violate the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause on the ground that the tax threatens the ability of the Federal Government to speak with one voice with respect to the asserted federal policy of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, and supplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic.  The evidence relied upon for such contention fails to reveal any such federal policy.

			"|"Wardair Canada v. Florida Department of Revenue
No. 84-902
Argued March 31, 1986
Decided June 18, 1986
477 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
During the time period in question, Florida law imposed a tax on all aviation fuel sold within the State to airlines regardless of whether the fuel was used to fly within or without the State, or whether the airline engaged in a substantial or a nominal amount of business within the State.  Shortly after the law was enacted, appellant, a Canadian airline that operates charter flights to and from the United States, filed a state court action attacking the law's validity insofar as it authorized assessment of a tax on fuel used by foreign airlines exclusively in foreign commerce.  Granting injunctive relief, the trial court held that an agreement between Canada and the United States expressed a ""federal policy"" to exempt foreign airlines from fuel taxes and precluded individual States from acting in such area.  The Florida Supreme Court reversed in part, holding that the agreement did not preempt state sales taxes, and that the Florida tax was not invalid under the Foreign Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Held:
1. The Federal Aviation Act does not occupy the field of international aviation, and thus does not preempt all state regulation.  Where a federal statute does not expressly declare that state law is preempted, and where there is no actual conflict between what federal and state law prescribe, there must be evidence of a congressional intent to preempt the specific field covered by the state law.  In the present case, not only is there no indication that Congress wished to preclude state sales taxation 
Page 477 U. S. 2
 of airline fuel, but, to the contrary, the Federal Aviation Act expressly permits States to impose such taxes.   477 U. S.  5-7.
2. The Florida tax does not violate the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause on the ground that the tax threatens the ability of the Federal Government to speak with one voice with respect to the asserted federal policy of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, and supplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic.  The evidence relied upon for such contention fails to reveal any such federal policy.  Moreover, the evidence shows the absence of the sort of federal governmental silence that triggers dormant Commerce Clause analysis.  The numerous international documents cited, including the agreement referred to in the courts below, show that, while there appears to be an international aspiration on the one hand to eliminate all impediments to foreign air travel -- including taxation of fuel -- the law as it presently stands acquiesces in taxation of the sale of that fuel by political subdivisions of countries.

Decided June 18, 1986
477 U.S. 21

Syllabus 
Petitioners instituted diversity libel actions on May 9, 1983, by filing their respective complaints in the Federal District Court for the District of New Jersey. Each complaint alleged that the plaintiff was libeled in a story that appeared in the May 31, 1982, issue of Fortune magazine, and described Fortune as ""a foreign corporation having its principal offices at Time and Life Building"" in New York City.  On May 20, the complaints were mailed to Time's registered agent in New Jersey, who received them on May 23 but refused service because Time was not named as a defendant.  On July 19, 1983, each petitioner amended his complaint to name as the captioned defendant, and to refer in the body of the complaint to, ""Fortune, also known as Time, Incorporated.""  The amended complaints were served on Time by certified mail on July 21.  The District Court dismissed the complaints under the New Jersey statute of limitations, which requires a libel action to be commenced within one year of the publication of the alleged libel.  The court held that, although the amended complaints adequately named Time as a defendant, the amendments did not relate back, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), to the filing of the original complaints because it had not been shown that Time received notice of the institution of the actions within the period provided by New Jersey law.  On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The actions were properly dismissed.  Pp.  477 U. S. 27-32.
(a) Even if this Court adopted the ""identity-of-interest"" exception under which an amendment that substitutes a related party in a complaint after the limitations period has expired will relate back to the date the original complaint was filed, the facts of this case do not fall within that exception.  Neither Fortune nor Time received notice of the filing until after the limitations period had run, and thus there was not proper notice to Fortune that could be imputed to Time.  Pp.  477 U. S. 27-29.
(b) The July, 1983, amendments to the complaints did not relate back to the May 9 filing.  Under Rule 15(c), relation back is dependent upon four factors, all of which must be satisfied.  Notice to Time and the necessary knowledge did not come into being ""within the period provided by law for commencing an action against"" Time as required by Rule 15(c).

Syllabus 
The New York Constitution and Civil Service Law grant a civil service employment preference, in the form of points added to examination scores, to New York residents who are honorably discharged veterans of the Armed Forces, served during time of war, and were New York residents when they entered military service.  Appellee Army veterans, long-time New York residents, passed the New York City civil service examinations, but were denied the veterans' preference because they were not New York residents when they joined the Army.  They then brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that the requirement that they have been New York residents when they joined the military violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and their constitutional right to travel.  The District Court dismissed the complaint.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
755 F.2d 266, affirmed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the prior resident requirement of the New York civil service veterans' preference laws violates appellees' constitutionally protected right to travel and to equal protection of the law.  Pp.  476 U. S. 901-912.
(a) The right to travel includes the freedom to enter and reside in any State, and a state law implicates that right when it actually deters such travel, when impeding travel is its primary objective, or when, as here, it uses a classification that penalizes the exercise of that right.  When the latter is involved, heightened scrutiny of the law is required to determine its constitutionality, and the State must come forward with a compelling justification.  Pp.  476 U. S. 901-906.
(b) New York has not met its burden of proving that it has selected a means of pursuing a compelling state interest that does not impinge unnecessarily on constitutionally protected interests.  The justifications offered in support of the prior residence requirement -- encouraging New York residents to join the Armed Forces, helping war veterans reestablish themselves, inducing veterans to return to New York, and employing a ""uniquely valuable class of public servants"" who possess 
Page 476 U. S. 899
 useful experience acquired through military service -- fail to withstand heightened scrutiny.  New York could accomplish these purposes without penalizing the right to travel by awarding special credits to all qualified veterans. Pp. 907-911.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER concluded that the New York prior residence requirement is invalid because it fails to meet the rational basis test under the Equal Protection Clause.  Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55; Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 472 U. S. 612.  Pp.  476 U. S. 912-916.

Syllabus 
Under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, the Secretary of Agriculture has authority to make emergency loans to farmers who suffer economic losses as a result of a natural disaster.  Pursuant to a rule of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), the Secretary required loan applicants suffering from disasters occurring between December 26, 1972, and April 20, 1973, to file their applications by April 2, 1974.  That rule embodied the command of Pub.L. 93-237 to keep such loan programs open at least until that date.  During this period, loans were available on terms far more generous than under later versions of the authorizing statute.  In 1976, a class action was instituted in Federal District Court, in which respondents represented farmers who had been eligible for loans during this period as the result of a Florida flood occurring in early April, 1973, but who, because of lack of notice, had not been aware of their eligibility.  It was alleged, inter alia, that the FmHA's failure to publicize the program more fully violated its own regulations, and an injunction was sought to require the FmHA to reopen the loan program.  The District Court granted the requested relief, finding that the FmHA, in violation of one of its own regulations, had failed to give adequate notice of the availability of loans, and requiring the agency to reopen the program for the period from April 15, 1981, to June 15, 1981.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on different grounds, holding that the FmHA had failed to comply with another regulation that required it to notify the public through the news media of the program's generous terms.  After an earlier remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals adhered to its prior views and reinstated its decision, observing that petitioner Government officials' liability was premised on the FmHA's failure to follow its own regulations.
Held:
1. The lower courts erred in holding that the Secretary's conduct violated the notice procedures relevant to the implementation of Pub.L. 93-237.  Accordingly, even assuming, arguendo, that reopening the loan program would have been an appropriate remedy had the relevant regulations been violated, awarding that relief was clearly improper in light of the FmHA's compliance with its own procedures.  The agency's applicable 
Page 476 U. S. 927
 regulations provided for press releases to inform the news media of the ""provisions of P.L. No. 93-237.""  Public Law 93-237 itself said nothing about the availability of the generous terms of the loan program, but merely stated that loans with respect to disasters occurring prior to April 20, 1973, would be administered under Pub.L. 92-385, and thus the statement in the FmHA's news releases that ""loan applications will be taken under the terms of a new law (P.L. 93-23) enacted January 2, 1974,"" was no less informative than were the ""provisions"" of the Act the release was endeavoring to describe.  And in light of the history of Pub.L. 93-237 and the regulatory history, the District Court's remedy cannot be supported on the theory that the FmHA violated its earlier notice requirements.  Pp.  476 U. S. 935-942.
2. Nor can the injunctive relief be supported on the theory that inadequate notice of the loan program deprived the respondents of property without due process of law.  Even assuming that respondents had a legitimate claim of entitlement protected by due process, the notice published by the Secretary in the Federal Register after the enactment of Pub.L. 93-237, which notice set out in detail the terms and conditions of the loan program, as well as the notice afforded by the Secretary in full compliance with his own procedures, was more than ample to satisfy any due process concerns.

No. 85-568
Argued April 21, 1985
Decided June 17, 1986
476 U.S. 953

Syllabus 
Appellants Nantahala Power & Light Co and Tapoco, Inc., are wholly owned subsidiaries of appellant Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa).  Each owns hydroelectric powerplants on the Little Tennessee River, which the Tennessee Valley Authority operates in exchange for providing them jointly with a fixed supply of low-cost ""entitlement power.""  In addition, Nantahala buys a variable amount of high-cost ""purchased power"" from the TVA's power grid.  Tapoco sells all its power to an Alcoa plant in Tennessee, and Nantahala serves public customers in North Carolina.  For the purpose of calculating the rate to be charged Nantahala's retail customers, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) issued an order allocating entitlement and purchased power between Tapoco and Nantahala that differs from the allocation of entitlement power between them ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a wholesale ratemaking proceeding.  The NCUC's order resulted from Nantahala's request to raise its intrastate retail rates.  The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed that order.
Held:  NCUC's allocation of entitlement and purchase power is preempted by federal law.   476 U. S.  962-972.
(a) FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates to be charged Nantahala's interstate wholesale customers.  Once FERC sets such a rate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.  Rather, a State must give effect to Congress' desire to give FERC plenary authority over interstate wholesale rates, and to ensure that the States do not interfere with this authority.  The ""filed rate"" doctrine, under which interstate power rates filed with or fixed by FERC must be given binding effect by state utility commissions in determining intrastate rates, is not limited to ""rates"" per se.  Here, FERC's decision directly affected Nantahala's wholesale rates by determining the amount of low-cost power that it may include in its source of power, and FERC required Nantahala's wholesale rates to be filed in accordance with that allocation.  FERC's allocation of entitlement power is therefore presumptively entitled to more than the negligible weight given it by NCUC.  Pp.  476 U. S. 962-967. 
Page 476 U. S. 954

(b) NCUC's decision that Nantahala should have included more of the low-cost, FERC-regulated power than it in fact can under FERC's order runs directly counter to that order, and therefore cannot withstand its preemptive force.  Moreover, NCUC's order impermissibly interferes with the scheme of federal regulation.  Since Congress intended FERC's allocation of power in wholesale interstate ratemakings to preempt any inconsistent state ratemakings, it is FERC's order, rather than NCUC's, that must be given effect.  Pp.  476 U. S. 967-972.

Each owns hydroelectric powerplants on the Little Tennessee River, which the Tennessee Valley Authority operates in exchange for providing them jointly with a fixed supply of low-cost ""entitlement power.""  In addition, Nantahala buys a variable amount of high-cost ""purchased power"" from the TVA's power grid.  Tapoco sells all its power to an Alcoa plant in Tennessee, and Nantahala serves public customers in North Carolina.  For the purpose of calculating the rate to be charged Nantahala's retail customers, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) issued an order allocating entitlement and purchased power between Tapoco and Nantahala that differs from the allocation of entitlement power between them ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a wholesale ratemaking proceeding.  The NCUC's order resulted from Nantahala's request to raise its intrastate retail rates.  The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed that order.
Held:  NCUC's allocation of entitlement and purchase power is preempted by federal law.   476 U. S.  962-972.
(a) FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates to be charged Nantahala's interstate wholesale customers.  Once FERC sets such a rate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.  Rather, a State must give effect to Congress' desire to give FERC plenary authority over interstate wholesale rates, and to ensure that the States do not interfere with this authority.  The ""filed rate"" doctrine, under which interstate power rates filed with or fixed by FERC must be given binding effect by state utility commissions in determining intrastate rates, is not limited to ""rates"" per se.  Here, FERC's decision directly affected Nantahala's wholesale rates by determining the amount of low-cost power that it may include in its source of power, and FERC required Nantahala's wholesale rates to be filed in accordance with that allocation.  FERC's allocation of entitlement power is therefore presumptively entitled to more than the negligible weight given it by NCUC.  Pp.  476 U. S. 962-967. 
Page 476 U. S. 954

(b) NCUC's decision that Nantahala should have included more of the low-cost, FERC-regulated power than it in fact can under FERC's order runs directly counter to that order, and therefore cannot withstand its preemptive force.  Moreover, NCUC's order impermissibly interferes with the scheme of federal regulation.  Since Congress intended FERC's allocation of power in wholesale interstate ratemakings to preempt any inconsistent state ratemakings, it is FERC's order, rather than NCUC's, that must be given effect.  Pp.  476 U. S. 967-972.

Syllabus 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act) provides in 21 U.S.C.  346 that, when the addition of any poisonous or deleterious substance to food is required in the production thereof or cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
""shall promulgate regulations limiting the quantity therein or thereon to such extent as he finds necessary for the protection of public health.""
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Secretary's designee for enforcing the Act, has long interpreted the phrase beginning ""to such extent"" to modify the word ""shall,"" rather than ""the quantity therein or thereon,"" and therefore views the decision whether to promulgate a  346 regulation (tolerance level) as a determination to be made by the FDA.  Rather than setting a tolerance level for aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen that is unavoidably present in some foods, the FDA set an action level of 20 parts per billion (ppb) (an action level assures food producers that the FDA ordinarily will not enforce the Act's general adulteration provisions against them if the quantity of the harmful substance in food is less than a specified quantity).  But in 1980, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register that the Act would not be enforced as to a certain harvest of corn to be used for livestock and poultry feed where it contained no more than 100 ppb.  Respondents, two public interest groups and a consumer, brought suit against petitioner Commissioner of Food and Drugs in Federal District Court, alleging that the Act requires the FDA to set a tolerance level for aflatoxin before allowing the shipment of food containing the substance, that, in this case, the FDA had employed insufficient procedures to set the aflatoxin action level even if a tolerance level was not required, and that the FDA's decision to grant the exemption from the action level violated the Act and the FDA's own regulations.  Adopting the FDA's longstanding interpretation of  346 as giving it discretion whether to promulgate a tolerance level, the District Court, on a motion for summary judgment, ruled that the FDA need not establish a tolerance level for aflatoxin before allowing the shipment of the aflatoxin-tainted corn.  The Court of Appeals 
Page 476 U. S. 975
 reversed, holding that the FDA's interpretation of  346 conflicted with its plain language.
Held:  In light of  346's inherent ambiguity, the FDA's interpretation of the provision is sufficiently rational to preclude a court from substituting its judgment for that of the FDA.  The legislative history is equally ambiguous, and provides no support for assertions that the FDA's interpretation is insufficiently rational to warrant this Court's deference.  Pp.  476 U.

A shipbuilder contracted with respondent to design, manufacture, and supervise the installation of turbines that would be the main propulsion units for four oil-transporting supertankers constructed by the shipbuilder.  After each ship was completed, it was chartered to one of the petitioners.  When the ships were put into service, the turbines on all four ships malfunctioned due to design and manufacturing defects.  Only the products themselves were damaged.  Petitioners filed a five-count admiralty complaint in Federal District Court against respondent, alleging tortious conduct based on a products liability theory and seeking damages for the cost of repairing the ships and for income lost while they were out of service.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioners' dissatisfaction with product quality did not state a claim cognizable in tort.
Held:
1. The fourth count should have been dismissed on the ground that the petitioner who chartered the ship referred to in that count lacked standing to bring the claim.  P.  476 U. S. 863.
2. The torts alleged in the other counts clearly fall within admiralty jurisdiction.  Pp.  476 U. S. 863-864.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Indian tribe brought suit against respondent corporation (hereafter respondent) in a North Dakota state court for negligence and breach of contract in connection with respondent's construction of a water supply system on petitioner's reservation.  The trial court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction.  The North Dakota Supreme Court held that a North Dakota statute (Chapter 27-19) -- which provides that jurisdiction of the State shall be extended over all civil claims for relief that arise on an Indian reservation upon acceptance by Indian citizens -- disclaimed the unconditional state court civil jurisdiction North Dakota had previously extended to tribal Indians suing non-Indians in state court, and that Chapter 27-19 barred petitioner from maintaining its suit in state court absent its waiver of sovereign immunity.
Held:
1. Because the federal statute governing state assumption of jurisdiction over Indian country, Pub.L. 280, was designed to extend the jurisdiction of the States over Indian country and to encourage state assumption of such jurisdiction, and because Congress specifically considered the issue of retrocession, but did not provide for disclaimers of jurisdiction lawfully acquired other than under Pub.L. 280 prior to 1968, such disclaimers cannot be reconciled with the congressional plan embodied in Pub.L. 280, and thus are preempted.  Pp.  476 U. S. 884-887.
2. The conclusion that the operation of the North Dakota jurisdictional scheme in this case is inconsistent with federal law is reinforced by the fact that it imposes an undue burden on federal and tribal interests in Indian self-government and autonomy, as well as the federal interest in ensuring access to the courts.

 Respondent conducted an investigation into the alleged failure of Philadelphia police to enforce state liquor laws against an ""after hours"" bar. In the course of that investigation, they hid a camera across the street from the bar and videotaped police officers entering and leaving the bar. Respondent ultimately broadcast a videotape of petitioner leaving a bar on October 11, 1981. The videotape stated that ""the only paperwork we saw [petitioner] doing was carrying this envelope out of the Club less than a minute after he went in."" A freeze frame with a circle around an object in petitioner's hand was used to emphasize the point. The announcer went on to say that the officer had difficulty finding the proper key to start his patrol car and that he was not wearing his uniform jacket or hat, ""all standard items officers on patrol are required to have ."" The clear implication of the broadcast was that petitioner had accepted a bribe. Respondent made no attempt to obtain petitioner's explanation for these events other than an ""ambush"" interview four months after the fact. In this ""interview,"" a reporter for respondent approached petitioner with cameras whirling as he came off of his all-night shift and asked what he had been doing four months earlier on the night of October 11, 1981. Petitioner said ""this here is harassment"" and declined to answer questions at that time. 
 Petitioner and his wife filed a libel suit in District Court. He alleged that even a minimal investigation of the events of that evening would have revealed that he was a rookie policeman, patrolling alone for the first time on October 11, 1981; that early in his shift, he was ordered to investigate a vandalism complaint at 
Page 476 U.S. 1187 , 1188
 the bar; that after talking to the bar's steward, he returned to the patrol car and filled out his incident report book; and that he was not required to wear his jacket or hat while on patrol. Petitioner further alleged that the purported ""envelope"" was in fact nothing other than his incident report book. The District Court concluded that petitioner had raised a genuine issue of material fact concerning the truth of the allegedly defamatory statements and that the broadcast was capable of a defamatory interpretation. 603 F.Supp. 377 (ED Pa.1985). Applying our decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, however, the District Court concluded that petitioner had not introduced sufficient evidence of "" actual malice"" on the part of respondent to withstand a motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the District Court had properly evaluated petitioner's evidence of actual malice. 780 F.2d 340 (CA3 1985). One judge concurred, observing that ""[t]he New York Times standard makes it hard enough for a public figure to win a libel suit, even when faced, as here, with what any fair observer must agree is egregious conduct on the part of the media."" Id., at 349 (Becker, J.). 
 Petitioner has raised an important federal question that we should review. He has been accused of accepting a bribe on the basis of a cursory investigation, yet his libel suit to clear his name has been found to be constitutionally barred. The District Court observed: ""An issue . . . exists as to whether [respondent], with a minimum of effort, could have discovered the truth.

No. 84-780
Argued January 14, 1986
Decided June 11, 1986
476 U.S. 693

Syllabus 
Appellees applied for and received benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the Food Stamp program.  They refused, however, to comply with the federal statutory requirements that participants in those programs furnish the state welfare agencies who administer the programs with their Social Security numbers and those of each member of their household as a condition of receiving benefits, and that each state agency utilize those numbers in administering the programs.  Appellees contended that obtaining a Social Security number for their 2-year-old daughter would violate their Native American religious beliefs.  Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare terminated AFDC benefits payable to appellees on the child's behalf and instituted proceedings to reduce the level of food stamps that appellees' household was receiving.  Appellees then filed an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment entitled them to an exemption from the Social Security number requirements, and requesting injunctive and other relief.  Following a trial in which it was disclosed that the child had in fact been assigned a Social Security number, the court held that the public interest in maintaining an efficient and fraud-resistant system could be met without requiring a Social Security number for the child.  The court then enjoined the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using and disseminating the Social Security number issued in the child's name, and also enjoined the federal and state defendants from denying appellees benefits, until the child's 16th birthday, because of their refusal to provide a Social Security number for her.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
590 F.Supp. 600, vacated and remanded.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the statutory requirement that a state agency utilize Social Security numbers in administering the programs in question does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  That Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion, but does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government's internal procedures.  The Government's 
Page 476 U. S. 694
 use of a Social Security number for appellees' child does not itself impair appellees' freedom to exercise their religion.  Pp.  476 U. S. 699-701.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, joined by JUSTICE POWELL and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part III that the statutory requirement that applicants provide a Social Security number as a condition of eligibility for the benefits in question does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  That requirement is facially neutral in religious terms, applies to all applicants for the benefits involved, and clearly promotes a legitimate and important public interest.  Preventing fraud in these benefit programs is an important goal, and the Social Security number requirement is a reasonable means of promoting that goal.

Syllabus 
Appellees applied for and received benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the Food Stamp program.  They refused, however, to comply with the federal statutory requirements that participants in those programs furnish the state welfare agencies who administer the programs with their Social Security numbers and those of each member of their household as a condition of receiving benefits, and that each state agency utilize those numbers in administering the programs.  Appellees contended that obtaining a Social Security number for their 2-year-old daughter would violate their Native American religious beliefs.  Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare terminated AFDC benefits payable to appellees on the child's behalf and instituted proceedings to reduce the level of food stamps that appellees' household was receiving.  Appellees then filed an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment entitled them to an exemption from the Social Security number requirements, and requesting injunctive and other relief.  Following a trial in which it was disclosed that the child had in fact been assigned a Social Security number, the court held that the public interest in maintaining an efficient and fraud-resistant system could be met without requiring a Social Security number for the child.  The court then enjoined the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using and disseminating the Social Security number issued in the child's name, and also enjoined the federal and state defendants from denying appellees benefits, until the child's 16th birthday, because of their refusal to provide a Social Security number for her.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
590 F.Supp. 600, vacated and remanded.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the statutory requirement that a state agency utilize Social Security numbers in administering the programs in question does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  That Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion, but does not afford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government's internal procedures.  The Government's 
Page 476 U. S. 694
 use of a Social Security number for appellees' child does not itself impair appellees' freedom to exercise their religion.  Pp.  476 U. S. 699-701.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, joined by JUSTICE POWELL and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded in Part III that the statutory requirement that applicants provide a Social Security number as a condition of eligibility for the benefits in question does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  That requirement is facially neutral in religious terms, applies to all applicants for the benefits involved, and clearly promotes a legitimate and important public interest.  Preventing fraud in these benefit programs is an important goal, and the Social Security number requirement is a reasonable means of promoting that goal.  Government regulation that indirectly and incidentally calls for a choice between securing a governmental benefit and adherence to religious beliefs is wholly different from governmental action or legislation that criminalizes religiously inspired activity or compels conduct that some find objectionable for religious reasons.  Pp.  476 U. S. 701-712.

Syllabus 
The Bald Eagle Protection Act (Eagle Protection Act) makes it a federal crime to hunt the bald eagle or the golden eagle, except that such hunting may be authorized, pursuant to a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, ""for the religious purposes of Indian tribes"" or for certain other narrow purposes compatible with preservation of those species.  The Endangered Species Act imposes a similar ban on the hunting of the bald eagle.  Respondent, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, was convicted after a jury trial in Federal District Court of, inter alia, the shooting of four bald eagles in violation of the Endangered Species Act, but the court before trial dismissed a charge of shooting a golden eagle in violation of the Eagle Protection Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions and affirmed the dismissal of the other charge, holding that members of the Tribe have a right under an 1858 treaty to hunt bald and golden eagles within the Yankton Reservation for noncommercial purposes, and that neither of the Acts in question abrogated this treaty right.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in recognizing respondent's treaty defense to the prosecutions.  Pp.  476 U. S. 738-746.
(a) The Eagle Protection Act abrogated the rights of members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe under the 1858 treaty to hunt the bald or golden eagle on the Yankton Reservation.  Congress' intention to abrogate Indian treaty rights must be clear and plain.  Here, such intention is strongly suggested on the face of the Eagle Protection Act, and this view is supported by the legislative history.  More particularly, Congress' action in 1962 in amending the Act to extend its ban to the golden eagle and authorizing the Secretary to issue permits for Indian hunting reflected an unmistakable and explicit legislative policy choice that Indian hunting of the bald or golden eagle, except pursuant to permit, is inconsistent with the need to preserve those species.  Pp.  476 U. S. 738-745.
(b) Since the Eagle Protection Act divested respondent of his treaty right to hunt bald eagles, he had no such right to hunt bald eagles that he could assert as a defense to the Endangered Species Act charge.  Pp.  476 U. S. 745-746.
762 F.2d 674, reversed in part and remanded.

Syllabus 
Appellees brought an action in Federal District Court alleging that the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 violated the Federal Constitution and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The court denied appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, except as to one provision of the Act which it held was invalid.  The Court of Appeals, after granting appellees' motion to enjoin enforcement of the entire Act, held unconstitutional, on the basis of the intervening decisions in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, and Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506, the following provisions of the Act:  (1) the portions of  3205 that, with respect to the requirement that the woman give her ""informed consent"" to an abortion, require her to be informed of the name of the physician who will perform the abortion, the ""particular medical risks"" of the abortion procedure to be used and of carrying her child to term, and the facts that there may be ""detrimental physical and psychological effects,"" medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care, the father is liable to assist in the child's support, and printed materials are available from the State that describe the fetus and list agencies offering alternatives to abortion; (2)  3208 that requires such printed materials to include a statement that there are agencies willing to help the mother carry her child to term and to assist her after the child is born and a description of the probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of an unborn child at ""two-week gestational increments""; (3)  3214(a) and (h) that require the physician to report, among other things, identification of the performing and referring physicians, information as to the woman's residence, age, race, marital status, and number of prior pregnancies, and the basis for any judgment that a medical emergency existed or for any determination of nonviability, and the method of payment for the abortion, and further provide that such reports shall not be deemed public records, but shall be available for public inspection and copying in a form that will not lead to disclosure of the identity of any person filing a report; (4)  3211(a) that requires the physician, after the 
Page 476 U. S. 748
 first trimester, to report the basis for his determination that a child is not viable; (5) 3210(b) that requires a physician performing a postviability abortion to exercise the degree of care required to preserve the life and health of any unborn child intended to be born and to use the abortion technique that would provide the best opportunity for the unborn child to be aborted alive unless it would present a significantly greater medical risk to the pregnant woman's life or health; and (6)  3210(c) that requires that a second physician be present during an abortion performed when viability is possible, which physician is to take all reasonable steps necessary to preserve the child's life and health.  The court held that the validity of other provisions of the Act might depend on evidence adduced at the trial, and accordingly remanded these features of the case to the District Court.
Held:
1. In a situation such as is presented by this case, where the judgment below is not final and the case is remanded for further development of the facts, this Court has no appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2).  But the jurisdictional statement here is treated as a petition for certiorari, and the writ is granted.  Pp.  476 U. S. 754-755.
2. With a full record before it on the issues as to the validity of the Act and with the intervening decisions in Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos at hand, the Court of Appeals was justified in proceeding to plenary review of those issues.  It was not limited to determining whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction.  Pp.  476 U. S. 755-757.
3. The States are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies.  The provisions of the Pennsylvania Act that the Court of Appeals invalidated wholly subordinate constitutional privacy interests and concerns with maternal health to the effort to deter a woman from making a decision that, with her physician, is hers to make.  Pp.  476 U. S. 758-771.
(a) The printed materials required by  3205 and 3208 are nothing less than an attempt to wedge the State's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed consent dialogue between the woman and her physician. Similarly,  3205's requirement that the woman be advised that medical assistance may be available, and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in support of the child, are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision.  And  3205's requirements that the physician inform the woman of ""detrimental physical and psychological effects"" and of all ""particular medical risks"" are the antithesis of informed consent.  Pp.  476 U. S. 759-765.
(b) The scope of the information required by  3214(a) and (h) and 3211(a) and its availability to the public belie any assertions by the State 
Page 476 U. S. 749
 that it is advancing any legitimate interest.  The reporting requirements of those sections raise the specter of public exposure and harassment of women who choose to exercise their personal, intensely private, right, with their physician, to end a pregnancy.  Thus, they pose an unacceptable danger of deterring the exercise of that right, and must be invalidated.  Pp.  476 U. S. 765-768.
(c) Section 3210(b) is facially invalid as being unsusceptible to a construction that does not require the mother to bear an increased medical risk in order save her viable fetus.  Section 3210(c), by failing to provide a medical emergency exception for the situation where the mother's health is endangered by delay in the second physician's arrival, chills the performance of a late abortion, which, more than one performed at an earlier date, tends to be under emergency conditions.  Pp.  476 U. S. 768-771.
737 F.2d 283, affirmed.

476 U.S. 834

Syllabus 
Respondent inherited interests in three Indian allotments, title to which was held in trust by the United States.  In 1954, the Government sold the allotments to the United States Forest Service despite the lack of express consent from every person who held an interest in the allotments.  In 1967, respondent expressed an interest to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in selling her inherited Indian lands, and the BIA provided her with a list of her allotment interests, but did not mention the three allotments that had already been sold.  In response to a specific inquiry in 1981, the BIA informed respondent that the allotments had been sold.  Respondent then filed suit against the United States in Federal District Court, claiming jurisdiction under, inter alia, the General Allotment Act of 1887 and the Tucker Act, and alleging that the sale of her interests was void.  She sought damages equal to the current fair market value of her interests.  The District Court ruled that her claims were barred by the general 6-year statute of limitations governing actions against the United States.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that that statute does not bar claims of title to Indian allotments, but that, since the statute of limitations question depended on resolving several preliminary issues, the case would be remanded to the District Court.  The Court of Appeals denied the Government's petition for a rehearing wherein the Government claimed that the suit was barred not by the general statute of limitations, but by the 12-year limitations period of the Quiet Title Act of 1972.
Held.  Respondent's suit is ""a civil action . . . to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest,"" within the meaning of the Quiet Title Act, and therefore is barred by that Act's 12-year limitations period.  Pp.  476 U. S. 841-851.
(a) The relief respondent seeks confirms this characterization of her suit.  What she seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses valid title to the interests in question and that the title the United States asserts is defective, and an order requiring the United States to pay her the value of her interests today in order properly to transfer title.  The provision of the Quiet Title Act that it ""does not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands"" operates solely to retain the United States' immunity from suit by third parties challenging the United States' title to land held in trust for 
Page 476 U. S. 835
 Indians.  Thus, when the United States claims an interest in real property based on its status as trust or restricted Indian lands, the Quiet Title Act does not waive the United States' immunity.  But when an Indian plaintiff challenges the United States' assertion of title in its own behalf, the Act applies.  The limitations period is a central condition of the consent given by the Act.  By 1967, at the very latest, respondent was on notice that the Government did not recognize her title to the allotments in question; this satisfied the provision of the Quiet Title Act that, for purposes of the 12-year limitations period that commences on the date upon which the action accrued, an action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff ""should have known"" of the United States' claim.  Pp.  476 U. S. 841-844.
(b) Respondent cannot avoid the Quiet Title Act limitations period by using the General Allotment Act for a quiet title action against the Government.  The General Allotment Act grants federal district courts jurisdiction over suits seeking the issuance of an allotment and suits involving an Indian's interests and rights in his allotment after he has acquired it.  The Act's structure suggests that it waives the Government's immunity only with respect to the former class of suits.  That federal courts may have general subject matter jurisdiction over claims to quiet title to allotments brought by Indians does not therefore mean that the United States has waived its immunity in cases where an Indian challenges the United States' claim of title in its own right.  To permit suits against the United States under the General Allotment Act would not only permit plaintiffs to avoid the Quiet Title Act's 12-year limitations period, but also could disrupt ongoing federal programs.  Pp.  476 U. S. 844-848.
(c) Respondent's action does not fall within the scope of the Tucker Act, and thus her appeal to the Court of Appeals was proper.  Pp.  476 U. S. 848-851.
753 F.2d 71, reversed.

(a) The relief respondent seeks confirms this characterization of her suit.  What she seeks is a declaration that she alone possesses valid title to the interests in question and that the title the United States asserts is defective, and an order requiring the United States to pay her the value of her interests today in order properly to transfer title.  The provision of the Quiet Title Act that it ""does not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands"" operates solely to retain the United States' immunity from suit by third parties challenging the United States' title to land held in trust for 
Page 476 U. S. 835
 Indians.  Thus, when the United States claims an interest in real property based on its status as trust or restricted Indian lands, the Quiet Title Act does not waive the United States' immunity.  But when an Indian plaintiff challenges the United States' assertion of title in its own behalf, the Act applies.  The limitations period is a central condition of the consent given by the Act.  By 1967, at the very latest, respondent was on notice that the Government did not recognize her title to the allotments in question; this satisfied the provision of the Quiet Title Act that, for purposes of the 12-year limitations period that commences on the date upon which the action accrued, an action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff ""should have known"" of the United States' claim.  Pp.  476 U. S. 841-844.
(b) Respondent cannot avoid the Quiet Title Act limitations period by using the General Allotment Act for a quiet title action against the Government.  The General Allotment Act grants federal district courts jurisdiction over suits seeking the issuance of an allotment and suits involving an Indian's interests and rights in his allotment after he has acquired it.  The Act's structure suggests that it waives the Government's immunity only with respect to the former class of suits.  That federal courts may have general subject matter jurisdiction over claims to quiet title to allotments brought by Indians does not therefore mean that the United States has waived its immunity in cases where an Indian challenges the United States' claim of title in its own right.  To permit suits against the United States under the General Allotment Act would not only permit plaintiffs to avoid the Quiet Title Act's 12-year limitations period, but also could disrupt ongoing federal programs.  Pp.  476 U. S. 844-848.
(c) Respondent's action does not fall within the scope of the Tucker Act, and thus her appeal to the Court of Appeals was proper.  Pp.  476 U. S. 848-851.
753 F.2d 71, reversed.

Syllabus 
Appellant's father died intestate at a time when  42 of the Texas Probate Code prohibited an illegitimate child from inheriting from its father unless its parents had subsequently married.  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U. S. 762, decided four months after the father's death, held that a total statutory disinheritance, from the paternal estate, of children born out of wedlock and not legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents, is unconstitutional.  Thereafter, appellant filed a claim to a share in her father's estate, but it was denied by a Texas trial court.  The Texas Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Trimble does not apply retroactively.
Held:  The interest, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, in avoiding unjustified discrimination against children born out of wedlock, requires that appellant's claim to a share in her father's estate be protected by the full applicability of Trimble.  There is no justification for the State's rejection of the claim.  At the time appellant filed her claim, Trimble had been decided, and her father's estate remained open.  Neither the date of the father's death nor the date appellant's claim was filed should have prevented the applicability of Trimble.  Those dates, either separately or in combination, had no impact on the State's interest in orderly administration of the estate.  Pp.  476 U. S. 854-857.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that
""[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""
In 1984, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) promulgated regulations requiring:  (1) health care providers receiving federal funds to post notices that, because of  504's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of handicap, health care should not be withheld from infants on the basis of their mental or physical impairments; (2) state child protective services agencies to establish procedures to prevent unlawful medical neglect of handicapped infants, and when considered necessary, in the judgment of the responsible official of the Department of Health and Human Services, to protect a handicapped infant's life or health; (3) immediate access to patient records; and (4) expedited compliance actions.  In consolidated actions in Federal District Court, respondents sought to declare the regulations invalid and to enjoin their enforcement.  The court granted the requested relief on the authority of United States v. University Hospital, 729 F.2d 144 (CA2), and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of that earlier decision.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
794 F.2d 676, affirmed.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that the regulations in question are not authorized by  504.  Pp.  476 U. S. 624-647.
(a) A hospital's withholding of treatment from a handicapped infant when no parental consent has been given cannot violate  504, for, without the parents' consent, the infant is neither ""otherwise qualified"" for treatment nor has he been denied care ""solely by reason of his handicap.""  There is nothing in the administrative record documenting the Secretary's belief that there exists ""discriminatory withholding of medical care"" in violation of  504 which would justify federal regulation.  None 
Page 476 U. S. 611
 of the examples cited by the Secretary as justification for the regulation suggests that the hospitals receiving federal funds, as opposed to parents, withheld medical care on the basis of handicap.  Pp.  476 U. S. 630-636.
(b) The complaint-handling process the Secretary would impose on unwilling state agencies is totally foreign to the authority to prevent discrimination conferred on him by  504.  While the Secretary can require state agencies to document their own compliance with  504, nothing in  504 authorizes him to commandeer state agencies to enforce compliance by other recipients of federal funds (in this instance, hospitals).  Pp.  476 U. S. 637-642.
(c) The Secretary's basis for federal intervention is perceived discrimination against handicapped infants in violation of  504, and yet the Secretary has pointed to no evidence that such discrimination occurs.  The administrative record does not contain the reasoning and evidence necessary to sustain federal intervention into a historically state-administered decisional process that appears -- for lack of any contrary evidence -- to be functioning in full compliance with  504.  Nothing in  504 authorizes the Secretary to dispense with the law's focus on discrimination, and instead to employ federal resources to save the lives of handicapped newborns without regard to whether they are victims of discrimination by recipients of federal funds or not.  Section 504 does not authorize the Secretary to give unsolicited advice either to parents, to hospitals, or to state officials who are faced with difficult treatment decisions concerning handicapped children.  The administrative record demonstrates that the Secretary has asserted the authority to conduct on-site investigations, to inspect hospital records, and to participate in the decisional process in emergency cases in which there was no colorable basis for believing that a violation of  504 had occurred or was about to occur.  These investigative actions are not authorized by  504, and the regulations that purport to authorize a continuation of them are invalid.  Pp.  476 U. S. 642-647.

Syllabus 
Respondents, who include an association of family physicians and several individual doctors, filed suit in Federal District Court to challenge the validity of a regulation that was promulgated under Part B of the Medicare program and that authorizes the payment of benefits in different amounts for similar physicians' services.  Holding that the regulation contravened several statutory provisions governing the Medicare program, the court rejected the Secretary of Health and Human Services' contention (the question presented in this Court) that Congress has forbidden judicial review of all questions affecting the amount of benefits payable under Part B of the Medicare program.  The Court of Appeals agreed.
Held:  In neither 42 U.S.C.  1395ff (1982 ed. and Supp. II) nor  1395ii (1982 ed., Supp. II), has Congress barred judicial review of regulations promulgated under Part B of the Medicare program.  Pp.  476 U. S. 670-682.
(a) There is a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.  Only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.  Pp.  476 U. S. 670-673.
(b) The provisions of  1395ff(b) that authorize administrative and judicial review of determinations as to the amount of benefits under Part A of the Medicare program do not impliedly foreclose judicial review of Part B regulations.  The reticulated statutory scheme, which details the forum and limits of review of determinations of the amounts of benefits payable under Parts A and B, simply does not speak to challenges as to the method by which such amounts are to be determined, rather than the determinations themselves.  That Congress did not preclude review of the method by which Part B awards are computed (as opposed to the computation) is supported by the legislative history.  United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S. 201, explained.  Pp.  476 U. S. 674-678.
(c) Nor does  1395ii, which states that 42 U.S.C.  405(h) (1982 ed., Supp. II), along with other provisions of the Social Security Act, shall be applicable to the Medicare program, preclude judicial review here.  Regardless of the abstract meaning of  405(h), which prohibits certain actions 
Page 476 U. S. 668
 against the Government or its officers, that section does not apply on its own terms to Part B, but is instead incorporated mutatis mutandis by  1395ii.  The legislative history of the Medicare program provides specific evidence of Congress' intent to foreclose review only of ""amount determinations,"" not of substantial statutory and constitutional challenges to the Secretary's administration of Part B.

Prior to his trial for murder in a Kentucky court, petitioner moved to suppress his confession.  Following a hearing, the trial court determined that the confession was voluntary, and denied the motion.  At trial, petitioner, who was 16 years old at the time of his arrest, sought to introduce testimony describing the length of the interrogation and the manner in which it was conducted.  In attempting to introduce such testimony, petitioner hoped to show that the confession, which was the principal component of the State's case, was unworthy of belief.  The trial court ruled that the testimony pertained solely to the issue of voluntariness, and was therefore inadmissible.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that the exclusion of the testimony violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held.  The exclusion of the testimony about the circumstances of his confession deprived petitioner of his fundamental constitutional right -- whether under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or under the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment -- to a fair opportunity to present a defense.  Evidence about the manner in which a confession was secured, in addition to bearing on its voluntariness, often bears on its credibility, a matter that is exclusively for the jury to assess.  The physical and psychological environment that yielded a confession is not only relevant to the legal question of voluntariness but can also be of substantial relevance to the ultimate factual issue of the defendant's guilt or innocence, especially in a case such as this, where there apparently was no physical evidence to link petitioner to the crime.

 Linda MULLIGANv. Francis HAZARD et al.No. 85-1641 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 9, 1986
 Rehearing Denied Aug. 19, 1986. 
 See 478 U.S. 1031. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 ( 1985), we held that an action brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 should be considered a personal injury action for purposes of borrowing an appropriate state statute of limitations. Since our decision in that case, the Courts of Appeals have differed on whether Wilson should be given retro- 
Page 476 U.S. 1174 , 1175
 active effect. In the present case, the Sixth Circuit held, without qualification, that Wilson should be given retroactive effect. 777 F.2d 340 (CA6 1985). The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have reached similar results. Gates v. Spinks, 771 F.2d 916 (CA5 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1065 (1986); Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, 763 F.2d 1250 (CA11 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1105 (1986). Two other Courts of Appeals, however, have determined that when retroactive application would shorten the statute of limitations, Wilson merits only prospective relief. Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334 (CA9 1986); Jackson v. City of Bloomfield, 731 F.2d 652 (CA10 1984). Although the Third and Eighth Circuits have applied Wilson retroactively in certain cases, it is unclear whether their holdings are designed to have universal application. See Wycoff v. Menke, 773 F.2d 983, 986-987 (CA8 1985); Fitzgerald v. Larson, 769 F.2d 160, 162- 164 (CA3 1985); Smith v. City of Pittsburgh, 764 F.2d 188, 194-196 (CA3 1985). 
 In addition, the Courts of Appeals also have reached conflicting results concerning what should be done when more than one state statute of limitations applies to personal injury actions. In Hamilton v. City of Overland Park, 730 F.2d 613 (1984) (en banc), cert. denied 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), and Mismash v. Murray City, 730 F.2d 1366 (1984) (en banc), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), the Tenth Circuit rejected, for 1983 purposes, the state statute of limitations for intentional torts, and chose instead a State's residual statute of limitations. See generally Preuit & Mauldin v. Jones, 474 U.S. 1105, 1106-1107, 893-895 ( 1986) (WHITE, J. dissenting from denial of certiorari). The Eleventh Circuit in Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, supra, the Fifth Circuit in Gates v. Spinks, supra, and the Sixth Circuit in the present case, however, follow a different rule, and select the state statute of limitations governing intentional torts. 
 The Court's decision not to review the instant case marks the third time this Term that it has refused to address these differences that exist between the Courts of Appeals; differences that are not likely to disappear without guidance from this Court. Given the square conflicts among the Circuits, and the frequency with which these cases arise, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.

 Linda MULLIGANv. Francis HAZARD et al.No. 85-1641 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 9, 1986
 Rehearing Denied Aug. 19, 1986. 
 See 478 U.S. 1031. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 In Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 ( 1985), we held that an action brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 should be considered a personal injury action for purposes of borrowing an appropriate state statute of limitations. Since our decision in that case, the Courts of Appeals have differed on whether Wilson should be given retro- 
Page 476 U.S. 1174 , 1175
 active effect. In the present case, the Sixth Circuit held, without qualification, that Wilson should be given retroactive effect. 777 F.2d 340 (CA6 1985). The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have reached similar results. Gates v. Spinks, 771 F.2d 916 (CA5 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1065 (1986); Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, 763 F.2d 1250 (CA11 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1105 (1986). Two other Courts of Appeals, however, have determined that when retroactive application would shorten the statute of limitations, Wilson merits only prospective relief. Gibson v. United States, 781 F.2d 1334 (CA9 1986); Jackson v. City of Bloomfield, 731 F.2d 652 (CA10 1984). Although the Third and Eighth Circuits have applied Wilson retroactively in certain cases, it is unclear whether their holdings are designed to have universal application. See Wycoff v. Menke, 773 F.2d 983, 986-987 (CA8 1985); Fitzgerald v. Larson, 769 F.2d 160, 162- 164 (CA3 1985); Smith v. City of Pittsburgh, 764 F.2d 188, 194-196 (CA3 1985). 
 In addition, the Courts of Appeals also have reached conflicting results concerning what should be done when more than one state statute of limitations applies to personal injury actions. In Hamilton v. City of Overland Park, 730 F.2d 613 (1984) (en banc), cert. denied 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), and Mismash v. Murray City, 730 F.2d 1366 (1984) (en banc), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1052 (1985), the Tenth Circuit rejected, for 1983 purposes, the state statute of limitations for intentional torts, and chose instead a State's residual statute of limitations. See generally Preuit & Mauldin v. Jones, 474 U.S. 1105, 1106-1107, 893-895 ( 1986) (WHITE, J. dissenting from denial of certiorari). The Eleventh Circuit in Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin, supra, the Fifth Circuit in Gates v. Spinks, supra, and the Sixth Circuit in the present case, however, follow a different rule, and select the state statute of limitations governing intentional torts. 
 The Court's decision not to review the instant case marks the third time this Term that it has refused to address these differences that exist between the Courts of Appeals; differences that are not likely to disappear without guidance from this Court. Given the square conflicts among the Circuits, and the frequency with which these cases arise, I would grant the petition for certiorari in this case.

 Alvin R. MOORE, Jr. v. Frank BLACKBURN, Warden.No. 85-5555 Supreme Court of the United States June 9, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The petitioner in this case was sentenced to death by a jury that was "" led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of [his] death rests elsewhere,"" Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 329, 2639 (1985). Under our recent decision in Caldwell, petitioner's sentence cannot stand unless this error "" had no effect on the sentencing decision,"" id., at 341, a point the courts below did not consider and the State does not contest here. I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the District Court's judgment, and remand for reconsideration in light of Caldwell. 
 At the penalty phase of petitioner's trial, the prosecutor argued: 
 On direct appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, petitioner argued that these statements had injected passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors into the sentencing determination. That court, while admitting that the prosecutor's argument was ""close to reversible error,"" ibid., concluded that the argument had not diminished the jury's sense of responsibility for its sentencing decision. The Fifth Circuit, reviewing the District Court's rejection of the same claim in petitioner's first federal habeas petition, 
Page 476 U.S. 1176 , 1177
 reached the same conclusion. Moore v. Maggio, 740 F.2d 308, 320 (CA5 1984 ). Subsequently, this Court decided Caldwell, and petitioner filed a second habeas petition claiming that the prosecutor's argument violated the Eighth Amendment as construed in our decision in that case. 
 The District Court denied this petition, and the Court of Appeals denied a certificate of probable cause. 774 F.2d 97 (CA5 1985). The latter court held that the Caldwell claim had been raised in petitioner's first application, and was therefore barred by Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, and by the principles enunciated in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 (1963). The court also concluded that its prior determination that the prosecutor's argument had not diminished the jury's sense of responsibility, see 740 F. 2d, at 320, was ""consistent with the rule set forth in Caldwell."" 774 F. 2d, at 98. Even had the Caldwell claim not been raised previously, the court held, it would have denied that claim as an abuse of the writ, because a competent lawyer would have been aware of the possibility of such a claim. 
 The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that its prior pronouncement that the jury's sense of responsibility was not diminished disposed of the Caldwell claim. The prosecutor's argument in this case is essentially identical to the argument held unconstitutional in Caldwell. The lesson of Caldwell, at a minimum, is that a misleading or incomplete statement concerning appellate review of a death sentence necessarily diminishes the jury's sense of responsibility. In the present case, no less than in Caldwell, the jury may have ""harbor[ed] misconceptions about the power of state appellate courts or, for that matter, this Court to override a jury's sentence of death."" 472 U.S., at 342 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Under those circumstances, we cannot be confident that the jury did not conclude that the ultimate responsibility for petitioner's fate rested elsewhere. 
 This case, then, falls squarely within the ""ends of justice"" exception to the general rule forbidding successive assertions of the same claim on habeas, see Sanders, supra, at 16-17-1078. In Sanders, this Court held that ""[i]f purely legal questions are involved, the applicant may be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law."" 373 U.S., at 17. Caldwell constitutes an intervening change in the law concerning the precise argument used by the prosecutor in this case-a change that re- [476 U.S. 1176 , 1178]

No. 84-6807
Argued December 9, 1985
Decided June 3, 1986
476 U.S. 530

Syllabus 
Petitioner and a codefendant, charged with committing a double murder, were tried jointly in an Illinois court in a bench trial at which neither defendant testified.  In finding petitioner guilty of both murders, the judge expressly relied on portions of the codefendant's confession, particularly with respect to the judge's rejection of petitioner's assertions that she had not participated in the murder of one of the victims and that she had acted either in self-defense or under intense and sudden passion in killing the other victim.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed petitioner's convictions, rejecting her contention that her rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated by the trial judge's consideration of the codefendant's confession against her.
Held:  The trial court's reliance upon the codefendant's confession as substantive evidence against petitioner violated her rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.   476 U. S.  539-547.
(a) The right of cross-examination is included in an accused's right to confront the witnesses against him; the right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses is primarily a functional right that promotes reliability in criminal trials.  This truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice's confession is sought to be introduced against a defendant without the benefit of cross-examination, since such a confession is hearsay, subject to all the dangers of inaccuracy which characterize hearsay generally, and since the accomplice may have a strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself.  Thus, accomplices' confessions that incriminate defendants are presumptively unreliable.  Pp.  476 U. S. 539-543.
(b) On the record here, the codefendant's confession did not bear sufficient independent ""indicia of reliability,"" Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56,  448 U. S. 66, to rebut the presumption of unreliability.  The circumstances surrounding the confession did not rebut the presumption that the codefendant's statement could not be trusted as regards petitioner's participation in the murders.  Nor is there any merit to Illinois' assertion that reliability was established because petitioner's confession and the codefendant's confession ""interlocked"" on some points.  A codefendant's confession is not rendered reliable simply because some of the facts it contains ""interlock"" with the facts of the defendant's statement.  
Page 476 U. S. 531
 Although the confessions here overlapped in their factual recitations to a great extent, they clearly diverged with respect to petitioner's participation in the planning of one victim's death, her facilitation of the murder of the other victim, and factual circumstances relevant to the couple's premeditation.  Thus, the subjects upon which the two confessions did not ""interlock"" cannot be characterized as irrelevant or trivial.  The determination, in the first instance, of whether the error as to the trial judge's consideration of the codefendant's confession was harmless is for the state courts.  Pp.  476 U. S. 543-547.

Argued March 5, 1986
Decided June 3, 1986
476 U.S. 558

Syllabus 
Prior to 1977, the Internal Revenue Code's gift tax permitted the taxpayer a lifetime exemption of $30,000 to be deducted from amounts otherwise taxable, which exemption could be claimed, in whole or in part, at any time during the taxpayer's lifetime.  26 U.S.C.  2521 (1970 ed.).  The estate tax afforded the estate a specific exemption of $60,000 in determining the amount subject to tax.   2052 (1970 ed.).  The Tax Reform Act of 1976 (new Act), which was enacted on October 4, 1976, and which became effective on January 1, 1977, created the so-called ""unified credit"" (deductible directly from the amount of the tax) that a taxpayer could apply either toward gift tax during life or toward estate tax after death.   2010(a), 2505(a).  The $30,000 exemption for gifts and the $60,000 exemption for estates were eliminated, beginning with estates of taxpayers dying after December 31, 1976, and gifts given after that date, and a phase-in schedule was established for the amount of the new unified credit.  The new Act also contained a transitional rule (applicable to taxpayers who, before 1977, had used up some or all of their $30,000 gift tax exemption) providing that the amount of the unified credit
""shall be reduced by an amount equal to 20% of the aggregate amount allowed as a specific exemption under section 2521 [prior to its repeal] with respect to gifts made by the decedent after September 8, 1976.""
 2010(c).  On September 28, 1976, a taxpayer made certain gifts, and he later filed a federal gift tax return which declared that no tax was due and in which he claimed his entire $30,000 lifetime exemption under  2521 (1970 ed.).  However, the taxpayer died just over two years later, and his estate was required by law to include in the estate all gifts made ""in contemplation of death,"" which presumptively included all gifts made within three years of the decedent's death.   2035 (1970 ed.).  After including the 1976 gifts in the estate, the estate then claimed the unified credit of $34,000 under the new Act.  However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that, under the new Act's transitional rule in  2010(c), the credit must be reduced by 20% of the specific gift-tax exemption claimed during the decedent's lifetime, or $6,000.  The estate paid the assessed deficiency of $6,000 and ultimately a refund suit was filed by appellees (the trustee of the decedent's ""revocable living trust"" and the transferees 
Page 476 U. S. 559
 of his property).  The District Court held that the application of  2010(c) to the decedent's gifts, which were made before the new Act's enactment, was so arbitrary and capricious as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. There is no merit to appellees' argument, focused on the word ""allowed"" in  2010(c), that Congress did not intend the transitional rule to be applied as the IRS applied it here, because, when the 1976 gifts were required to be included in the estate as having been made in contemplation of death, the $30,000 specific gift tax exemption decedent had claimed became ""disallowed"" -- a claim to a specific exemption not being ""allowed"" unless the taxpayer ultimately benefited from that exemption by paying less tax than he otherwise would have payed.  Longstanding interpretation of the tax laws does not support such argument.  Nor was the mere inclusion of the gifts in the gross estate tantamount to disallowance of the $30,000 exemption.  Moreover, decedent did receive a benefit for his specific exemption, since he avoided any gift taxes.  The application of  2010(c) here is consistent with the statute's language and purpose.  Pp.  476 U. S. 564-567.
2. The District Court erred in finding that  2010(c), as applied here, transgressed the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as being arbitrary and capricious because it retroactively affected the final disposition of a gift made before the statute's enactment.  Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440, distinguished.  The nature of a tax and the circumstances in which it is laid must be considered before it can be said that its retroactive application is so oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.  Here, in view of the applicable statutory provisions prior to the new Act, particularly the requirement of  2035 (1970 ed.) as to inclusion in an estate of gifts made in contemplation of death, appellees were no worse off than they would have been without the enactment of the new Act.  Moreover, even assuming that, as appellees asserted, the confluence of  2010(c) and 2035 required them to pay tax on the same transaction twice, the Constitution was not offended, since Congress clearly expressed its intention to occasion that result.  Pp.  476 U. S. 567-572.
Reversed.

Moreover, even assuming that, as appellees asserted, the confluence of  2010(c) and 2035 required them to pay tax on the same transaction twice, the Constitution was not offended, since Congress clearly expressed its intention to occasion that result.  Pp.  476 U. S. 567-572.

No. 84-2030
Argued March 3, 1986
Decided June 3, 1986
476 U.S. 573

APPEAL FROM COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK
New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law (ABC Law) provides that a distiller, licensed to do business in the State, may not sell its products to wholesalers within the State except in accordance with a monthly price schedule previously filed with appellee State Liquor Authority, and requires that the distiller include with the schedule an affirmation that the prices in the schedule are no higher than the lowest prices that the distiller will charge wholesalers anywhere else in the United States during the month.  Appellee determined that the ABC Law prohibited appellant distiller, which sells its liquor in New York and in other States, from offering certain promotional allowances (based on past purchases and projections of future purchases) to wholesalers in the State, and that the payment of the allowances to wholesalers in other States lowered the ""effective price"" of appellant's products to those wholesalers, thus violating the affirmation provision of the ABC Law.  After license revocation proceedings were instituted against appellant, it sought review of appellee's ruling in the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, which held, inter alia, that the affirmation provision did not, on its face, directly regulate interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The affirmation provision of New York's ABC Law, on its face, violates the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  476 U. S. 578-585.
(a) In analyzing state economic regulation under the Commerce Clause, the critical consideration is the overall effect of the state law on both local and interstate activity.  Pp.  476 U. S. 578-579.

No. 85-554
Argued April 23, 1986
Decided June 3, 1986
476 U.S. 593

Syllabus 
Respondent, in its gambling casino in Reno, Nev., operated a number of ""progressive"" slot machines.  In addition to paying fixed amounts when certain symbol combinations appear on their reels, these machines have a ""progressive"" jackpot that is won only when a different specified combination appears.  The amount of the jackpot increases as money is gambled on the machine, until the jackpot is won.  A Nevada Gaming Commission regulation prohibits reducing the indicated payoff without paying the jackpot.  Utilizing the accrual method of accounting, respondent's practice was, at the end of each fiscal year, to enter the total of the progressive jackpot amounts as an accrued liability on its books, and from that total to subtract the corresponding figure for the preceding year to produce the current tax year's increase in accrued liability.  On its federal income tax returns for certain fiscal years, respondent claimed this net figure as a deduction under  162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as an ordinary and necessary business expense incurred during the taxable year.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) disallowed the deductions on the ground that, under Treasury Regulations, an expense may not be deducted until ""all the events have occurred which determine the fact of liability and the amount thereof can be determined with reasonable accuracy,"" and that, until a patron actually won a progressive jackpot, respondent's liability to pay the jackpot was contingent, and therefore was not a deductible expense.  Accordingly, the Commissioner determined deficiencies in respondent's income taxes for the years in question.  Respondent paid the deficiencies, and, when its claims for refunds were denied, brought suit in the Claims Court.  The court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, holding that respondent's liability to pay the progressive jackpots was fixed by the Nevada regulation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondent was entitled to claim the deductions in question.  Pp.  476 U. S. 599-606.
(a) The ""all events"" test prescribed by the Treasury Regulations requires that before an expense can be regarded as ""incurred"" for federal income tax purposes, a liability must be fixed and absolute.  Pp.  476 U. S. 600-601. 
Page 476 U. S. 594

(b) Here, the effect of the Nevada regulation was to fix respondent's liability.  Identification of the winning players is irrelevant to respondent, since the obligation to pay exists, and whether it turns out that the winner is one patron or another makes no difference as to liability.  The event creating liability was the last play of each progressive slot machine before the end of the fiscal year, since that play fixed the jackpot amount irrevocably.  That event occurred during the taxable year.  Brown v. Helvering, 291 U. S. 193, distinguished.  Pp.  476 U. S. 601-603.
(c) Granting that the Commissioner has broad discretion to determine whether a taxpayer's accounting methods clearly reflect income, that financial accounting does not control for tax purposes, and that the mere desirability of matching expenses with income will not necessarily sustain a taxpayer's deduction, the disallowance of respondent's deductions was not justified.  As noted, the jackpot liabilities were fixed, and only the exact times of payment and the winners' identity remained uncertain.  Pp.  476 U. S. 603-604.
(d) Nothing in the record indicates that respondent used its progressive slot machines for tax-avoidance purposes.  Pp.  476 U. S. 604-605.
(e) The potential that a casino operator might go out of business, or surrender or lose its license, or go into bankruptcy, with the result that the progressive jackpot would never be paid, does not prevent accrual of the expense.  Pp.  476 U. S. 605-606.
(f) One of the expenses that necessarily attends the production of income from a progressive slot machine is the commitment of a particular portion of the income generated to an irrevocable jackpot.  Cf. United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422.  Respondent's true income from its progressive slot machines is only that portion of the money gambled that it is entitled to keep.  P.  476 U. S. 606.

No. 84-1809
Argued March 25, 1986
Decided June 2, 1986
476 U.S. 447

Syllabus 
Respondent organization of dentists in Indiana promulgated a policy requiring its members to withhold x-rays from dental insurers in connection with evaluating patients' claims for benefits.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a cease-and-desist order, ruling that the policy constituted an unfair method of competition in violation of  5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, since it amounted to a conspiratorial restraint of trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The Court of Appeals vacated the FTC's order on the ground that it was not supported by substantial evidence, holding that the FTC's findings that respondent's x-ray policy was anticompetitive were erroneous; that the findings were inadequate because of the FTC's failure to define the market in which respondent allegedly restrained competition and to establish that respondent had the power to restrain competition in that market; and that the FTC erred in not determining whether the alleged restraint on competition among dentists had actually resulted in higher dental costs to patients and insurers.
Held:
1. The FTC's factual findings regarding respondent's x-ray policy are supported by substantial evidence.  There is no dispute that respondent's members conspired among themselves to withhold x-rays, and the FTC's finding that competition among dentists with respect to cooperation with insurers' requests for x-rays was diminished where respondent held sway also finds adequate support in the record.  Pp.  476 U. S. 455-457.
2. Evaluated under the Rule of Reason, the FTC's factual findings are sufficient as a matter of law to establish a violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, i.e., an unreasonable restraint of trade, and hence a violation of  5 of the FTC Act.  Respondent's x-ray policy takes the form of a horizontal agreement among its members to withhold from their customers a particular service that they desire.  Absent some countervailing procompetitive virtue, such an agreement cannot be sustained under the Rule of Reason.  This conclusion is not precluded by the absence of specific findings as to the market in which respondent allegedly restrained competition or as to the power of respondent's members in that market, or by the FTC's failure to find that respondent's x-ray policy resulted in 
Page 476 U. S. 448
 more costly dental services than the patients and insurers would have chosen if they were able to evaluate x-rays in conjunction with claim forms.  Nor do alleged noncompetitive ""quality of care"" considerations justify respondent's x-ray policy.  And whether or not respondent's policy is consistent with Indiana's supposed policy against submission of x-rays to insurers, it is not immunized from antitrust scrutiny.  Anticompetitive collusion among private actors, even when consistent with state policy, acquires antitrust immunity only when it is actually supervised by the State, and there is no suggestion of such supervision here.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
Syllabus 
The Social Security Act provides benefits to disabled persons under two programs administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA):  the Social Security Disability Insurance Program (SSD) and the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI).  Regulations for both programs establish a five-step ""sequential evaluation"" process for determining eligibility for benefits.  The initial determination of whether an individual is disabled is made by a state agency under the authority and control of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).  This determination is subject to review by the SSA.  The disappointed claimant is then afforded a three-stage administrative review process.  Proceeding through these three stages exhausts the claimant's administrative remedies.  Thereafter, he may seek judicial review in Federal District Court, but must do so within 60 days of the Secretary's final decision as required by 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  Respondents brought a class action against the Secretary and the Commissioner of the SSA, seeking relief on behalf of all individuals residing in New York who had, within a specified time period, been denied disability benefits or whose benefits were terminated pursuant to an allegedly illegal internal policy of the Secretary.  The District Court certified the class as including claimants who had not complied with the 60-day requirement for seeking judicial review and other claimants who had not exhausted their administrative remedies and obtained a final decision of the Secretary as required by  405(g).  Holding that the policy in question was illegal, the District Court ordered the Secretary to reopen the decisions denying or terminating benefits, and to redetermine eligibility.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Syllabus 
Respondent sued petitioners, the city of Los Angeles and its Department of Water and Power (DWP), in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, a violation of its rights under the First Amendment by reason of (1) the city's refusal to grant respondent a cable television franchise on the ground that respondent had failed to participate in an auction for a single franchise in the area and (2) DWP's refusal to grant access to poles or underground conduits used for power lines.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
Held:  The complaint should not have been dismissed.  The activities in which respondent allegedly seeks to engage plainly implicate First Amendment interests.  Through original programming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire, respondent seeks to communicate messages on a wide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats.  But where speech and conduct are joined in a single course of action, the First Amendment values must be balanced against competing societal interests.  Thus, where the city has made factual assertions to justify restrictions on cable television franchising and these assertions are disputed by respondent, there must be a fuller development of the disputed factual issues before this Court will decide the legal issues.

No. 84-782
Argued December 12, 1985
Decided June 2, 1986
476 U.S. 498

Syllabus 
In 1760 and 1763, respondent Indian Tribe surrendered to Great Britain its aboriginal territory in return for the right to settle permanently on a 225-square-mile tract of land now located in South Carolina.  In 1840, the Tribe conveyed the tract to South Carolina in return for the State's establishing a new reservation for the Tribe.  In 1959, Congress, pursuant to its changed policies concerning Indian affairs, enacted the Catawba Indian Tribe Division of Assets Act (Catawba Act) authorizing a division of Catawba tribal assets.  Section 5 of that Act provided for revocation of the Tribe's constitution, rendered inapplicable to the Tribe and its members special federal statutory protections for Indians, and made state laws applicable to the Tribe and its members in the same way that they apply to all ""other persons or citizens.""  In 1980, the Tribe brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioners (South Carolina and other claimants to the 225-square-mile tract), seeking possession of the tract and trespass damages for the period of its dispossession on the ground that the 1840 conveyance to South Carolina was null and void because the United States never consented to it, as required by the Nonintercourse Act to make it effective.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, in part on the ground that the Tribe's claim was barred by the South Carolina statute of limitations.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under its interpretation of the Catawba Act, the state statute of limitations did not apply.
Held:  The explicit redefinition of the relationship between the Federal Government and respondent Tribe reflected in the Catawba Act's clear language requires the application of the state statute of limitations to the Tribe's claim.  But whether that statute bars the claim should be determined by the Court of Appeals on remand.  Pp.  476 U. S. 506-511.

In 1760 and 1763, respondent Indian Tribe surrendered to Great Britain its aboriginal territory in return for the right to settle permanently on a 225-square-mile tract of land now located in South Carolina.  In 1840, the Tribe conveyed the tract to South Carolina in return for the State's establishing a new reservation for the Tribe.  In 1959, Congress, pursuant to its changed policies concerning Indian affairs, enacted the Catawba Indian Tribe Division of Assets Act (Catawba Act) authorizing a division of Catawba tribal assets.  Section 5 of that Act provided for revocation of the Tribe's constitution, rendered inapplicable to the Tribe and its members special federal statutory protections for Indians, and made state laws applicable to the Tribe and its members in the same way that they apply to all ""other persons or citizens.""  In 1980, the Tribe brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioners (South Carolina and other claimants to the 225-square-mile tract), seeking possession of the tract and trespass damages for the period of its dispossession on the ground that the 1840 conveyance to South Carolina was null and void because the United States never consented to it, as required by the Nonintercourse Act to make it effective.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, in part on the ground that the Tribe's claim was barred by the South Carolina statute of limitations.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under its interpretation of the Catawba Act, the state statute of limitations did not apply.
Held:  The explicit redefinition of the relationship between the Federal Government and respondent Tribe reflected in the Catawba Act's clear language requires the application of the state statute of limitations to the Tribe's claim.  But whether that statute bars the claim should be determined by the Court of Appeals on remand.  Pp.  476 U. S. 506-511.

Syllabus 
The Communications Act of 1934 (Act) grants to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broad authority to develop and regulate ""interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication,"" 47 U.S.C.  151, but also provides that ""nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to (1) charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communication service,""  152(b).  In 1980 and 1981, the FCC issued orders changing its prior rules concerning practices for depreciating telephone plant and equipment.  Subsequently, upon the petition of private telephone companies, the FCC ruled that  220 of the Act, which expressly directs the FCC to prescribe depreciation practices, operated to preempt inconsistent state depreciation regulations for intrastate ratemaking purposes, and that, as an alternative ground, federal displacement of state regulation was justified as being necessary to avoid frustration of validly adopted federal policies.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 152(b) bars federal preemption of state regulation over depreciation of dual jurisdiction property for intrastate ratemaking purposes.  Pp.  476 U. S. 368-379.
(a) Sections 151 and 152(b) are naturally reconciled to define a national goal of the creation of a rapid and efficient telephone service, and to enact a dual regulatory system to achieve that goal.  P.  476 U. S. 370.
(b) Neither the legislative history of  152(b) nor the Act's structure supports the view that the words ""charges,"" ""classifications,"" and ""practices,"" as used in  152(b), were intended to refer only to ""customer charges"" for specific services, and not to depreciation charges.  Those words are terms of art that are to be interpreted by reference to the 
Page 476 U. S. 356
 trade to which they apply, and thus they embrace depreciation.  Pp.  476 U. S. 371-373.
(c) There is no merit to the argument that  152(b) does not control, because the plant involved is used interchangeably to provide both interstate and intrastate service, and that  152(b)'s reservation of authority to state commissions should be confined to intrastate matters that do not substantially affect interstate communication.  Although state regulation will generally be displaced to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, a federal agency may preempt state law only when and if it is acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority.  Here,  152(b) constitutes a congressional denial of power to the FCC to require state commissions to follow FCC depreciation practices for intrastate ratemaking purposes, and the FCC may not take ""preemptive"" action merely because it thinks such action will best effectuate federal policy.  Moreover, the Act itself establishes a process designed to resolve ""jurisdictional separations"" matters, by which process it may be determined what portion of an asset is employed to produce or deliver interstate, as opposed to intrastate, service, 47 U.S.C.  410(c).  Thus it is possible to apply different rates and methods of depreciation to plant once the correct allocation between interstate and intrastate use has been made.  Pp.  476 U. S. 373-376.
(d) Nor is there merit to the argument that  220, which directs the FCC to prescribe the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be included under operating expenses in fixing rates, and which prohibits carriers from departing from FCC-set regulations respecting depreciation, requires automatic preemption of all state regulation respecting depreciation.  The meaning of  220 is not so unambiguous or straightforward as to override  152(b)'s command that ""nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply or to give the Commission jurisdiction"" over intrastate service.

476 U.S. 380

Syllabus 
Appellee was formerly employed as a ship superintendent for a stevedoring company.  When he, with others, attempted to organize the company's ship superintendents and to affiliate with appellant Union, a union official allegedly assured them that the Union would get them their jobs back if they were discharged for participating in union-related activities.  After he was discharged apparently because of such activities, appellee filed a suit against appellant in an Alabama Circuit Court, alleging fraud and misrepresentation under an Alabama statute.  The case proceeded to trial, and a jury entered a verdict in appellee's favor.  Throughout the trial, appellant defended the suit on the merits, and not until its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict did it claim that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction because the suit was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The Circuit Court denied the motion and entered judgment on the verdict.  The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the preemption claim was a waivable defense that was required to be affirmatively pleaded under Alabama law, and that since it was not so pleaded, it was deemed waived.
Held:
1. The Alabama Supreme Court's holding that appellant had waived its preemption claim by noncompliance with state procedural rules governing affirmative defenses did not present an independent and adequate state ground supporting the court's judgment, and the court erred in declining to address that claim on the merits.  Pp.  476 U. S. 387-393.
2. The general standard for determining whether state proceedings are preempted by the NLRA, i.e., whether the conduct at issue was arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA, San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, is applicable to this case.  Where state law is preempted by the NLRA under Garmon and its progeny, the state courts lack the power to adjudicate the claims that trigger preemption.  Here, if appellee was arguably an employee, rather than a supervisor, the preemption issue should be initially decided by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), not the state courts.  Because the preemption issue turns on appellee's status, the appellant's preemption claim must be supported by a showing sufficient to permit the NLRB to find that appellee was an employee.  On the 
Page 476 U. S. 381
 record, appellant has made no such showing.  The mere lack of a conclusive determination by the NLRB as to appellee's status does not make out an arguable case for preemption.  Pp.  476 U. S. 394-399.

Syllabus 
Petitioner shippers brought class actions in Federal District Court against respondent motor carriers and respondent ratemaking bureau, alleging that, during the years 1966 through 1981, respondents engaged in a conspiracy, in violation of the Sherman Act, to fix rates for transporting freight between the United States and Canada without complying with an agreement filed by the bureau with, and approved by, the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Petitioners sought treble damages, measured by the difference between the allegedly higher rates they paid and the rates they would have paid in a freely competitive market, and also sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court dismissed the complaints on the authority of Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U. S. 156, wherein it was held that a private shipper could not recover treble damages under  7 of the Sherman Act in connection with ICC-filed tariffs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal as to the treble damages claims.
Held:  Petitioners are not entitled to bring a treble damages antitrust action.  Keogh, supra.  Pp.  476 U. S. 415-423.
(a) Nothing in the Reed-Bulwinkle Act or in its legislative history indicates that Congress intended to change or supplant the Keogh rule.  Similarly, there is no evidence that Congress, in enacting the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, intended to change the Keogh rule.  And cases like Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound Conference, 383 U. S. 213, emphasizing the necessity to strictly construe immunity of collective ratemaking activities from antitrust laws, do not render Keogh invalid.  Pp.  476 U. S. 417-422.
(b) The various developments that have occurred since Keogh -- the development of class actions, the emergence of precedents permitting treble damages even when there is an available regulatory remedy, greater sophistication in evaluating damages, and the development of procedures in which judicial proceedings can be stayed pending regulatory proceedings -- are insufficient to overcome the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute.

Syllabus 
On the application of a customer of respondent, a bank issued a standby letter of credit for respondent's benefit in the amount of $145,200.  The letter of credit provided that a draft drawn upon it would be honored by the bank only if accompanied by respondent's signed statement that the customer had failed to make payment for invoiced goods.  On the same day that the letter of credit was issued, the customer executed an unsecured promissory note in the bank's favor.  The customer and the bank understood the liability on the note to be contingent on respondent's presenting drafts on the letter of credit after the customer's nonpayment.  Subsequently, the bank was declared insolvent, and petitioner Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed its receiver.  Respondent then presented to the FDIC drafts on the letter of credit for payment of over $700,000 worth of goods delivered to the customer before the bank became insolvent.  When the drafts were returned unpaid, respondent sued the FDIC in Federal District Court, alleging that the letter of credit backed by a promissory note was an insured deposit under the definition of ""deposit"" in 12 U.S.C.  1813(1)(1) as an unpaid balance of ""money or its equivalent"" received or held by a bank that, inter alia, is evidenced by a letter of credit, and that therefore respondent was entitled to $100,000 in deposit insurance, this being the maximum amount insured by the FDIC.  The District Court agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A standby letter of credit backed by a contingent promissory note does not give rise to an insured deposit.  This has been the FDIC's longstanding interpretation, and such interpretation is consistent with Congress' purpose in creating federal deposit insurance to protect the assets and ""hard earnings"" that businesses and individuals have entrusted to banks.  This purpose would not be furthered by extending deposit insurance to cover a standby letter of credit backed by a contingent promissory note, which involves no such surrender of assets or hard earnings to the bank's custody.  In this case, the bank was not in possession of

 Ronald S. MONROEv. Frank BLACKBURN, Warden.No. 84-6667 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 27, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of 
certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case to resolve the serious questions it raises concerning the scope of a defendant's rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), during the period following his conviction. While lower courts here have adhered to our precedents in finding petitioner's Brady rights to have been violated, the remedy ordered impermissibly dilutes those rights even as it recognizes them. 
 I  
 In 1980, after a previous conviction had been overturned, petitioner was brought to trial in New Orleans, once again charged with the 1978 murder of Lenora Collins, a neighbor. The State's case consisted of eyewitness identifications by the victim's two children, both of whom were present when the assailant broke into their mother's bedroom. State v. Monroe, 397 So.2d 1258, 1268 (La.1981). Accepting the testimony of the two children, who at the time of the murder were aged 12 and 11, the jury re- 
Page 476 U.S. 1145 , 1146
 jected petitioner's alibi, found him guilty of first-degree murder, and unanimously recommended the death sentence. 
 Six months after petitioner's conviction, but while his appeal was still pending, the New Orleans Police Department was contacted by Detective Joseph Gallardo of the Pontiac, Michigan, Police Department. In the course of investigating one George Stinson's murder of his common-law wife in Michigan, Gallardo had received information suggesting that Stinson may also have murdered his previous wife, three years earlier in New Orleans. His previous wife was Lenora Collins, for whose murder petitioner has been sentenced to die. Two months later, Detective Gallardo again called the New Orleans police. This time, he related to Sergeant John McKenzie the substance of an interview he had had with Stinson's cellmate during which the cellmate had quoted Stinson as first confessing to the Michigan murder and then saying that ""the same thing happened"" to his first wife, Lenora Collins. Noting that a second source had corroborated this admission, Detective Gallardo also reported having received information that Stinson had threatened Lenora Collins' two children into identifying petitioner as their mother's killer. 
 All this information was carefully recorded by Sergeant McKenzie, who then dispatched his notes to the detectives who had been involved in the Collins investigation. These notes did not trigger further police inquiries. Neither was their existence ever disclosed to petitioner, who under Louisiana law, could have sought the remand of his case so that he might move in the trial court for a new trial. See State v. Spell, 388 So. 2d 754 (La.1980). Indeed, it was not until late 1983 that independent investigation by petitioner's counsel led him to Detective Gallardo, who told of Stinson's incriminating admissions and of the fact that the New Orleans police had long before known of the new evidence. Petitioner thereupon filed a motion in New Orleans Criminal District Court seeking a new trial or, in the alternative, postconviction relief, and also a stay of his execution, then scheduled for January 4, 1984. In this motion, petitioner claimed that the State had unconstitutionally suppressed material, exculpatory evidence. While petitioner was still unaware of the existence of Sergeant McKenzie's actual notes, his counsel's independent efforts in Pontiac enabled him to present the Criminal District Court with all of the information contained in the notes.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 27, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of 
certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Texas Association of Concerned Taxpayers challenges the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 324 (TEFRA), on the ground that it was enacted in violation of the Origination Clause of the United States Constitution, which provides that ""[a]ll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives."" Art. I , 7, cl. 1. Specifically, petitioner asserts that when the bill originated in the House of Representatives, it was not a ""bill for raising revenue"" within the meaning of the Origination Clause because the net effect of the bill would have been to reduce the amount of revenue collected. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that this issue was a nonjusticiable political question. 772 F.2d 163, 165-167 ( CA5 1985). This holding conflicts with the Ninth Circuit's explicit holding with respect to an identical challenge to TEFRA that the Origination Clause issue was in fact justiciable. See Armstrong v. United States, 759 F.2d 1378, 1381-1382 (CA9 1985). See also Wardell v. United States, 757 F.2d 203 (CA8 1985) (per curiam) (adjudicating same claim on the merits); Heitman v. United States, 753 F.2d 33 (CA6 1984) (per curiam) (same). The Fifth Circuit's holding is also in tension with this Court's decision in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U.S. 107, 142-143, 345 (1911), in which we also adjudicated an Origination Clause challenge to a statute.

 Rudy J. RAMIREZv. CALIFORNIA.No. 85-1321 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 27, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California. 
 The petition for a writ of 
certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Rudy Ramirez is currently serving a prison term imposed by the State of California for a crime committed before January 1, 1983. As of that date, a new plan for awarding sentence reduction credits and their forfeiture became effective. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. 2931, 2932 (West Supp.1986). Ramirez was charged in January 1983 with altering the paperwork relating to a television set. This resulted in a loss under the new plan of 95 days of behavior credits, which was later reduced to 48 days. Under the old plan, Ramirez would have forfeited at most 15 days. [ Ramirez v. California 476 U.S. 1152 (1986) ][1152-Continued.] 
 Ramirez then filed a habeas corpus petition in the California state courts, challenging the application to him of the new system on the ground that such application violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. Art. I, 10. A divided California Supreme Court upheld the new system, as applied to Ramirez, applying the two-part test set forth in Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 29, 964, 67 L. Ed.2d 17 (1981), and concluding that the new provisions were not unconstitutionally retrospective because the increased sanctions were imposed only for misconduct occurring after the changes became effective. In re Ramirez, 39 Cal.3d 931, 218 Cal.Rptr. 324, 705 P.2d 897 (1985). 
 The decision of the California Supreme Court conflicts with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Beebe v. Phelps, 650 F.2d 774 (CA5 1981). In Beebe, the Fifth Circuit held that the application of new provisions for revoking previously earned credits for parole violations to a prisoner who had been incarcerated before the new provisions became effective violated the Ex Post Facto Clause even where the parole violations occurred after the effective date of the new provisions. The decision of the California Supreme Court also is in tension with our decision in Weaver, supra, in which we held that the application to a prisoner of a new system for earning good-time credits, which system reduced the credits that could be earned, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. See also Greenfield v. Scafati, 277 F.Supp. 644 ( Mass.1967), summarily aff'd, 390 U.S. 713 ( 1968). In Weaver, we analyzed the question of retrospectivity according to whether the new rule ""substantially alters the consequences 
Page 476 U.S. 1152 , 1153
 attached to a crime already completed,"" 450 U.S., at 33, and the California Supreme Court's distinction here between the ability to earn good-time credits, at issue in Weaver, and the forfeiture of such credits, at issue here, does not seem immediately relevant to this analysis. To resolve the conflict with Beebe and the tension with Greenfield and Weaver, I would grant certiorari and set the case for argument.

 Ronald J. STRAIGHTv. WAINWRIGHT, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections, et al.No. A-892(85-6947) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 20, 1986
 The order heretofore entered staying the execution of the sentence of death until 5 p.m., May 20, 1986, is vacated. The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice REHNQUIST, and Justice O'CONNOR, concurring in the denial of a stay. 
 In view of the discussion in the dissents, I write to summarize my reasons for voting to deny a stay in this case. 
 Ronald Straight is here on his second federal habeas corpus petition. In his first petition, Straight argued that he was handicapped by the reasonable belief of trial counsel and the trial judge that Florida law barred the introduction of nonstatutory mitigating evidence at capital sentencing proceedings. Cf. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978). The District Court denied relief on this claim, and on Straight's other claims as well, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Straight v. Wainwright, 772 F.2d 674 (CA11 1985). Less than seven weeks ago, this Court denied Straight's petition for certiorari, a petition that again raised his Lockett argument. 475 U.S. 1099 (1986). 
 In his second habeas petition, filed late yesterday, Straight raises the same substantive legal claim, and adds various new 
Page 476 U.S. 1132 , 1133
 factual allegations in support. The District Court properly found that, to the extent Straight seeks to relitigate the same claims raised earlier, his petition should be dismissed under Habeas Corpus Rule 9(b) as a successive petition. The court also found that, to the extent that Straight sought to make new arguments that plainly could have been raised earlier, his petition was an abuse of the writ. See Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.S. 377, 378-380, 752-754 (1984) ( POWELL, J., joined by BURGER, C.J., and BLACKMUN, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., concurring). The Court of Appeals found no error in the District Court's disposition, and denied a certificate of probable cause to appeal. The Court of Appeals granted a stay of execution until noon today to permit this Court to consider Straight's belated application for a stay and petition for certiorari. [Footnote 1] 

 I find no basis for concluding that the District Court abused its discretion. Applicant has not offered any reason why he should be permitted to relitigate his Lockett claim, nor has he justified his previous failure to allege the supporting factual grounds on which he now relies. Thus, the District Court's decision to deny relief based on Rule 9 was plainly correct. That being the case, there is no ground for reaching the merits argument that the dissenting opinions now rely on. [Footnote 2] [476 U.S. 1132 , 1134]

Decided May 19, 1986
476 U.S. 207

Syllabus 
The Santa Clara, Cal., police received an anonymous telephone tip that marijuana was growing in respondent's backyard, which was enclosed by two fences and shielded from view at ground level.  Officers who were trained in marijuana identification secured a private airplane, flew over respondent's house at an altitude of 1,000 feet, and readily identified marijuana plants growing in the yard.  A search warrant was later obtained on the basis of one of the officer's naked-eye observations; a photograph of the surrounding area taken from the airplane was attached as an exhibit.  The warrant was executed, and marijuana plants were seized.  After the California trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the evidence of the search, he pleaded guilty to a charge of cultivation of marijuana.  The California Court of Appeal reversed on the ground that the warrantless aerial observation of respondent's yard violated the Fourth Amendment.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment was not violated by the naked-eye aerial observation of respondent's backyard.  Pp.  476 U. S. 211-215.
(a) The touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis is whether a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy, which involves the two inquiries of whether the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search, and whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.  Ratz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347.  In pursuing the second inquiry, the test of legitimacy is not whether the individual chooses to conceal assertedly ""private activity,"" but whether the government's intrusion infringes upon the personal and societal values protected by the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  476 U. S. 211-212.
(b) On the record here, respondent's expectation of privacy from all observations of his backyard was unreasonable.  That the backyard and its crop were within the ""curtilage"" of respondent's home did not itself bar all police observation.  The mere fact that an individual has taken measures to restrict some views of his activities does not preclude an officer's observation from a public vantage point where he has a right to be and which renders the activities clearly visible.  The police observations here took place within public navigable airspace, in a physically nonintrusive manner.  The police were able to observe the plants 
Page 476 U. S. 208
 readily discernible to the naked eye as marijuana, and it was irrelevant that the observation from the airplane was directed at identifying the plants and that the officers were trained to recognize marijuana.  Any member of the public flying in this airspace who cared to glance down could have seen everything that the officers observed.  The Fourth Amendment simply does not require police traveling in the public airways at 1,000 feet to obtain a warrant in order to observe what is visible to the naked eye.  Pp.  476 U. S. 212-215.

No. 84-1259
Argued December 10, 1985
Decided May 19, 1986
476 U.S. 227

Syllabus 
Petitioner operates a 2,000-acre chemical plant consisting of numerous covered buildings, with outdoor manufacturing equipment and piping conduits located between the various buildings exposed to visual observation from the air.  Petitioner maintains elaborate security around the perimeter of the complex, barring ground-level public views of the area.  When petitioner denied a request by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for an on-site inspection of the plant, EPA did not seek an administrative search warrant, but instead employed a commercial aerial photographer, using a standard precision aerial mapping camera, to take photographs of the facility from various altitudes, all of which were within lawful navigable airspace.  Upon becoming aware of the aerial photography, petitioner brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that EPA's action violated the Fourth Amendment and was beyond its statutory investigative authority.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that EPA's aerial observation did not exceed its investigatory authority and that the aerial photography of petitioner's plant complex without a warrant was not a search prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.
Held:
1. The fact that aerial photography by petitioner's competitors might be barred by state trade secrets law is irrelevant to the questions presented in this case.  Governments do not generally seek to appropriate trade secrets of the private sector, and the right to be free of appropriation of trade secrets is protected by law.  Moreover, state tort law governing unfair competition does not define the limits of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  476 U. S. 231-233.
2. The use of aerial observation and photography is within EPA's statutory authority.  When Congress invests an agency such as EPA with enforcement and investigatory authority, it is not necessary to identify explicitly every technique that may be used in the course of executing the statutory mission.  Although  114(a) of the Clean Air Act, which provides for EPA's right of entry to premises for inspection purposes, 
Page 476 U. S. 228
 does not authorize aerial observation, that section appears to expand, not restrict, EPA's general investigatory powers, and there is no suggestion in the statute that the powers conferred by  114(a) are intended to be exclusive.  EPA needs no explicit statutory provision to employ methods of observation commonly available to the public at large.  Pp.  476 U. S. 233-234.
3. EPA's taking, without a warrant, of aerial photographs of petitioner's plant complex from an aircraft lawfully in public navigable airspace was not a search prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.  The open areas of an industrial plant complex such as petitioner's are not analogous to the ""curtilage"" of a dwelling, which is entitled to protection as a place where the occupants have a reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy that society is prepared to accept.  See California v. Ciraolo, ante, p.  476 U. S. 207.  The intimate activities associated with family privacy and the home and its curtilage simply do not reach the outdoor areas or spaces between structures and buildings of a manufacturing plant.  For purposes of aerial surveillance, the open areas of an industrial complex are more comparable to an ""open field"" in which an individual may not legitimately demand privacy.  Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170.  Here, EPA was not employing some unique sensory device not available to the public, but rather was employing a conventional, albeit precise, commercial camera commonly used in mapmaking.  The photographs were not so revealing of intimate details as to raise constitutional concerns.  The mere fact that human vision is enhanced somewhat, at least to the degree here, does not give rise to constitutional problems.  Pp.  476 U. S. 234-239.

No. 85-385
Argued April 1, 1986
Decided May 19, 1986
476 U.S. 253

Syllabus 
During the time pertinent to this case, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) (later repealed) required that qualified entities (such as respondent county), receiving federal grants for programs providing job training and employment opportunities for economically disadvantaged, unemployed, or underemployed persons, comply with the statute and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (Secretary).  Section 106(b) of CETA provided that the Secretary shall investigate whenever he has reason to believe, through a complaint, an audit, or otherwise, that a grant recipient was misusing CETA funds, and further provided that the Secretary ""shall"" determine ""the truth of the allegation or belief involved, not later than 120 days after receiving the complaint.""  Labor Department audits with respect to two grants that respondent had received raised questions concerning respondent's costs related to ineligible employees, and were filed with the Department's Grant Officer, but his final determinations disallowing such costs in each instance were not issued within 120 days after the audit reports were filed.  On review of both final determinations, an Administrative Law Judge, although reducing the amount of the disallowance in each case, rejected respondent's contention that the Secretary could not order respondent to repay such sums because the final determination was not issued within the 120-day period and respondent had suffered prejudice because of the delay.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  106(b) prevented the Secretary from acting unless his final determination was made within the 120-day period after the audits were filed.
Held:  The Secretary does not lose the power to recover misused CETA funds after expiration of the 120-day period specified in  106(b).  Pp.  476 U. S. 258-266.
(a) The mere use of the word ""shall"" in  106(b), standing alone, is not enough to remove the Secretary's power to act after 120 days.  Every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement does not void subsequent agency action, especially when important public rights are at stake.  When, as here, there are less drastic remedies available for failure to meet a statutory deadline, courts should not assume that Congress intended that the agency lose its power to act.  Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807, distinguished.  There is no merit to respondent's 
Page 476 U. S. 254
 contention that statutes setting deadlines for agency action should be interpreted to permit the agency to proceed after the deadline has expired only when agency inaction would prejudice a private citizen seeking some sort of redress, and that, when agency inaction will injure only the Federal Treasury, courts should read a command like that of  106(b) as a statute of limitations or jurisdictional bar.  Pp.  476 U. S. 258-262.
(b) Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to impose a jurisdictional limitation on the Secretary's enforcement powers if he failed to issue a final determination on a complaint or audit within 120 days.  Rather, the 120-day provision was clearly intended to spur the Secretary to action in discovering and rectifying abuses of grant recipients, not to limit the scope of his authority.  Pp.  476 U. S. 262-266.
(c) Nor is there any merit to the contention that the Secretary's regulations established a jurisdictional bar to the Secretary's recovery of funds.  The regulations merely provided a timetable for the resolution of complaints and audits.  And there is no authority in the statute or legislative history for the courts to create a remedy by treating  106(b) like a statute of limitations that can vary depending on the complexity of the dispute or the culpability of the grant recipient.  Pp.  476 U. S. 265-266.

476 U.S. 267

Syllabus 
The collective bargaining agreement between respondent Board of Education (Board) and a teachers' union provided that, if it became necessary to lay off teachers, those with the most seniority would be retained, except that at no time would there be a greater percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time of the layoff.  After this layoff provision was upheld in litigation arising from the Board's noncompliance with the provision, the Board adhered to it, with the result that, during certain school years, nonminority teachers were laid off, while minority teachers with less seniority were retained.  Petitioners, displaced nonminority teachers, brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause and certain federal and state statutes.  Dismissing the suit on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld the constitutionality of the layoff provision, holding that the racial preferences granted by the Board need not be grounded on a finding of prior discrimination but were permissible under the Equal Protection Clause as an attempt to remedy societal discrimination by providing ""role models"" for minority schoolchildren.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
746 F.2d 1152, reversed.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE REHNQUIST, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that the layoff provision violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  476 U. S. 273-278.
(a) In the context of affirmative action, racial classifications must be justified by a compelling state purpose, and the means chosen by the State to effectuate that purpose must be narrowly tailored.  Pp.  476 U. S. 273-274.
(b) Societal discrimination alone is insufficient to justify a racial classification.  Rather, there must be convincing evidence of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications to remedy such discrimination.  The ""role model"" theory employed by the District Court would allow the Board to engage in discriminatory hiring and layoff practices long past the point required by any legitimate remedial purpose.  Moreover, it does not 
Page 476 U. S. 268
 bear any relationship to the harm caused by prior discriminatory hiring practices.  Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for finding race-conscious state action and for imposing a racially classified remedy.  Pp.  476 U. S. 274-276.
(c) If the purpose of the layoff provision was to remedy prior discrimination, as the Board claims, such purpose, to be constitutionally valid, would require the District Court to make a factual determination that the Board had a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.  No such finding has ever been made.  Pp.  476 U. S. 277-278.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, as a means of accomplishing purposes that otherwise may be legitimate, the layoff provision is not sufficiently narrowly tailored.  Other, less intrusive means of accomplishing similar purposes -- such as the adoption of hiring goals -- are available .  Pp.  476 U. S. 279-284.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that respondent Board of Education's layoff policy has the same effect, and is equally violative of the Equal Protection Clause, as integrating a workforce by discharging whites and hiring blacks until the latter comprise a suitable percentage of the workforce.  Pp.  476 U. S. 294-295.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that the layoff provision is not ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve its asserted remedial purpose, because it acts to maintain levels of minority hiring set by a hiring goal that has no relation to the remedying of employment discrimination.  Pp.  476 U. S. 293-294.

JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concluded that, as a means of accomplishing purposes that otherwise may be legitimate, the layoff provision is not sufficiently narrowly tailored.  Other, less intrusive means of accomplishing similar purposes -- such as the adoption of hiring goals -- are available .  Pp.  476 U. S. 279-284.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that respondent Board of Education's layoff policy has the same effect, and is equally violative of the Equal Protection Clause, as integrating a workforce by discharging whites and hiring blacks until the latter comprise a suitable percentage of the workforce.  Pp.  476 U. S. 294-295.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that the layoff provision is not ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve its asserted remedial purpose, because it acts to maintain levels of minority hiring set by a hiring goal that has no relation to the remedying of employment discrimination.  Pp.  476 U. S. 293-294.

No. 84-1744
Argued April 1, 1986
Decided May 19, 1986
476 U.S. 321

Syllabus 
The Speedy Trial Act (Act) commands that a defendant be tried within 70 days of the latest of either the filing of an indictment or information, or the first appearance before a judge or magistrate.  However, a provision of the Act, 18 U.S.C.  3161(h)(1)(F) (hereafter subsection (F)), excludes from this time
""[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including . . . delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.""
With regard to petitioners, who were ultimately convicted in Federal District Court of charges relating to the manufacture, possession, and distribution of controlled substances, the Act's 70-day period commenced on September 3, 1980, but the trial did not begin until November 1, 1982, because of various delays, including those resulting from overlapping filings by petitioners and the Government with respect to a motion to suppress certain evidence, a hearing and posthearing submissions by the parties on that motion, petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the court's denial of the motion to suppress, and petitioners' motion to dismiss the indictment because of violation of the Act.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' convictions, rejecting their contention that, under subsection (F), only delays that were ""reasonably necessary"" could be excluded from the Act's 70-day period.
Held:
1. Congress intended subsection (F) to exclude from the Act's 70-day limitation all time between the filing of a pretrial motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is ""reasonably necessary.""  The plain terms of the statute exclude all time between the filing of and the hearing on a motion, whether that hearing was prompt or not.  Moreover, Congress' express use of the phrase ""reasonable period of delay"" in another provision of the statute indicates that the exclusion of the period defined in subsection (F) was intended to be automatic.  The legislative history also supports this reading of subsection (F).  Nor does the phrase ""or other prompt disposition"" in subsection (F) imply that only reasonably necessary delays may be excluded between the time of filing and the conclusion of 
Page 476 U. S. 322
 the hearing.  That language was intended to apply to situations where motions are decided on the papers filed without a hearing.  Pp.  476 U. S. 326-330.
2. Subsection (F) also excludes time after a hearing on a motion where the District Court awaits additional filings from the parties that are needed for proper disposition of the motion.  Although the language of the statute is not clear on this point, its structure requires that such time be excluded.  Pp.  476 U. S. 330-331.
3. Under the facts in this case, there were only 69 nonexcludable days of delay before petitioners' trial, and therefore the Act was not violated.  Pp.  476 U. S. 331-333.

Syllabus 
Certain provisions of the Social Security Act in effect between 1979 and 1983 authorized payment of survivor's benefits to a wage-earner's widowed spouse who remarried after age 60, but not to a similarly situated divorced widowed spouse.  After being administratively denied survivor's benefits under these provisions because she had remarried, appellee divorced widow filed a class action in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the provisions.  The court upheld the challenge, reasoning that, because Congress in 1977 had chosen to treat surviving divorced spouses and widowed spouses in the same manner upon the wage-earner's death, there was no logical basis for distinguishing between the two classes of individuals upon their subsequent remarriage.
Held:  The provisions in question did not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  476 U. S. 345-350.
(a) When Congress decided to create some exceptions to the rule under which widowed spouses would lose their entitlement to survivor's benefits upon remarriage, it was not required to take an all-or-nothing approach, but instead had valid reasons for proceeding more cautiously.  Faced with concerns about the increase in the benefits that would ensue if the remarriage rule were completely eliminated, Congress reasonably could decide to concentrate limited funds where the need was likely to be greatest.  Pp.  476 U. S. 346-348.
(b) Because divorced widowed spouses did not enter into remarriage with the same level of dependency on the wage-earner's account as widows or widowers, it was rational for Congress to treat these groups differently after remarriage.  Any inference that, because both divorced widowed spouses and widowed spouses were entitled to survivor's benefits, Congress viewed the groups as equally dependent on the wage-earner, is belied by the history and provisions of the Act.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 19, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to 
Page 476 U.S. 1126 , 1127
 proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice REHNQUIST and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 Miller was charged with ""misapplication of funds"" in connection with the 1978 construction of several homes. The Florida statute under which Miller was charged provides that one of the elements of the crime, the "" intent to defraud,"" can be prima facie established by the ""failure to pay for such labor, services or materials furnished for this specific improvement after receipt of such proceeds."" Fla.Stat. 713.34(3) (1985). 
 The state trial court instructed the jury that 
 Miller was found guilty and sentenced to 6 months in county jail and 141/2 years' probation. After Miller's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, he brought this federal habeas action. The District Court denied the application. 
 The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, 775 F.2d 1572 ( 1985), holding that the jury instructions could have been interpreted as creating a ""mandatory rebuttable presumption"" in violation of Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307 (1985), and Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510 (1979). Although this holding was sufficient to dispose of the application, the court went on to hold that the statute under which Miller was convicted was unconstitutional. Since the improper jury instructions were a "" verbatim"" rendition of the statute, the court reasoned, the statute, like the instructions, must fail. 
 Even if the jury instructions were impermissible under Franklin and Sandstrom, by striking down the underlying statute the Court of Appeals' decision flies in the face of Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140 (1979), where we considered a facial attack upon a New York statute on the grounds that it impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. As the Court explained, a facial attack to a statute on these grounds will fail if the statute creates [476 U.S. 1126 , 1128]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 19, 1986
 On petition for writ of 
certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice O'CONNOR join, dissenting. 
 In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that an allegation that a State has violated the Commerce Clause is not cognizable in an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983. 503 A.2d 214 (1986). This decision, while supported by the weight of authority, see, e.g., Consolidated Freightways Corp. v. Kassel, 730 F.2d 1139 (CA8), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 834 (1984), conflicts with the holding in Kennecott Corp. v. Smith, 637 F.2d 181, 186, n. 5 (CA3 1980). I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict. 
 This case also presents the question whether persons subjected to an unconstitutional tax, the nonpayment of which is a crime, may bring a refund action under the Fourteenth Amendment if no state refund procedure is available. The Supreme Judicial Court recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment may require a refund of unconstitutional taxes paid under compulsion. See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363, 369, 123 (1930); Ward v. Board of County Comm'rs, 253 U.S. 17, 24, 422 (1920). However, the court rejected the "" implied duress"" theory of Atchison, T. & S.F. R. Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U.S. 280, 286, 217 (1912), and held that petitioners have no right of recovery under the Fourteenth Amendment 
Page 476 U.S. 1129 , 1130
 because they failed to present evidence that the State actually threatened them with arrest or seizure of personal property if they failed to pay the tax in question. Because this holding calls into question the continuing vitality of Atchison, I would grant certiorari on this issue as well.

Syllabus 
California's application to stay enforcement of the California Supreme Court's judgment invalidating respondent's death sentence is granted.  The State Supreme Court's judgment was based on its holdings that the failure to properly instruct the jury at respondent's murder trial on the issue of intent to kill violated his right to due process under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, and that such error was not harmless.  The State seeks the stay so that it can petition for certiorari to raise the question of the proper constitutional standard for determining prejudice with regard to Sandstrom errors.  Since the outcome here may well be affected by the decision in another, pending case, it is likely that a majority of this Court would not want to dispose of the petition for certiorari in this case before a decision is rendered in such other case.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, husband and wife, who owned a building housing a restaurant and apartments, were charged with various crimes in connection with a fire in the building that resulted in the killing of two tenants.  At the close of the prosecution's case in chief at their bench trial in a Pennsylvania state court, petitioners challenged the sufficiency of the evidence by filing a demurrer pursuant to a Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure.  The trial court sustained the demurrer, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court quashed the Commonwealth's appeal on the ground that it was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed, holding that the granting of a demurrer is not the functional equivalent of an acquittal, and that, for purposes of considering a plea of double jeopardy, a defendant who demurs at the close of the prosecution's case in chief ""elects to seek dismissal on grounds unrelated to his factual guilt or innocence.""
Held:  The trial judge's granting of petitioners' demurrer was an acquittal under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the Commonwealth's appeal was barred because reversal would have led to further trial proceedings.  Whether the trial is to a jury or, as here, to the bench, subjecting the defendant to postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Syllabus 
Petitioners robbed a bank van of $281,000 in cash and killed the guards by dumping them into a lake in sacks weighted with rocks.  Petitioners were convicted of first-degree murder in an Arizona state court.  At a separate hearing, while finding that the statutory aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed for ""pecuniary gain"" was not present because it applied only to contract killings, the trial judge sentenced petitioners to death upon finding that the statutory aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed in ""an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner"" was present.  The Arizona Supreme Court, while reversing and remanding for a retrial on other grounds, held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of the ""especially heinous"" circumstance, but that the trial judge erred in finding the ""pecuniary gain"" circumstance limited to contract killings, and that, if petitioners were again convicted, the judge might find this circumstance present.  On remand, petitioners were again convicted of first-degree murder and the trial judge again sentenced them to death, finding that both the ""pecuniary gain"" and ""especially heinous"" circumstances were present.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioners' argument that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred reimposition of the death penalty.  The court found the evidence still insufficient to support the ""especially heinous"" circumstance, but sufficient to support the ""pecuniary gain"" circumstance.
Held:  Reimposing the death penalty on petitioners did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  476 U. S. 152-157.
(a) When a conviction is reversed on appeal, it is nullified and ""the slate wiped clean,'"" so that, if the defendant is convicted again, he may constitutionally be subjected to whatever punishment is lawful.  Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430,  451 U. S. 442.  This rationale is, however, inapplicable where a jury agrees or an appellate court decides that the prosecution ""has not proved its case.""  Id. at  451 U. S. 443.  Therefore, the relevant inquiry in these cases is whether the sentencing judge or the reviewing court has ""decided that the prosecution has not proved its case""

(b) The trial judge's rejection of the ""pecuniary gain"" aggravating circumstance was not an ""acquittal"" of that circumstance for double jeopardy purposes, and did not foreclose its consideration by the reviewing court.  Moreover, because the reviewing court did not find the evidence legally insufficient to justify imposition of the death penalty, there was no death penalty ""acquittal"" by that court.  The Double Jeopardy Clause, therefore, did not foreclose a second sentencing hearing at which the ""clean slate"" rule applied.  Pp.  476 U. S. 154-157.

Syllabus 
At respondent's Arkansas state court trial for capital felony murder, the judge at voir dire removed for cause, over respondent's objections, those prospective jurors who stated that they could not under any circumstances vote for the imposition of the death penalty -- that is, so-called ""Witherspoon-excludables"" under the principles of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510.  The jury convicted respondent, but, at the sentencing phase of the trial, it rejected the State's request for the death penalty and set punishment at life imprisonment without parole.  The conviction was affirmed on appeal, and respondent's petition for state postconviction relief was denied.  He then sought federal habeas corpus relief, contending that the ""death qualification"" of the jury by the removal for cause of the ""Witherspoon-excludables"" violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to have his guilt or innocence determined by an impartial jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community.  The District Court ruled that ""death qualification"" of the jury prior to the guilt phase of the bifurcated trial violated both the fair cross section and the impartiality requirements of the Constitution.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that removal for cause of ""Witherspoon-excludables"" violated respondent's Sixth Amendment right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community.
Held:  The Constitution does not prohibit the removal for cause, prior to the guilt phase of a bifurcated capital trial, of prospective jurors whose opposition to the death penalty is so strong that it would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors at the sentencing phase of the trial.  This is so even assuming, arguendo, that the social science studies introduced in the courts below were adequate to establish that ""death qualification"" in fact produces juries somewhat more ""conviction-prone"" than ""non-death-qualified"" juries.  Pp.  476 U. S. 173-183.
(a) ""Death qualification"" of a jury does not violate the fair cross section requirement of the Sixth Amendment, which applies to jury panels or venires but does not require that petit juries actually chosen reflect the composition of the community at large.  Even if the requirement were extended to petit juries, the essence of a fair cross section claim is the systematic exclusion of a ""distinctive group"" in the community 
Page 476 U. S. 163
 -- such as blacks, women, and Mexican-Americans -- for reasons completely unrelated to the ability of members of the group to serve as jurors in a particular case.  Groups defined solely in terms of shared attitudes that would prevent or substantially impair members of the group from performing one of their duties as jurors, such as the ""Witherspoon-excludables"" at issue here, are not ""distinctive groups"" for fair cross section purposes.  ""Death qualification"" is carefully designed to serve the State's legitimate interest in obtaining a single jury that can properly and impartially apply the law to the facts of the case at both the guilt and sentencing phases of a capital trial.  Pp.  476 U. S. 173-177.
(b) Nor does ""death qualification"" of a jury violate the constitutional right to an impartial jury on the theory asserted by respondent that, because all individual jurors are to some extent predisposed towards one result or another, a constitutionally impartial jury can be constructed only by ""balancing"" the various predispositions of the individual jurors, and when the State ""tips the scales"" by excluding prospective jurors with a particular viewpoint, an impermissibly partial jury results.  An impartial jury consists of nothing more than jurors who will conscientiously apply the law and find the facts.  Respondent's view of jury impartiality is both illogical and impractical.  Neither Witherspoon, supra, nor Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38, supports respondent's contention that a State violates the Constitution whenever it ""slants"" the jury by excluding a group of individuals more likely than the population at large to favor the defendant.  Here, the removal for cause of ""Witherspoon-excludables"" serves the State's entirely proper interest in obtaining a single jury (as required by Arkansas law) that could impartially decide all of the issues at both the guilt and the penalty phases of respondent's trial.  Moreover, both Witherspoon and Adams dealt With the special context of capital sentencing, where the range of jury discretion necessarily gave rise to far greater concern over the effects of an ""imbalanced"" jury.  The case at bar, by contrast, deals not with capital sentencing, but with the jury's more traditional role of finding the facts and determining the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant, where jury discretion is more channeled.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a black man, was indicted in Virginia on charges of capital murder for fatally shooting the white proprietor of a jewelry store in the course of a robbery.  During voir dire, the state trial judge refused petitioner's request to question the prospective jurors on racial prejudice.  The jury convicted petitioner, and, after a separate sentencing hearing, recommended that he be sentenced to death, a recommendation the trial judge accepted.  The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, rejecting petitioner's argument that the trial judge deprived him of a fair trial by refusing to question the prospective jurors on racial prejudice.  Petitioner then sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, which rejected the same argument and denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
753 F.2d 342, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and III, concluding that a defendant accused of an interracial capital crime is entitled to have prospective jurors informed of the victim's race and questioned on the issue of racial bias.  This rule is minimally intrusive.  As in other cases involving ""special circumstances,"" the trial judge retains discretion as to the form and number of questions, including whether to question the venire individually or collectively.  Also, a defendant cannot complain of a failure to question the venire on racial prejudice unless he has specifically requested such an inquiry.  Pp.  476 U. S. 29-33,  476 U. S. 36-37.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, JUSTICE STEVENS, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Parts II and IV that:
(1) The risk that racial prejudice may have infected petitioner's capital sentencing is unacceptable in light of the ease with which that risk, being especially serious in view of the finality of the death sentence, could have been minimized.  Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, distinguished.  Pp.  476 U. S. 33-36.
(2) While it is not necessary that petitioner be retried on the issue of guilt, there was an unacceptable risk of racial prejudice infecting the capital sentencing proceeding, and the inadequacy of the voir dire requires 
Page 476 U. S. 29
 that his death sentence be vacated.  This unacceptable risk arose from the conjunction of three factors:  the fact that the crime charged involved interracial violence, the broad discretion given the jury under Virginia law at the sentencing hearing, and the special seriousness of the risk of improper sentencing in a capital case.  Pp.  476 U. S. 37-38.

Syllabus 
Appellee physicians, who provide abortion services in Illinois, filed a class action in Federal District Court challenging the constitutionality of the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, as amended, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  Appellant pediatrician (hereafter appellant) filed a motion to intervene as a party defendant based on his conscientious objection to abortions and on his status as a pediatrician and as a parent of a minor daughter.  The District Court granted the motion without indicating whether the intervention was permissible or as of right.  Ultimately, the District Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of certain provisions of the law that impose criminal liability upon physicians for violation of the prescribed standards of care for performing abortions and the requirements for furnishing a patient with particular abortion-related information.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, and also permanently enjoined the enforcement of another related provision.  The State did not appeal to this Court, but filed a ""letter of interest"" under this Court's Rule 10.4, stating that its interest was identical to that advanced by it in the lower courts, and essentially coterminous with appellant's position.
Held:  Because appellant lacks any judicially cognizable interest in the Illinois Abortion Law, his appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Pp.  476 U. S. 61-71.
(a) The presence of a disagreement is insufficient, by itself, to meet Art. III's ""case"" or ""controversy"" requirement.  The party seeking judicial resolution of a dispute must also show that he personally suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the other party's allegedly illegal conduct.  Pp.  476 U. S. 61-62.
(b) Illinois' ""letter of interest"" is insufficient to bring the State into the suit as an appellant with standing to defend the statute's constitutionality in this Court.  While the State, as a party below, remains a party under Rule 10.4, that status does not equate with the status of appellant.  The State's failure to invoke this Court's jurisdiction leaves the Court without a ""case"" or ""controversy"" between appellee physicians and the State.  Pp.  476 U. S. 62-64. 
Page 476 U. S. 55

(c) Appellant's interests in enforcement of the statute do not permit him to defend it.  Only the State has a judicially cognizable interest in defending its criminal statutes.  Pp.  476 U. S. 64-65.
(d) Appellant's claims that his professional interests confer standing have no merit.  As a pediatrician. he has an interest, but no direct stake, in the abortion process.  This abstract concern does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art. III.  Similarly, appellant's claim of conscientious objection to abortion does not provide a judicially cognizable interest.  Nor can he maintain the appeal in his capacity as a parent, absent any showing that his daughter is currently a minor or otherwise incapable of asserting her own rights.  And he cannot assert any constitutional right of the unborn fetus, since only the State may invoke regulatory measures to protect that interest or the power of the courts when those measures are subject to challenge.  Pp.  476 U. S. 65-67.
(e) Neither appellant's status as an intervenor below, whether permissive or as of right, nor the fact that the District Court assessed attorney's fees against him and the State, confers standing to keep the case alive in the absence of the State on this appeal.  An intervenor's right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon the intervenor's showing that he satisfies Art. III's requirements, and appellant has not made such a showing.  As to the fee award, Art. III standing requires an injury with a nexus to the substantive character of the statute at issue, and the fee award bears no relation to the Illinois Abortion Law.  Pp.  476 U. S. 68-71.
Appeal dismissed.  Reported below:  749 F.2d 452.

(a) The presence of a disagreement is insufficient, by itself, to meet Art. III's ""case"" or ""controversy"" requirement.  The party seeking judicial resolution of a dispute must also show that he personally suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the other party's allegedly illegal conduct.  Pp.  476 U. S. 61-62.
(b) Illinois' ""letter of interest"" is insufficient to bring the State into the suit as an appellant with standing to defend the statute's constitutionality in this Court.  While the State, as a party below, remains a party under Rule 10.4, that status does not equate with the status of appellant.  The State's failure to invoke this Court's jurisdiction leaves the Court without a ""case"" or ""controversy"" between appellee physicians and the State.  Pp.  476 U. S. 62-64. 
Page 476 U. S. 55

(c) Appellant's interests in enforcement of the statute do not permit him to defend it.  Only the State has a judicially cognizable interest in defending its criminal statutes.  Pp.  476 U. S. 64-65.
(d) Appellant's claims that his professional interests confer standing have no merit.  As a pediatrician. he has an interest, but no direct stake, in the abortion process.  This abstract concern does not substitute for the concrete injury required by Art. III.  Similarly, appellant's claim of conscientious objection to abortion does not provide a judicially cognizable interest.  Nor can he maintain the appeal in his capacity as a parent, absent any showing that his daughter is currently a minor or otherwise incapable of asserting her own rights.  And he cannot assert any constitutional right of the unborn fetus, since only the State may invoke regulatory measures to protect that interest or the power of the courts when those measures are subject to challenge.  Pp.  476 U. S. 65-67.
(e) Neither appellant's status as an intervenor below, whether permissive or as of right, nor the fact that the District Court assessed attorney's fees against him and the State, confers standing to keep the case alive in the absence of the State on this appeal.  An intervenor's right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon the intervenor's showing that he satisfies Art. III's requirements, and appellant has not made such a showing.  As to the fee award, Art. III standing requires an injury with a nexus to the substantive character of the statute at issue, and the fee award bears no relation to the Illinois Abortion Law.  Pp.  476 U. S. 68-71.

No. 84-6263
Argued December 12, 1985
Decided April 30, 1986
476 U.S. 79

Syllabus 
During the criminal trial in a Kentucky state court of petitioner, a black man, the judge conducted voir dire examination of the jury venire and excused certain jurors for cause.  The prosecutor then used his peremptory challenges to strike all four black persons on the venire, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected.  Defense counsel moved to discharge the jury on the ground that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross-section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws.  Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted petitioner.  Affirming the conviction, the Kentucky Supreme Court observed that recently, in another case, it had relied on Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, and had held that a defendant alleging lack of a fair cross-section must demonstrate systematic exclusion of a group of jurors from the venire.
Held:
1. The principle announced in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, that a State denies a black defendant equal protection when it puts him on trial before a jury from which members of his race have been purposefully excluded, is reaffirmed.  Pp.  476 U. S. 84-89.
(a) A defendant has no right to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own race.  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303,  100 U. S. 305.  However, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the defendant that the State will not exclude members of his race from the jury venire on account of race, or on the false assumption that members of his race as a group are not qualified to serve as jurors.  By denying a person participation in jury service on account of his race, the State also unconstitutionally discriminates against the excluded juror.  Moreover, selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.  Pp.  476 U. S. 85-88.
(b) The same equal protection principles as are applied to determine whether there is discrimination in selecting the venire also govern the State's use of peremptory challenges to strike individual jurors from the petit jury.  Although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise 
Page 476 U. S. 80
 peremptory challenges for any reason, as long as that reason is related to his view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried, the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State's case against a black defendant.  Pp.  476 U. S. 88-89.
2. The portion of Swain v. Alabama, supra, concerning the evidentiary burden placed on a defendant who claims that he has been denied equal protection through the State's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges is rejected.  In Swain, it was held that a black defendant could make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination on proof that the peremptory challenge system as a whole was being perverted.  Evidence offered by the defendant in Swain did not meet that standard, because it did not demonstrate the circumstances under which prosecutors in the jurisdiction were responsible for striking black jurors beyond the facts of the defendant's case.  This evidentiary formulation is inconsistent with equal protection standards subsequently developed in decisions relating to selection of the jury venire.  A defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying solely on the facts concerning its selection in his case.  Pp.  476 U. S. 89-96.
3. A defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant's trial.  The defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race.  The defendant may also rely on the fact that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.  Finally, the defendant must show that such facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.  Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors.  The prosecutor may not rebut a prima facie showing by stating that he challenged the jurors on the assumption that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race or by affirming his good faith in individual selections.  Pp.  476 U. S. 96-98.
4. While the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in trial procedures, the above-stated principles will not undermine the contribution that the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.  Nor will application of such principles create serious administrative difficulties.  Pp.  476 U. S. 98-99. 
Page 476 U. S. 81

5. Because the trial court here flatly rejected petitioner's objection to the prosecutor's removal of all black persons on the venire without requiring the prosecutor to explain his action, the case is remanded for further proceedings.  P.  476 U. S. 100.
Reversed and remanded.

No. 84-6859
Argued February 24, 1986
Decided April 29, 1986
476 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder and rape after a jury trial in a South Carolina court.  The State sought the death penalty, and a separate sentencing hearing was held before the trial jury.  Following the State's introduction of evidence in aggravation of the offense, petitioner presented as mitigating evidence his own testimony and that of his former wife, his mother, his sister, and his grandmother.  He then sought to introduce testimony of two jailers and a ""regular visitor"" to the effect that he had ""made a good adjustment"" during the 7 1/2 months he had spent in jail between his arrest and trial.  The trial court ruled such evidence irrelevant and inadmissible, and petitioner was sentenced to death.  The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting petitioner's contention that the trial court had committed constitutional error in excluding the testimony of the jailers and visitor.
Held:  The trial court's exclusion from the sentencing hearing of the testimony of the jailers and the visitor denied petitioner his right to place before the sentencing jury all relevant evidence in mitigation of punishment.  Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104.  Pp.  476 U. S. 4-9.
(a) The record does not support the State's contention that the trial court's ruling was no more than an application of rules restricting the use of lay opinion testimony.  Pp.  476 U. S. 5-6.
(b) Nor is there any support in the record for the State's contention that the trial court's ruling was not improper because it did not prevent petitioner from introducing evidence of past good conduct in jail, but

 only foreclosed the introduction of ""irrelevant"" evidence of his future adaptability to prison life.  Pp.  476 U. S. 6-7.
(c) And, contrary to the State's suggestion, it is implausible, on the facts, to characterize the excluded evidence as cumulative, and its exclusion as harmless error.  Pp.  476 U. S. 7-9.

Syllabus 
During contract negotiations with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), respondent American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) submitted a proposal that would require the EEOC ""to comply with OMB Circular A-76 and other applicable laws and regulations concerning contracting out"" by federal agencies.  The EEOC refused to bargain over the proposal on the ground that it was nonnegotiable under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Act).  On AFGE's petition for review, respondent Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) rejected the EEOC's contentions that (1) because AFGE's proposed contract provision concerned contracting out, the proposal was inconsistent with the Act's management rights clause, which protects an agency's authority, ""in accordance with applicable laws,"" to make determinations as to contracting out, and (2) the Circular itself forbade negotiation over the proposal.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The writ of certiorari previously granted by this Court is dismissed as improvidently granted.  The EEOC did not assert before either the FLRA or the Court of Appeals its contentions here that (1) the Circular is not an ""applicable la[w]"" within the meaning of the Act's management rights clause, and therefore AFGE's proposal, by requiring compliance with the Circular, would intrude on management's reserved rights, and (2) any alleged violation of the Circular would not be grievable absent AFGE's proposal, because the Circular is not a ""law, rule, or regulation"" within the meaning of the Act's definition of ""grievance.""  Nor had the EEOC presented to the FLRA the argument that the Circular is a ""Government-wide rule or regulation"" for purposes of the Act's provision that excludes such rules or regulations from the scope of the duty to bargain.  The Act provides that an objection that has not been urged before the FLRA shall not be considered on judicial review unless the failure to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances.  Such statutory bar is not ""waived"" simply because the FLRA fails to invoke it.  Since the EEOC failed to excuse its failure to raise before the FLRA its principal objections to AFGE's proposal, this Court will not consider them.  Moreover, even if the EEOC's failure to raise its

 ""grievability"" contention before the FLRA were to be excused on the ground that the FLRA, sua sponte, had injected the grievability issue into the proceedings, it did not excuse the EEOC's failure to raise its claim in the Court of Appeals.

 Bret CLARKv. FLORIDA.No. 85-6004 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 28, 1986
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER. 
 I agree that we should dismiss this improper appeal, and treating the appeal as a petition for certiorari, deny certiorari. The merits of this appeal are utterly frivolous, as were most of appellant's persistent efforts in the courts of Florida. In light of that frivolousness, as well as appellant's status as a member of the Florida Bar, I would award the State costs and fees under Rule 49.2. 
 This case originated when appellant Bret Clark received a speeding ticket while traveling on the Florida Turnpike on August 12, 1982. At the time he was a law student. Appellant pleaded not guilty, went to trial pro se and lost; he was fined $100. On appeal the Fifth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, sitting in its appellate capacity, affirmed without opinion on September 4, 1984. At some point during 1984 appellant graduated from law school and was admitted to the Florida Bar. 
Page 475 U.S. 1134 , 1135
 Five months later, on February 14, 1985, appellant sought a writ of certiorari from the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal. Under Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.100(c), however, a petition for that writ must be filed within 30 days of the order sought to be reviewed, or in this case, no later than October 4, 1984. Appellant claimed that his petition was nevertheless timely under an exception to the rule when denial of appellate review would be fundamentally unfair, because he claimed he did not become aware of the Fifth Judicial Circuit's order of affirmance until January 14, 1985, after his driver's license had been suspended by the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. He apparently failed to inform the Circuit Court of his change of address while appeal was pending and to keep a watchful eye on that court's docket, as he was obligated to do if he intended to pursue his claim. 
 On the merits, he challenged the arresting officer's failure to show him the digital display on the radar detection device indicating that he was exceeding the speed limit. He also challenged the Florida sentencing procedure as discriminating against traffic offenders who plead not guilty by imposing ""double or nothing"" fines that exceed the fine imposed if they plead guilty, thereby discouraging offenders from protesting their guilt. Finally, he challenged the constitutionality of the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. The Court of Appeal ordered the State to show cause why the petition should not be granted, and the State filed a response raising the jurisdictional bar based on the untimely filing of the petition. On April 15, 1985, the court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. 
 Undeterred, appellant filed a motion for rehearing which was stricken as untimely. Over a month later he filed a motion to recall mandate and a suggestion for reconsideration. At this point the State, frustrated with appellant's frivolous litigious efforts, filed a response pointing out that the court had no power to recall mandate, and that no mandate had even issued. The State also moved for attorney's fees pursuant to Fla. Stat. 57.105 (1985), which provides for an award of fees where a losing party's position is completely lacking any ""justiciable issue"" of law or fact. The State emphasized that appellant's motion for recall of mandate

 Bret CLARKv. FLORIDA.No. 85-6004 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 28, 1986
 The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER. 
 I agree that we should dismiss this improper appeal, and treating the appeal as a petition for certiorari, deny certiorari. The merits of this appeal are utterly frivolous, as were most of appellant's persistent efforts in the courts of Florida. In light of that frivolousness, as well as appellant's status as a member of the Florida Bar, I would award the State costs and fees under Rule 49.2. 
 This case originated when appellant Bret Clark received a speeding ticket while traveling on the Florida Turnpike on August 12, 1982. At the time he was a law student. Appellant pleaded not guilty, went to trial pro se and lost; he was fined $100. On appeal the Fifth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida, sitting in its appellate capacity, affirmed without opinion on September 4, 1984. At some point during 1984 appellant graduated from law school and was admitted to the Florida Bar.

 MAINEv. Jay G. THIBODEAU.No. 85-744 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 28, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, dissenting. 
 John Tower's brother reported him missing on October 27, 1983; his mother told police that he had last been seen taking respondent Jay Thibodeau for a test drive in his car that he had for sale. On the morning of October 28, police officers went to the Thibodeau apartment where they spoke with respondent in the presence of his parents for about 10 minutes. Respondent told police that he and Tower had gone for a test drive the previous day, after which Tower dropped him off at home. [ Maine v. Thibodeau 475 U.S. 1144 (1986) ][1144-Continued.] 
 Two police officers returned to the Thibodeau household that afternoon and asked respondent to show them the route he and Tower had taken the day before. Respondent agreed and got into the backseat of the police car, a two-door automobile. For about an hour and a half the three retraced the complicated route respondent described to the police, after which respondent was returned home. At no time did respondent ask to leave the car. At one point in the journey respondent asked if he was a suspect. The police stated that he had been the last person seen with the victim, to which respondent replied, ""Well, I guess I am."" 
 Two days later police found John Tower's body, shot in the head with a .22-caliber rifle. The next day, police discovered that respondent had traded in his .22-caliber rifle for another gun. Police arrested respondent on November 1. After waiving his Miranda rights, respondent confessed to the killing. 
 At trial respondent moved to suppress his statements to the police on the morning and afternoon of October 28 on the ground that he was subjected to custodial interrogations without the necessary Miranda warnings. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the statements were ""voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt"" and that ""the circumstances did not constitute custodial interrogation"" because respondent had willingly cooperated with the police in generally noncoercive settings. 
 The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, three justices dissenting, reversed respondent's murder conviction on the ground that the afternoon session with police constituted a custodial interrogation requiring Miranda warnings. 496 A.2d 635 (Me.1985). The court listed the following criteria for determining whether there had 
Page 475 U.S. 1144 , 1145
 been a custodial interrogation: (1) the locale where the statements were made; (2) the party initiating the contact; (3) the existence or nonexistence of probable cause to arrest; (4) the subjective intent of the police; (5) the subjective belief of the defendant; and (6) the focus of the investigation. Applying these factors to this case, the court noted that the officers' suspicions had ""increased dramatically since the morning"" and that, although no crime had yet been detected, respondent ""was the only suspect."" Id., at 639. Furthermore, a reasonable person would have felt, as did respondent, that he had no choice but to accompany the officers. Finally, by placing him in the backseat of a two-door automobile, police had deprived him of his freedom in a significant way. 
 This decision of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court illustrates an acute need for clarification of the proper factors to be considered in making the ""in custody"" determination-a clarification perhaps made necessary by our own lack of clarity as to the standards to be applied. However, four of the six factors enumerated by the Maine court have been rejected by either this Court or other state and federal courts. 
 (1) We plainly rejected the relevancy of the ""subjective intent of the police"" in Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442, 3152 (1984), where we stated ""[a] policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing on the question whether a suspect was 'in custody' at a particular time."" 
 (2) In Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 341, 48 L. Ed.2d 1 (1976), we held that whether police suspicion had focused upon the defendant has no bearing whatever on the ""in custody"" determination: "" 'It was the compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation, and not the strength or content of the government's suspicions at the time the questioning was conducted, which led the Court to impose the Miranda requirements with regard to custodial questioning.' "" Id., at 346-347-1617 (quoting United States v. Caiello, 420 F.2d 471, 473 ( CA2 1969)). See also People v. Black, 698 P.2d 766 (Colo.1984) (trial court erred in suppressing evidence by considering whether the police's investigation had ""focused"" on the defendant). Cf. Green v. Superior Court, 40 Cal.3d 126, 219 Cal.Rptr. 186, 707 P.2d 248 (1985) (lack of police suspicion dispositive). 
 (3) The Ninth Circuit has held that the existence of probable cause at the time of the interrogation is similarly irrelevant. See United States v. Woods, 720 F.2d 1022 (CA9 1983). [475 U.S. 1144 , 1146]

 Theodore R. LITTLE, Jr.v. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, CRESTWOOD.No. 85-1435 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 28, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Virginia, City of Chesapeake. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In this case a state court conducted an election to determine whether petitioner, who was previously elected pastor of the First Baptist Church, Crestwood (Church), is still entitled to serve as pastor. I believe that such an action threatens to erode the First Amendment's prohibitions against entanglement between religious and secular authority, and I would therefore grant the petition for certiorari. 
 I  
 In The Church is congregational or self-governing, as opposed to associational or hierarchical, which refers to churches that are part of and governed by a larger organization. See generally Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 722-728 (1872). During 1984 petitioner and certain members of the Church became involved in a dispute. Respondents, individual members of the Church, then filed this action for an injunction, claiming to act on behalf of the Church. Respondents alleged that at a duly held meeting of the 
Page 475 U.S. 1148 , 1149
 congregation, a majority had voted to terminate petitioner's employment. Petitioner's answer disputed respondents' authority to initiate the action on behalf of the Church. 
 The trial court, based only on the pleadings, temporarily enjoined petitioner from entering the Church premises and appointed a commissioner to hold an election of the congregation. After the commissioner had held the election and certified to the court that a majority had voted to fire petitioner, the court permanently enjoined petitioner from entering Church property or interfering in Church affairs. 
 II  
 Because religious organizations may own property and enter into contracts, it is inevitable that they will become involved in legal disputes. However, where the use of property or the terms of contracts necessitate reference to ecclesiastical principles or authority, courts must exercise extreme care to avoid taking sides on matters of religious belief. This Court set down the basic framework for such situations over 100 years ago, in Watson, supra. Although it has undergone some refinements, see, e.g., Jones v. Wolf, 443 U.S. 595, 61 L. Ed.2d 775 (1979), the Watson approach is simple. A court may apply neutral principles of secular law to the dispute at hand. When that process requires a court to determine the validity of a church decision, the court ordinarily must discern from the relevant canonical law what body is authorized to make a particular decision within the church, and what decision that body has reached. Having done so, the court may not inquire whether the decision was made arbitrarily or whether it conflicts with the ecclesiastical precepts of the organization. Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696 (1976); Maryland and Virginia Eldership v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., 396 U.S. 367, 368, 500 ( 1970) (BRENNAN, J., concurring). 
 In the present case the trial court clearly did not follow this method; indeed it imposed its own view of proper procedures on the congregation's decisionmaking. The court took respondents' word that they represented the Church without any evidence, although petitioner contested the fact. The court made no inquiry into whether the alleged meeting at which petitioner was fired actually took place, whether a quorum was present, or how the members voted. Lacking any evidence that the authorized decisionmaker had acted, the court induced a decision on its own initiative. [475 U.S. 1148 , 1150]

|475 u.s. 813|"Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Lavoie
No. 84-1601
Argued December 4, 1985
Decided April 22, 1986
475 U.S. 813

Syllabus 
When appellant insurer refused to pay the full amount of a hospital bill incurred by appellees, they brought suit in an Alabama state court, seeking both payment of the full amount and punitive damages for appellant's alleged bad-faith refusal to pay a valid claim.  The jury awarded $3.5 million in punitive damages.  The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, 5 to 4, in a per curiam opinion written by Justice Embry.  Appellant then filed an application for rehearing, and, before the application was acted on, learned that, while the case was pending before the Alabama Supreme Court, Justice Embry had filed two actions in an Alabama court against insurance companies alleging bad-faith failure to pay claims and seeking punitive damages.  One of the actions was a class action on behalf of all state employees insured under a group plan by Blue Cross-Blue Shield.  Appellant then filed motions challenging, on due process Founds, Justice Embry's participation in the per curiam decision and his continued participation in considering the rehearing application, and also alleging that all justices on the court should recuse themselves because of their interests as potential class members in the Blue Cross suit.  The court denied these motions, and also the rehearing application.  Subsequently, the Blue Cross suit was settled, and Justice Embry received $30,000 under that settlement.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the question whether Justice Embry's participation in this case violated appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, where the Alabama Supreme Court's order denying the recusal motions clearly demonstrated that the court reached the merits of appellant's constitutional challenge, and where appellant raised this issue as soon as it discovered the facts relating to Justice Embry's personal lawsuits.  Pp.  475 U. S. 819-820.
2. Appellant's allegations, on a general basis, of Justice Embry's bias and prejudice against insurance companies that were dilatory in paying claims, were insufficient to establish any constitutional violation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 820-821.
3. The record, however, presents more than mere allegations of bias and prejudice, and supports the conclusion that Justice Embry's participation in this case violated appellant's due process rights.  All of the issues in this case were present in his Blue Cross suit, and the very 
Page 475 U. S. 814
 nature of that suit placed in issue whether he would have to establish that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the underlying claims that Blue Cross refused to pay before gaining punitive damages.  Moreover, the affirmance in this case of the largest punitive damages award ever issued in Alabama on precisely the type of claim raised in the Blue Cross suit ""raised the stakes"" for Blue Cross in that suit, to Justice Embry's benefit.  Thus, his opinion for the Alabama Supreme Court had the clear and immediate effect of enhancing both the legal status and the settlement value of his own case.  When he made the judgment in this case, he acted as ""a judge in his own case.""  His interest in this case was ""direct, personal, substantial, [and] pecuniary,'"" Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57,  409 U. S. 60, as shown by the sum he received in settlement of the Blue Cross suit.  Pp.  475 U. S. 821-826.
4. There is no basis for concluding that the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court other than Justice Embry were disqualified under the Due Process Clause.  While those justices might conceivably have had a slight pecuniary interest in this case because of their possible inclusion in the Blue Cross class action, that interest cannot properly be characterized as ""direct, personal, substantial, [and] pecuniary.""  Any interest that they might have had when they passed on the rehearing application was highly speculative and contingent, since, at that time, the trial court in the Blue Cross suit had not even certified a class, let alone awarded any class relief of a pecuniary nature.  Pp.  475 U. S. 826-827.
5. Because of Justice Embry's leading role in the decision under review, the ""appearance of justice"" will best be served by vacating the decision and remanding for further proceedings.  Pp.  475 U. S. 827-828.
470 So.2d 1060, vacated and remanded.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, POWELL, REHNQUIST, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.  BRENNAN, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p.  475 U. S. 829.

Appellant then filed motions challenging, on due process Founds, Justice Embry's participation in the per curiam decision and his continued participation in considering the rehearing application, and also alleging that all justices on the court should recuse themselves because of their interests as potential class members in the Blue Cross suit.  The court denied these motions, and also the rehearing application.  Subsequently, the Blue Cross suit was settled, and Justice Embry received $30,000 under that settlement.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the question whether Justice Embry's participation in this case violated appellant's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, where the Alabama Supreme Court's order denying the recusal motions clearly demonstrated that the court reached the merits of appellant's constitutional challenge, and where appellant raised this issue as soon as it discovered the facts relating to Justice Embry's personal lawsuits.  Pp.  475 U. S. 819-820.
2. Appellant's allegations, on a general basis, of Justice Embry's bias and prejudice against insurance companies that were dilatory in paying claims, were insufficient to establish any constitutional violation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 820-821.
3. The record, however, presents more than mere allegations of bias and prejudice, and supports the conclusion that Justice Embry's participation in this case violated appellant's due process rights.  All of the issues in this case were present in his Blue Cross suit, and the very 
Page 475 U. S. 814
 nature of that suit placed in issue whether he would have to establish that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the underlying claims that Blue Cross refused to pay before gaining punitive damages.  Moreover, the affirmance in this case of the largest punitive damages award ever issued in Alabama on precisely the type of claim raised in the Blue Cross suit ""raised the stakes"" for Blue Cross in that suit, to Justice Embry's benefit.  Thus, his opinion for the Alabama Supreme Court had the clear and immediate effect of enhancing both the legal status and the settlement value of his own case.  When he made the judgment in this case, he acted as ""a judge in his own case.""  His interest in this case was ""direct, personal, substantial, [and] pecuniary,'"" Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57,  409 U. S. 60, as shown by the sum he received in settlement of the Blue Cross suit.  Pp.  475 U. S. 821-826.
4. There is no basis for concluding that the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court other than Justice Embry were disqualified under the Due Process Clause.  While those justices might conceivably have had a slight pecuniary interest in this case because of their possible inclusion in the Blue Cross class action, that interest cannot properly be characterized as ""direct, personal, substantial, [and] pecuniary.""  Any interest that they might have had when they passed on the rehearing application was highly speculative and contingent, since, at that time, the trial court in the Blue Cross suit had not even certified a class, let alone awarded any class relief of a pecuniary nature.  Pp.  475 U. S. 826-827.
5. Because of Justice Embry's leading role in the decision under review, the ""appearance of justice"" will best be served by vacating the decision and remanding for further proceedings.  Pp.  475 U. S. 827-828.

Syllabus 
Section 511(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the ""unrelated business taxable income"" of tax-exempt organizations.  Section 512(a)(1) defines ""unrelated business taxable income"" as the gross income derived by such an organization from any ""unrelated trade or business . . . regularly carried on by it,"" and  513(a) defines ""unrelated trade or business"" as ""any trade or business the conduct of which is not substantially related"" to the organization's tax-exempt purposes.  Respondent tax-exempt organization, in furtherance of its exempt purposes of maintaining high standards in medical education and practice, encouraging research, and fostering measures for preventing disease and improving public health, publishes a monthly medical journal containing articles relevant to the practice of internal medicine.  Each issue of the journal contains paid advertisements for pharmaceuticals, and medical supplies and equipment useful in the practice of internal medicine.  After respondent had paid taxes on its net income from such advertisements in 1975, it filed a claim for a refund, and when the Government demurred, ultimately filed suit in the United States Claims Court, which held that the advertisements were not substantially related to respondent's tax-exempt purposes, and that therefore the advertising proceeds were taxable.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Taking the view that the Claims Court had focused too much on the commercial character of the advertising business and not enough on the advertisements' contribution to the education of the medical journal's readers, the Court of Appeals held that respondent had established the requisite substantial relation and its entitlement to exemption from taxation.
Held:  Respondent must pay a tax on the profits it earns from the advertisements.  Pp.  475 U. S. 837-850.
(a) It is undisputed that respondent's publication of paid advertising is a ""trade or business,"" and that the business is ""regularly carried on.""  Pp.  475 U. S. 839-841.
(b) There is no merit to the Government's argument that Congress and the Treasury intended to establish a blanket rule requiring the taxation of income from all commercial advertising by tax-exempt professional journals without a specific analysis of the circumstances. 
Page 475 U. S. 835
  There is no support for such a rule in the regulations or in the legislative history of the Internal Revenue Code.  Pp.  475 U. S. 841-847.
(c) In this case, however, based on the Claims Court's finding of facts that are adequately supported by the record, and considering those facts in light of the applicable legal standard, it must be concluded that the advertisements in question were not ""substantially related,"" or, in the words of the implementing regulation, did not ""contribute importantly,"" to the medical journal's educational purposes.  The Claims Court properly directed its attention to respondent's conduct of its advertising business, whereas the Court of Appeals erroneously focused exclusively upon the information conveyed by commercial advertising, and consequently failed to give effect to the governing statute and regulations.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) allows an individual responsible for the support of a child living with him a credit against income taxes due equal to a certain percentage of so much of earned income as does not exceed a specified amount.  If the credit exceeds tax liability, the excess is considered ""an overpayment"" of tax under IRC  6401(b).  Section 6402(a) provides for a refund of ""any overpayment"" to the person who made it.  Section 6402(c) requires the amount of ""any overpayment"" to be reduced by the amount of any past-due child support payments assigned to a State.  Section 464 of the Social Security Act (SSA) directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ""intercept"" tax refunds payable to persons who have failed to meet child support obligations that have been assigned to a State.  When petitioner's husband fell behind in support payments for a child of a previous marriage who was in the custody of his former wife, the latter, upon applying for welfare benefits from the State of Washington, assigned to the State, as required by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, her right to collect the unpaid child support payments.  Petitioner and her husband, who had their own dependent child living with them, filed a joint federal income tax return for 1981 in which all income was attributable to petitioner's wages and unemployment compensation benefits and in which they anticipated a refund based in part on an earned-income credit.  The Internal Revenue Service, however, notified them that a certain amount of the anticipated refund was being retained, under the authority of the tax-intercept law, and would be paid over to the State of Washington.  Petitioner then filed a class action in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that  464 of the SSA did not reach a refund attributable to an excess earned-income credit.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  An excess earned-income credit can properly be intercepted under the applicable statutes.  Pp.  475 U. S. 859-865.
(a) The IRC's treatment of earned-income credits supports the Government's position.  The refundability of that credit is inseparable from its classification as an overpayment of tax.  It is an ""overpayment"" not only for purposes of  6402(a), but also for purposes of  6402(c).  Eligibility 
Page 475 U. S. 852
 for an earned-income credit does not depend upon an individual's actually having paid any tax.  The IRC's classification of the credit as an ""overpayment"" to be refunded is similarly independent of the individual's actually having made any payment.  To the extent an excess credit is ""payable"" to an individual, it is payable as if it were a refund of tax paid.  Pp.  475 U. S. 859-863.
(b) There is no support for petitioner's claim that Congress did not intend the tax-intercept program to reach excess earned-income credits.  Although Congress never mentioned the earned-income credit in enacting the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, which added  6902(c) to the IRC, it must have been aware, when it provided in  6402(c) that ""any overpayment"" to be refunded shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due child support, that this would include refunds attributable to excess earned-income credits.  And, although the goals of the earned-income credit -- to reduce the disincentive to work caused by Social Security taxes on earned income, to stimulate the economy by funneling funds to persons likely to spend the money immediately, and to provide for relief for low-income families hurt by rising food and energy prices -- are important, it cannot be said that Congress concluded that they outweigh the goals served by the subsequently enacted tax-intercept program -- securing child support from absent parents and reducing the number of families on welfare.

Following an investigation by the Erie County, N.Y. District Attorney's Office, an investigator viewed videocassette movies that had been rented from respondents' store by a member of the County Sheriff's Department.  The investigator then executed affidavits summarizing the theme of, and conduct depicted in, each movie.  These affidavits were attached to an application for a warrant to search respondents' store, and a New York Supreme Court Justice issued the warrant authorizing the search and the seizure of the movies.  The warrant was executed, and the movies were seized.  Respondents were charged in a New York Justice Court with violating the New York obscenity statute, and moved to suppress the seized movies on the ground that the warrant was issued without probable cause to believe that the movies were obscene.  The Justice Court granted the motion and dismissed the charges, and both the County Court and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Court of Appeals held that there was a ""higher"" probable cause standard for issuing warrants to seize such things as books and movies than for warrants to seize such things as weapons or drugs, and that, under this ""higher"" standard, there was insufficient information in the affidavits to permit the issuing justice to believe that the movies in question were obscene under New York law.
Held:  No ""higher"" probable cause standard was required by the First Amendment for issuance of the warrant in question.  An application for a warrant authorizing the seizure of materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment should be evaluated under the same probable cause standard used to review warrant applications generally, namely, that there is a ""fair probability"" that evidence of a crime will be found in the particular place to be searched.  Evaluating the supporting affidavits here under this standard, the warrant was supported by probable cause to believe that the movies were obscene under New York law, and they should not have been suppressed.

Respondents were employed by petitioner as members of the Engineering Department on board a nonself-propelled fish-processing barge.  They sued petitioner in Federal District Court, seeking to recover overtime benefits under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  Finding that they were seamen because they performed work of a maritime character on navigable waters, the District Court held that respondents were excluded from such benefits under the provision of the FLSA that excludes ""any employee employed as a seaman.""  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Reviewing under a ""de novo"" standard, the Court of Appeals found that respondents' ""dominant employment"" was ""industrial maintenance,"" and that the ""maritime work"" that they performed took only a small portion of their time, and therefore concluded that respondents were not seamen.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in engaging in such factfinding.  The facts necessary to a proper determination of the legal question whether an exemption to the FLSA applies in a particular case should be reviewed by the courts of appeals pursuant to the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of review set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), like the facts in other civil bench-tried litigation in federal courts.

Syllabus 
The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Fees Act) provides that ""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee"" in enumerated civil rights actions.  Respondents brought a class action against petitioners (the Governor and other public officials of Idaho responsible for the education and treatment of mentally handicapped children) in Federal District Court on behalf of children who have been or will be placed in petitioners' care.  It was alleged that deficiencies in both the educational programs and health care services provided respondents violated the Federal and State Constitutions and various federal and state statutes.  Injunctive relief and an award of costs and attorney's fees were sought.  Ultimately, the District Court approved a settlement granting the injunctive relief sought conditional on respondents' waiver of any claim for attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals invalidated the fee waiver, left standing the remainder of the settlement, and remanded to the District Court to determine what attorney's fees were reasonable, holding that the historical background of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), which gives a district court power to approve settlements of class actions, and of the Fees Act, compelled the conclusion that a stipulated waiver of attorney's fees obtained solely as a condition for obtaining relief for the class should not be accepted by the court.

			"|"Evans v. Jeff D.
No. 84-1288
Argued November 13, 1985
Decided April 21, 1986
475 U.S. 717

Syllabus 
The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Fees Act) provides that ""the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee"" in enumerated civil rights actions.  Respondents brought a class action against petitioners (the Governor and other public officials of Idaho responsible for the education and treatment of mentally handicapped children) in Federal District Court on behalf of children who have been or will be placed in petitioners' care.  It was alleged that deficiencies in both the educational programs and health care services provided respondents violated the Federal and State Constitutions and various federal and state statutes.  Injunctive relief and an award of costs and attorney's fees were sought.  Ultimately, the District Court approved a settlement granting the injunctive relief sought conditional on respondents' waiver of any claim for attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals invalidated the fee waiver, left standing the remainder of the settlement, and remanded to the District Court to determine what attorney's fees were reasonable, holding that the historical background of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), which gives a district court power to approve settlements of class actions, and of the Fees Act, compelled the conclusion that a stipulated waiver of attorney's fees obtained solely as a condition for obtaining relief for the class should not be accepted by the court.

1. The District Court had the power, in its discretion, to approve the waiver of attorney's fees.  Pp.  475 U. S. 730-738.

No. 84-1491
Argued December 3, 1985
Decided April 21, 1986
475 U.S. 767

Syllabus 
Appellee Hepps is the principal stockholder of appellee corporation that franchises a chain of stores selling beer, soft drinks, and snacks.  Appellant owner published a series of articles in its Philadelphia newspaper whose general theme was that Hepps, the franchisor corporation, and its franchisees (also appellees) had links to organized crime and used some of those links to influence the State's governmental processes.  Appellees then brought a defamation suit in a Pennsylvania state court against the newspaper owner and the authors (also appellants) of the articles in question.  Concluding that the Pennsylvania statute giving the defendant the burden of proving the truth of allegedly defamatory statements violated the Federal Constitution, the trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving falsity.  The jury ruled for appellants, and therefore awarded no damages to appellees.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, concluding that a showing of fault did not require a showing of falsity, held that to place the burden of showing truth on the defendant did not unconstitutionally inhibit free debate, and remanded the case for a new trial.
Held:  In a case such as this one, where a newspaper publishes speech of public concern about a private figure, the private-figure plaintiff cannot recover damages without also showing that the statements at issue are false.  Because in such a case the scales are in an uncertain balance as to whether the statements are true or false, the Constitution requires that the scales be tipped in favor of protecting true speech.  To ensure that true speech on matters of public concern is not deterred, the common law presumption that defamatory speech is false cannot stand.  While Pennsylvania's ""shield law,"" which allows employees of the media to refuse to divulge their sources, places a heavier burden on appellees, the precise scope of that law is unclear and, under these circumstances, it does not appear that such law requires a different constitutional standard than would prevail in the absence of such law.

No. 85-531
Decided April 21, 1986
475 U.S. 796

Syllabus 
Respondent was stopped by Los Angeles police officers, who suspected that he was driving while intoxicated, and was told that he was under arrest.  When an officer attempted to handcuff him, an altercation developed and respondent fell through a plate-glass window.  Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming damages from arrest without probable cause and from excessive force in the making of the arrest.  During a bifurcated trial, his claims against the police officer were heard first, and the jury was instructed that respondent would make out his constitutional claim if he demonstrated he had been arrested without reasonable cause or with ""unreasonable force"" that exceeded the force necessary under the circumstances to effect arrest.  The jury was not instructed on any affirmative defenses that might have been asserted by the officer.  The jury returned a verdict for the officer, and the District Court dismissed the action against petitioners, the city and members of its Police Commission.  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment dismissing the case against petitioners, even though it did not disturb the verdict for the officer.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in apparently basing its reversal on the grounds that the jury could have believed that the officer, having followed Police Department regulations, was entitled in substance to a defense of good faith, and that such a belief would not negate the existence of a constitutional injury.  The jury was not charged on any affirmative defense that the officer might have had -- such as good faith and qualified immunity -- and the theory under which jury instructions are given, and reviewed on appeal, provides that juries act in accordance with the instructions given them, and do not base their decisions on legal questions as to which they are not charged.  The jury's finding of no constitutional injury was conclusive not only as to the officer, but also as to petitioners.  Petitioners were sued only because they were thought legally responsible for the officer's actions; if the latter inflicted no constitutional injury on respondent, petitioners cannot be liable in damages to respondent, regardless

Syllabus 
Respondent, which holds patents for plastic cable ties, sued petitioner in Federal District Court for infringement, and petitioner defended on the ground that the patents were invalid for obviousness.  After examining the prior art, identifying the differences between it and the patents at issue, and ultimately concluding that all of the improvements made by the patents over the prior art would have been obvious to one skilled in that art, the court held that respondent's patents were invalid for obviousness.  The Court of Appeals reversed, disagreeing with the District Court's assessment of the prior art and ruling that the references cited by the District Court did not teach the innovations introduced by respondent.  Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals improperly ignored Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) in substituting its view of factual issues for that of the District Court.
Held:  Regardless of whether the ultimate question of obviousness is one of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a), the District Court's subsidiary determinations, at the least, are subject to the Rule.  The Court of Appeals, however, did not mention the Rule, did not explicitly apply the clearly erroneous standard to any of the District Court's findings on obviousness, and did not explain why, if it was of that view, the Rule had no applicability to the issue of obviousness.  In the absence of an opinion clearly setting forth the Court of Appeals' views on such matters, plenary consideration will not be given here to petitioner's claim that the decision below cannot be squared with the Rule.

 Krista WILSEY, Individually and as Special Administratrix of the Estate of Lacey M. Hammel, Deceased Minorv. Charles F. EDDINGFIELD et al.No. 85-1314 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 21, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Krista Wilsey, an Iowa resident, filed this wrongful-death action in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois against respondents, three Illinois physicians. Specifically, petitioner alleged that respondents had been negligent in performing surgery on her 4-year-old daughter, the decedent. Petitioner also requested that she be appointed special administrator of the estate of her deceased daughter so that she could properly prosecute the action: Under Illinois law, a special administrator is appointed to administer a decedent's estate where the only asset of that estate is a cause of action for wrongful death. See Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 70, 2.1 (1986). Jurisdiction was allegedly based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S. C. 1332. 
 A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, held that diversity jurisdiction was lacking and dismissed the action. 780 F.2d 614 (1985). Relying on its earlier decision in Betar v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd., 603 F.2d 30 (1979), the Court of Appeals concluded that a special administrator under Illinois law has no personal stake in the proceeds of a wrongful-death action but merely distributes those proceeds to the statutory beneficiaries. Consequently, the statutory beneficiaries and not the special administrator are the real parties in interest whose citizenship is determinative for di- 
Page 475 U.S. 1130 , 1131
 versity purposes. Because the decedent's father, one of the statutory beneficiaries, was an Illinois resident, there was incomplete diversity between the parties and diversity jurisdiction was lacking. 
 This holding, as the Court of Appeals itself recognized, is in conflict with the Tenth Circuit's decision in Hackney v. Newman Memorial Hospital, Inc., 621 F.2d 1069 (1980), in which that court found diversity jurisdiction to be proper in a very similar situation involving the Oklahoma wrongful-death statute. See also, e.g., Bettin v. Nelson, 744 F.2d 53 (CA8 1984); Bianca v. Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Div. of Warner- Lambert Co., 723 F.2d 392 (CA5 1984). Moreover, as Judge Posner pointed out in his dissent from the Court of Appeals' decision not to rehear this case en banc, under Illinois law the special administrator is a fiduciary of the estate's beneficiaries and has sole control over the litigation. See Rodgers v. Consolidated Railroad Corp., 136 Ill.App.3d 191, 193, 90 Ill.Dec. 797, 799, 482 N.E.2d 1080, 1082 (1985). Thus, the holding below is also in tension with this Court's decision in Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 465, 1784 (1980), in which we held that business trustees-""active trustees whose control over the assets held in their names is real and substantial""-were real parties in interest for diversity purposes. See also Mecom v. Fitzsimmons Co., 284 U.S. 183 (1931). In addition, defining diversity jurisdiction by the citizenship of the statutory beneficiaries, the approach taken by the Seventh Circuit panel, could make for a difficult and time-consuming determination in ascertaining diversity for jurisdictional purposes. See Navarro, supra, 446 U.S., at 464, n. 13, n. 13. 
 Because of the conflict among the Circuits and the tension between the Court of Appeals' holding and our decision in Navarro, I would grant certiorari.

Relying on its earlier decision in Betar v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Ltd., 603 F.2d 30 (1979), the Court of Appeals concluded that a special administrator under Illinois law has no personal stake in the proceeds of a wrongful-death action but merely distributes those proceeds to the statutory beneficiaries. Consequently, the statutory beneficiaries and not the special administrator are the real parties in interest whose citizenship is determinative for di- 
Page 475 U.S. 1130 , 1131
 versity purposes. Because the decedent's father, one of the statutory beneficiaries, was an Illinois resident, there was incomplete diversity between the parties and diversity jurisdiction was lacking. 
 This holding, as the Court of Appeals itself recognized, is in conflict with the Tenth Circuit's decision in Hackney v. Newman Memorial Hospital, Inc., 621 F.2d 1069 (1980), in which that court found diversity jurisdiction to be proper in a very similar situation involving the Oklahoma wrongful-death statute. See also, e.g., Bettin v. Nelson, 744 F.2d 53 (CA8 1984); Bianca v. Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Div. of Warner- Lambert Co., 723 F.2d 392 (CA5 1984). Moreover, as Judge Posner pointed out in his dissent from the Court of Appeals' decision not to rehear this case en banc, under Illinois law the special administrator is a fiduciary of the estate's beneficiaries and has sole control over the litigation. See Rodgers v. Consolidated Railroad Corp., 136 Ill.App.3d 191, 193, 90 Ill.Dec. 797, 799, 482 N.E.2d 1080, 1082 (1985). Thus, the holding below is also in tension with this Court's decision in Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 465, 1784 (1980), in which we held that business trustees-""active trustees whose control over the assets held in their names is real and substantial""-were real parties in interest for diversity purposes. See also Mecom v. Fitzsimmons Co., 284 U.S. 183 (1931). In addition, defining diversity jurisdiction by the citizenship of the statutory beneficiaries, the approach taken by the Seventh Circuit panel, could make for a difficult and time-consuming determination in ascertaining diversity for jurisdictional purposes. See Navarro, supra, 446 U.S., at 464, n. 13, n. 13. 
 Because of the conflict among the Circuits and the tension between the Court of Appeals' holding and our decision in Navarro, I would grant certiorari.

Syllabus 
Petitioner employer and respondent Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement covering telephone equipment installation workers.  Article 8 of the agreement provides for arbitration of differences arising over interpretation of the agreement.  Article 9 provides that, subject to certain limitations, but otherwise not subject to the arbitration clause, petitioner is free to exercise certain management functions, including the hiring, placement, and termination of employees.  Article 20 prescribes the order in which employees will be laid off ""[w]hen lack of work necessitates Layoff.""  The Union filed a grievance challenging petitioner's decision to lay off 79 installers from its Chicago location, claiming that there was no lack of work at that location, and that therefore the layoffs would violate Article 20.  But petitioner laid off the installers and refused to submit the grievance to arbitration on the ground that, under Article 9, the layoffs were not arbitrable.  The Union then sought to compel arbitration by filing suit in Federal District Court, which, after finding that the Union's interpretation of Article 20 was at least ""arguable,"" held that it was for the arbitrator, not the court, to decide whether that interpretation had merit, and, accordingly, ordered petitioner to arbitrate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The issue whether, because of express exclusion or other evidence, the dispute over interpretation of Article 20 was subject to the arbitration clause should have been decided by the District Court and reviewed by the Court of Appeals, and should not have been referred to the arbitrator.

S. 593), it was the District Court's duty to interpret the collective bargaining agreement and to determine whether the parties intended to arbitrate grievances concerning layoffs predicated on a ""lack of work"" determination by petitioner.

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944 (Act) authorizes the Secretary of Energy (Secretary), acting through Administrators of regional Power Marketing Administrations, to fix rates for the sale of hydroelectric power generated at federally owned dams, and provides that ""the rate schedules [shall] become effective upon confirmation and approval by the Secretary.""  Pursuant to the Secretary's regulatory scheme. new schedules increasing rates were developed by the Southwestern Power Administration after public participation, were approved and placed into effect on an interim basis, effective April 1, 1979, and were ultimately approved on a final basis by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Secretary's delegate) in January, 1982.  Respondent cities, who had entered into power purchase contracts with the Government, paid the new increased rates and then filed suit in the Court of Claims to recover money paid pursuant to the interim rate increase between April, 1979, and January, 1982, contending that the Secretary violated  5 of the Act and the terms of the power purchase contracts by putting the new rates into effect on an interim basis.  The contracts in question provided that rates could be increased or modified, and that such rates would become effective
""on the effective date specified in the order of the Federal Power Commission [a predecessor of the Secretary with respect to  5] containing such confirmation and approval.""
The Court of Claims ruled for respondents on the question of liability (the subsequently organized Claims Court later entered judgment in their favor), and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.
Held:  Neither the Act nor the power purchase contracts at issue preclude the Secretary from making hydroelectric power rates effective upon interim confirmation and approval, even though further administrative review is still pending.  Pp.  475 U. S. 665-672.
(a) Although the above-quoted language of  5 of the Act does not definitively speak to the question of interim rates, the relevant federal agencies' practice (at least since the mid-1970's) of allowing rates to become effective after interim confirmation and approval is as consistent with the statutory language as is respondents' preferred arrangement.  While the legislative history of the Act does not resolve the ambiguity, the Secretary's interim ratesetting practice is a reasonable accommodation

 of the Act's conflicting policies of protecting consumers by ensuring that power be sold at the lowest possible rates consistent with sound business principles and of protecting the public fisc by ensuring that federal hydroelectric programs recover their own costs and do not require subsidies from the federal treasury.  The Secretary's plan is not inconsistent with the congressional scheme, as respondents contend, on the ground that the plan's refund process if interim rates are ultimately found to be too high offers insufficient protection because refunds may not successfully trickle down to the same ultimate consumers who immediately bore the excessive charges.

(b) Nor do interim rate increases violate the terms of respondents' power purchase contracts.  The contracts contain no language unambiguously barring the imposition of interim rates.

Syllabus 
During respondent's murder trial, the Delaware trial court refused to allow defense counsel to cross-examine a prosecution witness about an agreement that he had made to speak with the prosecutor about the murder in question in exchange for the dismissal of an unrelated criminal charge against him.  Respondent was convicted.  The Delaware Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the trial court, by improperly restricting defense counsel's cross-examination designed to show bias on the prosecution witness' part, violated respondent's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and refused to consider whether such ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Held:  While the trial court's denial of respondent's opportunity to impeach the prosecution witness for bias violated respondent's rights under the Confrontation Clause, such ruling is subject to harmless error analysis under Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18.  The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, including the importance of the witness' testimony, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of corroborating or contradictory testimony on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall strength of the prosecution's case.

While petitioner's application to renew its franchise to operate taxicabs in respondent city of Los Angeles was pending, petitioner's drivers went on strike.  The City Council then conditioned renewal of the franchise on settlement of the labor dispute by a certain date.  When the dispute was not settled by that date, the franchise expired.

475 U.S. 625*

Syllabus 
Respondents, at separate arraignments in a Michigan trial court on unrelated murder charges, each requested appointment of counsel.  But before respondents had an opportunity to consult with counsel, police officers, after advising respondents of their Miranda rights, questioned them and obtained confessions.  Both respondents were convicted over objections to the admission of the confessions in evidence.  The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in one case, but affirmed in the other.  The Michigan Supreme Court considered both cases together, and held that the confessions were improperly obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
Held:  The confessions should have been suppressed.  Although the rule of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, that once a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, police may not initiate interrogation until counsel has been made available to the suspect, rested on the Fifth Amendment and concerned a request for counsel made during custodial interrogation, the reasoning of that case applies with even greater force to these cases.  The assertion of the right to counsel is no less significant, and the need for additional safeguards no less clear, when that assertion is made at an arraignment and when the basis for it is the Sixth Amendment.  If police initiate an interrogation after a defendant's assertion of his right to counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding, as in these cases, any waiver of that right for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.

 As Justice MARSHALL explains in his dissenting opinion, the violation of petitioner's Fifth Amendment right to counsel requires that the sentence of death for the shooting of Betty Jean Barker be set aside. However, in view of the fact that, as petitioner has presented the issue, this error would not appear to have affected the validity of the conviction or the death sentence for the murder of Carl Douglas Buchanan, I agree with the Court's decision to deny certiorari and allow the error to be corrected in collateral proceedings. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In the landmark case of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), this Court held that before police institute custodial interrogation of an individual, they must inform him of his right to consult with counsel. Miranda further required that the police respect the individual's decision to exercise that right. We stated, in clear and mandatory language: 
 We reaffirmed that rule in Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 719, 2568 (1979) (""[T]he Court fashioned in Miranda the rigid rule that an accused's request for an attorney is per se an invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, requiring that all interrogation cease""); see also Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 298, 1688 (1980); Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 104, n. 10, 326, n. 10 (1975); id., at 109-111-330 (WHITE, J., concurring in result). We refined the rule in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 485, 1885, 68 L. Ed.2d 378 (1981), explaining that the right to counsel, once asserted, cannot be waived ""unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police."" We emphasized: ""[I]t is inconsistent with Miranda and its progeny for the authorities, at their instance, to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted his right to counsel.""

475 U.S. 1301

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
California's application to stay the enforcement of the California Supreme Court's judgment -- which invalidated respondent's death sentence for first-degree murder on the ground that the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution was violated by a jury instruction given during the sentencing phase of his trial that told the jury not to be swayed by ""mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling"" -- is granted pending disposition of the State's petition for certiorari.  It is likely that four Members of this Court will vote to grant certiorari to review the jury instruction issue, and that the decision below ultimately will be reversed.  There is no merit to respondent's argument that the decision below was based on adequate and independent state grounds, and is therefore unreviewable by this Court.  Moreover, the State has met its burden of demonstrating irreparable harm if its application for a stay is not granted.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.
Applicant, the State of California, asks that I stay pending disposition of its petition for certiorari the enforcement of the judgment of the California Supreme Court, which invalidated the death sentence imposed on respondent Brown in 1980 for the first-degree murder of a 15-year-old girl.  See 40 Cal.3d 512, 709 P.2d 440 (1986).  The California Supreme Court invalidated Brown's death sentence because it believed that a jury instruction given during the sentencing phase of Brown's trial, which told the jury that it ""must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling,"" violated the Eighth

Decided March 26, 1986
475 U.S. 560

Syllabus 
After respondent and others were indicted for armed robbery in Rhode Island Superior Court, they were held without bail.  When the trial was about to begin, four uniformed state troopers were sitting in the front row of the spectators' section of the courtroom to supplement the customary security force which was overextended at the time.  Respondent's counsel objected to the troopers' presence, but this objection was overruled by the trial justice, primarily on the basis of voir dire responses during the selection of the jury indicating that the troopers' presence would not affect the defendants' ability to receive a fair trial.  Respondent was convicted, and the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed.  Respondent then brought a habeas corpus proceeding in Federal District Court, which also rejected his objections to the troopers' presence.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial justice had failed to consider whether the particular circumstances of respondent's trial had called for the troopers' presence, and that the justice had improperly relied on the jurors' voir dire responses to rebut any suggestion of prejudice to respondent.
Held:  The troopers' presence at respondent's trial was not so inherently prejudicial that he was thereby denied his constitutional right to a fair trial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 567-572.
(a) While an accused is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial, this does not mean that every practice tending to single out an accused from everyone else in the courtroom must be struck down.  Pp.  475 U. S. 567-568.
(b) The conspicuous, or at least noticeable, presence of guards in a courtroom during trial is not the sort of inherently prejudicial practice that should be permitted only where justified by an essential state interest.  Such presence need not be interpreted as a sign that the defendant is particularly dangerous or culpable.  Jurors may just as easily believe that the guards are there to prevent outside disruptions or eruptions of violence in the courtroom.  Reason, principle, and human experience counsel against a presumption that any use of identifiable guards in a courtroom is inherently prejudicial.  In view of the variety of ways 
Page 475 U. S. 561
 in which such guards can be deployed, a case-by-case approach is more appropriate.  Pp.  475 U. S. 568-669.
(c) Whenever a courtroom arrangement is challenged as inherently prejudicial, the question is not whether the jurors articulated a consciousness of some prejudicial effect, but rather whether there was an unacceptable risk of prejudice.  In this case, there is no justification for finding such an unacceptable risk based on the troopers' presence.  Even if the jurors had been aware that the deployment of troopers was not common practice, there is no reason to believe that the troopers' presence tended to brand respondent with guilt.  Their presence was unlikely to have been taken as a sign of anything other than a normal official concern for safety and order.  Moreover, even if a slight degree of prejudice could be attributed to the troopers' presence, sufficient cause for their presence could be found in the State's need to maintain custody over defendants who had been denied bail.  The troopers' presence was intimately related to the State's legitimate interest in maintaining such custody, and thus did not offend the Equal Protection Clause by arbitrarily discriminating against those unable to post bail or to whom bail has been denied.  Pp.  475 U. S. 670-672.
(d) Since this case involves a federal court's review of a constitutional challenge to a state court proceeding, the federal court's task is not to determine whether it might have been feasible for the State to have employed less conspicuous security measures in the courtroom, but only whether what the jurors saw was so inherently prejudicial as to pose an unacceptable threat to the defendants' right to a fair trial.  Respondent has failed to show the existence of such inherent prejudice, and has not shown actual prejudice.  P.  475 U. S. 672.

475 U.S. 574

Syllabus 
Petitioners are 21 Japanese corporations or Japanese-controlled American corporations that manufacture and/or sell ""consumer electronic products"" (CEPs) (primarily television sets).  Respondents are American corporations that manufacture and sell television sets.  In 1974, respondents brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioners, over a 20-year period, had illegally conspired to drive American firms from the American CEP market by engaging in a scheme to fix and maintain artificially high prices for television sets sold by petitioners in Japan and, at the same time, to fix and maintain low prices for the sets exported to and sold in the United States.  Respondents claim that various portions of this scheme violated, inter alia,  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act,  2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, and  73 of the Wilson Tariff Act.  After several years of discovery, petitioners moved for summary judgment on all claims.  The District Court then directed the parties to file statements listing all the documentary evidence that would be offered if the case went to trial.  After the statements were filed, the court found the bulk of the evidence on which respondents relied was inadmissible, that the admissible evidence did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of the alleged conspiracy, and that any inference of conspiracy was unreasonable.  Summary judgment therefore was granted in petitioners' favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  After determining that much of the evidence excluded by the District Court was admissible, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in granting a summary judgment, and that there was both direct and circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy.  Based on inferences drawn from the evidence, the Court of Appeals concluded that a reasonable factfinder could find a conspiracy to depress prices in the American market in order to drive out American competitors, which conspiracy was funded by excess profits obtained in the Japanese market.
Held.  The Court of Appeals did not apply proper standards in evaluating the District Court's decision to grant petitioners' motion for summary judgment.  Pp.  475 U. S. 582-598.
(a) The ""direct evidence"" on which the Court of Appeals relied -- petitioners' alleged supracompetitive pricing in Japan, the ""five-company 
Page 475 U. S. 575
 rule"" by which each Japanese producer was permitted to sell only to five American distributors, and the ""check-prices"" (minimum prices fixed by agreement with the Japanese Government for CEPs exported to the United States) insofar as they established minimum prices in the United States -- cannot, by itself, give respondents a cognizable claim against petitioners for antitrust damages.  Pp.  475 U. S. 582-583.
(b) To survive petitioners' motion for a summary judgment, respondents must establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether petitioners entered into an illegal conspiracy that caused respondents to suffer a cognizable injury.  If the factual context renders respondents' claims implausible, i.e., claims that make no economic sense, respondents must offer more persuasive evidence to support their claims than would otherwise be necessary.  To survive a motion for a summary judgment, a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of  1 of the Sherman Act must present evidence ""that tends to exclude the possibility"" that the alleged conspirators acted independently.  Thus, respondents here must show that the inference of a conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have harmed respondents.  Pp.  475 U. S. 585-588.
(c) Predatory pricing conspiracies are, by nature, speculative.  They require the conspirators to sustain substantial losses in order to recover uncertain gains.  The alleged conspiracy is therefore implausible.  Moreover, the record discloses that the alleged conspiracy has not succeeded in over two decades of operation.  This is strong evidence that the conspiracy does not in fact exist.  The possibility that petitioners have obtained supracompetitive profits in the Japanese market does not alter this assessment.  Pp.  475 U. S. 588-593.
(d) Mistaken inferences in cases such as this one are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to protect.  There is little reason to be concerned that, by granting summary judgment in cases where the evidence of conspiracy is speculative or ambiguous, courts will encourage conspiracies.  Pp.  475 U. S. 593-595.
(e) The Court of Appeals erred in two respects:  the ""direct evidence"" on which it relied had little, if any, relevance to the alleged predatory pricing conspiracy, and the court failed to consider the absence of a plausible motive to engage in predatory pricing.  In the absence of any rational motive to conspire, neither petitioners' pricing practices, their conduct in the Japanese market, nor their agreements respecting prices and distributions in the American market sufficed to create a ""genuine issue for trial"" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e).  On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider whether there is other, unambiguous evidence of the alleged conspiracy.  Pp.  475 U. S. 595-598.

Syllabus

Petitioner, a physician and the proprietor of a clinic in Cincinnati, Ohio, that provided medical services primarily to welfare recipients, was indicted by a grand jury for fraudulently accepting payments from state welfare agencies.  During the grand jury investigation, subpoenas were issued for the appearance of two of petitioner's employees.  When the employees failed to appear, the Assistant County Prosecutor obtained capiases for their detention.  But when two County Deputy Sheriffs attempted to serve the capiases at petitioner's clinic, he barred the door and refused to let them enter the part of the clinic where the employees presumably were located.  Thereafter, Cincinnati police officers, whom petitioner had called, appeared and told petitioner to allow the Deputy Sheriffs to enter.  Petitioner continued to refuse.  The Deputy Sheriffs then called their superior, who told them to call the County Prosecutor's Office and to follow his instructions.  The Deputy Sheriffs spoke to the Assistant Prosecutor assigned to the case.  He in turn conferred with the County Prosecutor, who told him to instruct the Deputy Sheriffs to ""go in and get"" the employees.  The Assistant Prosecutor relayed these instructions to the Deputy Sheriffs.  After the Deputy Sheriffs tried unsuccessfully to force the door, city police officers obtained an axe and chopped down the door.  The Deputy Sheriffs then entered and searched the clinic, but were unable to locate the employees sought.  Although petitioner was acquitted of the fraud charges, he was indicted and convicted for obstructing police in the performance of an authorized act.  His conviction was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court.  Petitioner then filed a damages action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the county, among other defendants, alleging that the county had violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court dismissed the claim against the county on the ground that the individual officers were not acting pursuant to the kind of ""official policy"" that is the predicate for municipal liability under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner had failed to prove the existence of a county policy because he had shown nothing more than that, on ""this one occasion,"" the Prosecutor and the Sheriff decided to force entry into petitioner's clinic. 
Page 475 U. S. 470

Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  746 F.2d 337, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and II-C, concluding that:
1. The ""official policy"" requirement of Monell was intended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of the municipality's employees, and thereby make clear that municipal liability is limited to actions for which the municipality is actually responsible.  Monell held that recovery from a municipality is limited to acts that are, properly speaking, ""of the municipality,"" i.e., acts that the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.  With this understanding, it is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.  If the decision to adopt a particular course of action is directed by those who establish governmental policy, the municipality is equally responsible whether that action is to be taken only once or to be taken repeatedly.  Pp.  475 U. S. 477-481.
2. It was error to dismiss petitioner's claim against the county.  Ohio law authorizes the County Sheriff to obtain instructions from the County Prosecutor.  The Sheriff followed the practice of delegating certain decisions to the Prosecutor where appropriate.  In this case, the Deputy Sheriffs received instructions from the Sheriff's Office to follow the orders of the County Prosecutor, who made a considered decision based on his understanding of the law and commanded the Deputy Sheriffs to enter petitioner's clinic.  That decision directly caused a violation of petitioner's Fourth Amendment rights.  In ordering the Deputy Sheriffs to enter petitioner's clinic to serve the capiases on the employees, the County Prosecutor was acting as the final decisionmaker for the county, and the county may therefore be held liable under  1983.  Pp.  475 U. S. 484-485.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part II-B that not every decision by municipal officers automatically subjects the municipality to  1983 liability.  The fact that a particular official has discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion unless the official is also responsible, under state law, for establishing final governmental policy respecting such activity.  Municipal liability under  1983 attaches where -- and only where -- a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.  Pp.  475 U. S. 481-484.

No. 84-1160
Argued December 2, 1985
Decided March 25, 1986
475 U.S. 469

Syllabus

Petitioner, a physician and the proprietor of a clinic in Cincinnati, Ohio, that provided medical services primarily to welfare recipients, was indicted by a grand jury for fraudulently accepting payments from state welfare agencies.  During the grand jury investigation, subpoenas were issued for the appearance of two of petitioner's employees.  When the employees failed to appear, the Assistant County Prosecutor obtained capiases for their detention.  But when two County Deputy Sheriffs attempted to serve the capiases at petitioner's clinic, he barred the door and refused to let them enter the part of the clinic where the employees presumably were located.  Thereafter, Cincinnati police officers, whom petitioner had called, appeared and told petitioner to allow the Deputy Sheriffs to enter.  Petitioner continued to refuse.  The Deputy Sheriffs then called their superior, who told them to call the County Prosecutor's Office and to follow his instructions.  The Deputy Sheriffs spoke to the Assistant Prosecutor assigned to the case.  He in turn conferred with the County Prosecutor, who told him to instruct the Deputy Sheriffs to ""go in and get"" the employees.  The Assistant Prosecutor relayed these instructions to the Deputy Sheriffs.  After the Deputy Sheriffs tried unsuccessfully to force the door, city police officers obtained an axe and chopped down the door.  The Deputy Sheriffs then entered and searched the clinic, but were unable to locate the employees sought.  Although petitioner was acquitted of the fraud charges, he was indicted and convicted for obstructing police in the performance of an authorized act.  His conviction was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court.  Petitioner then filed a damages action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the county, among other defendants, alleging that the county had violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court dismissed the claim against the county on the ground that the individual officers were not acting pursuant to the kind of ""official policy"" that is the predicate for municipal liability under Monell v.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an Orthodox Jew and ordained rabbi, was ordered not to wear a yarmulke while on duty and in uniform as a commissioned officer in the Air Force at March Air Force Base, pursuant to an Air Force regulation that provides that authorized headgear may be worn out of doors but that indoors ""[h]eadgear [may] not be worn . . . except by armed security police in the performance of their duties.""  Petitioner then brought an action in Federal District Court, claiming that the application of the regulation to prevent him from wearing his yarmulke infringed upon his First Amendment freedom to exercise his religious beliefs.  The District Court permanently enjoined the Air Force from enforcing the regulation against petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The First Amendment does not prohibit the challenged regulation from being applied to petitioner, even though its effect is to restrict the wearing of the headgear required by his religious beliefs.  That Amendment does not require the military to accommodate such practices as wearing a yarmulke in the face of its view that they would detract from the uniformity sought by dress regulations.  Here, the Air Force has drawn the line essentially between religious apparel that is visible and that which is not, and the challenged regulation reasonably and evenhandedly regulates dress in the interest of the military's perceived need for uniformity.

475 U.S. 534

Syllabus 
When a group of high school students in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, formed a club for the purpose of promoting ""spiritual growth and positive attitudes in the lives of its members,"" they asked the Principal for permission to hold club meetings on the school premises during student activity periods.  The matter was referred to the School Superintendent, who denied permission on the basis of an opinion of the School District Solicitor, and the School Board upheld the denial.  The students then filed suit in Federal District Court against the School District, members of the School Board, the Superintendent, and the Principal, alleging that the refusal to allow the club to meet on the same basis as other student groups because of its religious activities violated the First Amendment, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The District Court, on motions for summary judgment, ruled in the students' favor, but entered no injunction and granted no relief against any defendant in his individual capacity.  The School District took no appeal, but complied with the judgment and allowed the students' club to conduct the meetings as requested.  However, respondent Youngman (hereafter respondent), who was then still a member of the School Board, did appeal.  No one raised any question about his standing to appeal, and the Court of Appeals held in his favor.
Held:  Respondent had no standing to appeal, and therefore the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to hear his appeal.  Pp.  475 U. S. 541-549.
(a) Federal courts have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the federal statutes enacted pursuant thereto.  Every federal appellate court must satisfy itself that the party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has a sufficient stake in the outcome of the litigation to support that jurisdiction.  Pp.  475 U. S. 541-543.
(b) Respondent had no standing to appeal in his individual capacity.  Although the complaint alleged that the action was brought against the defendants ""in their individual and official capacities,"" there is nothing else in the complaint or in the record to support the suggestion that relief was sought or awarded against any School Board member in his individual capacity.  P.  475 U. S. 543.
(c) As a member of the School Board sued in his official capacity, respondent had no personal stake in the outcome of the litigation, and 
Page 475 U. S. 535
 therefore had no standing to appeal in that capacity.  His status as a Board member did not permit him to ""step into the shoes of the Board"" and invoke its right to appeal.  Pp.  475 U. S. 543-545.
(d) Nor did respondent have standing to appeal in his capacity as a parent of a student attending the high school.  There is nothing in the record to indicate anything about his status as a parent, or to indicate that he or his children have suffered any injury as a result of the District Court's judgment or of the activities of the club in question subsequent to the entry of that judgment.  Respondent was not sued as a parent, and thus was plainly not a ""party"" in that capacity in the District Court.  Pp.  475 U. S. 545-549.

Syllabus 
In 1980, appellant filed a paternity and child support petition in a Pennsylvania court on behalf of her 7-year-old daughter, who had been born out of wedlock, alleging that appellee was the natural father and had ceased making contributions to the daughter's support in 1975.  The court held that the action was barred under the state statute of limitations, which then required that paternity actions be commenced within six years of the child's birth or within two years of the putative father's last voluntary support contribution or written acknowledgment of paternity.  Appellant's contention that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was rejected.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed.
Held:  The judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for further consideration in light of Pennsylvania's intervening enactment of a new statute providing that a paternity action may be commenced at any time within 18 years of the child's birth.  Appellee conceded that he was subject to the new statute and would be liable for child support from the date paternity was established, but he contended that he would not be liable for support payments dating back to when the petition was filed in 1980.  If the Pennsylvania court were to interpret the new statute to require payments dating back to 1980, the constitutionality of the 6-year statute of limitations would be irrelevant.

 In this case the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the comprehensive remedial scheme established by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 1 (CSRA) indicates a congressional intent to preclude judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act 2 of claims that could have been reviewed administratively under the CSRA. 248 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 771 F.2d 1504 (1985).

 Petitioner is scheduled to be executed at 12:01 tomorrow morning. In his application for a stay and petition for writ of habeas corpus, he claims that the death-qualification of his jury and the consequent exclusion for cause of one prospective juror from 
Page 475 U.S. 1076 , 1077
 the panel because of her opposition to the death penalty deprived him of his right to an impartial jury and his right to a jury selected from a representative cross section of the community in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. A case raising an identical claim is now pending before this Court. Lockhart v. McCree, No. 84-1865. 
 The District Court denied the petition and denied a certificate of probable cause. It found that petitioner had abused the writ, that petitioner's claims were procedurally barred, and, in any event, that these claims were meritless. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied petitioner's application for a certificate of probable cause and a stay of execution, finding his claims to lack merit. 772 F.2d 668 (1985). 
 Three times in the past six months, a stay of execution has been granted in virtually identical circumstances. See Bowden v. Kemp, 474 U.S. 891 (1985), Moore v. Blackburn, No. A-261 ( 85-5555); Celestine v. Blackburn, 473 U.S. 938 (1985). In light of the disposition of those applications, I can see no justification whatever for the Court's action today. As I noted only two days ago: ""I can only lament this Court's own special contribution to the arbitrariness and freakishness that continues to characterize the implementation of the death penalty."" Harich v. Wainwright, 475 U.S. 1074, 1076, 1393. 
 Justice BLACKMUN and Justice STEVENS would grant the application for stay.

 The application for stay of execution of sentence of death, scheduled for Wednesday, March 19, 1986, presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice POWELL, concurring. 
 The other capital case in which execution was scheduled for tomorrow is James v. Wainwright, 475 U.S. 1074. I voted to grant a stay of execution in that case. Both James and this case profess to present claims similar to that pending before the Court in Lockhart v. McCree, No. 84-1865. 
 This case, however, presents an issue different from James and one without merit. In James, the Lockhart issue was at least ar-

Harich v. Wainwright, 484 So.2d 1237 (1986). Similarly, before this Court applicant makes no allegation that persons on the venire were excluded during voir dire because of any objections to capital punishment. 
 Accordingly, my vote is to deny the application for a stay of execution.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Four Justices of this Court have voted to defer consideration of the petition for certiorari accompanying this application for a stay pending our decision in Lockhart v. McCree, No. 84-1865. Applicant has raised a claim that would be directly affected by the decision in McCree. Although no prospective juror in this case was actually stricken because of expressed scruples against the death penalty, applicant alleges that the jurors' exposure to voir dire on their willingness to inflict the death penalty rendered them more likely to convict him. This is identical to a claim at issue in McCree. It is also identical to claims raised in James v. Wainwright, 475 U.S. 1074, and Adams v. Wainwright, 475 U.S. 1062, both of which were stayed by this Court, the former only hours ago. James, like applicant, relied solely on the jurors' exposure to death qualification; he nowhere claimed that the exclusion of jurors via peremptory strikes brought his case within the scope of McCree. See Pet. for Cert. in No. 85- 6545, pp. 6-13. Although this Court has deferred consideration of numerous other petitions for certiorari pending our decision in McCree, and has issued stays of execution where necessary to permit this deferral, the Court inexplicably refuses to treat the case before us as we have treated these others.

No. 84-978
Argued December 9, 1985
Decided March 10, 1986
475 U.S. 355

Syllabus 
The New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act), enacted in 1977 to respond to the problem of hazardous substance release, imposes an excise tax upon major petroleum and chemical facilities within the State to finance the prevention and cleanup of oil spills and leaks of hazardous chemicals from disposal sites.  The tax revenue goes into a permanent fund (Spill Fund), which may spend money not only to clean up releases of hazardous substances, but also to compensate third parties for certain economic losses sustained as a result of such releases, and to pay administrative and research costs.  The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), enacted in response to similar concerns, imposes an excise tax on petroleum and other specified chemicals and establishes a trust fund (Superfund) that may be used to clean up hazardous substance releases and for certain other purposes.  CERCLA does not cover oil spills; nor is Superfund money available to compensate private parties for economic harms that result from hazardous substance releases.  Superfund money may be used to reimburse private parties only for their cleanup activities that are expressly authorized by the Federal Government; to finance Federal or State Government expenses for short-term cleanup or for measures to achieve a permanent remedy to a particular hazardous waste problem; and to compensate those governments for damages to their natural resources.  Appellant corporations, having paid the Spill Act tax, brought suit in the New Jersey Tax Court against appellees (the State and certain of its officials), seeking a tax refund and a declaratory judgment that the New Jersey tax was invalid in its entirety as being preempted under  114(c) of CERCLA, which provides:
""Except as provided in this chapter, no person may be required to contribute to any fund, the purpose of which is to pay compensation for claims for any costs of response or damages or claims which may be compensated under this subchapter.""
Section 114(c) also contains a saving provision stating that nothing in  114(c) shall be interpreted to prevent a State from using general revenues for such a fund or from imposing a special tax to purchase or locate equipment or otherwise prepare for a response to hazardous substance releases.  The court entered summary judgment for appellees, and the Appellate Division 
Page 475 U. S. 356
 of the New Jersey Superior Court affirmed.  The New Jersey Supreme Court also affirmed, holding that the Spill Fund tax was not preempted by  114(c) insofar as the Spill Fund
""is used to compensate hazardous waste cleanup costs and related claims that are either not covered or not actually paid under Superfund.""
Held:
1. The words ""costs of response or damages or claims"" in  114(c) are to be read as a unit, and the entire phrase is modified by the phrase ""which may be compensated under this subchapter,"" thus preempting any special state tax fund used to reimburse either a State or a third party for cleanup expenses.  An interpretation of those terms so as to include only a private party's cleanup expenses, and so as to permit state fund expenditures for all state government cleanup efforts is not supported by CERCLA's history or the wording of other provisions of CERCLA, particularly the saving provision of  114(c) which, in authorizing special state taxes to pay for the State's preparations for responding to hazardous substance releases, would be redundant if the preemption provision did not cover direct governmental expenditures at all.  Pp.  475 U. S. 363-370.
2. Section 114(c)'s phrase ""which may be compensated under this subchapter"" is to be interpreted as preempting any state fund that is intended, in whole or in part, to pay for the same types of expenses that may be paid by Superfund, and not as covering only expenses that are actually paid by Superfund.  Pp.  475 U. S. 370-371.
3. Neither the structure nor the legislative history of CERCLA supports appellees' contention that, although  114(c) is not restricted to cases in which Superfund actually disburses money, it applies only when Superfund pays a claim or would have paid the claim had it not already been paid by a state fund.  Remedying the Nation's toxic waste problems as effectively as possible was not the sole policy choice reflected in CERCLA.  Congress' decision to enact a preemption provision resulted in part from its concern about the potentially adverse effects of overtaxation on the competitiveness of the American petrochemical industry.  That consideration cautions against concluding that Congress would not have wanted to hinder state attempts to clean up hazardous substances in any way.  Nor is there sufficient support in  114(c)'s language or history to accept appellees' contention that, in view of the limited availability of Superfund money, only projects that have been actually approved, or are almost certain to be approved, can be termed ""eligible"" for Superfund financing, and then only to the extent of the approved funding.  Pp.  475 U. S. 371-374.
4. The National Contingency Plan -- which CERCLA requires to be revised annually to list sites most in need of federal efforts -- provides 
Page 475 U. S. 357
 the appropriate measure of whether a given expenditure constitutes ""costs of response or damages or claims which may be compensated"" by Superfund.  Since CERCLA also provides that a State must agree to pay at least 10% of the cost of any remedial action for a hazardous site within the State, such state share is not eligible for Superfund money, and thus is not a cost that ""may be compensated"" for purposes of  114(c).  Under the above-stated principles, use of the New Jersey Spill Fund to compensate third parties for damage resulting from hazardous substance discharges, to pay personnel and equipment costs, to administer the fund, and to conduct research is beyond the scope of CERCLA, and therefore not preempted by  114(c).  However, use of the Spill Fund to finance state governmental cleanup (except the 10% state share of remedial costs) and to reimburse third parties for cleanup costs is preempted, so long as such efforts occur at sites that are eligible for Superfund financing according to the terms of the National Contingency Plan.  Pp.  475 U. S. 374-376.

475 U.S. 387

Syllabus 
Following a jury trial in Federal District Court, respondent was convicted of conspiring to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, and related offenses.  Part of the evidence consisted of taped conversations between various participants in the conspiracy.  Respondent sought to exclude the recorded statements of the unindicted coconspirators, including one Lazaro, on the ground that they did not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), which provides that a statement by a coconspirator of a party made ""during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy"" is not hearsay when offered against the party.  Respondent also objected to the admission of the statements on Confrontation Clause grounds, contending that they were inadmissible absent a showing that the declarants were unavailable.  The District Court held that the statements satisfied Rule 801(d)(2)(E), and admitted the statements, conditioned on the prosecution's commitment to produce Lazaro.  The Government subpoenaed Lazaro, but he failed to appear, and defense counsel made no effort to secure his presence.  The court then overruled respondent's renewed Confrontation Clause objections, holding that Lazaro's statements were admissible because they satisfied the coconspirator rule.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in reliance on Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, that, although Rule 801(d)(2)(E) had been satisfied, the Confrontation Clause established an independent requirement that the Government, as a condition to admission of any out-of court statements, must show the declarant's unavailability.
Held:  The Confrontation Clause does not require a showing of unavailability as a condition to admission of the out-of court statements of a nontestifying coconspirator.  Pp.  475 U. S. 392-400.
(a) Ohio v. Roberts, supra, which simply reaffirmed a longstanding rule that applies unavailability analysis to the prior testimony of a witness not produced at trial, cannot fairly be read to stand for the proposition that no out-of court statement can be introduced by the prosecution without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.  Pp.  475 U. S. 392-394.
(b) The principles whereby prior testimony may be admitted as a substitute for live testimony only if the declarant is unavailable do not apply to coconspirator statements.  Co-conspirator statements derive much of their value from the fact that they are made in a context very different 
Page 475 U. S. 388
 from trial, and therefore are usually irreplaceable as substantive evidence.  Their admission into evidence thus actually furthers the Confrontation Clause's mission of advancing the ""truth-determining process.""  Pp.  475 U. S. 394-396.
(c) Little benefit would be accomplished by an unavailability rule.  Under such a rule, if the coconspirator either is unavailable or is available and produced by the prosecution, his prior statements could be introduced.  Nor is an unavailability rule likely to produce much testimony that adds anything to the ""truth-determining process"" over and above what would be produced without such a rule, because the relative interests of the parties will have changed drastically.  In contrast to the slight benefits, the burden imposed by an unavailability rule is significant.  A rule that required each invocation of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) to be accompanied by a decision on the declarant's availability would impose a substantial burden on the entire criminal justice system.  Moreover, a significant practical burden would be imposed on the prosecution, since, in every case involving coconspirators' statements, the prosecution would be required to identify each declarant, locate them, and then attempt to ensure their availability for trial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 396-400.

The District Court held that the statements satisfied Rule 801(d)(2)(E), and admitted the statements, conditioned on the prosecution's commitment to produce Lazaro.  The Government subpoenaed Lazaro, but he failed to appear, and defense counsel made no effort to secure his presence.  The court then overruled respondent's renewed Confrontation Clause objections, holding that Lazaro's statements were admissible because they satisfied the coconspirator rule.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, in reliance on Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, that, although Rule 801(d)(2)(E) had been satisfied, the Confrontation Clause established an independent requirement that the Government, as a condition to admission of any out-of court statements, must show the declarant's unavailability.
Held:  The Confrontation Clause does not require a showing of unavailability as a condition to admission of the out-of court statements of a nontestifying coconspirator.  Pp.  475 U. S. 392-400.
(a) Ohio v. Roberts, supra, which simply reaffirmed a longstanding rule that applies unavailability analysis to the prior testimony of a witness not produced at trial, cannot fairly be read to stand for the proposition that no out-of court statement can be introduced by the prosecution without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.  Pp.  475 U. S. 392-394.
(b) The principles whereby prior testimony may be admitted as a substitute for live testimony only if the declarant is unavailable do not apply to coconspirator statements.  Co-conspirator statements derive much of their value from the fact that they are made in a context very different 
Page 475 U. S. 388
 from trial, and therefore are usually irreplaceable as substantive evidence.  Their admission into evidence thus actually furthers the Confrontation Clause's mission of advancing the ""truth-determining process.""  Pp.  475 U. S. 394-396.
(c) Little benefit would be accomplished by an unavailability rule.  Under such a rule, if the coconspirator either is unavailable or is available and produced by the prosecution, his prior statements could be introduced.  Nor is an unavailability rule likely to produce much testimony that adds anything to the ""truth-determining process"" over and above what would be produced without such a rule, because the relative interests of the parties will have changed drastically.  In contrast to the slight benefits, the burden imposed by an unavailability rule is significant.  A rule that required each invocation of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) to be accompanied by a decision on the declarant's availability would impose a substantial burden on the entire criminal justice system.  Moreover, a significant practical burden would be imposed on the prosecution, since, in every case involving coconspirators' statements, the prosecution would be required to identify each declarant, locate them, and then attempt to ensure their availability for trial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 396-400.

Syllabus 
After respondent was arrested by the Cranston, Rhode Island, police in connection with a breaking and entering, the police obtained evidence suggesting that he might be responsible for the murder of a woman in Providence earlier that year.  An officer telephoned the Providence police at approximately 6 p.m., and an hour later Providence police officers arrived at the Cranston headquarters to question respondent about the murder.  That same evening, unknown to respondent, his sister, who was unaware that respondent was then under suspicion for murder, telephoned the Public Defender's Office to obtain legal assistance for her brother on the burglary charge.  At 8:15 p.m., an Assistant Public Defender telephoned the Cranston detective division, stated that she would act as respondent's counsel if the police intended to question him, and was informed that he would not be questioned further until the next day.  The attorney was not informed that the Providence police were there or that respondent was a murder suspect.  Less than an hour later, the Providence police began a series of interviews with respondent, giving him warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, before each session and obtaining three signed waivers from him prior to eliciting three signed statements admitting to the murder.  At all relevant times, respondent was unaware of his sister's efforts to retain counsel and of the attorney's telephone call, but at no time did he request an attorney.  The state trial court denied his pretrial motion to suppress the statements, finding that he had validly waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel.  Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder, and the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting the contention that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments required suppression of the statements.  Respondent then unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the police conduct in failing to inform respondent as to the attorney's call had fatally tainted his waivers of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and right to counsel. 
Page 475 U. S. 413

Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in construing the Fifth Amendment to require the exclusion of respondent's confessions.  The record supports the state court findings that the Providence police followed Miranda procedures with precision in obtaining respondent's written waivers of his Fifth Amendment rights prior to eliciting the confessions.  Pp.  475 U. S. 420-428.
(a) The police's failure to inform respondent of the attorney's telephone call did not deprive him of information essential to his ability to knowingly waive his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to the presence of counsel.  Events occurring outside of a suspect's presence and entirely unknown to him can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.  Once it is demonstrated that a suspect's decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State's intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law.  The level of the police's culpability -- whether intentional or inadvertent -- in failing to inform respondent of the telephone call has no bearing on the validity of the waivers.  Pp.  475 U. S. 421-424.
(b) Miranda's reach will not be extended so as to require the reversal of a conviction if the police are less than forthright in their dealings with an attorney or if they fail to tell a suspect of an attorney's unilateral efforts to contact him.  Reading Miranda to forbid police deception of an attorney would cut that decision loose from its rationale of guarding against abridgment of the suspect's Fifth Amendment rights.  And, while a rule requiring that the police inform a suspect of an attorney's efforts to reach him might add marginally to Miranda's goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation, overriding practical considerations -- particularly the ease and clarity of Miranda's application -- counsel against adoption of the rule.  Moreover, such a rule would work a substantial and inappropriate shift in the subtle balance struck in Miranda between society's legitimate law enforcement interests and the protection of the accused's Fifth Amendment rights.  Pp.  475 U. S. 424-428.
2. The conduct of the police did not violate respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  That right initially attaches only after the first formal charging procedure, whereas the challenged police conduct here occurred prior to respondent's arraignment.  The contention that the right to noninterference with an attorney's dealings with a criminal suspect arises the moment that the relationship is formed, or, at the very least, once the suspect is placed in custodial interrogation, is not supported by precedent.  Moreover, such contention is both practically 
Page 475 U. S. 414
 and theoretically unsound.  By its very terms, the Sixth Amendment becomes applicable only when the government's role shifts from investigation to accusation through the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings.  The possibility that custodial interrogation may have important consequences at trial, standing alone, is insufficient to trigger the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Pp.  475 U. S. 428-432.
3. Nor was the asserted misconduct of the police -- particularly the conveying of false information to the attorney -- so offensive as to deprive respondent of the fundamental fairness guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although, on facts more egregious than those presented here, police deception might rise to a level of a due process violation, the conduct challenged here falls short of the kind of misbehavior that so shocks the sensibilities of civilized society as to warrant a federal intrusion into the criminal processes of the States.  Pp.  475 U. S. 432-434.

 Eleven years ago, while in Cobb County, Georgia, Potts and a female companion persuaded Robert Snyder to give them a ride in a pickup truck. After Snyder agreed, Potts shot him through the left ear and nose with a pistol. Snyder acted as if he were unconscious while Potts dragged him out of the truck. Potts robbed 
Page 475 U.S. 1068 , 1069
 Snyder and then, unable to start the truck, walked to a nearby home. There he told Michael Priest that an accident had occurred. Priest drove Potts back to the truck. Upon their arrival, Priest saw Snyder lying in a ditch and attempted to help him. But Potts ordered Priest to drive him and his companion to the next county, Forsyth County. Once there, he forced Priest out of the car at gunpoint. Priest said, ""Oh my God, don't kill me""; Potts retorted that there was no such thing as God, and that he would determine whether Priest would live or die. Potts then put a gun to Priest's head and killed him. 
 Potts was convicted in the Superior Court of Cobb County of kidnaping Priest with bodily injury, armed robbery of Priest, and armed robbery and aggravated assault of Snyder. Potts was sentenced to death for the kidnaping and for the armed robbery. He was subsequently tried in the Superior Court of Forsyth County for the murder of Priest and received another death sentence. Potts' convictions and sentences were affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court, although the court vacated Potts' death sentence for armed robbery. Potts v. State, 241 Ga. 67, 69, 243 S.E.2d 510, 514 (1978). He then sought and was denied state habeas relief. 
 Potts next sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The District Court ordered a new guilt/innocence trial with respect to the Cobb County kidnaping conviction and a new sentencing trial with respect to the Forsyth County murder conviction. 575 F.Supp. 374 (1983). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 734 F.2d 526 (11th Cir.1984). 
 Potts' federal habeas petition contained several issues that had never been presented to the Georgia state courts; for the first time in his petition, he argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel . This issue had not been raised on direct appeal or on state habeas. Indeed, in the District Court Potts moved to amend his federal habeas petition to include this new claim. The State contended that Potts had not exhausted his state remedies, citing this Court's opinion in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982). The District Court nonetheless granted the motion to amend, stating that it was ""hard pressed to see how [the State] would be prejudiced by the granting of the . . . motion.""

475 U.S. 335

Syllabus 
On the basis of the monitoring of two telephone calls pursuant to a court-authorized wiretap of the telephone of an acquaintance of respondents' daughter, petitioner Rhode Island state trooper (hereafter petitioner) prepared felony complaints charging respondents with possession of marihuana.  The complaints were presented to a state judge, accompanied by arrest warrants and supporting affidavits.  The judge signed the warrants and respondents were arrested, but the charges were subsequently dropped when the grand jury did not return an indictment.  Respondents then brought a damages action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that petitioner, in applying for the arrest warrants, violated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The case was tried to a jury, and the court, while granting a directed verdict for petitioner on other grounds at the close of respondents' evidence, stated that a police officer who believes that the facts stated in an affidavit are true and submits them to a neutral magistrate may be entitled to immunity under the ""objective reasonableness"" standard of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Petitioner is not entitled to absolute immunity, but only to qualified immunity from liability for damages.  Pp.  475 U. S. 339-346.
(a) Neither the common law nor public policy affords any support for absolute immunity.  Such immunity cannot be permitted on the basis that petitioner's function in seeking the arrest warrants was similar to that of a complaining witness, since complaining witnesses were not absolutely immune at common law.  As a matter of public policy, qualified immunity provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  Nor is there any tradition of absolute immunity for a police officer requesting a warrant comparable to that afforded a prosecutor at common law.  In the case of an officer applying for a warrant, the judicial process will, on the whole, benefit from a rule of qualified rather than absolute immunity.  The Harlow ""objective reasonableness"" standard, which gives ample room for mistaken judgments, will not deter an officer from submitting an affidavit when there is probable cause to make an arrest, and defines the qualified 
Page 475 U. S. 336
 immunity accorded an officer whose request for a warrant allegedly caused an unconstitutional arrest.   475 U. S.  340-345.
(b) Petitioner cannot avoid liability under the rule of qualified immunity on the grounds that the act of applying for an arrest warrant is per se objectively reasonable where the officer believes that the facts alleged in his affidavit are true, and that he is entitled to rely on the judicial officer's judgment in issuing the warrant, and hence finding that probable cause exists.  The question is whether a reasonably well-trained officer in petitioner's position would have known that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause, and that he should not have applied for the warrant.  If such was the case, the application for the warrant was not objectively reasonable, because it created the unnecessary danger of an unlawful arrest.  Pp.  475 U. S. 345-346.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Chicago Teachers Union has been the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the Chicago Board of Education's educational employees since 1967.  Approximately 95% of the employees are members of the Union.  Until 1982, the members' dues financed the entire cost of the Union's collective bargaining and contract administration, and nonmembers received the benefits of the Union's representation without making any contributions to its cost.  In an attempt to solve this ""free rider"" problem, the Union and the Board entered into an agreement requiring the Board to deduct ""proportionate share payments"" from nonmembers' paychecks.  The Union determined that the ""proportionate share"" assessed on nonmembers was 95% of union dues, computed on the basis of the Union's financial records.  The Union also established a procedure for considering nonmembers' objections to the deductions.  After the deduction was made, a nonmember could object by writing to the Union President, and the objection would then meet a three-stage procedure:  (1) the Union's Executive Committee would consider the objection and notify the objector within 30 days of its decision; (2) if the objector disagreed with that decision and appealed within another 30 days, the Union's Executive Board would consider the objection; and (3) if the objector continued to protest after the Executive Board's decision, the Union's President would select an arbitrator.  If an objection was sustained at any stage, the remedy would be a reduction in future deductions and a rebate for the objector.  Respondent objecting nonmembers of the Union brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the Union procedure on the grounds that it violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression and association and their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and also permitted the use of their proportionate shares for impermissible purposes.  The District Court rejected the challenges and upheld the procedure.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the procedure was constitutionally inadequate.  The court rejected the Union's defense that its subsequent adoption of an arrangement whereby it voluntarily placed all of the objectors' agency fees in escrow cured any constitutional defects.

Held:
1. Under an agency shop agreement, procedural safeguards are necessary to prevent compulsory subsidization of ideological activity by nonunion employees who object thereto while at the same time not restricting the union's ability to require any employee to contribute to the cost of collective bargaining activities.  The fact that nonunion employees' rights are protected by the First Amendment requires that the procedure be carefully tailored to minimize an agency shop's infringement on those rights.  And the nonunion employee must have a fair opportunity to identify the impact on those rights and to assert a meritorious First Amendment claim.  Pp.  475 U. S. 301-304.
2. Here, the original Union procedure contained three constitutional defects.  First, it failed to minimize the risk that nonunion employees' contributions might be temporarily used for impermissible purposes.  Second, it failed to provide nonmembers with adequate information about the basis for the proportionate share from which the advance deduction of dues was calculated.  And third, it failed to provide for a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker.  The nonunion employee, whose First Amendment rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.  Pp.  475 U. S. 304-309.
3. The Union's subsequent adoption of an escrow arrangement did not cure all of these defects.  Two still remain -- failure to provide an adequate explanation for the advance reduction of dues and to provide for a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker.  Pp.  475 U. S. 309-310.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Chicago Teachers Union has been the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the Chicago Board of Education's educational employees since 1967.  Approximately 95% of the employees are members of the Union.  Until 1982, the members' dues financed the entire cost of the Union's collective bargaining and contract administration, and nonmembers received the benefits of the Union's representation without making any contributions to its cost.  In an attempt to solve this ""free rider"" problem, the Union and the Board entered into an agreement requiring the Board to deduct ""proportionate share payments"" from nonmembers' paychecks.  The Union determined that the ""proportionate share"" assessed on nonmembers was 95% of union dues, computed on the basis of the Union's financial records.  The Union also established a procedure for considering nonmembers' objections to the deductions.  After the deduction was made, a nonmember could object by writing to the Union President, and the objection would then meet a three-stage procedure:  (1) the Union's Executive Committee would consider the objection and notify the objector within 30 days of its decision; (2) if the objector disagreed with that decision and appealed within another 30 days, the Union's Executive Board would consider the objection; and (3) if the objector continued to protest after the Executive Board's decision, the Union's President would select an arbitrator.

No. 84-1077
Argued December 10, 1985
Decided March 4, 1986
475 U.S. 312

Syllabus 
During the course of a riot at the Oregon State Penitentiary, a prison officer was taken hostage and placed in a cell on the upper tier of a two-tier cellblock.  In an attempt to free the hostage, prison officials worked out a plan that called for the prisoner security manager to enter the cellblock unarmed, followed by prison officers armed with shotguns.  The security manager ordered one of the officers to fire a warning shot and to shoot low at any inmates climbing the stairs to the upper tier, since he would be climbing the stairs to free the hostage.  One of the officers, after firing a warning shot, shot respondent in the left knee when he started up the stairs.  Respondent subsequently brought an action in Federal District Court against petitioner prison officials pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging, inter alia, that they had deprived him of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  At the conclusion of the trial, the District Court directed a verdict for petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial on respondent's Eighth Amendment claim.
Held:
1. The shooting of respondent did not violate his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments.  Pp.  475 U. S. 318-326.
(a) It is obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that characterize the conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, whether that conduct occurs in connection with establishing conditions of confinement, supplying medical needs, or restoring control over a tumultuous cellblock.  The infliction of pain in the course of a prison security measure, therefore, does not amount to cruel and unusual punishment simply because it may appear in retrospect that the degree of force authorized or applied for security purposes was unreasonable, and hence unnecessary in the strict sense.  The general requirement that an Eighth Amendment claimant establish the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain should also be applied with due regard for differences in the kind of conduct involved.  Thus, where a prison security measure is undertaken to resolve a disturbance, such as occurred in this case, that poses significant risks to the safety of inmates 
Page 475 U. S. 313
 and prison staff, the question whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering ultimately turns on whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the purpose of causing harm.  Pp.  475 U. S. 318-322.
(b) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent, as must be done in reviewing the decision reversing the trial court's directed verdict for petitioners, it does not appear that the evidence supports a reliable inference of wantonness in the infliction of pain under the above standard.  Evidence arguably showing that the prison officials erred in judgment when they decided on a plan that employed potentially deadly force falls far short of a showing that there was no plausible basis for their belief that this degree of force was necessary.  In particular, the order to shoot, qualified by an instruction to shoot low, falls short of commanding the infliction of pain in a wanton and unnecessary fashion.  Nor was the failure to provide for a verbal warning, in addition to a warning shot, so insupportable as to be wanton, since any inmate running up the stairs after the prison security manager could reasonably be thought to pose a threat to the rescue attempt.  And the failure to take into account the possibility that respondent might climb the stairs in an effort to return to his cell does not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.  Assuming that the prison officer shot at respondent, rather than at the inmates as a group, does not establish that the officer shot respondent knowing that it was unnecessary to do so.  Under all these circumstances, the shooting was part and parcel of a good faith effort to restore prison security.  Pp.  475 U. S. 322-326.
2. In this case, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot serve as an alternative basis for affirmance, independently of the Eighth Amendment.  In the prison security context, the Due Process Clause affords respondent no greater protection than does the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Pp.  475 U. S. 326-327.

 MISSOURI FARMERS ASSOCIATION, INC.v. UNITED STATES.No. 85-727 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 3, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In this case the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a federal regulation provides the appropriate rule for deciding whether the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) 
Page 475 U.S. 1053 , 1054
 retains a continuing security interest in collateral to whose sale the FmHA allegedly consented.* 764 F.2d 488 (1985). The question presented is whether, under United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 99 S. Ct. 1448 (1979), the Eighth Circuit erred in looking to federal regulations rather than state law for the rule of decision. 
 In Kimbell Foods this Court determined that although federal law should determine the priority of liens stemming from federal lending programs, a national rule is not necessary to protect the federal interests underlying the loan programs of the Small Business Administration and FmHA. Thus, we held that ""absent a congressional directive, the relative priority of private liens and consensual liens arising from these Government lending programs is to be determined under nondiscriminatory state laws."" Id., at 740 (emphasis added). 
 I find it difficult to reconcile the Court of Appeals' decision with Kimbell Foods. A federal regulation is not a congressional directive, and although Kimbell Foods involves a question of lien priority while the present case concerns the extinguishment of a federal lien, that distinction is tenuous at best. 
 Besides being in obvious tension with Kimbell Foods, the Court of Appeals' decision conflicts with the decision in United States v. Tugwell, 779 F.2d 5 (CA4 1985), which holds that under Kimbell Foods the question whether a FmHA lien is extinguished upon sale of the collateral must be resolved by looking to state law. I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict among the Courts of Appeals. 
[Footnote *] The regulation on which the Eighth Circuit relied is 7 CFR 1962. 18(b) (1985), which at the time the case was decided provided in relevant part:
 This regulation has since been rewritten: 50 Fed.Reg. 45787 (1985) ( proposed 7 CFR 1962.17(a)), which provides that ""[w]hen the borrower sells security, the property and proceeds remain subject to the lien until the lien is released by the County Supervisor."" This change in wording is immaterial to the issues presented in this case.

 Rehearing Denied April 21, 1986. 
 See 475 U.S. 1132. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case because petitioner was not represented by counsel at a critical stage of a criminal proceeding, and is therefore entitled to reversal of his conviction. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, and n. 25, ___, and n. 25 (1984); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489, 1181 (1978). 
 Petitioner was convicted of murdering a police officer and sentenced to death. After exhausting state remedies, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court. Petitioner contended that he had been denied counsel at a commitment hearing, a device used under Georgia law to determine the existence of probable cause to detain a suspect, Ga.Code Ann. 17-7-23 (1982), and one that the Georgia Supreme Court has held to be a critical stage of the prosecution, State v. Houston, 234 Ga. 721, 218 S.E.2d 13 (1975); cf. Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970). The District Court held that the hearing that took place in this case had not been a ""commitment hearing"" as contemplated 
Page 475 U.S. 1058 , 1059
 by state law, and that in any event petitioner had been represented by an attorney, Millard Farmer. 560 F.Supp. 525 (MD Ga.1983). Viewing the latter question as one of fact and the District Court's resolution as not clearly erroneous, a divided Court of Appeals affirmed without considering the nature of the hearing. 748 F.2d 1435 (CA11 1984). 
 Assuming for the sake of argument that the District Court's determination that attorney Farmer represented petitioner is a pure issue of fact, but see Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 342, 1714 (1980) (whether counsel engaged in multiple representation is mixed question of law and fact), I would not hesitate to hold that finding clearly erroneous. See 748 F.2d, at 1456 (Tuttle, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Petitioner, Son Fleming, was arrested along with Henry Willis and Larry Fleming, who is petitioner's nephew. Petitioner and his two codefendants requested and received separate appointed counsel. Larry Fleming's appointed counsel induced Farmer, an experienced full-time criminal attorney, to represent both Larry Fleming and Henry Willis. Farmer then requested a commitment hearing for his two clients, who, like petitioner, had been indicted for kidnaping but not yet for murder. Petitioner's counsel, who had been appointed on the kidnaping charge but not the murder charge, chose not to participate. Nevertheless, the prosecutor required petitioner to be at the hearing, at which the State introduced testimony on the kidnaping and murder charges, and permitted Farmer an opportunity to cross-examine. 
 The District Court found that Farmer had represented all three defendants at the hearing. It based this conclusion on the facts that the transcript showed Farmer appearing ""for the defendants,"" id., at 1444, and that the prosecutor had referred to Farmer as ""counsel for the defendants,"" ibid.

 Son H. FLEMING v. Ralph KEMP, Superintendent, Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center.No. 85-5386 Supreme Court of the United States March 3, 1986
 Rehearing Denied April 21, 1986. 
 See 475 U.S. 1132. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this case because petitioner was not represented by counsel at a critical stage of a criminal proceeding, and is therefore entitled to reversal of his conviction. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, and n. 25, ___, and n. 25 (1984); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489, 1181 (1978). 
 Petitioner was convicted of murdering a police officer and sentenced to death. After exhausting state remedies, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court. Petitioner contended that he had been denied counsel at a commitment hearing, a device used under Georgia law to determine the existence of probable cause to detain a suspect, Ga.Code Ann. 17-7-23 (1982), and one that the Georgia Supreme Court has held to be a critical stage of the prosecution, State v. Houston, 234 Ga. 721, 218 S.E.2d 13 (1975); cf. Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970). The District Court held that the hearing that took place in this case had not been a ""commitment hearing"" as contemplated 
Page 475 U.S. 1058 , 1059
 by state law, and that in any event petitioner had been represented by an attorney, Millard Farmer. 560 F.Supp. 525 (MD Ga.1983). Viewing the latter question as one of fact and the District Court's resolution as not clearly erroneous, a divided Court of Appeals affirmed without considering the nature of the hearing. 748 F.2d 1435 (CA11 1984). 
 Assuming for the sake of argument that the District Court's determination that attorney Farmer represented petitioner is a pure issue of fact, but see Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 342, 1714 (1980) (whether counsel engaged in multiple representation is mixed question of law and fact), I would not hesitate to hold that finding clearly erroneous. See 748 F.2d, at 1456 (Tuttle, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Petitioner, Son Fleming, was arrested along with Henry Willis and Larry Fleming, who is petitioner's nephew. Petitioner and his two codefendants requested and received separate appointed counsel. Larry Fleming's appointed counsel induced Farmer, an experienced full-time criminal attorney, to represent both Larry Fleming and Henry Willis. Farmer then requested a commitment hearing for his two clients, who, like petitioner, had been indicted for kidnaping but not yet for murder. Petitioner's counsel, who had been appointed on the kidnaping charge but not the murder charge, chose not to participate. Nevertheless, the prosecutor required petitioner to be at the hearing, at which the State introduced testimony on the kidnaping and murder charges, and permitted Farmer an opportunity to cross-examine. 
 The District Court found that Farmer had represented all three defendants at the hearing. It based this conclusion on the facts that the transcript showed Farmer appearing ""for the defendants,"" id., at 1444, and that the prosecutor had referred to Farmer as ""counsel for the defendants,"" ibid. The District Court also gave weight to Farmer's failure to inform the court during the hearing that he was not representing all three defendants, and to his cross-examination of the State's witnesses, which related to the conduct of all three defendants.

No. 83-5424
Argued November 7, 1984
Decided February 26, 1986
470 U.S. 68

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an indigent, was charged with first-degree murder and shooting with intent to kill.  At his arraignment in an Oklahoma trial court, his behavior was so bizarre that the trial judge, sua sponte, ordered him to be examined by a psychiatrist.  Shortly thereafter, the examining psychiatrist found petitioner to be incompetent to stand trial, and suggested that he be committed.  But six weeks later, after being committed to the state mental hospital, petitioner was found to be competent on the condition that he continue to be sedated within an antipsychotic drug.  The State then resumed proceedings, and, at a pretrial conference, petitioner's attorney informed the court that he would raise an insanity defense, and requested a psychiatric evaluation at state expense to determine petitioner's mental state at the time of the offense, claiming that he was entitled to such an evaluation by the Federal Constitution.  On the basis of United States ex rel. Smith v. Baldi, 344 U. S. 561, the trial court denied petitioner's motion for such an evaluation.  At the guilt phase of the ensuing trial, the examining psychiatrists testified that petitioner was dangerous to society, but there was no testimony as to his sanity at the time of the offense.  The jury rejected the insanity defense, and petitioner was convicted on all counts.  At the sentencing proceeding, the State asked for the death penalty on the murder counts, relying on the examining psychiatrists' testimony to establish the likelihood of petitioner's future dangerous behavior.  Petitioner had no expert witness to rebut this testimony or to give evidence in mitigation of his punishment, and he was sentenced to death.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences.  After rejecting, on the merits, petitioner's federal constitutional claim that, as an indigent defendant, he should have been provided the services of a court-appointed psychiatrist, the court ruled that petitioner had waived such claim by not repeating his request for a psychiatrist in his motion for a new trial.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review this case.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals' holding that the federal constitutional claim to a court-appointed psychiatrist was waived depended on the court's 
Page 470 U. S. 69
 federal law ruling, and consequently does not present an independent state ground for its decision.  Pp.  470 U. S. 74-75.
2. When a defendant has made a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor at trial, the Constitution requires that a State provide access to a psychiatrist's assistance on this issue if the defendant cannot otherwise afford one.  Pp.  470 U. S. 76-85.
(a) In determining whether, and under what conditions, a psychiatrist's participation is important enough to preparation of a defense to require the State to provide an indigent defendant with access to a psychiatrist, there are three relevant factors:  (i) the private interest that will be affected by the State's actions; (ii) the State's interest that will be affected if the safeguard is to be provided; and (iii) the probable value of the additional or substitute safeguards that are sought and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the affected interest if those safeguards are not provided.  The private interest in the accuracy of a criminal proceeding is almost uniquely compelling.  The State's interest in denying petitioner a psychiatrist's assistance is not substantial in light of the compelling interest of both the State and petitioner in accurate disposition.  And without a psychiatrist's assistance to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the insanity defense, to help determine whether that defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing the cross-examination of the State's psychiatric witnesses, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.  This is so particularly when the defendant is able to make an ex parte threshold showing that his sanity is likely to be a significant factor in his defense.  Pp.  470 U. S. 78-83.
(b) When the State at a capital sentencing proceeding presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness, the defendant, without a psychiatrist's assistance, cannot offer an expert's opposing view, and thereby loses a significant opportunity to raise in the jurors' minds questions about the State's proof of an aggravating factor.  In such a circumstance, where the consequence of error is so great, the relevance of responsive psychiatric testimony so evident, and the State's burden so slim, due process requires access to a psychiatric examination on relevant issues, to a psychiatrist's testimony, and to assistance in preparation at the sentencing phase.  Pp.  470 U. S. 83-84.
(c) United State ex rel. Smith v. Baldi, supra, is not authority for absolving the trial court of its obligation to provide petitioner access to a psychiatrist.  Pp.  470 U. S. 84-85.
3. On the record, petitioner was entitled to access to a psychiatrist's assistance at his trial, it being clear that his mental state at the time of 
Page 470 U. S. 70
 the offense was a substantial factor in his defense, and that the trial court was on notice of that fact when the request for a court-appointed psychiatrist was made.  In addition, petitioner's future dangerousness was a significant factor at the sentencing phase, so as to entitle him to a psychiatrist's assistance on this issue, and the denial of that assistance deprived him of due process.

Syllabus 
Respondent was tried before a jury in a Texas District Court and convicted of murder.  He elected to be sentenced by the jury, as was his right under Texas law, and the jury imposed a 20-year sentence.  The trial judge then granted respondent's motion for a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.  Respondent was retried before a jury, with the same trial judge presiding, and again was found guilty.  This time he elected to have the judge fix his sentence, and she imposed a 50-year sentence.  To justify the longer sentence, the judge entered the following findings of fact:  the testimony of two state witnesses who had not testified at the first trial added to the credibility of the State's key witness and detracted from the credibility of respondent and a defense witness; the two new witnesses' testimony directly implicated respondent in the commission of the murder and shed new light upon his life and conduct; and it was learned for the first time on retrial that respondent had been released from prison only four months before the murder.  The Texas Court of Appeals reversed and sentenced respondent to 20 years' imprisonment, considering itself bound by North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, wherein it was held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevented increased sentences on retrial when the increase was motivated by the sentencing judge's vindictiveness, and that, to show the absence of vindictiveness, the reasons for imposing the increased sentence must affirmatively appear.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, while holding that, as a matter of procedure, the case should have been remanded to the trial judge for resentencing, also held that, under Pearce, vindictiveness must be presumed even though a jury had fixed punishment at the first trial and a judge had fixed it at the second trial.
Held:  The Due Process Clause was not violated by the trial judge's imposition of a greater sentence on retrial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 137-144.
(a) The facts of this case provide no basis for a Pearce presumption of vindictiveness.  In contrast to Pearce, respondent's second trial came about because the trial judge herself concluded that the prosecutor's misconduct required it.  Granting respondent's motion for a new trial hardly suggests any vindictiveness on the judge's part toward him.  The presumption is also inapplicable because different sentencers assessed the

Syllabus 
In preparing for his Iowa state court trial on a murder charge, respondent consistently told his attorney that, although he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand when he stabbed the victim, he was convinced that the victim had a gun.  Respondent's companions who were present during the stabbing told counsel that they had not seen a gun, and no gun was found.  Counsel advised respondent that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish a claim of self-defense, and that only a reasonable belief that the victim had a gun nearby was necessary, even though no gun was actually present.  However, during preparation for direct examination shortly before trial, respondent for the first time told counsel that he had seen ""something metallic"" in the victim's hand.  When asked about this, respondent said:  ""If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead.""  On respondent's insisting that he would testify that he saw ""something metallic,"" counsel told him that, if he testified falsely, it would be counsel's duty to advise the court that he felt respondent was committing perjury, and that counsel probably would be allowed to impeach that testimony and would seek to withdraw from representation if respondent insisted on committing perjury.  Respondent ultimately testified as originally contemplated, admitting on cross-examination that he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand.  After the jury found respondent guilty, respondent moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair trial by counsel's admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or ""something metallic.""  The court denied the motion after a hearing, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that counsel's actions were not only permissible, but were required under Iowa law.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus relief, alleging that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney's refusal to allow him to testify as he proposed.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that an intent to commit perjury, communicated to counsel, does not alter a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel, and that counsel's threatened violation of his client's confidences violated the ""effective representation"" standards set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. 
Page 475 U. S. 158

Held:  The Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant to assistance of counsel is not violated when an attorney refuses to cooperate with the defendant in presenting perjured testimony at his trial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 164-176.
(a) Strickland v. Washington, supra, held that, to obtain relief by way of federal habeas corpus on a claim of a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, the movant must establish both serious attorney error and prejudice.  The Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney's conduct was ""reasonably effective.""  A court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of attorney conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct, and thereby intrude into a state's proper authority to define and apply the standards of professional conduct applicable to those it admits to practice in its courts.  Pp.  475 U. S. 164-166.
(b) Counsel's conduct here fell within the wide range of professional responses to threatened client perjury acceptable under the Sixth Amendment.  Counsel's duty of loyalty to, and advocacy of, the defendant's cause is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth.  Although counsel must take all reasonable lawful means to attain his client's objectives, counsel is precluded from taking steps or in any way assisting the client in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law.  Moreover, accepted norms require that a lawyer disclose his client's perjury and frauds upon the court.  Iowa's Code also expressly permits withdrawal from representation as an appropriate response of an attorney when the client threatens to commit perjury.  Pp.  475 U. S. 166-171.
(c) The Court of Appeals' holding is not supported by the record, since counsel's action, at most, deprived respondent of his contemplated perjury.  Whatever the scope of a constitutional right to testify, it is elementary that such a right does not extend to testifying falsely, and the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury.  There was no breach of professional duty in counsel's admonition to respondent that he would disclose respondent's perjury to the court.  Pp.  475 U. S. 171-175.
(d) As a matter of law, counsel's conduct here cannot establish the prejudice required for relief under the Strickland inquiry.  The ""conflict of interests"" involved was one imposed on the attorney by the client's proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony.  This is not the kind of conflict of interest that would render the representation constitutionally infirm.  Pp.  475 U. S. 175-176.

In preparing for his Iowa state court trial on a murder charge, respondent consistently told his attorney that, although he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand when he stabbed the victim, he was convinced that the victim had a gun.  Respondent's companions who were present during the stabbing told counsel that they had not seen a gun, and no gun was found.  Counsel advised respondent that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish a claim of self-defense, and that only a reasonable belief that the victim had a gun nearby was necessary, even though no gun was actually present.  However, during preparation for direct examination shortly before trial, respondent for the first time told counsel that he had seen ""something metallic"" in the victim's hand.  When asked about this, respondent said:  ""If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead.""  On respondent's insisting that he would testify that he saw ""something metallic,"" counsel told him that, if he testified falsely, it would be counsel's duty to advise the court that he felt respondent was committing perjury, and that counsel probably would be allowed to impeach that testimony and would seek to withdraw from representation if respondent insisted on committing perjury.  Respondent ultimately testified as originally contemplated, admitting on cross-examination that he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand.  After the jury found respondent guilty, respondent moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair trial by counsel's admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or ""something metallic.""  The court denied the motion after a hearing, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that counsel's actions were not only permissible, but were required under Iowa law.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus relief, alleging that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney's refusal to allow him to testify as he proposed.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that an intent to commit perjury, communicated to counsel, does not alter a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel, and that counsel's threatened violation of his client's confidences violated the ""effective representation"" standards set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. 
Page 475 U. S. 158

Held:  The Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant to assistance of counsel is not violated when an attorney refuses to cooperate with the defendant in presenting perjured testimony at his trial.  Pp.  475 U. S. 164-176.
(a) Strickland v. Washington, supra, held that, to obtain relief by way of federal habeas corpus on a claim of a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, the movant must establish both serious attorney error and prejudice.  The Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney's conduct was ""reasonably effective.""  A court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of attorney conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct, and thereby intrude into a state's proper authority to define and apply the standards of professional conduct applicable to those it admits to practice in its courts.  Pp.  475 U. S. 164-166.
(b) Counsel's conduct here fell within the wide range of professional responses to threatened client perjury acceptable under the Sixth Amendment.  Counsel's duty of loyalty to, and advocacy of, the defendant's cause is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth.  Although counsel must take all reasonable lawful means to attain his client's objectives, counsel is precluded from taking steps or in any way assisting the client in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law.  Moreover, accepted norms require that a lawyer disclose his client's perjury and frauds upon the court.  Iowa's Code also expressly permits withdrawal from representation as an appropriate response of an attorney when the client threatens to commit perjury.  Pp.  475 U. S. 166-171.
(c) The Court of Appeals' holding is not supported by the record, since counsel's action, at most, deprived respondent of his contemplated perjury.  Whatever the scope of a constitutional right to testify, it is elementary that such a right does not extend to testifying falsely, and the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury.  There was no breach of professional duty in counsel's admonition to respondent that he would disclose respondent's perjury to the court.  Pp.  475 U. S. 171-175.
(d) As a matter of law, counsel's conduct here cannot establish the prejudice required for relief under the Strickland inquiry.  The ""conflict of interests"" involved was one imposed on the attorney by the client's proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony.  This is not the kind of conflict of interest that would render the representation constitutionally infirm.  Pp.  475 U. S. 175-176.

Syllabus 
In 1970, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) certified the Firstbank Independent Employees Association (Firstbank) as the collective bargaining representative of a bargaining unit consisting of the employees of Seattle-First National Bank (SeaFirst), and successive collective bargaining agreements were negotiated.  In 1978, in an election in which only union members were allowed to vote, Firstbank voted to affiliate with an international union and changed its name to the Financial Institution Employees of America, Local 1182 (FIEA).  FIEA then petitioned the Board to amend its certification to reflect this change.  After initially granting the petition and holding that SeaFirst had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to recognize the amended certification or to bargain with FIEA, the Board, on reconsideration, held that, because nonunion employees were not allowed to vote in the affiliation election, the election did not meet minimal ""due process"" standards, and that therefore the affiliation was invalid.  Accordingly, the Board dismissed FIEA's unfair labor practice charge and vacated the amended certification.  The Court of Appeals granted FIEA's petition for review of the Board's decision and remanded the case, holding that the Board's requirement that nonunion employees be allowed to vote on affiliation questions was irrational and inconsistent with the National Labor Relations Act (Act).
Held:  The Board exceeded its authority under the Act in requiring that nonunion employees be allowed to vote for affiliation before it would order the employer to bargain with the affiliated union.  Pp.  475 U. S. 198-209.
(a) Such requirement dramatically changes the scheme under which the Board's practice has been to grant an independent union's petition to 
Page 475 U. S. 193
 amend the union's certification to reflect a name change resulting from affiliation with a national or international union if the Board found that union members had an adequate opportunity to vote on affiliation and that there was substantial ""continuity"" between the preaffiliation and postaffiliation union.  Pp.  475 U. S. 198-201.
(b) Under the Act, the certified union must be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of all employees in the bargaining unit, and the Board cannot discontinue that recognition without determining that the affiliation of that union with another union raises a question of representation and, if so, conducting an election to decide whether the certified union is still the choice of a majority of the unit.  Here, by refusing either to amend FIEA's certification or to order SeaFirst to bargain, the Board effectively circumvented the decertification procedures provided for by the Act.  Moreover, the Board's requirement that nonunion employees be allowed to vote in the affiliation election violated the policy Congress incorporated into the Act against outside interference in union decisionmaking.  Pp.  475 U. S. 201-204.
(c) Employees' dissatisfaction with representation is not a reason for requiring the union to allow nonunion employees to vote on union matters like affiliation.  Rather, the Act allows union members to control the shape and direction of the union.  Dissatisfaction with the decision union members make may be tested by a Board-conducted representation election only if it is unclear whether the recognized union retains majority support.  Any distinction between affiliation and other changes in a union's organization and structure does not justify the Board's meddling in the union's internal affairs.  Pp.  475 U. S. 205-208.
(d) The Board's new rule contravenes the Act's assumption that stable bargaining relationships are best maintained by allowing an affiliated union to continue representing a bargaining unit unless the Board finds that the affiliation raises a question of representation.  Such rule effectively gives the employer the power to veto an independent union's decision to affiliate, thereby allowing the employer to interfere directly with union decisionmaking that Congress intended to insulate from outside interference.

No. 84-1555
Argued December 2, 1985
Decided February 26, 1986*
475 U.S. 211

Syllabus 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), enacted in 1974, established a pension plan termination insurance program whereby the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a wholly owned Government corporation, collects insurance premiums from covered private retirement plans and provides benefits to participants if their plan terminates with insufficient assets to support the guaranteed benefits.  The program covers both single-employer and multiemployer pension plans.  With respect to the latter plans, ERISA delayed mandatory payment of guaranteed benefits until January 1, 1978, prior to which date the PBGC had discretionary authority to pay benefits upon the termination of a pension plan.  As that date approached, Congress became concerned that a significant number of multiemployer plans were experiencing extreme financial hardship, and that implementation of mandatory guarantees might induce several large plans to terminate, thus subjecting the insurance system to liability beyond its means.  After further delaying the effective date for the mandatory guarantees, Congress enacted the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (MPPAA) requiring an employer withdrawing from a multiemployer pension plan to pay a fixed and certain debt to the plan amounting to the employer's proportionate share of the plan's ""unfunded vested benefits.""  Appellant trustees administer a multiemployer pension plan for employers under collective bargaining agreements covering employees in the construction industry in California and Nevada.  Under the trust agreement and the plan, the employer's sole obligation is to pay the contributions required by the collective bargaining agreements, and the employer's obligation for pension benefits is ended when the employer pays the contribution to the pension trust.  Prior to enactment of the MPPAA, the trustees filed suit against the PBGC in Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that ERISA was unconstitutional as depriving the trustees, the employers, and the plan participants of property 
Page 475 U. S. 212
 without proper compensation.  During the course of the litigation, the MPPAA was enacted, and the District Court permitted the trustees to file an amended complaint to include a challenge to that Act.  Ultimately, the District Court granted summary judgment in the PBGC's favor, rejecting appellants' argument that imposition of withdrawal liability under the MPPAA violates the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  The withdrawal liability provisions of the MPPAA do not violate the Taking Clause.  Pp.  475 U. S. 221-228.
(a) In these cases, the United States under the MPPAA has taken nothing for its own use, and only has nullified a contractual provision limiting liability by imposing an additional obligation that is otherwise within Congress' power to impose.  That the statutory withdrawal liability will operate in this manner and will redound to the benefit of the pension trust does not justify a holding that the withdrawal liability provisions violate the Taking Clause.  Pp.  475 U. S. 221-224.
(b) In identifying a ""taking"" forbidden by the Taking Clause, three factors should be considered:  (1) ""the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant""; (2) ""the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations""; and (3) ""the character of the governmental action.""  Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104,  438 U. S. 124.  Examining the MPPAA in light of these factors supports the conclusion that the imposition of withdrawal liability does not constitute a compensable taking under the Taking Clause.  The interference with an employer's property rights resulting from requiring the employer to fund its share of the pension plan obligation arises from a public program that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good, and does not constitute a taking requiring Government compensation.  As to the severity of the MPPAA's economic impact, there is nothing to show that the withdrawal liability imposed on an employer will always be out of proportion to its experience with the pension plan.  And as to interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, employers had more than sufficient notice not only that pension plans were being regulated at the time the MPPAA was enacted, but also that withdrawal itself might trigger additional financial obligations.  Pp.  475 U. S. 224-228.

Syllabus 
Respondent and another man (Daugherty) robbed a bank in Ohio.  After an automobile chase, the police surrounded the two men when they stopped at a farmhouse.  Thereafter, the police heard shots fired inside the house, and respondent emerged from the house and surrendered.  The police then entered the house and found Daugherty dead.  Based on the Coroner's opinion that Daugherty had committed suicide, the State did not charge respondent with Daugherty's death, but with aggravated robbery.  Respondent pleaded guilty, but two days later admitted having shot Daugherty.  Respondent was then indicted for aggravated murder based on the bank robbery.  The state trial court denied his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and he was found guilty after a jury trial.  Ultimately, the Ohio Court of Appeals, finding that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred respondent's conviction for aggravated murder, modified that conviction to that of the lesser included offense of murder.  After the Ohio Supreme Court denied respondent's motion to appeal, he sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which denied the petition.  The Federal Court of Appeals reversed.  Apparently agreeing with respondent's assertion that evidence was admitted at his trial for aggravated murder that would have been inadmissible in a trial for murder, and stating that the jury ""may have been prejudiced"" by that evidence, the court held that respondent had established a ""reasonable possibility"" that he was prejudiced by the double jeopardy violation sufficient to warrant a new trial on the murder charge.
Held:  Reducing respondent's concededly jeopardy-barred conviction for aggravated murder to a conviction for murder that concededly was not jeopardy-barred was an adequate remedy for the double jeopardy violation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 244-248.
(a) When a jeopardy-barred conviction is reduced to a conviction for a lesser included offense that is not jeopardy-barred, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate a reasonable probability (i.e., a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome) that he would not have been convicted of the nonjeopardy-barred offense absent the presence of the jeopardy-barred offense.  Where it is clear that the jury necessarily 
Page 475 U. S. 238
 found that the defendant's conduct satisfies the elements of the lesser included offense, it would be incongruous to order another trial as a means of curing the double jeopardy violation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 244-247.
(b) Here, the Federal Court of Appeals' legal and factual basis for ordering the writ of habeas corpus was seriously flawed.  Its ""reasonable possibility"" standard was not sufficiently demanding, it did not expressly say that it agreed with respondent that certain evidence admitted at his trial would not have been admitted in a separate trial for murder, nor did it refer to any Ohio authorities, and its observation that the admission of such evidence ""may have prejudiced the jury"" falls far short of a considered conclusion that, if the evidence at issue was not before the jury in a separate trial for murder, there was a reasonable probability that respondent would not have been convicted.

The Superior Court upheld the ordinance, but was reversed by the California Court of Appeal.  In the meantime, based on the intervening decision in Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, the question arose as to whether the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was preempted by the Sherman Act.  The California Supreme Court held that there was no conflict between the ordinance and the Sherman Act.
Held:  The ordinance is not unconstitutional as being preempted by the Sherman Act.  Pp.  475 U. S. 264-270.
(a) The rent ceilings established by the ordinance and maintained by the Rent Stabilization Board were unilaterally imposed by the city upon landlords to the exclusion of private control.  Thus, the rent ceilings lack the element of concerted action needed before they can be characterized as a per se violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  A restraint imposed unilaterally by government does not become concerted action within the meaning of  1 simply because it has a coercive effect upon parties who must obey the law.  And the mere fact that all competing landlords must comply with the ordinance is not enough to establish a conspiracy among landlords.  Pp.  475 U. S. 265-267.
(b) While the ordinance gives tenants some power to trigger its enforcement, it places complete control over maximum rent levels exclusively in the Rent Stabilization Board's hands.

A Berkeley, California, ordinance, enacted pursuant to popular initiative, imposes rent ceilings on residential real property in the city.

475 U.S. 282

Syllabus 
A Wisconsin statute debars persons or firms who have violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) three times within a 5-year period from doing business with the State.  The debarment lasts for three years.  After appellee was debarred in 1982, it filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that the Wisconsin statute was preempted by the NLRA. T he court agreed and granted summary judgment for appellee.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The NLRA preempts the Wisconsin debarment statute.  Pp.  475 U. S. 286-291.
(a) States are prevented not only from setting forth standards of conduct inconsistent with the NLRA's substantive requirements, but also from providing their own regulatory or judicial remedies for conduct prohibited or arguably prohibited by the NLRA.  Because the Wisconsin debarment statute functions as a supplemental sanction for violations of the NLRA, it conflicts with the National Labor Relations Board's comprehensive regulation of industrial relations in precisely the same way as would a prohibition against private parties within the State doing business with repeat labor law violators.  That Wisconsin has chosen to use its spending power rather than its police power in enacting the debarment statute does not significantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict when two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same activity.  Pp.  475 U. S. 286-289.
(b) Although state action in the nature of ""market participation"" is not subject to the restrictions placed on state regulatory power by the Commerce Clause, Wisconsin, by prohibiting state purchases from repeat labor law violators, is not functioning as a private purchaser; its debarment scheme is tantamount to regulation.  In any event, the ""market participant"" doctrine reflects the particular concerns underlying the Commerce Clause, not any general notion regarding the necessary extent of state power in areas where Congress has acted, as it has here in enacting the NLRA.  This is not a case where a State's spending policies address conduct that is of such ""peripheral concern"" to the NLRA, or that implicates ""interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility"" that preemption should not be inferred.  Nor is it a case where spending determinations that bear on labor relations were intentionally left to 
Page 475 U. S. 283
 the States by Congress.  The manifest purpose and inevitable effect of the Wisconsin debarment scheme is to enforce the requirements of the NLRA.  Pp.  475 U. S. 289-291.  750 F.2d 608, affirmed.

No. 84-1044
Argued October 8, 1985

475 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Appellant Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has distributed a newsletter in its monthly billing statements for many years.  The newsletter has included political editorials, feature stories on matters of public interest, tips on energy conservation, and information about utility services and bills.  Appellee Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN), in a ratemaking proceeding before appellee California Public Utilities Commission (Commission), urged the Commission to forbid appellant to use billing envelopes to distribute political editorials, on the ground that appellant's customers should not bear the expense of appellant's own political speech.  The Commission decided that the envelope space that appellant had used to disseminate the newsletter was the ratepayers' property, defining this ""extra space"" as the space left over after including the bill and required notices.  In an effort to apportion this ""extra space"" between appellant and its customers, the Commission permitted TURN to use the ""extra space"" four times a year to raise funds and to communicate with ratepayers with no limitation except to state that its messages were not those of appellant.  Arguing that it had a First Amendment right not to help spread a message with which it disagrees, appellant appealed the Commission's order to the California Supreme Court, which denied discretionary review.
Held:  The Commission's decision must be vacated.
Remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BRENNAN, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded: 
Page 475 U. S. 2

1. The Commission's order impermissibly burdens appellant's affirmative First Amendment rights.  Pp.  475 U. S. 9-18.
(a) The order awards access to the billing envelopes only to persons or groups, such as TURN, who disagree with appellant's views as expressed in its newsletter and who oppose appellant in Commission proceedings.  Such one-sidedness impermissibly burdens appellant's expression.  Appellant must contend with the fact that, whenever it speaks out on a given issue, it may be forced to help disseminate hostile views.  Appellant ""might well conclude"" that, under these circumstances, ""the safe course is to avoid controversy,"" thereby reducing the free flow of information and ideas.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241,  418 U. S. 257.  Pp.  475 U. S. 10,  475 U. S. 12-15.
(b) The order also impermissibly requires appellant to associate with speech with which appellant may disagree.  Appellant may be forced either to appear to agree with TURN's views or to respond.  That kind of forced response is antithetical to the free discussion that the First Amendment fosters.  For corporations, as for individuals, the choice to speak includes within it the choice of what not to say.  Tornillo, supra, at  418 U. S. 258.  Pp.  475 U. S. 10-11,  475 U. S. 15-17.
(c) The Commission's determination that the envelopes' ""extra space"" belongs to the ratepayers does not correct the order's constitutional deficiency.  The billing envelopes remain appellant's property.  Under the order, appellant must use that property to disseminate views with which it disagrees.  Pp.  475 U. S. 17-18.
2. The order is neither a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest nor a permissible time, place, or manner regulation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 19-20.
JUSTICE MARSHALL concluded that the State, pursuant to the Commission's order, has redefined a property right in the ""extra space"" in appellant's billing envelopes in such a way as to achieve a result -- burdening one party's speech in order to enhance another party's speech -- that the First Amendment disallows.

No. 84-1360
Argued November 12, 1985
Decided February 25, 1986
475 U.S. 41

Syllabus 
Respondents purchased two theaters in Renton, Washington, with the intention of exhibiting adult films and, at about the same time, filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the First and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by a city ordinance that prohibits adult motion picture theaters from locating within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, single- or multiple-family dwelling, church, park, or school.  The District Court ultimately entered summary judgment in the city's favor, holding that the ordinance did not violate the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ordinance constituted a substantial restriction on First Amendment interests, and remanded the case for reconsideration as to whether the city had substantial governmental interests to support the ordinance.
Held:  The ordinance is a valid governmental response to the serious problems created by adult theaters and satisfies the dictates of the First Amendment.  Cf. Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50.  Pp.  475 U. S. 46-55.
(a) Since the ordinance does not ban adult theaters altogether, it is properly analyzed as a form of time, place, and manner regulation.  ""Content-neutral"" time, place, and manner regulations are acceptable so long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.  Pp.  475 U. S. 46-47.
(b) The District Court found that the Renton City Council's ""predominate"" concerns were with the secondary effects of adult theaters on the surrounding community, not with the content of adult films themselves.  This finding is more than adequate to establish that the city's pursuit of its zoning interests was unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and thus the ordinance is a ""content-neutral"" speech regulation.  Pp.  475 U. S. 47-50.
(c) The Renton ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.  A city's interest in attempting to preserve the quality of urban life, as here, must be accorded high respect.  Although the ordinance was enacted without the benefit of studies specifically relating to 
Page 475 U. S. 42
 Renton's particular problems, Renton was entitled to rely on the experiences of, and studies produced by, the nearby city of Seattle and other cities.  Nor was there any constitutional defect in the method chosen by Renton to further its substantial interests.  Cities may regulate adult theaters by dispersing them, or by effectively concentrating them, as in Renton.  Moreover, the ordinance is not ""underinclusive"" for failing to regulate other kinds of adult businesses, since there was no evidence that, at the time the ordinance was enacted, any other adult business was located in, or was contemplating moving into, Renton.  Pp. 50-53.
(d) As required by the First Amendment, the ordinance allows for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.  Although respondents argue that, in general, there are no ""commercially viable"" adult theater sites within the limited area of land left open for such theaters by the ordinance, the fact that respondents must fend for themselves in the real estate market, on an equal footing with other prospective purchasers and lessees, does not give rise to a violation of the First Amendment, which does not compel the Government to ensure that adult theaters, or any other kinds of speech-related businesses, will be able to obtain sites at bargain prices.  Pp. 53-54.

No. 84-1640
Argued December 2, 1985

475 U.S. 66

Syllabus 
A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging respondents and cross-petitioners (hereafter defendants) with drug-related offenses and conspiracy, and later returned a superseding indictment expanding the conspiracy charge.  Two law enforcement agents testified in tandem before the grand jury in support of the superseding indictment.  The defendants did not learn about this until the second week of their trial, when the Government furnished them with a transcript of the grand jury testimony.  The defendants were found guilty after a jury trial, and the District Court denied their motion to dismiss the superseding indictment on the ground that the two agents' simultaneous presence before the grand jury violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(d), which provides that only specified persons including ""the witness under examination"" may be present at a grand jury proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed the conspiracy convictions and dismissed the conspiracy portion of the indictment, holding that, although Rule 6(d) was violated, the violation tainted only that portion of the indictment.
Held:  However diligent the defendants may have been in seeking to discover the basis for the claimed violation of Rule 6(d), the petit jury's guilty verdict rendered harmless any error in the grand jury's charging decision that may have flowed from the violation.  In such case, the societal costs of retrial are far too substantial to justify setting aside the verdict simply because of an error in the grand jury proceeding.  Pp.  475 U. S. 69-73.

			"|"United States v. Mechanik
No. 84-1640
Argued December 2, 1985
Decided February 25, 1986*
475 U.S. 66

Syllabus 
A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging respondents and cross-petitioners (hereafter defendants) with drug-related offenses and conspiracy, and later returned a superseding indictment expanding the conspiracy charge.  Two law enforcement agents testified in tandem before the grand jury in support of the superseding indictment.  The defendants did not learn about this until the second week of their trial, when the Government furnished them with a transcript of the grand jury testimony.  The defendants were found guilty after a jury trial, and the District Court denied their motion to dismiss the superseding indictment on the ground that the two agents' simultaneous presence before the grand jury violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(d), which provides that only specified persons including ""the witness under examination"" may be present at a grand jury proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed the conspiracy convictions and dismissed the conspiracy portion of the indictment, holding that, although Rule 6(d) was violated, the violation tainted only that portion of the indictment.
Held:  However diligent the defendants may have been in seeking to discover the basis for the claimed violation of Rule 6(d), the petit jury's guilty verdict rendered harmless any error in the grand jury's charging decision that may have flowed from the violation.  In such case, the societal costs of retrial are far too substantial to justify setting aside the verdict simply because of an error in the grand jury proceeding.  Pp.  475 U. S. 69-73.

475 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
This case, which was instituted by the United States to quiet title to the seabed along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, presents the question whether Nantucket Sound qualifies as ""internal waters"" of Massachusetts rather than partly territorial sea and partly high seas as the United States contends.  Massachusetts has excepted to the portion of the Special Master's report that concludes that Nantucket Sound is not a part of Massachusetts' inland waters under the doctrine of ""ancient title.""  Massachusetts contends that, under such doctrine, the English Crown acquired title to Nantucket Sound as a result of discovery and occupation by colonists in the early 17th century, and that Massachusetts has succeeded to the Crown's title.
Held:  Massachusetts cannot prevail under the doctrine of ""ancient title.""  Pp.  475 U. S. 93-105.
(a) Principles of international law have been followed consistently in fixing the United States' coastline.  Massachusetts contends that the doctrine of ""ancient title"" is a sufficient basis for identifying a ""historic bay,"" under Article 7(6) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, so as to constitute ""internal waters"" of the sovereign.  To claim ""ancient title"" to waters that would otherwise constitute high seas or territorial sea, a sovereign must base its title on ""occupation,"" that is, a title based on ""clear original title"" which is fortified ""by long usage.""  The parties agree that effective ""occupation"" must have taken place before the freedom of the seas became a part of international law -- no later than the latter half of the 18th century.  Pp.  475 U. S. 93-96.
(b) The pertinent exhibits and transcripts show that Massachusetts did not effectively ""occupy"" Nantucket Sound so as to obtain ""clear original title"" and fortify that title ""by long usage"" before the seas were recognized to be free.  For purposes of the ""ancient title"" doctrine, ""occupation"" requires, at a minimum, the existence of acts, attributable to the sovereign, manifesting an assertion of exclusive authority over the waters claimed.  The historical evidence introduced by Massachusetts does not show occupation by the colonists of Nantucket Sound as a whole.  Massachusetts' evidence of occupation is also deficient because it does not warrant a finding that the colonists asserted any exclusive right to the waters.  Moreover, Massachusetts has not established any linkage between the colonists' activities and the English Crown.  Thus, Great 
Page 475 U. S. 90
 Britain did not obtain title which could devolve upon Massachusetts.  Pp.  475 U. S. 97-103.
(c) The determination that Massachusetts had not established clear title prior to freedom of the seas is corroborated by its consistent failure to assert dominion over Nantucket Sound since that time.  Rather, during the 18th and 19th centuries Massachusetts continued to treat Nantucket Sound in a manner inconsistent with its recent characterization of that body as internal waters.  Pp.  475 U.

Syllabus 
When two New York City police officers observed respondent driving above the speed limit in a car with a cracked windshield, both traffic violations under New York law, they stopped him.  He then emerged from the car and approached one of the officers.  The other officer opened the car door to look for the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), which is located on the left doorjamb in pre-1969 automobiles.  When the officer did not find the VIN on the doorjamb, he reached into the car's interior to move some papers obscuring the area of the dashboard where the VIN is located on later model automobiles.  In doing so, the officer saw the handle of a gun protruding from underneath the driver's seat and seized the gun.  Respondent was then arrested.  After the state trial court denied a motion to suppress the gun as evidence, respondent was convicted of criminal possession of a weapon.  The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court upheld the conviction, but the New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, in the absence of any justification for the search of respondent's car besides the traffic violations, the search was prohibited and the gun must accordingly be excluded from evidence.
Held:
1. The New York Court of Appeals' decision did not rest on an adequate and independent state ground, so as to deprive this Court of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals' opinion, which mentions the New York Constitution only once and then in direct conjunction with the Federal Constitution, and which makes use of both federal and New York cases in its analysis, lacks the requisite ""plain statement"" that it rests on state grounds.  Moreover, in determining that the search in question was prohibited, the court looked to the Federal Constitution, and not to a state statute that authorizes officers to demand that drivers reveal their VIN, merely holding that that statute provided no justification for a search.  Pp.  475 U. S. 109-110.
2. The police officer's action in searching respondent's car did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  475 U. S. 111-119.
(a) Because of the important role played by the VIN in the pervasive governmental regulation of automobiles and the efforts by the Federal Government through regulations to assure that the VIN is placed in plain view, respondent had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the 
Page 475 U. S. 107
 VIN.  The placement of the papers obscuring the VIN was insufficient to create a privacy interest in the VIN.  Pp.  475 U. S. 111-114.
(b) The officer's search was sufficiently unintrusive to be constitutionally permissible in light of respondent's lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the VIN, the fact that the officers observed respondent commit two traffic violations, and concerns for the officers' safety.

 State of TEXAS, plaintiff,v. State of NEW MEXICO.No. 65 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 24, 1986
 On motion for interim fees and disbursements. 
 The motion of the Special Master for allowance of interim fees and disbursements is granted and a total of $34,213.09 is allowed. 

 Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting. 
 In Louisiana v. Mississippi, 466 U.S. 921 (1984), I dissented from an order of the Court granting fees to the Special Master. The basis for my dissent was that the hourly rates at which the Special Master sought fees for work performed by his junior associates, some of whom were only ""summer law clerks,"" were not supported and were unreasonable. [ Texas v. New Mexico 475 U.S. 1004 (1986) ][1004-Continued.] 
 In the present case, the Special Master (who also sat in the Louisiana case) has applied for interim fees in the amount of $33,511. I dissent because the Special Master has elected to give the Court even less information supporting the fee request than he did in Louisiana. The Special Master omits any information concerning the experience levels of the four attorneys for whose services he seeks to charge. (I assume, although it is not so stated, that they are in fact members of the bar, for I cannot believe such a claim would be made for services of any persons not admitted to practice.) We are not informed as to the hourly rates charged for his work and the work of those attorneys. Instead, we are provided only with enough information to conclude that the average hourly rate charged by the attorneys is $140 per hour. The Court and the parties are thus necessarily left to speculate as to whether that average reflects a charge in excess of $100 per hour for work performed only by junior associates. 
 As I noted in Louisiana, 
 This applies with equal force where, as here, the parties do not oppose the application. The present application for interim fees 
Page 475 U.S. 1004 , 1005
 is made by an adjudicator who has yet to adjudicate. I draw no inferences, affirmative or negative, from the fact that the parties have elected not to express their views concerning the Special Master's application. 
 However, in dissenting in Louisiana, I stated: 
 ""A Special Master of this Court is a surrogate of the Court and in that sense the service performed is an important public duty of high order in much the same way as is serving in the Judiciary. I do not suggest that Special Masters should serve without compensation, as for example, Senior Federal Judges have done for a number of years in such cases, but I believe the public service aspect of the appointment is a factor that is not to be wholly ignored in determining the reasonableness of fees charged in a case like this."" Id., 466 U.S., at 921. 
 Even if the public service aspect of the function of a Special Master of this Court should not enter into the fixing of fees, I am unwilling to act without being provided with at least as much information as private clients routinely receive from their privately retained counsel. The contending litigants have a right to expect this Court to exercise its independent judgment on fees rather than requiring each or both of them to challenge the amounts. 
 I would defer action on the application for interim fees until adequate information is provided. Without such data, this Court cannot protect the legitimate public interests implicated.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 24, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice POWELL join, dissenting. 
 The Internal Revenue Code allows a deduction from the taxable estate of bequests ""to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes."" 26 U.S.C. 2055(a)(2). This petition presents the question whether a bequest to a nonprofit cemetery association qualifies for a deduction pursuant to this section. 
 A. Leon Davis died testate on December 6, 1976. His will provided that the residue of his estate was to be distributed to the Verona Cemetery in Oakmont, Pennsylvania. The cemetery was established by nearby residents in 1881 as a nonstock, nonprofit corporation for the purpose of providing burial space to any person regardless of religion or race. Davis' executors filed a federal 
Page 475 U.S. 1032 , 1033
 estate tax return, paid the tax, and then submitted a claim asserting a charitable deduction of $370,901.74, the total amount distributed to the cemetery. The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction and denied the accompanying claim for a refund. After exhausting administrative remedies, the executors instituted the present refund action in Federal District Court. Concluding that Verona Cemetery was a "" corporation organized and operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes,"" 590 F.Supp. 160, 162, n. 1 (WD Pa.1984), the District Court held that the bequest qualified for a deduction under 2055(a)(2). In reaching that conclusion, the court observed that the cemetery was exempt from federal income taxes, that the bequest had already been held exempt from Pennsylvania's inheritance tax and, more generally, that bequests to public nonprofit cemetery associations traditionally had been considered charitable under the common law of trusts. 
 A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 762 F.2d 283 (1985). It acknowledged the ""anomaly"" of treating nonprofit cemetery associations differently for federal estate and income tax purposes. It believed, however, that this asymmetry was compelled by the language and history of the relevant provisions of the Code. Employing language that closely parallels 2055(a)(2), 501(c)(3) exempts from federal income taxes ""[c]orporations . . . organized and operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes."" Since 1913, the Code has included a separate exemption for ""[c]emetery companies owned and operated exclusively for the benefit of their members or which are not operated for profit."" 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(13). In 1954, as part of the general revision of the Code, Congress enacted 170(c)(5), which permits deductions of contributions to any cemetery company that meets a standard virtually identical to that set out in 501(c)(13). After examining this history, the Court of Appeals concluded that nonprofit cemetery companies did not qualify as a ""charitable"" corporation under 2055(a)(2). Because Congress had thought it necessary to enact a special provision for cemeteries on the income tax side, the court reasoned, it must have believed that such entities were not within the general deduction for "" charitable"" contributions. 26 U.S.C. 170(c)(2)(B). Thus, the court concluded, the failure to adopt a parallel provision on the estate tax side foreclosed petitioners' contention that ceme- [475 U.S. 1032 , 1034]

After exhausting administrative remedies, the executors instituted the present refund action in Federal District Court. Concluding that Verona Cemetery was a "" corporation organized and operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes,"" 590 F.Supp. 160, 162, n. 1 (WD Pa.1984), the District Court held that the bequest qualified for a deduction under 2055(a)(2). In reaching that conclusion, the court observed that the cemetery was exempt from federal income taxes, that the bequest had already been held exempt from Pennsylvania's inheritance tax and, more generally, that bequests to public nonprofit cemetery associations traditionally had been considered charitable under the common law of trusts. 
 A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 762 F.2d 283 (1985). It acknowledged the ""anomaly"" of treating nonprofit cemetery associations differently for federal estate and income tax purposes. It believed, however, that this asymmetry was compelled by the language and history of the relevant provisions of the Code. Employing language that closely parallels 2055(a)(2), 501(c)(3) exempts from federal income taxes ""[c]orporations . . . organized and operated exclusively for . . . charitable . . . purposes."" Since 1913, the Code has included a separate exemption for ""[c]emetery companies owned and operated exclusively for the benefit of their members or which are not operated for profit."" 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(13). In 1954, as part of the general revision of the Code, Congress enacted 170(c)(5), which permits deductions of contributions to any cemetery company that meets a standard virtually identical to that set out in 501(c)(13). After examining this history, the Court of Appeals concluded that nonprofit cemetery companies did not qualify as a ""charitable"" corporation under 2055(a)(2). Because Congress had thought it necessary to enact a special provision for cemeteries on the income tax side, the court reasoned, it must have believed that such entities were not within the general deduction for "" charitable"" contributions. 26 U.S.C. 170(c)(2)(B). Thus, the court concluded, the failure to adopt a parallel provision on the estate tax side foreclosed petitioners' contention that ceme- [475 U.S. 1032 , 1034]

 The Federal Trade Commission ordered petitioner to cease various unfair trade practices in selling land, and required, among other things, that petitioner send all customers still under land sale contracts with it a letter disclosing that the Commission had brought an action against petitioner and explaining possible courses of action the customers might take. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the Commission's order over petitioner's objection that the notification order was not within the Commission's remedial authority under 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. 768 F.2d 1171 (1985). The Tenth Circuit's decision is at odds with decisions of the Fourth and Ninth Circuits holding that 5 authorizes only cease-and-desist orders, and not notification orders. See Barrett Carpet Mills, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Comm'n, 635 F.2d 299 (CA4 1980); Congoleum Industries, Inc. v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 24, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The trial judge in this case rejected a unanimous jury decision that petitioner's life should be spared, and sentenced him to die. Petitioner's allegations, which call into question the reliability of the judge's sentencing determination, further illustrate why a judge should not have the awesome power to reject a jury recommendation of life. Moreover, a serious inadequacy in the Indiana capital-sentencing procedure dramatically distinguishes it from the jury-override procedure that this Court upheld in Spaziano v.

 Thomas N. Schiro was convicted of murder in the course of a rape and, following a hearing on the appropriateness of sentencing him to die, the jury recommended a life sentence. The trial judge, however, rejected the jury's decision and imposed a sentence of death. Upon direct appeal, the Supreme Court of Indiana found that the trial court's findings pertaining to the sentencing did not set out clearly and properly the court's reasons for imposing the death penalty. Schiro v. State, 451 N.E.2d 1047, 1056 ( Schiro I ), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1003 ( 1983). That court ordered that the trial court make written findings setting out the aggravating circumstance proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the mitigating circumstances, if any, as listed in the state statute. 451 N.E.2d, at 1056. 
 In response, the trial court specified one aggravating circumstance, that the jury had convicted petitioner of murder in the course of a rape; it then stated that it found no mitigating circumstances, listing and rejecting each of the statutory mitigating circumstances, even though several were suggested by the evidence. With regard to the mitigating factor concerning a defendant's mental or emotional condition and the impairment of his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his acts, the court found as follows: 
 On the basis of his own suspicions, not subject to evidentiary requirements or tested by cross-examination, the judge decided that a unanimous jury was wrong and that petitioner should die. The Indiana Supreme Court upheld the sentence of death. 479 N.E.2d 556 (1985).

No. 84-744
Argued October 9, 1985
Decided January 27, 1986*
474 U.S. 438

Syllabus 
James Lane and his son Dennis, respondents in No. 84-744, were indicted on counts for, inter alia, mail fraud in connection with insurance claims that were made and that insurers paid for fire damage to a restaurant and duplex that James had hired a professional arsonist to burn.  The restaurant was operated by James in partnership with others.  Count 1 charged James with mail fraud with regard to that fire.  The duplex was owned by a different partnership, of which Dennis was one of the partners.  Counts 2 through 4 charged both respondents with mail fraud related to the duplex fire.  Count 5 charged both respondents with conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with a third arson scheme, and Count 6 charged Dennis with perjury before the grand jury.  The Federal District Court denied respondents' pretrial motions for severance on the alleged ground that the charged offenses were misjoined in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(b), which provides that two or more defendants may be charged in the same indictment if they are alleged to have participated ""in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.""  The trial then proceeded jointly before a jury.  When evidence relating to the restaurant fire was admitted, the court instructed the jury not to consider that evidence against Dennis, and repeated this instruction in the final charge and admonished the jury to consider each count and defendant separately.  The jury returned convictions on all counts.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for new trials, holding that the joinder of Count 1 with the other five counts violated Rule 8(b) and that such misjoinder was prejudicial per se.  The court, however, rejected respondents' contention that there was insufficient evidence to support convictions under Counts 2 through 4 because each charged mailing occurred after each related insurance payment had been received and thus after each scheme to defraud had reached fruition.
Held:
1. Misjoinder under Rule 8(b) is subject to harmless error analysis, and is not reversible error per se.  An error involving misjoinder ""affects 
Page 474 U. S. 439
 substantial rights"" and requires retrial only if the misjoinder results in actual prejudice because it ""had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.""  Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750,  328 U. S. 776.  It is only by such a holding that Rule 8(b) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) -- which provides that any error ""which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded"" -- can be brought into substantial harmony.  Here, in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt, the claimed error was harmless.  The District Court provided proper limiting jury instructions, and, moreover, the same evidence on Count 1 would likely have been admissible on joint retrial of the other counts to show James' intent under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).  Any error therefore failed to have any ""substantial influence"" on the verdict.  Pp.  474 U. S. 444-450.
2. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions on Counts 2 through 4.  On the evidence and under proper instructions, the jury could properly find that the mailings charged in Counts 2 and 3 took place while the overall scheme charged in the indictment was still continuing and that the scheme was not completed until after the mailing charged in Count 4, because that mailing, as were the others, was intended to ""lull"" the insurer into a false sense of security.

No. 84-1070
Argued November 6, 1985
Decided January 27, 1986
474 U.S. 481

Syllabus 
Petitioner, suffering from a progressive eye condition, applied to the Washington Commission for the Blind for vocational rehabilitation assistance pursuant to a Washington statute.  At the time, he was attending a private Christian college seeking to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  The Commission denied aid on the ground that it was prohibited by the State Constitution, and this ruling was upheld on administrative appeal.  Petitioner then brought an action in State Superior Court, which affirmed the administrative ruling on the same state law grounds.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed but based its ruling on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, holding that the provision of aid to petitioner would have the primary effect of advancing religion in violation of that Clause.
Held:  On the record, extension of aid under the Washington vocational rehabilitation program to finance petitioner's training at the Christian college would not advance religion in a manner inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  474 U. S. 485-490.
(a) As far as the record shows, assistance provided under the Washington program is paid directly to the student, who then transmits it to the educational institution of his or her choice.  The program is in no way skewed towards religion, and creates no financial incentive for students who undertake sectarian education.  Pp.  474 U. S. 487-488.
(b) Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that, if petitioner succeeds, any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.  P.  474 U. S. 488.
(c) On the facts, it is inappropriate to view any aid ultimately flowing to the Christian college as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidizing religion.  Nor does the mere circumstance that petitioner has chosen to use neutrally available state aid to help pay for his religious education confer any message of state endorsement of religion.  Pp.  474 U. S. 488-489.

The program is in no way skewed towards religion, and creates no financial incentive for students who undertake sectarian education.  Pp.  474 U. S. 487-488.
(b) Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that, if petitioner succeeds, any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education.  P.  474 U. S. 488.
(c) On the facts, it is inappropriate to view any aid ultimately flowing to the Christian college as resulting from a state action sponsoring or subsidizing religion.  Nor does the mere circumstance that petitioner has chosen to use neutrally available state aid to help pay for his religious education confer any message of state endorsement of religion.  Pp.  474 U. S. 488-489.

Quanta Resources Corp. (Quanta) processed waste oil at facilities located in New York and New Jersey.  The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) discovered that Quanta had violated a provision of the operating permit for the New Jersey facility by accepting oil contaminated with a toxic carcinogen.  During negotiations with NJDEP for the cleanup of the New Jersey site, Quanta filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and after NJDEP had issued an order requiring cleanup, Quanta converted the action to a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7.  An investigation of the New York facility then revealed that Quanta had also accepted similarly contaminated oil at that site.  The trustee notified the creditors and the Bankruptcy Court that he intended to abandon the property under  554(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes a trustee to ""abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value to the estate.""  The City and the State of New York objected, contending that abandonment would threaten the public's health and safety, and would violate state and federal environmental law.  The Bankruptcy Court approved the abandonment, and, after the District Court affirmed, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  Meanwhile, the Bankruptcy Court also approved the trustee's proposed abandonment of the New Jersey facility over NJDEP's objection, and NJDEP took a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals.  In separate judgments, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Bankruptcy Court erred in permitting abandonment.
Held:  A trustee in bankruptcy may not abandon property in contravention of a state statute or regulation that is reasonably designed to protect the public health or safety from identified hazards.  Congress did not intend for  554(a) to preempt all state and local laws.  A bankruptcy court does not have the power to authorize an abandonment without formulating 
Page 474 U. S. 495
 conditions that will adequately protect the public's health and safety.  Pp.  474 U. S. 500-507.
(a) Before the 1978 revisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which codified in  554 the judicially developed rule of abandonment, the trustee's abandonment power had been limited by a judicially developed doctrine intended to protect legitimate state and federal interests.  In codifying the rule of abandonment, Congress also presumably included the corollary that a trustee could not exercise his abandonment power in violation of certain state and federal laws.  Pp.  474 U. S. 500-501.
(b) Neither this Court's decisions nor Congress has granted a trustee in bankruptcy powers that would lend support to a right to abandon property in contravention of state or local laws designed to protect public health or safety.  Where the Bankruptcy Code has conferred other special powers upon the trustee, and where there was no common law limitation on such powers, Congress has expressly provided that the trustee's efforts to marshal and distribute the estate's assets must yield to governmental interests in public health and safety.  It cannot be assumed that Congress, having placed such limitations upon other aspects of trustees' operations, intended to discard the well-established judicial restriction on the abandonment power.  Moreover, 28 U.S.C.  959(b), which commands the trustee to ""manage and operate the property in his possession . . . according to the requirements of the valid laws of the State,"" provides additional evidence that Congress did not intend for the Bankruptcy Code to preempt all state laws.  Pp.  474 U. S. 502-505.

474 U.S. 518

Syllabus 
Petitioners sued respondents in an Alabama state court, alleging that respondent bank had fraudulently induced petitioner individuals to permit a third person to take control of a subsidiary of petitioner corporation and eventually to obtain complete ownership. Subsequently, the subsidiary was adjudicated an involuntary bankrupt.  Petitioners then sued the bank in Federal District Court, alleging that the same conduct on the bank's part that was the subject of the state suit violated the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) amendments.  The federal action went to trial before the state action, and the District Court granted judgment n.o.v. for the bank.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Thereafter, respondents pleaded a res judicata defense in the state action based on the federal judgment, but the Alabama court denied the defense.  After the state complaint was amended to include a Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) claim that the bank's foreclosure sale of the subsidiary's assets was commercially unreasonable, the jury returned a verdict for damages in petitioners' favor.  Respondents then returned to the District Court and filed an injunctive action against petitioners.  Holding that the state fraud and UCC claims should have been raised in the federal action as pendent to the BHCA claim, and accordingly that the BHCA judgment barred the state claims under res judicata, the District Court enjoined petitioners from further prosecuting the state action.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the parties to the BHCA action were barred by res judicata from raising the state claims in state court after the entry of the federal judgment, and that the federal injunction was proper under the ""relitigation exception"" to the Anti-Injunction Act, which generally prohibits a federal court from enjoining state proceedings but excepts from the prohibition the issuance of an injunction by a federal court ""where necessary . . . to protect or effectuate its judgments.""  The court did not consider the possible preclusive effect under Alabama law of the state court's resolution of the res judicata issue, holding instead that the ""relitigation exception"" to the Anti-Injunction Act worked a pro tanto amendment to the Full Faith and Credit Act, which requires federal courts as well as state courts to give state judicial proceedings ""the 
Page 474 U. S. 519
 same full faith and credit . . . as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred by refusing to consider the possible preclusive effect under Alabama law of the state court judgment.  Even if the state court mistakenly rejected respondents' res judicata claim, this would not justify the highly intrusive remedy of a federal court injunction against enforcement of the state court judgment.  Rather, the Full Faith and Credit Act requires that the federal courts give the state court judgment, and particularly the state court's resolution of the res judicata issue, the same preclusive effect it would have in another court of the same State.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 27, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 ( 1985), we held that an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 should be considered a personal injury action for purposes of borrowing an appropriate state statute of limitations. The present case presents the question of what to 
Page 474 U.S. 1105 , 1106
 do when more than one state statute of limitations applies to personal injury actions. 
 Respondent in this case is an Alabama farmer who brought a 1983 action against petitioners for allegedly violating his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by causing his equipment to be seized pursuant to prejudgment attachment writs that petitioners obtained without notice or a hearing. The only significant issue on appeal was the appropriate statute of limitations to borrow from the Alabama Code. 763 F.2d 1250 (CA11 1985). The Eleventh Circuit explained that its task of applying Wilson v. Garcia, supra, was complicated by the fact that Alabama has not one but two personal injury statutes of limitations. Alabama Code 6-2-34(1) (1975) governs actions for ""any trespass to person or liberty, such as false imprisonment or assault and battery,"" and has been interpreted by the Alabama courts as applying to actions for trespass. Alabama Code 6-2-39(a)(5) (1975) governs ""[a]ctions for any injury to the person or rights of another not arising from contract and not specifically enumerated in this section,"" and has been interpreted by the Alabama courts as applying to actions for trespass on the case. The Eleventh Circuit resolved its seeming dilemma in applying Wilson v. Garcia by reasoning that while not all 1983 actions involve trespass, trespass is ""the particular type of wrong that was most paradigmatic, the one category of wrongs that the legislators [who enacted 1983] intended first and foremost to address."" 763 F.2d, at 1255. Accordingly, the court held that the 6-year statute of limitations provided by 6-2-34(1), rather than the then 1-year statute of limitations provided by 6-2-39(a)( 5), should govern 1983 actions in Alabama. [Footnote 1] 

 The Eleventh Circuit's decision in this case conflicts with three en banc decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, all of which were companion cases to the decision we affirmed in Wilson v. Garcia, supra. In Hamilton v. City of Overland Park, Kansas, 730 F.2d 613, 614 (1984) (en banc), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1052d 476 (1985), the Tenth Circuit rejected, for 1983 purposes, use of the 1-year Kansas statute of limitations governing "" '[a]n action for assault, battery, malicious prosecution, or false imprisonment,' "" and instead chose the 2-year limitations [474 U.S. 1105 , 1107]

Syllabus 
Section 2(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 defines ""bank"" as any institution ""which (1) accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand, and (2) engages in the business of making commercial loans.""  In response to the increase in the number of arguably uncovered ""nonbank banks"" -- such as institutions offering customers ""NOW"" (negotiable order of withdrawal) accounts, which function like traditional checking accounts but are subject to a seldom exercised right of the bank to require prior notice of withdrawal, and institutions offering ""commercial loans substitutes"" such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper -- the Federal Reserve Board amended its ""Regulation Y"" to redefine a ""bank"" as any institution that (1) accepts deposits that ""as a matter of practice"" are payable on demand and (2) engages in the business of making ""any loan other than a loan to an individual for personal, family, household, or charitable purposes,"" including
""the purchase of retail installment loans or commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, and similar money market instruments.""
In consolidated cases challenging the amended Regulation Y, the Court of Appeals set aside the regulation.
Held:  The Board did not act within its statutory authority in defining ""banks"" as it did.  Pp.  474 U. S. 366-375.
(a) The Board's definition of ""demand deposit"" is not an accurate or reasonable interpretation of  2(c) of the Act.  An institution that offers NOW accounts -- even if it engages in commercial lending -- is not a ""bank"" for the purposes of the Act because the requirement of prior notice of withdrawal withholds from the depositor any ""legal right"" to withdraw on demand.  No amount of agency expertise can make the words ""legal right"" contained in  2(c) mean a right to do something ""as a matter of practice.""  Pp.  474 U. S. 367-368.
(b) Nor is the Board's definition of ""commercial loan"" a reasonable interpretation of  2(c), under which an institution, even if it accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand, is not a bank unless it ""engages in the business of making commercial loans.""  The term ""commercial loan"" is used in the financial community 
Page 474 U. S. 362
 to describe the direct loan from a bank to a business customer for the purpose of providing funds needed by the customer in its business.  Money market transactions, which the Board characterizes as ""commercial loan substitutes,"" do not fall within the commonly accepted definition of ""commercial loans.""  Nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history indicates that the term ""commercial loan"" meant anything different from its accepted ordinary commercial usage.  Pp.  474 U. S. 368-373.
(c) The Board's new definition cannot be supported on the asserted basis that it falls within the Act's ""plain purpose"" of regulating institutions ""functionally equivalent"" to banks.  The ""plain purpose"" of legislation is determined in the first instance with reference to the plain language of the statute itself.  Here, rather than defining ""bank"" as an institution that offers the functional equivalent of banking services, Congress defined with specificity certain transactions that constitute banking subject to regulation.  The statute may be imperfect, but the Board has no power to correct flaws that it perceives in the statute it is empowered to administer.  Its rulemaking power is limited to adopting regulations to carry into effect Congress' will as expressed in the statute.  Pp.  474 U. S. 373-375.

(c) The Board's new definition cannot be supported on the asserted basis that it falls within the Act's ""plain purpose"" of regulating institutions ""functionally equivalent"" to banks.  The ""plain purpose"" of legislation is determined in the first instance with reference to the plain language of the statute itself.  Here, rather than defining ""bank"" as an institution that offers the functional equivalent of banking services, Congress defined with specificity certain transactions that constitute banking subject to regulation.  The statute may be imperfect, but the Board has no power to correct flaws that it perceives in the statute it is empowered to administer.  Its rulemaking power is limited to adopting regulations to carry into effect Congress' will as expressed in the statute.  Pp.  474 U. S. 373-375.
744 F.2d 1402, affirmed.
BURGER, C.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except WHITE, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Syllabus 
After respondent and his friend Tucker accepted Dickson's offer of a ride home, a fight developed between Tucker and Dickson, and Dickson stopped the car.  Respondent held Dickson's head as Tucker struck Dickson in the face with a whiskey bottle.  Tucker then pummeled Dickson with his fists until Dickson fell to the ground and lay helpless, at which point Tucker killed him by smashing his skull with a concrete block.  Respondent and Tucker disposed of the body, and respondent kept Dickson's car for himself.  Respondent was arrested the next day and was charged with capital murder under a Mississippi statute.  The jury found him guilty and, following a separate sentencing hearing, sentenced him to death.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, finding that the capital murder verdict and death sentence were sustainable under a Mississippi law making an accomplice equally responsible with the principal offender.  After exhausting state postconviction remedies, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which denied the writ.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that respondent's death sentence was invalid under the intervening decision in Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, that the Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition of the death penalty on
""one . . . who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.""
Id. at  458 U. S. 797.  The court based its conclusion solely upon its reading of the jury instructions at respondent's state trial, reasoning that, under those instructions, the jury may well have found respondent guilty and sentenced him to death despite concluding that he had neither killed nor intended to kill, or without ever coming to any conclusion on those questions.  Accordingly, the court granted a writ of habeas corpus and vacated respondent's death sentence but permitted the State, at its option, to impose a life sentence or conduct a new sentencing hearing at which, with the proper findings, a death sentence could be reimposed. 
Page 474 U. S. 377

Held:
1. The Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that neither the jury's verdict of guilt nor its imposition of the death sentence necessarily reflected a finding that respondent killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill.  Pp.  474 U. S. 383-384.
2. But the Court of Appeals erred in focusing exclusively on the jury and in ordering a new sentencing hearing without inquiring whether the necessary finding of intent had been made by the state trial court or appellate court.  The Enmund rule need not be enforced by the jury, and does not impose any particular form of procedure upon the States.  At what point in its criminal process a State chooses to make the Enmund determination is of little concern from the standpoint of the Constitution.  Accordingly, when a federal habeas corpus court reviews an Enmund claim, its inquiry cannot be limited to an examination of jury instructions.  Rather, the court must examine the entire course of the state proceedings in order to determine whether, at some point, the requisite factual finding as to the defendant's culpability has been made.  If it has, the finding must be presumed correct by virtue of 28 U.S.C.  2254(d), and unless the habeas petitioner can bear the burden of overcoming the presumption, the court must hold that the Eighth Amendment, as interpreted in Enmund, is not offended by the death sentence.  Pp.  474 U. S. 384-388.
3. The Mississippi Supreme Court's finding was insufficient to satisfy Enmund, for Enmund holds that the Eighth Amendment does more than require that a death sentenced defendant be legally responsible for a killing as a matter of state law; it requires that he himself have actually killed, attempted to kill, or intended that a killing take place or that lethal force be used.  Pp.  474 U. S. 389-390.
4. The proper course for a federal court faced with a habeas corpus petition raising an Enmund claim when the state courts have failed to make any finding regarding the Enmund criteria is to take steps to require the State's own judicial system to make the factual findings in the first instance.  Therefore, it is Mississippi, not the federal habeas corpus court, that should first provide respondent with a reliable determination as to whether he killed, attempted to kill, or intended that a killing take place or that lethal force be used.  Pp.  474 U. S. 390-391.
5. Here, the District Court should be directed to issue the habeas corpus writ vacating respondent's death sentence, but to leave to the State the choice of either imposing a sentence of life imprisonment or reimposing the death sentence after obtaining a determination from its own courts of the factual question whether respondent killed, attempted to

No. 84-1076
Argued October 8, 1985
Decided January 22, 1986
474 U.S. 409

Syllabus 
In 1978, during a period of natural gas shortage, appellant interstate pipeline entered into long-term contracts with appellee Getty Oil Co. and others to purchase natural gas from a common gas pool in Mississippi.  The contract with Getty obligated appellant to buy only Getty's shares of the gas produced by the wells Getty operated.  Demand was sufficiently high that appellant also purchased, on a noncontract basis, the production shares of smaller owners, such as appellee Coastal Exploration, Inc., in the Getty wells.  But in 1982, consumer demand dropped significantly, and appellant began to have difficulty in selling its gas.  It therefore announced that it would no longer purchase gas from owners with whom it had not contracted.  Getty cut back production so that its wells produced only that amount of gas equal to its ownership interest in the maximum flow.  This deprived Coastal of revenue, because none of its share of the common pool gas was being produced.  Coastal then filed a petition with appellee Mississippi State Oil and Gas Board (Board), asking it to enforce statewide Rule 48 requiring gas purchasers to purchase gas without discrimination in favor of one producer against another in the same source of supply.  The Board found appellant in violation of Rule 48 and ordered it to start taking gas ""ratably"" (i.e., in proportion to the various owners' shares) from the gas pool, and to purchase the gas under nondiscriminatory price and take-or-pay conditions.  On appeal, the Mississippi Circuit Court held that the Board's authority was not preempted by the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), and that the NGPA effectively overruled Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm'n of Kansas, 372 U. S. 84, which struck down, on preemption grounds, a state regulation virtually identical to the Board's order.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The Board's ratable-take order is preempted by the NGA and NGPA.  Pp.  474 U. S. 417-425.
(a) Congress, in enacting the NGPA, did not alter the characteristics of the comprehensive regulatory scheme that provided the basis in Northern Natural for the finding of preemption.  The Board's order directly undermines Congress' determination in enacting the NGPA that the supply, demand, and price of high-cost gas be determined by market 
Page 474 U. S. 410
 forces.  To the extent that Congress in the NGPA denied the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the power to regulate directly the prices at which pipelines purchase high-cost gas, it did so because it wanted to leave determination of supply and first-sale price to the market.  In light of Congress' intent to move toward a less regulated national natural gas market, its decision to remove jurisdiction from FERC cannot be interpreted as an invitation to the States to impose additional regulations.  Pp.  474 U. S. 417-423.
(b) The Board's order disturbs the uniformity of the federal scheme, since interstate pipelines will be forced to comply with varied state regulations of their purchasing practices.  The order would also have the effect of increasing the ultimate price to consumers, thus frustrating the federal goal of ensuring low prices most effectively.  Pp.  474 U. S. 423-425.

Decided January 21, 1986
474 U.S. 302

Syllabus 
Respondents were arrested and indicted in November, 1975, on counts of possessing firearms and dynamite.  In March, 1976, the Federal District Court granted respondents' motion to suppress evidence relating to the dynamite counts, and the Government promptly filed a notice of appeal and requested a continuance.  The District Court denied this request and, when the Government answered ""not ready"" after the case was called for trial, dismissed the indictment.  The Government appealed this dismissal, and the two appeals were consolidated.  In August, 1979, the Court of Appeals reversed the suppression order, ordered that the dynamite counts be reinstated, and held that the District Court erred in dismissing the firearms counts.  In November, 1979, respondents filed a petition for certiorari, which this Court denied.  The Court of Appeals' mandate issued in March, 1980, 46 months after the Government filed its notice of appeal from the dismissal of the indictment, during which time respondents were unconditionally released.  On remand, the District Court ordered the Government to reindict on the firearms charges.  In August, 1980, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss on the ground of vindictive prosecution as to one respondent, but denied it as to the other respondents, and both the Government and these respondents appealed.  During these appeals, respondents remained free on their own recognizance.  In July, 1982, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal as to the one respondent and dismissed the appeals of the other respondents, and in October, 1982, denied respondents' petitions for a rehearing.  Respondents then filed a petition for certiorari, which this Court denied.  The Court of Appeals' mandate issued in January, 1983.  In May, 1983, the District Court again dismissed the indictment, ruling that respondents' Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The time during which the indictment was dismissed and respondents were free of all restrictions on their liberty should be excluded from the length of delay considered under the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  United States v. MacDonald, 456 U. S. 1.  Pp.  474 U. S. 310-312.
(a) Where no indictment is outstanding, it is only the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engages the protection of the Speedy Trial Clause.  Here, respondents 
Page 474 U. S. 303
 were not incarcerated and were not subject to bail, and further judicial proceedings would have been necessary to subject them to any actual restraints.  Pp.  474 U. S. 310-311.
(b) The fact that the Government's desire to prosecute respondents was a matter of public record was insufficient to count the time in question toward a speedy trial claim.  Nor does the fact that respondents were ordered to appear at the evidentiary hearing held on remand in the District Court during the first appeal constitute the sort of ""actual restraint"" required for application of the Speedy Trial Clause.  And respondents' necessity to obtain counsel while their case was technically dismissed was not sufficient to trigger that Clause.  Pp.  474 U. S. 311-312.
2. The delay attributable to the interlocutory appeals does not weigh effectively towards respondents' claim under the Speedy Trial Clause.  Under the balancing test of Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, courts must accommodate the competing concerns of orderly appellate review and a speedy trial.  Pp.  474 U. S. 312-317.
(a) Three of the factors under Barker -- the length of delay, the extent to which respondents have asserted their speedy trial rights, and the prejudice to respondents -- fail to support a finding of a violation of the Speedy Trial Clause.  Pp.  474 U. S. 314-315.
(b) The remaining Barker factor, the reason for the delay, also fails to carry respondents' claims.  The Government's first interlocutory appeal was justified where the Government could not have otherwise presented the issue relating to exclusion of the evidence on the dynamite counts, and the Government's appeal on this issue was strong.  Similarly, the Government's second interlocutory appeal was justified because the Government could not have otherwise proceeded against the one respondent against whom the indictment was dismissed, and here too the Government's position was strong.  Pp.  474 U. S. 315-316.
(c) The delay from respondents' interlocutory appeals does not count toward their speedy trial claims.  A defendant bears the heavy burden of showing an unreasonable delay caused by the prosecution in that appeal or a wholly unjustified delay by the appellate court.  Pp.  474 U. S. 316-317.

No. 84-5872
Argued November 6, 1985
Decided January 21, 1986
474 U.S. 327

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought an action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, seeking to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained when, while an inmate in a Richmond, Virginia, jail, he slipped on a pillow negligently left on a stairway by respondent sheriff's deputy.  Petitioner contends that such negligence deprived him of his ""liberty"" interest in freedom from bodily injury ""without due process of law"" within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Due Process Clause is not implicated by a state official's negligent act causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.  Pp.  474 U. S. 329-336.
(a) The Due Process Clause was intended to secure an individual from an abuse of power by government officials.  Far from an abuse of power, lack of due care, such as respondent's alleged negligence here, suggests no more than a failure to measure up to the conduct of a reasonable person.  To hold that injury caused by such conduct is a deprivation within the meaning of the Due Process Clause would trivialize the centuries-old principle of due process of law.  Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, overruled to the extent that it states otherwise.  Pp.  474 U. S. 329-332.
(b) The Constitution does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society.  While the Due Process Clause speaks to some facets of the relationship between jailers and inmates, its protections are not triggered by lack of due care by the jailers.  Jailers may owe a special duty of care under state tort law to those in their custody, but the Due Process Clause does not embrace such a tort law concept.  Pp.  474 U. S. 332-336.
748 F.2d 229, affirmed.

Syllabus 
When threatened by a fellow inmate in the New Jersey State Prison, petitioner sent a note reporting the incident to respondent Assistant Superintendent of the prison, who read the note and sent it to respondent Corrections Sergeant, who, while informed of its contents, did not read it or notify other officers of the threat, and forgot about it by the time he went off duty.  Two days later, the inmate attacked petitioner and inflicted serious injuries.  Petitioner then brought a damages action against respondents in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that they had violated his rights under, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amendment by negligently failing to protect him from the other inmate.  After a bench trial, the District Court awarded damages, holding that petitioner was deprived of his liberty interest in personal security as a result of respondents' negligence and that such deprivation was without due process because of a New Jersey statute that protects prison officials from liability for injuries caused by one prisoner to another.

Held:  The protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, whether procedural or substantive, are not triggered by lack of due care by prison officials.  Daniels v.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that beneficiaries of an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) plan must exhaust internal plan remedies before suing plan fiduciaries on the basis of an alleged violation of duties imposed by the statute. Although this ruling is consistent with the law of the Seventh Circuit, see Kross v. Western Electric Co., 701 F.2d 1238 (1983), it is at odds with a decision of the Ninth Circuit, Amaro v. Continental Can Co. 724 F.2d 747 (1984), which held that plaintiffs alleging a statutory violation (as opposed to a mere denial of benefits owing under an ERISA plan) need not exhaust internal remedies.* The Third Circuit has noted the existence of this conflict but failed to take a direct position on it, see Barrowclough v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 752 F.2d 923, 939, n. 15 (1985), although that court's acceptance of the notion that statutory ERISA claims are normally not arbitrable seems to reflect agreement with the Ninth Circuit's approach. See id., at 941. I believe that the Court should grant certiorari in this case in order to resolve the uncertainty over the existence of an exhaustion requirement in cases of this kind. The increasing significance of ERISA litigation is apparent from the growing number of such cases that appear on our docket; in a field so productive of federal litigation, the need for clear procedural rules governing access to the federal courts is imperative. Moreover, because the coverage of particular ERISA plans frequently extends to beneficiaries in more than one State-and, no doubt, in more than one judicial circuit-differences in the rules governing access to federal court for the purpose of pressing a claim under ERISA may have the troubling effect of encouraging forum shopping by plaintiffs. Accordingly, the conflict among the Circuits over the issue of an exhaustion requirement under ERISA can hardly be passed

 over as an unimportant one unworthy of this Court's attention. I therefore dissent from the denial of certiorari.

 James E. MESSER, Jr.v. Ralph KEMP, Warden.No. 85-5571 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 21, 1986
 On Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner in this case, James Messer, was sentenced to death by a jury that was unable in any meaningful fashion to give him the "" individualized consideration"" to which he has a constitutional right, Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605, 2965 ( 1978) (plurality opinion), because of egregiously unprofessional assistance by his trial counsel. I believe that petitioner has clearly met the standard that this Court set in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), for establishing ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase of his trial, and I would accordingly grant the petition and vacate petitioner's sentence. [ Messer v. Kemp 474 U.S. 1088 (1986) ][1088-Continued.] 
 I  
 Petitioner was convicted of kidnaping and murdering his 8-year-old niece. After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review, he sought a writ of habeas corpus in state court, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel. The court declined to hold a hearing, made no findings, and denied the writ. Petitioner then sought federal habeas relief. The Magistrate to whom the case was referred recommended that the writ be granted as to the sentence, concluding that petitioner had received ineffective assistance during the penalty phase. The District Court nevertheless denied the writ. It concluded that petitioner had not established prejudice, as required by Strickland, supra, and therefore did not reach the question whether counsel gave adequate assistance. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 760 F.2d 1080 (CA11 1985), with one judge dissenting, id., at 1093 (Johnson, J.). 
 II  
 The only factfinder that has considered the question, the Federal Magistrate, found that petitioner has met the first Strickland criterion- that counsel's performance at the sentencing phase was ""outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,"" 
Page 474 U.S. 1088 , 1089
 Strickland, supra, 466 U.S., at 690. Even the most cursory review of petitioner's trial demonstrates that the Magistrate's conclusion was inescapable. 
 At petitioner's hearing before the Magistrate, counsel testified that he had decided as a matter of strategy to adopt a ""low-key"" approach during the guilt phase, in hopes of establishing credibility with the jury . He had then hoped to ""humanize"" petitioner during the sentencing phase and try to convince the jury to spare petitioner's life. 760 F.2d, at 1088. Both the majority and the dissenter in the Court of Appeals concluded that this strategy was not unreasonable in light of the overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt. Id., at 1090, 1095. 
 Counsel succeeded admirably in implementing the first part of his strategy. He made no opening statement and put on no case in chief. He performed only cursory cross-examination, and did not object to any evidence. Id., at 1089. Counsel's attempts to carry out the second prong of his strategy, however, were piteously deficient. His brief summation during the guilt phase, after acknowledging his ""frustration"" with the case, App. B to Pet. for Cert. 14 (opinion of District Court), went on to "" emphasize the horror of the crime,"" 760 F.2d, at 1095 (Johnson, J., dissenting), to the very jury that would soon be called upon to determine whether the murder was ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman,"" Ga.Code Ann. 17-10-30(b)(7) (1982). 
 During the penalty phase, counsel put on a single witness, petitioner's mother. She testified concerning petitioner's childhood, which was marred by mistreatment at the hands of his father and his parents' subsequent divorce. The effect of this implied plea for pity, however, was then destroyed when counsel, despite having previously warned the witness to avoid the topic, asked her what petitioner had told her about his expectations. She replied ""he and I both, my sister, and my mother expect the death penalty here."" 760 F.2d, at 1096. 
 It was counsel's summation during the penalty phase, however, that led the Magistrate to conclude that petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated. His statement, which the Magistrate called a "" nonargument,"" id., at 1097, made no mention of petitioner's mother's testimony nor of any other mitigating [474 U.S. 1088 , 1090]

 Joel Dale WRIGHTv. FLORIDA.No. 85-5747 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 21, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this capital case to ensure that the Florida courts have not sentenced a man to die based on a conviction obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment. 
 On She apparently had died the previous night after being raped and stabbed. All the doors to her home were locked, but a back window was found open. Several weeks later, Charles Westberry told his wife that petitioner Joel Wright had come to Westberry's trailer shortly after daylight on the morning of February 6 and had confessed to killing the victim. Wright lived with his parents near the victim's home. Westberry's wife notified the police, and Wright was arrested and tried for the crime. At trial, Westberry was the State's principal witness. He testified that Wright had told him on the morning of February 6 that Wright had entered the victim's house through the back window to steal money, that the victim had discovered him as he was wiping his fingerprints from her purse, and that he had killed her because he did not want to return to prison. According to Westberry, Wright counted out $290 he claimed to have taken from the victim's home, and he asked Westberry to tell the authorities that Wright had spent the previous night at Westberry's 
Page 474 U.S. 1094 , 1095
 trailer. Another witness for the State testified that, approximately one month before the murder, he and Wright had stolen money from the victim's home after entering through the window later found open on February 6. The jury also was told that a fingerprint identified as Wright's had been found on a portable stove in the victim's bedroom. 
 Wright took the stand and denied involvement in the murder. He testified that he had returned home from a party at approximately 1 a.m. on February 6, but had found himself locked out. He claimed that he then had walked along Highway 19 to Westberry's trailer, where he had spent the night. He also presented a witness who testified that, late on the night of February 5 and early in the morning of February 6, he had seen a group of three men, whom he had not recognized, in the general vicinity of the victim's home. 
 After the close of evidence but prior to final arguments, the defense moved to re-open the case in order to introduce the testimony of a newly discovered witness, Kathy Waters. Waters apparently had read newspaper accounts of the trial, had listened to parts of the testimony, and had discussed the trial with friends in attendance. She offered to testify that, shortly after midnight on February 6, she had seen a person who could have been Wright walking along Highway 19, and had also observed three persons she did not recognize near the victim's home. Waters claimed that she had not realized she possessed relevant information until the morning her testimony was proffered, and that she had come forward of her own volition. The trial judge denied Wright's motion, noting that Florida's sequestration rule would be rendered ""meaningless"" if, after discussing the case with others, a witness were permitted ""to testify in support of one side or the other, almost as if that testimony were tailor- made."" 473 So.2d 1277, 1279 (1985). Although the State acknowledged that the violation of the sequestration rule had been inadvertent, it argued that the prosecution ""could very well be substantially prejudiced"" if Waters were permitted to testify. Id., at 1280. Wright was convicted and sentenced to die. 
 On appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida held that the trial judge's rigid application of the State's sequestration rule was inconsistent with Wright's Sixth Amendment right to present witnesses in his behalf. The court affirmed the conviction, however, because it deemed the error harmless: [474 U.S. 1094 , 1096]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 I would grant certiorari in this capital case to ensure that the Florida courts have not sentenced a man to die based on a conviction obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment. 
 On She apparently had died the previous night after being raped and stabbed. All the doors to her home were locked, but a back window was found open. Several weeks later, Charles Westberry told his wife that petitioner Joel Wright had come to Westberry's trailer shortly after daylight on the morning of February 6 and had confessed to killing the victim. Wright lived with his parents near the victim's home. Westberry's wife notified the police, and Wright was arrested and tried for the crime. At trial, Westberry was the State's principal witness. He testified that Wright had told him on the morning of February 6 that Wright had entered the victim's house through the back window to steal money, that the victim had discovered him as he was wiping his fingerprints from her purse, and that he had killed her because he did not want to return to prison. According to Westberry, Wright counted out $290 he claimed to have taken from the victim's home, and he asked Westberry to tell the authorities that Wright had spent the previous night at Westberry's 
Page 474 U.S. 1094 , 1095
 trailer. Another witness for the State testified that, approximately one month before the murder, he and Wright had stolen money from the victim's home after entering through the window later found open on February 6. The jury also was told that a fingerprint identified as Wright's had been found on a portable stove in the victim's bedroom. 
 Wright took the stand and denied involvement in the murder. He testified that he had returned home from a party at approximately 1 a.m. on February 6, but had found himself locked out. He claimed that he then had walked along Highway 19 to Westberry's trailer, where he had spent the night. He also presented a witness who testified that, late on the night of February 5 and early in the morning of February 6, he had seen a group of three men, whom he had not recognized, in the general vicinity of the victim's home. 
 After the close of evidence but prior to final arguments, the defense moved to re-open the case in order to introduce the testimony of a newly discovered witness, Kathy Waters. Waters apparently had read newspaper accounts of the trial, had listened to parts of the testimony, and had discussed the trial with friends in attendance. She offered to testify that, shortly after midnight on February 6, she had seen a person who could have been Wright walking along Highway 19, and had also observed three persons she did not recognize near the victim's home. Waters claimed that she had not realized she possessed relevant information until the morning her testimony was proffered, and that she had come forward of her own volition. The trial judge denied Wright's motion, noting that Florida's sequestration rule would be rendered ""meaningless"" if, after discussing the case with others, a witness were permitted ""to testify in support of one side or the other, almost as if that testimony were tailor- made."" 473 So.2d 1277, 1279 (1985). Although the State acknowledged that the violation of the sequestration rule had been inadvertent, it argued that the prosecution ""could very well be substantially prejudiced"" if Waters were permitted to testify. Id., at 1280. Wright was convicted and sentenced to die. 
 On appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida held that the trial judge's rigid application of the State's sequestration rule was inconsistent with Wright's Sixth Amendment right to present witnesses in his behalf. The court affirmed the conviction, however, because it deemed the error harmless: [474 U.S. 1094 , 1096]

Syllabus 
Respondent purchased a car in Switzerland and had it shipped to Vancouver, Canada.  After he had picked up the car in Vancouver, he drove to the United States border, but failed to declare the car when asked by a United States customs officer whether he had anything to declare.  Customs then seized the car pursuant to 19 U.S.C.  1497, which provides that any article not declared upon entry into the United States that by law must be declared is subject to forfeiture or to a penalty equaling the value of the article.  Respondent, rather than waiting to challenge the seizure in a judicial forfeiture action that might be initiated by the Government, immediately chose the other statutory option of filing a petition for administrative remission of the forfeiture.  Two weeks later, he posted a bond for $24,500, the car's value, and Customs released the car.  The Customs Service did not respond to the remission petition until 36 days after it was filed, at which time the penalty for failure to declare the car was reduced to $3,600, and this penalty was upheld on administrative review.  Respondent then filed a complaint in Federal District Court, seeking cancellation of the penalty on the ground that he had not violated  1497, and a declaration that the seizure and penalty were unlawful.  The District Court disagreed and entered judgment for the Government.  The Court of Appeals held that the 36-day delay in acting on respondent's remission petition denied him due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Subsequently, on remand from this Court for reconsideration in light of United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555, the Court of Appeals held that the four-factor balancing test of Barker v. Wino, 407 U. S. 514 -- the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice suffered by the defendant -- applied in $8,850 in determining whether a delay in bringing a forfeiture proceeding violated due process should also be applied to determine whether the 36-day delay in this case violated due process, and accordingly remanded to the District Court to determine that question under the above test.
Held:  On the record, the 36-day delay did not deprive respondent of property without due process of law.  Pp.  474 U. S. 249-251.
(a) Respondent's right to a forfeiture proceeding meeting the Barker test provides the postseizure hearing required by due process to protect respondent's property interest in the car.  The remission statute simply 
Page 474 U. S. 243
 grants the Secretary of the Treasury the discretion not to pursue a complete forfeiture despite the Government's entitlement to one.  Remission proceedings are not necessary to a forfeiture determination, and therefore are not constitutionally required.  Thus, there is no constitutional basis for a claim that respondent's interest in the car, or in the money put up to secure the bond, entitled him to a speedy answer to his remission petition.  Pp.  474 U. S. 249-250.
(b) Even if respondent had a property right under the remission statute that cannot be taken away without due process that includes a speedy answer to the remission petition, any due process requirement of timely disposition was more than adequately provided for here.  It is not shown that he suffered any prejudice from the 36-day delay.  Pp.  474 U. S. 250-251.

Syllabus 
In 1962, a California grand jury indicted respondent for murder.  Before trial in California Superior Court, the judge refused to quash the indictment on the alleged ground that it had been issued by a grand jury from which blacks had been systematically excluded.  Respondent was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder.  After unsuccessfully pursuing appeals and collateral relief in the state courts for the next 16 years, respondent filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, again raising his equal protection challenge to the grand jury that indicted him.  The District Court upheld the challenge, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Respondent's obligation to exhaust state remedies before seeking collateral relief in federal court was not circumvented by the fact that the District Court, pursuant to a valid exercise of its power to expand the record, directed the parties to present supplemental evidence (consisting of affidavits and a computer analysis assessing the mathematical possibility that chance or accident could have accounted for the exclusion of blacks from the grand jury), where such evidence did not fundamentally alter the claim already considered by the state courts.  Pp.  474 U. S. 257-260.
2. The longstanding rule requiring reversal of the conviction of a defendant indicted by a grand jury from which members of his own race were systematically excluded will not be abandoned in this case on the theory that discrimination in the grand jury amounted to harmless error, and that respondent's conviction after a fair trial purged any taint attributable to the grand jury process.  Intentional discrimination in the selection of grand jurors is a grave constitutional trespass, possible only under color of state authority, and wholly within the State's power to prevent.  Even if the grand jury's determination of probable cause to believe that a defendant has committed a crime is confirmed in hindsight by a conviction on the indicted offense, that confirmation does not suggest that discrimination did not impermissibly infect the framing of the indictment and, consequently, the nature or existence of the proceedings to come.  And just as a conviction is void under the Equal Protection Clause if the prosecutor deliberately charged the defendant on account of 
Page 474 U. S. 255
 his race, a conviction cannot be understood to cure the taint attributable to a grand jury selected on the basis of race.  Pp.  474 U. S. 260-264.
3. Sound jurisprudence counsels against adoption of a rule whereby the grant of federal habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner would be conditioned upon the passage of time between his conviction and the filing of the federal habeas corpus petition, depending upon the State's ability to obtain a second conviction.  Pp.  474 U. S. 264-265.
4. The decision in this case is supported, but not compelled, by the stare decisis doctrine, the means by which this Court ensures that the law will not merely change erratically but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.  Pp.  474 U. S. 265-266.

Syllabus 
On three occasions shortly after his arrest in Florida for sexual battery, respondent was given Miranda warnings, and in each instance he exercised his right to remain silent and stated that he wished to speak with an attorney before answering any questions.  Respondent later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and in the closing arguments in the Florida trial court, the prosecutor, over defense counsel's objection, reviewed police officer testimony as to the occasions on which respondent had exercised his right to remain silent, and suggested that respondent's repeated refusals to answer questions without first consulting an attorney demonstrated a degree of comprehension that was inconsistent with his claim of insanity.  Respondent's subsequent conviction was affirmed by the Florida Court of Appeal, which held that the general rule precluding prosecutorial comment as to a defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent did not apply to a case in which an insanity plea was filed.  Respondent then unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under the reasoning of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, respondent was entitled to a new trial.
Held:  The prosecutor's use of respondent's postarrest, post-Miranda warnings silence as evidence of sanity violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  474 U. S. 289-295.
(a) In Doyle, supra, it was held that the prosecutor's impeachment of the defendants' exculpatory testimony by asking them on cross-examination why they had not explained their conduct at the time of their arrest was fundamentally unfair, and therefore violated the Due Process Clause.  The source of the unfairness was the implicit assurance contained in Miranda warnings that silence will carry no penalty.  Pp.  474 U. S. 289-291.
(b) There is no merit to the argument that Doyle does not control this case because proof of sanity is significantly different from proof of the commission of the underlying offense.  The point of the Doyle holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.  It is equally unfair

 to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant's plea of insanity. South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, distinguished. Pp. 292-293.
(c) The argument that Doyle should not control this case because a suspect's comprehension of Miranda warnings, as evidenced by his silence, is far more probative of sanity than of commission of the underlying offense, is also unpersuasive.  Such argument fails to meet the problem of fundamental unfairness that flows from the State's breach of its implied assurances.  Pp.  474 U. S. 293-294.
(d) A State's legitimate interest in proving that the defendant's behavior appeared to be rational at the time of his arrest can be served by carefully framed questions that avoid any mention of the defendant's exercise of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to consult counsel.

 COLORADO v. Francis Barry CONNELLY.No. 85-660 Supreme Court of the United States January 13, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Colorado. The motion of Duane Woodard, Attorney General of Colorado, et al., for leave to file a brief as amici curiae is granted. The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the question presented by the petition for writ of certiorari, the parties are requested to brief and argue the following question: Did respondent's mental condition render his waiver of Miranda rights ineffective? The application for stay, presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court, is granted pending the issuance of the mandate of this Court. 

 Memorandum of Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice STEVENS joins. 
 This grant of certiorari is yet another instance supporting the concern that the Court shows an unseemly eagerness to act as ""the adjunct of the State and its prosecutors in facilitating efficient and expedient conviction. . . ."" Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 463, 872 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Most often, this concern has been evoked by the Court's overly narrow interpretations of the Constitution's fundamental guarantees and the laws established to secure relief from violations of those guarantees. See ibid.; United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 928-929, 3430 (1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). However, the Court's willingness to take special judicial action to assist the prosecutor has not been limited to its interpretations of substantive law. For example, in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985), reargument was directed on a constitutional question not raised by either party because it provided a broader basis for upholding the State's action. Similarly, two Terms ago, Justice STEVENS noted the ""quite striking"" fact that during the preceding two-and-a-half years the Court had summarily reversed, without briefing or oral argument, 19 criminal cases-every one on the petition of the warden or the prosecutor and every one in his favor. Florida v. 
Page 474 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 Meyers, 466 U.S. 380, 385-387, and n. 3, 1855-1856, and n. 3 (1984) (STEVENS J., dissenting). Nothing has changed in the year and a half since that decision, for, although in the immediate wake of Justice STEVENS' dissent the Court did summarily reverse a few convictions on the petition of a criminal defendant, the trend to grant summary dispositions only in favor of the prosecutor has resumed and the record now stands at 26-4.1 No particularly informed understanding of statistics is required to appreciate that the likelihood of courts so consistently erring in favor of defendants is truly remote and that only a one-sided exercise of discretion can explain these results. 
 The Court's treatment of this case provides another clear example of why there is concern that the Court engages in injudicious efforts to assist prosecutors. Today, the Court takes the unprecedented step of rewriting a prosecutor's certiorari petition for him, enabling him to seek reversal on a ground he did not present himself. [Footnote 2] 

 Respondent approached a uniformed police officer and stated that ""he had killed someone"" and wanted to tell the officer about it. Before questioning respondent about the killing, the officer informed respondent of his Miranda rights. Respondent waived [474 U.S. 1050 , 1052]

The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the question presented by the petition for writ of certiorari, the parties are requested to brief and argue the following question: Did respondent's mental condition render his waiver of Miranda rights ineffective? The application for stay, presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court, is granted pending the issuance of the mandate of this Court. 

 Memorandum of Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice STEVENS joins. 
 This grant of certiorari is yet another instance supporting the concern that the Court shows an unseemly eagerness to act as ""the adjunct of the State and its prosecutors in facilitating efficient and expedient conviction. . . ."" Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 463, 872 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Most often, this concern has been evoked by the Court's overly narrow interpretations of the Constitution's fundamental guarantees and the laws established to secure relief from violations of those guarantees. See ibid.; United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 928-929, 3430 (1984) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). However, the Court's willingness to take special judicial action to assist the prosecutor has not been limited to its interpretations of substantive law. For example, in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325 (1985), reargument was directed on a constitutional question not raised by either party because it provided a broader basis for upholding the State's action. Similarly, two Terms ago, Justice STEVENS noted the ""quite striking"" fact that during the preceding two-and-a-half years the Court had summarily reversed, without briefing or oral argument, 19 criminal cases-every one on the petition of the warden or the prosecutor and every one in his favor. Florida v. 
Page 474 U.S. 1050 , 1051
 Meyers, 466 U.S. 380, 385-387, and n. 3, 1855-1856, and n. 3 (1984) (STEVENS J., dissenting). Nothing has changed in the year and a half since that decision, for, although in the immediate wake of Justice STEVENS' dissent the Court did summarily reverse a few convictions on the petition of a criminal defendant, the trend to grant summary dispositions only in favor of the prosecutor has resumed and the record now stands at 26-4.1 No particularly informed understanding of statistics is required to appreciate that the likelihood of courts so consistently erring in favor of defendants is truly remote and that only a one-sided exercise of discretion can explain these results. 
 The Court's treatment of this case provides another clear example of why there is concern that the Court engages in injudicious efforts to assist prosecutors. Today, the Court takes the unprecedented step of rewriting a prosecutor's certiorari petition for him, enabling him to seek reversal on a ground he did not present himself. [Footnote 2] 

 Respondent approached a uniformed police officer and stated that ""he had killed someone"" and wanted to tell the officer about it. Before questioning respondent about the killing, the officer informed respondent of his Miranda rights. Respondent waived [474 U.S. 1050 , 1052]

 Sonia YOUNGv. ARKANSAS.No. 85-391 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 13, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Arkansas Stat. Ann. 41-1812 (1977) provides, in pertinent part, that ""[a] person commits indecent exposure if, with purpose to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of himself or of any other person, he exposes his sex organs . . . in a public place or public view. . . ."" * Petitioner was a nude dancer at D.L.'s Darkroom, a tavern in Little Rock, Arkansas. Along with nearly every other nude dancer in the metropolitan area, petitioner was arrested in one of two ""sweep"" operations conducted in February 1984. At a bench trial, an undercover police officer testified that once during her dance, petitioner touched her breasts, and then touched the inside of her thighs. At no time did petitioner expose her vaginal area or touch her genitals. The Municipal Court convicted petitioner for indecent exposure under 41-1812, fined her $700, and gave her a 30-day suspended sentence. 
Page 474 U.S. 1070 , 1071
 The Pulaski County Circuit Court conducted a trial de novo on appeal. The court held that mere nude dancing violated the statute, and rejected petitioner's First Amendment defense on the grounds that her nude dancing had no articulated message. Pet. for Cert. 13-14. The court affirmed petitioner's conviction, and imposed a 1-year suspended sentence on the condition that she not ""display herself in a public place. . . ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 8-a. 
 The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed, both on the ground that petitioner's conduct violated the statute and because such behavior was not protected by the First Amendment. 286 Ark. 413, 692 S.W.2d 752 (1985 ). With respect to the statutory argument, the court noted that 41-1812 was intended to cover both nude dancing and "" 'flashers.' "" Id., at 415, 692 S.W.2d, at 753. Turning to petitioner's constitutional argument, the court ""d[id.] not take issue"" with petitioner's contention that ""mere nude dancing"" is entitled to First Amendment protection, but found under the facts of this case that petitioner's conduct "" 'was not simply nudity. . . . ' "" Id., at 417, 692 S.W.2d, at 754. Instead, ""while dancing [petitioner] ran her hand over her breast, down over her stomach and rubbed herself on the inner thigh below the vaginal area."" Ibid. Because petitioner did not argue that such conduct is constitutionally protected, the court did not address the remaining aspects of her constitutional argument. Ibid. 
 Petitioner maintains that, as applied to mere nude dancing, 41-1812 is overbroad and substantially abridges First Amendment rights. Regardless of whether and how petitioner might have touched herself during her performance, she has standing to raise this overbreadth challenge. See Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 958-959, 2848 (1984); Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 633-635, 834-35 (1980); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 611- 612, 2915 (1973). 
 In New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714, 101 S. Ct. 2599 (1981) and California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972), the Court held that States may regulate nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve liquor by virtue of the power conferred under the Twenty-first Amendment. In both cases, however, the Court intimated that statutes which seek to regulate nude dancing in public places other than bars and taverns might contravene the dictates of the First Amendment, as this form of entertainment [474 U.S. 1070 , 1072]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 13, 1986
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
Page 474 U.S. 1073 , 1074
 
 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Because the Court's refusal to grant certiorari in this case allows the State of Florida to proceed with the execution of a defendant whose conviction may well rest upon a ground that the Florida Supreme Court has held invalid, I must dissent from the denial here. 
 Since Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931), this Court has recognized that ""a general verdict must be set aside if the jury was instructed that it could rely on any of two or more independent grounds, and one of those grounds is insufficient, because the verdict may have rested exclusively on the insufficient ground."" Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 881, 2745 (1983). See Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 237, n. 21, 1119, n. 21 (1980); Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 31-32, 1545-46 (1969). Although in Stromberg, the Court was concerned that the jury might have held the defendant criminally liable for conduct protected by the First Amendment, the rationale of that decision should not be limited to cases in which a general verdict may be based upon a ground repugnant to the Federal Constitution. Where a jury has been instructed that it may convict a defendant upon an invalid ground, the reason for that invalidity is not important. See Chiarella v. United States, supra, 445 U.S., at 237, n. 21, n. 21 (""We may not uphold a criminal conviction if it is impossible to ascertain whether the defendant has been punished for noncriminal conduct""). What offends the Due Process Clause is the possibility that the jury may have condemned the defendant for reasons that as a matter of law-be it statutory or constitutional-cannot support the verdict. The existence of such a possibility is all too real in this case and demands that petitioner's conviction be set aside. 
 Petitioner was arrested and charged with the murder of an 8-year-old girl. In statements to the police, he admitted removing the victim's clothes, using rope to tie her hands, and placing plastic bags over her body. He said he thought he had tried to have sexual relations with the victim but either could not do it or could [474 U.S. 1073 , 1075]

|494 u.s. 1|"Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission
No. 88-1076
Argued Nov. 1, 1989
Decided Feb. 21, 1990
494 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Because preexisting federal law failed to deal adequately with the national problem of shrinking rail trackage, Congress enacted the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983 (Amendments) to the National Trails System Act (Trails Act), which authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) to preserve for possible future railroad use rights-of-way not currently in service and to allow interim use of the land as recreational trails.  Section 8(d) of this so-called ""rails-to-trails"" statute provides that a railroad wishing to cease operations along a particular route may negotiate with a State, municipality, or private group prepared to assume financial and managerial responsibility for the right-of-way.  If the parties reach agreement, the land may, subject to ICC-imposed terms and conditions, be transferred to the trail operator for interim trail use notwithstanding whatever reversionary interests may exist in the property under state law.  If no agreement is reached, the railroad may abandon the line entirely, thereby allowing the property to revert to abutting landowners if the terms of applicable easements and state law provide for such reversion.  After Vermont Railway, Inc., stopped using a right-of-way adjacent to petitioners' land in Vermont, petitioners brought a state court quiet title action, alleging that the railroad's easement had been abandoned and thus extinguished, and that the right-of-way had therefore reverted to them under state law.  Holding that it lacked jurisdiction because the ICC had not authorized 
Page 494 U. S. 2
 abandonment of the route, and therefore still exercised exclusive jurisdiction over it, the court dismissed the action, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.  Petitioners then sought a certificate of abandonment from the ICC, but the Commission granted a petition to permit the railroad to discontinue rail service and transfer the right-of-way to the city of Burlington for interim trail use under  8(d).  The Federal Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contentions that  8(d) is unconstitutional on its face because it takes private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment and because it is not a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power.
Held:
1. Even if the rails-to-trails statute gives rise to a taking, compensation is available under the Tucker Act, and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment are therefore satisfied.  Since the Amendments and their legislative history do not mention the Tucker Act -- which provides Claims Court jurisdiction over claims against the Government to recover damages founded on, inter alia, the Constitution -- the Amendments do not exhibit the type of ""unambiguous intention"" to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy that is necessary to preclude a claim under that Act.  See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986,  467 U. S. 1019.  Section 101 of the Amendments -- which provides that
""authority to . . . make payments . . . under this Act shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts""
does not, as petitioners claim, indirectly manifest the necessary intent by rendering ""unauthorized,"" as not approved by Congress for payment in advance, any rail-to-trail conversion that could result in Claims Court litigation.  Since  8(d) speaks in capacious terms of interim use of any right-of-way, it clearly authorizes conversions giving rise to just compensation claims, and therefore does not support petitioners' contention.  That there is no explicit promise to pay for any takings is irrelevant, since the Tucker Act constitutes an implied promise to pay just compensation which individual laws need not reiterate.  Moreover,  101 speaks only to payments under the Amendments themselves, and not to takings claims that ""arise"" under the Fifth Amendment and for which payments are made ""under"" the Tucker Act from the separately appropriated Judgment Fund.  Nor do statements in the legislative history indicating Congress' desire that the Amendments operate at ""low cost"" demonstrate an unambiguous intent to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy, since a generalized desire to protect the public fisc is insufficient for that purpose, see, e.g., Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102,  419 U. S. 127-128, and since the statements might simply reflect Congress' rejection of a more ambitious program of federally owned and managed trails.  Because petitioners' failure to make use of the available Tucker Act remedy 
Page 494 U. S. 3
 renders their takings challenge to the ICC's order premature, there is no need to determine whether a taking occurred.  Pp.  494 U. S. 11-17.
2. The Amendments are a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power.  The stated congressional purposes -- (1) to encourage the development of additional recreational trails on an interim basis and (2) to preserve established railroad rights-of-way for future reactivation of rail service -- are valid objectives to which the Amendments are reasonably adapted.  Even if petitioners were correct that the rail banking purpose is a sham concealing a true purpose of preventing reversion of rights-of-way to property owners after abandonment, the Amendments would still be valid because they are reasonably adapted to the goal of encouraging the development of additional trails.  There is no requirement that a law serve more than one legitimate purpose.  Moreover, this Court is not free under the applicable rational basis standard of review to hold the Amendments invalid simply because the rail banking purpose might be advanced more completely by measures more Draconian than  8(d) -- such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of all abandonments.  The long history of congressional attempts to address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason to defer to the legislative judgment that  8(d) is an appropriate answer.  Furthermore, in light of that history, Congress was entitled to make the judgment that every line is a potentially valuable national asset meriting preservation even if no future rail use for it is currently foreseeable, so that the fact that the ICC must certify that public convenience and necessity permit abandonment before granting an interim trail use permit does not indicate that the statute fails to promote its purpose of preserving rail corridors.

			"|"Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission
No. 88-1076
Argued Nov. 1, 1989
Decided Feb. 21, 1990
494 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Because preexisting federal law failed to deal adequately with the national problem of shrinking rail trackage, Congress enacted the National Trails System Act Amendments of 1983 (Amendments) to the National Trails System Act (Trails Act), which authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) to preserve for possible future railroad use rights-of-way not currently in service and to allow interim use of the land as recreational trails.  Section 8(d) of this so-called ""rails-to-trails"" statute provides that a railroad wishing to cease operations along a particular route may negotiate with a State, municipality, or private group prepared to assume financial and managerial responsibility for the right-of-way.  If the parties reach agreement, the land may, subject to ICC-imposed terms and conditions, be transferred to the trail operator for interim trail use notwithstanding whatever reversionary interests may exist in the property under state law.  If no agreement is reached, the railroad may abandon the line entirely, thereby allowing the property to revert to abutting landowners if the terms of applicable easements and state law provide for such reversion.  After Vermont Railway, Inc., stopped using a right-of-way adjacent to petitioners' land in Vermont, petitioners brought a state court quiet title action, alleging that the railroad's easement had been abandoned and thus extinguished, and that the right-of-way had therefore reverted to them under state law.  Holding that it lacked jurisdiction because the ICC had not authorized 
Page 494 U. S. 2
 abandonment of the route, and therefore still exercised exclusive jurisdiction over it, the court dismissed the action, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.  Petitioners then sought a certificate of abandonment from the ICC, but the Commission granted a petition to permit the railroad to discontinue rail service and transfer the right-of-way to the city of Burlington for interim trail use under  8(d).  The Federal Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contentions that  8(d) is unconstitutional on its face because it takes private property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment and because it is not a valid exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power.
Held:
1. Even if the rails-to-trails statute gives rise to a taking, compensation is available under the Tucker Act, and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment are therefore satisfied.

 ILLINOISv. CORPS OF ENGINEERS OF the UNITED STATES ARMY et al.No. 85-800 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 3, 1986
 On petitions for writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. [ River Road Alliance, Inc. v. Corps of Engineers of U.S. Army 475 U.S. 1055 (1986) ][1055-Continued.] 
 In 1980, respondent National Marine Service applied to respondent Army Corps of Engineers for a permit to construct a temporary barge fleeting facility on the Mississippi River. After holding a public hearing on the environmental effects of the proposed facility, the Corps issued a brief ""environmental assessment"" concluding that the facility would have no significant environmental effects. Based on this conclusion, the Corps determined that it was not required to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the proposed project, since such an EIS is required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 83 Stat. 853, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), only for projects that will ""significantly affec[t ] . . . the quality of the human environment."" Thus, the Corps issued the permit sought. 
 Petitioners, the State of Illinois and others including River Road Alliance, Inc., brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, challenging the issuance of the permit and the Corps' underlying finding of no significant environmental effects. On petitioners' motion for summary judgment, the District Court found that ""[ w]hile paying lip service to [NEPA], the Corps has failed to take the 'hard look' required to support its conclusions, and has failed to document that 'hard look' in the Environmental Assessment. . . ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 85-800, p. 33. Based on this conclusion, the District Court held that the Corps' action was arbitrary and capricious and entered judgment in favor of petitioners. 
 On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 764 F.2d 445 (1985). While observing that 
Page 475 U.S. 1055 , 1056
 that court had previously held that an agency's decision not to prepare an EIS is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion, see, e.g., Wisconsin v. Weinberger, 745 F.2d 412, 417 (CA7 1984), the Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged that other Courts of Appeals have held that such decisions are reviewed for reasonableness. 764 F.2d, at 449. Having noted these differing formulations, the Court of Appeals expressed its doubt as to the ""practical difference"" between the two standards: ""There is plenary review and there is deferential review, and whether it is fruitful to attempt fine gradations within the second category may be doubted, though there is no need to resolve our doubt here."" Ibid. The court then declined to substitute its judgment for the Corps' and reversed the decision of the District Court. 
 Although the precise contours of the Court of Appeals' review in this case are somewhat unclear, the decision below again presents to this Court the unresolved question of the standard of review to be applied by courts reviewing an agency decision not to prepare an EIS. I have noted before the divergent standards of review invoked by the various Courts of Appeals in this context, see Gee v. Boyd, 471 U.S. 1058, 1059, 2124 (1985) (dissenting from denial of certiorari), and I will not again detail the alignment of the lower courts here. I reiterate, however, my previously expressed view that ""[t]his conflict is not merely semantic or academic"": The courts that invoke the abuse-of-discretion or arbitrary-and-capricious standard emphasize that the decision is committed to the agency's discretion and expertise; the courts that invoke the reasonableness standard, in contrast, stress the nondiscretionary nature of NEPA's language. Id., at 1060. Because this conflict among the Circuits raises a significant question as to the proper interpretation of a federal statute, because this question recurs regularly, and because I believe that the issue is not merely one of semantics, I would grant certiorari to resolve the issue.

 James D. LEDBETTER, Commissioner, Georgia Dept. of Human Resourcesv. Vernita BALDWIN et al.No. A-448. 
 Dec. 18, 1986. 

 Justice POWELL, Circuit Justice. 
 Applicant in this case is the Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Human Resources. He promulgated regulations implementing 42 U.S.C. 602(a)(38) (1982 ed., Supp.III). That section alters the requirements for state plans distributing grants under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Generally, 602(a)(38) requires the States, in determining a family's need for AFDC payments, to consider child support payments made to certain children living with the family. Respondents filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, contending that applicant's regulations violated the Federal Constitution in two respects: the regulations took property from the children without just compensation and violated substantive due process. The District Court held in favor of respondents and declared the regulations unconstitutional. 647 F.Supp. 623. Applicant sought a stay pending appeal from the District Court. Before the District Court ruled on that motion, applicant filed a notice of appeal in this Court pur- 
Page 479 U.S. 1309 , 1310
 suant to 28 U.S.C. 1252 and 2101. Subsequently, the District Court denied applicant's request for a stay. 
 Three considerations govern a Justice's decision whether to grant an application for a stay pending appeal. First, there must be a reasonable probability that four Members of the Court would consider the underlying issue sufficiently meritorious to justify notation of probable jurisdiction. Second, there must be a significant possibility of reversal of the lower court's decision. Finally, there must be a likelihood that irreparable harm will result if the lower court's decision is not stayed. See Times-Picayune Publishing Corp. v. Schulingkamp, 419 U.S. 1301, 1305, 3 (1974) (POWELL, J., in chambers); Graves v. Barnes, 405 U.S. 1201, 1203-1204, 753-754 ( 1972) (POWELL, J., in chambers). 
 Respondents concede that the case raises an issue sufficiently meritorious for the Court to note probable jurisdiction. On December 8, the Court noted probable jurisdiction in the similar cases of Kirk v. Gilliard, No. 86-564, and Bowen v. Gilliard, No. 86-509, 479 U.S. 1004 (both on appeal from Gilliard v. Kirk, 633 F. Supp. 1529 (WDNC 1986)). My review of the papers filed with this application and in Nos. 86-564 and 86-509 convinces me that there is a significant possibility that the Court will reverse the lower court's decision in this case. Finally, the State will suffer irreparable harm if the decision is not stayed. The State will bear the administrative costs of changing its system to comply with the District Court's order. Even if this Court reverses the judgment of the District Court, it is unlikely that the State would be able to recover these costs. Similarly, it is unlikely that disputed payments made pursuant to the District Court's judgment could be recovered. On the other hand, respondents argue that they will suffer irreparable injury if a stay is issued. If the Court affirms the judgment of the District Court, a stay will have deprived them of the disputed payments during the period of the Court's consideration. If the State then pays the disputed amount with interest, as presumably it would, [479 U.S. 1309 , 1311]
