Syllabus 
National Labor Relations Board regulations implementing the unfair labor practice provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act) provide that, after one of the Board's regional directors has filed a complaint, but before a hearing is held thereon, the director may enter into either a formal or an informal settlement.  The regulations allow a nonconsenting party to appeal a formal settlement to the Board's General Counsel, and then to the Board itself, and the Board's order is subject to review in the federal courts of appeals under  10(f) of the Act as ""a final order of the Board.""  However, if such a settlement is informal in nature, the regulations permit an appeal to the General Counsel, but not to the Board.  Respondent union filed charges alleging that an employer and another union had committed an unfair labor practice.  After the Regional Director filed complaints, but before the scheduled hearing, the Director entered into an informal settlement agreement in which respondent refused to join.  Pursuant to the regulations, respondent challenged the Director's action before the General Counsel, who sustained the settlement.  Respondent then sought review in the Court of Appeals, which rejected the Board's contention that the petition for review should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction to review an informal settlement that did not result in an order of the Board, and that was entered into without hearings.
Held:
1. A postcomplaint, prehearing informal settlement decision by the General Counsel is not subject to judicial review under the NLRA.  Pp.  484 U. S. 123-130.
(a) The regulations' failure to provide for a judicially reviewable Board order on the General Counsel's postcomplaint, prehearing informal settlement decision is consistent with the NLRA, and entitled to deference.  The language, structure, and history of the NLRA, as amended, clearly reveal that Congress intended to differentiate between ""prosecutorial"" determinations, which are to be made solely by the General Counsel, independent of the Board, and ""adjudicatory"" decisions, which are to be made by the Board, subject to judicial review.  It is a 
Page 484 U. S. 113
 reasonable construction of the NLRA to find that postcomplaint, prehearing settlement determinations are prosecutorial in nature, since, until a hearing is held, the Board has taken no action, and has therefore made no adjudication.  Moreover, the General Counsel's unreviewable discretion to file and withdraw complaints supports a reading that he or she also has final authority to dismiss a complaint in favor of an informal settlement before a hearing begins.  The legislative history indicates a congressional intent to give the General Counsel final authority to handle all aspects of prosecutions, not merely the filing of complaints.  The legislative history's silence regarding settlements does not indicate an intention to deny the Board the usual flexibility accorded an agency in interpreting its authorizing statute and in developing new regulations to meet changing needs, since Congress was aware of the importance of settlements to the administrative labor relations process.  Pp.  484 U. S. 123-128.
(b) Respondent's contention that, because the General Counsel acts ""on behalf of the Board"" under  3(d) of the NLRA, his or her final determinations are reviewable under  10(f) as orders ""of the Board,"" is refuted by the Act's plain language, structure, and history.  Clearly, an act ""on behalf of"" the Board is not the same as an act ""of the Board"" itself.  Further, the Act's provisions, particularly  3 and 10, evidence a congressional intent to distinguish unreviewable prosecutorial orders of the General Counsel from judicially reviewable orders of the Board.  The NLRA's history also confirms this distinction, demonstrating that the ""on behalf of the Board"" language was added to make it clear that the General Counsel acts within the agency, not to imply that the General Counsel's acts should be considered acts of the Board.  Moreover, since respondent concedes that the General Counsel's decision not to file a complaint is not reviewable under  10(f), there is no merit in the argument that the General Counsel's settlement decisions may be reviewable.  Pp.  484 U. S. 128-130.
2. The General Counsel's settlement determinations may not be judicially reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as final agency actions ""for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,"" since APA review is unavailable where ""statutes preclude judicial review.""  Although the NLRA does not contain language expressly precluding APA review, the NLRA's structure and history clearly establish the requisite congressional intent to do so.  The NLRA is a comprehensive statute that exhaustively sets out the stages through which unfair labor practice charges must pass, and expressly provides for judicial review only as to Board orders.  APA review of General Counsel settlement decisions would run directly counter to this scheme, and would be extremely illogical, since appeals would be to the district courts, would involve lengthy proceedings in an area where Congress felt speed of 
Page 484 U. S. 114
 resolution to be necessary, and would provide a charged party with an incentive not to fulfill its settlement obligations until the proceedings were completed.  Since postcomplaint, prehearing informal settlements represent a substantial portion of unfair labor practice charge dispositions, Congress could not have intended the potentially serious consequences that APA review would entail.  Moreover, APA review would inevitably require the initial examination of the merits of charges to be made by federal courts, rather than the Board, as Congress intended.  Pp.  484 U. S. 130-133.

Syllabus 
Section 203(a) of the Secretary of Labor's ""interim regulations"" governing black lung benefits claims filed between July 1, 1973, and April 1, 1980, provides that a claimant who engaged in coal mine employment for at least 10 years is entitled to an ""interim presumption"" of eligibility for disability benefits if he meets one of four medical requirements:  (1) a chest X-ray ""establishes"" the presence of pneumoconiosis; (2) ventilatory studies establish the presence of any respiratory or pulmonary disease of a specified severity; (3) blood gas studies demonstrate an impairment in the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to the blood; or (4) other medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasonable medical judgment, establishes a totally disabling respiratory impairment.  Section 203(b) provides that ""all relevant medical evidence shall be considered"" in the adjudication of a claim, and that the interim presumption is rebutted if the evidence establishes (1) that the claimant is doing his usual or comparable work; (2) that he is capable of doing such work; (3) that his disability did not arise, even in part, out of coal mine employment; or (4) that he does not have pneumoconiosis.  At the hearing on respondent Ray's 1976 claim, the record proved that Ray had 16 years of coal mine employment and contained one qualifying and seven nonqualifying X-ray interpretations, two qualifying and four nonqualifying ventilatory studies, and one qualifying and five nonqualifying physicians' opinions.  After weighing the evidence, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) held that Ray was not entitled to the benefit of the interim presumption, and issued an order denying benefits, which the Benefits Review Board affirmed.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the Secretary's position that  203(a) requires the claimant to establish one of the qualifying facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court held instead that a single item of qualifying evidence is always sufficient to invoke the interim presumption, and, upon finding that the presumption had been invoked in this case by the two qualifying ventilatory studies and the qualifying physician's opinion, remanded for the 
Page 484 U. S. 136
 ALJ to determine whether the presumption had been rebutted by Ray's employer.
Held:  Section 203(a) requires that the claimant establish at least one of the qualifying facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp.  484 U. S. 146-160.
(a) Section 203(a)'s plain language does not mandate that the interim presumption be invoked on the basis of a single item of qualifying evidence.  The Court of Appeals' reading of  203(a)(1) as though it merely requires X-ray evidence of the presence of pneumoconiosis ignores the fact that  203(a)(1) expressly requires an X-ray that actually ""establishes"" the presence of the disease.  It is not the X-ray in isolation that establishes that presence; rather, the regulation must, at a minimum, have reference both to the X-ray itself and to interpretations by qualified experts.  The Secretary's view of the regulation, which would render some evidence inadmissible for certain aspects of rebuttal, is not inconsistent with  203(b)'s requirement that ""all relevant evidence shall be received"" in adjudicating a claim, since nothing in the Secretary's position prevents all relevant evidence from being considered at some point in the proof process, and nothing in the regulation requires that all relevant medical evidence be considered at the rebuttal phase.  Moreover, the Secretary's interpretation is not rendered internally inconsistent by his position that, if the claimant invokes the presumption by establishing the existence of pneumoconiosis under  203(a)(1), the employer may not try to disprove the disease under  203(b)(4), since nothing in the regulation requires each rebuttal subsection to be fully available in each case.  Furthermore, the Secretary's position will not permit an employer to prevail solely on a single negative X-ray interpretation in violation of a statutory provision prohibiting claim denials on that basis.  Thus, the Secretary's interpretation of  203 is entirely consistent with the regulation's text.  Pp.  484 U. S. 146-152.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in finding that the legislative history of the black lung benefits statutes requires a single-item-of-evidence invocation burden.  Section 203(a)'s interim presumption derives directly from, and is substantially similar to, an interim presumption for black lung claims promulgated by the Social Security Administration, under which ALJs have routinely weighed the evidence at the invocation stage without judicial objection, and often with explicit court approval.  Pp.  484 U. S. 152-155.
(c) The fact that a single item of qualifying evidence may often be sufficient to invoke the interim presumption does not compel the conclusion that such evidence must always be sufficient.  The factual understanding underlying the presumption -- that it is highly probable that a long-term coal miner is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis arising from his employment if he can prove any of the regulation's medical requirements 
Page 484 U. S. 137
 -- is not present when the claimant merely offers a single item of qualifying evidence that is overcome by more reliable conflicting evidence.  Similarly, the policy concern underlying the presumption -- that long-term miners who are truly diseased should not have to undertake the difficult task of proving that their diseases are totally disabling and coal mine related, or that they are in fact pneumoconiosis -- is not implicated if a miner is not actually suffering from the type of ailment with which Congress was concerned.  Thus, the Secretary's reading of the interim presumption's invocation burden is eminently reasonable, and deserving of substantial deference.  Pp.  484 U. S. 156-160.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 14, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886 ( 1984), the Court defined what constitutes a ""reasonable attorney's fee"" under 42 U.S.C. 1988 for salaried attorneys employed by legal aid organizations. We held that the fee awards of such attorneys must be calculated on the basis of the prevailing community rate for similar services by attorneys of comparable skill, experience, and reputation. Id., at 895-896, and n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1547, and n. 11. We did not decide whether the fee awards of private attorneys with an established billing rate must be calculated in the same manner. 
 Here, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld an attorney's fee award under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k) based on an hourly rate that was consistent with the prevailing market rate 
Page 484 U.S. 990 , 991
 but that substantially exceeded counsel's own customary billing rate. Maldonado v. Lehman, 811 F.2d 1341 (1987). The court expressly rejected the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 241 U.S.App.D.C. 11, 746 F.2d 4 (1984), cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1021 ( 1985), which held that an attorney's customary billing rate must be used in calculating a fee award so long as that rate is not unusually high or low. 
 It is true that the District of Columbia Circuit recently granted rehearing en banc in Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel, 263 U.S. App.D.C. 409, 826 F.2d 43 (1987), for the purpose of deciding whether Laffey ought to be reconsidered. The Cumberland Mountains case has been held in abeyance, however, pending the resolution of the petition for certiorari in this case. Hence, the conflict persists between the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case and the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in Laffey. It cannot be said with any certainty that the latter court will decide to overrule Laffey in whole or in part. 
 In addition, there is some tension between the Ninth Circuit's definition of a ""reasonable"" fee and other courts' definition of the term as ""a fee large enough to induce competent counsel to handle the plaintiff's case, but no larger."" Lenard v. Argento, 808 F.2d 1242, 1247 ( CA7 1987). See also Coulter v. Tennessee, 805 F.2d 146, 148-149 (CA6 1986 ) (""Congress did not intend that lawyers . . . receive excess compensation or incentives beyond the amount necessary to cause competent legal work to be performed""), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 914 ( 1987). It is at least arguable that an attorney will have sufficient incentive to accept a case so long as he receives the same fee from suing the government as he would receive from suing a private party. 
 Finally, the question of what constitutes a ""reasonable"" fee for an attorney with an established billing rate is likely to arise in other circuits. The Court has previously observed that more than 100 federal statutes provide for an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party, and that ""the benchmark for the awards under nearly all of these statutes is that the attorney's fee must be 'reasonable.' "" Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 562, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 3096-3097 (1986). Hence, since fee awards under all statutes that provide for ""reasonable"" attorney's fees are calculated in a similar manner, the petition raises an issue of considerable practical importance.

No. 86-740
Argued October 6, 1987
Decided December 8, 1987
484 U.S. 97

Syllabus 
Omni Capital International, Ltd., and Omni Capital Corporation (hereafter petitioners), New York corporations, marketed an investment program involving commodity futures trades on the London Metals Exchange.  Certain investors filed suits (later consolidated) against petitioners in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, charging that petitioners fraudulently induced them to participate in petitioners' program, in violation of various federal securities laws.  Petitioners impleaded respondent Rudolf Wolff & Co., a British corporation with offices in London that was employed by petitioners to handle trades on the London Exchange, and respondent Gourlay (hereafter respondents), a United Kingdom citizen and resident who was Wolff's representative in soliciting petitioners' business.  Petitioners contended that their liability, if any, was caused by respondents' improper trading activities.  While the action was pending, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, was decided, recognizing an implied private cause of action under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), and the plaintiffs in this litigation amended their complaints to allege violations of that Act.  The District Court dismissed the other securities law claims as preempted by the CEA, and held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over respondents because (1) the CEA was silent about service of process for private causes of action, (2) thus, application of Louisiana's long-arm statute was required, and (3) that statute's requirements were not met.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over respondents in this federal question litigation under the CEA.  Pp.  484 U. S. 102-111.
(a) The requirement that a federal court have personal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  However, before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be more than notice to the defendant and a constitutionally sufficient relationship between the defendant and the forum.  There also must be a basis for the defendant's amenability to service of summons.  Absent consent, there must be authorization for service of summons on the defendant.  Pp.  484 U. S. 103-104. 
Page 484 U. S. 98

(b) Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e), a federal court normally looks either to a federal statute or to the long-arm statute of the State in which it sits to determine whether an out-of-state defendant is amenable to service.  After the Curran decision, and while the present litigation was still pending in the District Court, Congress added  22 to the CEA, explicitly authorizing a private cause of action for CEA violations but not referring to service of process, in contrast to Congress' explicit authorization of nationwide service of process in other CEA provisions for other civil actions under the Act.  This contrast, as well as the legislative history, supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to provide nationwide service of process for private actions under the CEA.  Nor was nationwide service implicitly authorized for any implied private cause of action under the CEA, such as petitioners', that accrued prior to  22's effective date.  Moreover, the District Court held, and petitioners concede, that the requirements of Louisiana's long-arm statute were not met here.  Pp.  484 U. S. 104-108.
(c) Even were it within this Court's power, judicial creation of a common law rule authorizing service of process in this litigation would be unwise.  The strength of the longstanding assumption that federal courts cannot add to the scope of service of summons Congress has authorized, and the network of statutory enactments and judicial decisions tied to that assumption, argue strongly against devising common law service of process provisions.  The responsibility for creating service of process provisions rests with those who propose the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with Congress.  Pp.  484 U. S. 108-111.
795 F.2d 415, affirmed.

 Rehearing Denied Jan. 19, 1988. 
 See 484 U.S. 1037. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 ( 1975), we held that an accused has a right to conduct his own defense. We also stated that, because an accused's election to do so ""relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel,"" a defendant who chooses to proceed pro se may be allowed to do so only if he "" 'knowingly and intelligently' [chooses to] forgo those relinquished benefits."" Id., at 835. We stated that an accused wishing to be tried without counsel ""should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that 'he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.' "" Ibid. [ McDowell v. U.S 484 U.S. 980 (1987) ][980-Continued.] 
 Since Faretta, lower federal and state courts have sought to arrive at the proper balance between allowing an accused to exercise his right of self-representation, and at the same time, insuring that a waiver of a defendant's right to counsel is only made when ""knowing and intelligent"" and ""with eyes open."" In this case, for example, after petitioner indicated to the District Court his desire to present his own defense, the trial judge conducted a short colloquy with petitioner before allowing him to proceed pro se. On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's claim that this brief exchange with the trial judge was insufficient to establish that he had ""knowingly and intelligently"" waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Sixth Circuit concluded that ""a fair reading of the record as a whole"" established that petitioner elected to represent himself with ""eyes open""; therefore it affirmed petitioner's conviction. 814 F.2d 245, 249 (1987). The Court of Appeals, however, in the exercise of its supervisory powers, required district judges in the future to conduct a more detailed inquiry of a defendant-based on the model offered at 1 Bench Book for United States District Judges 1.02-2- 1.02-5 (3d ed. 1986)-before allowing an accused to waive his right to counsel, as this petitioner had. 814 F.2d, at 250-251. 
 In reaching this decision, the Sixth Circuit followed the approach taken by the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v. Bailey, 219 U.S.App.D.C. 67, 75-76, 675 F.2d 1292, 1300- 
Page 484 U.S. 980 , 981
 1301, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 853 (1982). It also rejected the position of the Third Circuit, which had reversed a conviction on facts similar to these, by interpreting Faretta to require a "" searching inquiry"" with an accused before allowing him to conduct his own defense. United States v. Welty, 674 F.2d 185, 188-189 (1982); accord, Piankhy v. Cuyler, 703 F.2d 728, 730-731 (CA3 1983). Two other Courts of Appeals have likewise read our decision in Faretta as requiring that a trial judge conduct a special ""hearing to ensure that the accused understands the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding pro se."" United States v. Edwards, 716 F.2d 822, 824 (CA11 1983); accord, United States v. Chaney, 662 F.2d 1148, 1152 (CA5 1981). 
 By contrast, four Courts of Appeals have taken the position that no specific inquiries or special hearings must be conducted before an accused's exercise of his Faretta rights will be considered ""knowing and intelligent."" United States v. Hafen, 726 F.2d 21, 26 (CA1), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 962 (1984); United States v. Kimmel, 672 F.2d 720, 721-722 (CA9 1982); United States v. Trapnell, 638 F.2d 1016, 1029 (CA7 1980); United States v. Tompkins, 623 F.2d 824, 828-829 (CA2 1980). This conflict among the Courts of Appeals has now gained the attention of, and been a source of confusion to, the state courts as well. See, e.g., State v. Christensen, 40 Wash.App. 290, 292-297, 698 P.2d 1069, 1071-1073 (1985) ( discussing the varying applications of Faretta ). 
 Because a conflict among the lower courts has emerged concerning the proper application and interpretation of our decision in Faretta, I would grant certiorari and address the question presented by this petition.

Respondent employer's collective bargaining agreement with petitioner union authorizes the submission to binding arbitration of any grievance that arises from the interpretation or application of the agreement's terms, and reserves to management the right to establish, amend, and enforce rules regulating employee discharge and discipline and setting forth disciplinary procedures.  One of respondent's rules listed as causes for discharge the possession or use of controlled substances on company property.  Isiah Cooper, an employee covered by the agreement who operated a hazardous machine, was apprehended by police in the backseat of someone else's car in respondent's parking lot with marijuana smoke in the air and a lighted marijuana cigarette in the frontseat ashtray.  A police search of Cooper's own car on the lot revealed marijuana gleanings.  Upon learning of the cigarette incident, respondent discharged Cooper for violation of the disciplinary rule.  Cooper then filed a grievance which proceeded to arbitration on the stipulated issue whether respondent had just cause for the discharge under the rule and, if not, the appropriate remedy.  The arbitrator upheld the grievance and ordered Cooper's reinstatement, finding that the cigarette incident was insufficient proof that Cooper was using or possessed marijuana on company property.  Because, at the time of the discharge, respondent was not aware of, and thus did not rely upon, the fact that marijuana had been found in Cooper's own car, the arbitrator refused to accept this fact into evidence.  However, the District Court vacated the arbitration award and the Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that reinstatement would violate the public policy ""against the operation of dangerous machinery by persons under the influence of drugs.""  The court held that the cigarette incident and the finding of marijuana in Cooper's car established a violation of the disciplinary rule that gave respondent just cause for discharge.

1. The Court of Appeals exceeded the limited authority possessed by a court reviewing an arbitrator's award entered pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  484 U. S. 36-42. 
Page 484 U. S. 30

(a) Absent fraud by the parties or the arbitrator's dishonesty, reviewing courts in such cases are not authorized to reconsider the merits of the award, since this would undermine the federal policy of privately settling labor disputes by arbitration without governmental intervention.  The parties having agreed to submit all questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator, the reviewing court is confined to ascertaining whether the award draws its essence from the contract and does not simply reflect the arbitrator's own notions of industrial justice.  As long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority, the court cannot overturn his decision simply because it disagrees with his factual findings, contract interpretations, or choice of remedies.  Pp.  484 U. S. 36-38.
(b) The Court of Appeals was not free to refuse enforcement of the award simply because it considered the cigarette incident ample proof that the disciplinary rule had been violated, since no dishonesty is alleged here, and since improvident factfinding is hardly a sufficient basis for disregarding what the arbitrator appointed by the parties determined to be the historical facts.  Nor is the arbitrator's refusal to consider the evidence of marijuana in Cooper's car a sufficient basis for nonenforcement, since the collective bargaining agreement largely left evidentiary matters to the arbitrator, whose decision on this point was consistent with the practice followed by other arbitrators of refusing to admit evidence which a discharging party did not rely upon.  Assuming that the arbitrator did err on this point, his error was not in bad faith or so gross as to amount to affirmative misconduct.  Moreover, his decision not to consider the disputed evidence did not forever foreclose respondent's use of that evidence as a basis for discharge.  Even if it were open to the court to find a disciplinary rule violation on the basis of that evidence, the court could not properly set aside the award because, in its view, discharge was the correct remedy, since arbitrators normally have wide discretion in formulating remedies.  Although the agreement here may have limited the arbitrator's remedial discretion by giving respondent the unreviewable right to discharge violators of the disciplinary rule, the proper course would have been remand to the arbitrator for a definitive construction of the contract in this respect.  Pp.  484 U. S. 39-42.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the arbitral award on public policy grounds.  A court's refusal to enforce an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement is limited to situations where the contract, as interpreted, would violate ""some explicit public policy"" that is
""well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents, and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.""

 framed under the approach set out in W. R. Grace, and the violation of such policy must be clearly shown.  Here, the court made no attempt to review existing laws and legal precedents, but simply formulated a policy against the operation of dangerous machinery under the influence of drugs based on ""general considerations of supposed public interests.""  Even if that formulation could be accepted, no violation of the policy was clearly shown, since the assumed connection between the marijuana gleanings in Cooper's car and his actual use of drugs in the workplace is tenuous, at best.  It was inappropriate for the court itself to draw that inference, since such factfinding is the task of the arbitrator chosen by the parties, not the reviewing court.  Furthermore, the award ordered Cooper's reinstatement in his old job or an equivalent one for which he was qualified, and it is not clear that he would pose a threat to the asserted public policy in every such alternative job.

Syllabus 
Section 505(a) of the Clean Water Act authorizes private citizens to commence a civil action for injunctive relief and/or the imposition of civil penalties in federal district court against any person ""alleged to be in violation"" of the conditions of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.  Between 1981 and 1984, petitioner repeatedly violated the conditions of its NPDES permit by exceeding authorized effluent limitations.  However, due to the installation of new equipment, petitioner's last reported violation occurred in May, 1984.  Nevertheless, in June, 1984, having given notice of their intent to sue to petitioner to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to state authorities, as required by  505(b) of the Act, respondents filed a  505 (a) suit alleging that petitioner ""has violated . . . [and] will continue to violate its NPDES permit.""  The District Court denied petitioner's motion for dismissal of the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction under the Act, rejecting the contention that  505(a)'s ""alleged to be in violation"" language requires that the defendant be violating the Act at the time of suit, and holding, in the alternative that respondents satisfied  505(a)'s jurisdictional requirements because their complaint alleged in good faith that petitioner was continuing to violate its permit at the time the suit was filed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing with the District Court that  505(a) authorizes suits on the basis of wholly past violations, and finding it unnecessary to rule on the District Court's alternative holding.
Held:
1. Section 505(a) does not confer federal jurisdiction over citizen suits for wholly past violations.  Pp.  484 U. S. 56-63.
(a) Although  505(a)'s ""to be in violation"" language is not without ambiguity, the most natural reading of that language is a requirement that citizen plaintiffs allege a state of either continuous or intermittent violation -- that is, a reasonable likelihood that a past polluter will continue to pollute in the future.  The contention that Congress' failure to choose statutory language that looked to the past is simply the result of a ""careless accident"" is unpersuasive, since the citizen suit provisions of several other environmental statutes that authorize only prospective relief 
Page 484 U. S. 50
 use language identical to  505(a)'s, while other statutory provisions demonstrate that Congress knows how to avoid prospective implications by using language that explicitly targets wholly past violations.  Also untenable is the argument that, since the EPA compliance order provisions in  309(a) of the Act use language parallel to the  505(a) ""to be in violation"" phrase, since  309(a) is incorporated by reference into the EPA civil enforcement provisions of  309(b), and since the EPA may bring enforcement actions to recover civil penalties for wholly past violations, citizens, too, may maintain such actions.  Section 309 authorizes equitable relief and the imposition of civil penalties in separate and distinct provisions, including  309(d), which provides for civil penalties but does not contain language parallel to  505(a)'s.  In contrast,  505(a)'s reference to civil penalties and injunctive relief in the same sentence suggests a connection between the two remedies, and supports the conclusion that citizens may seek civil penalties only in a suit brought to enjoin or otherwise abate an ongoing violation.  Pp.  484 U. S. 56-59.
(b) The language and structure of the rest of  505's citizen suit provisions make plain that the harm sought to be addressed by such a suit lies in the present or future, rather than the past, particularly in light of the pervasive and undeviating use of the present tense throughout  505.  Any other conclusion would render gratuitous  505(b)'s notice provision, the purpose of which is to give the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the Act, and thus make a citizen suit unnecessary.  Moreover,  505(b)(1)(B)'s bar on citizen suits once a governmental enforcement action is under way suggests that the citizen suit is meant to supplement, not supplant, governmental action, which supplemental role could be undermined if citizen suits for wholly past violations were permitted, since such a suit might intrude upon governmental discretion to enforce the Act in the public interest.  Pp.  484 U. S. 59-61.
(c) The Act's legislative history indicates that  505 suits were intended to abate pollution and to enjoin continuous or intermittent violations, not to remedy wholly past violations.  Pp.  484 U. S. 61-63.
2. Section 505 confers citizen suit jurisdiction on federal district courts when plaintiffs make a good faith allegation of continuous or intermittent violation.  It is not necessary that plaintiffs prove their allegations of ongoing noncompliance before jurisdiction attaches, since the statute does not require that a defendant ""be in violation"" at the commencement of suit, but only that the defendant be ""alleged to be in violation.""  The good faith requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 will adequately protect defendants from frivolous allegations.  Moreover, allegations of injury are sufficient under this Court's standing cases to invoke the jurisdiction of a court, and the Constitution does not require that the plaintiff offer proof of the allegations as a threshold matter.  Furthermore, longstanding mootness doctrine will protect the defendant 
Page 484 U. S. 51
 from the continuation of suits after the plaintiff's allegations of ongoing violations become false because the defendant has begun to comply with the Act.  Since the Court of Appeals declined to decide whether respondents' complaint contained a good faith allegation of ongoing violation by petitioner, the case must be remanded for consideration of this question.  Pp.  484 U. S. 64-67.

Syllabus 
Within a month after the effective date of a New Jersey statute requiring primary and secondary public school educators to permit students to observe a minute of silence before the start of each schoolday ""for quiet and private contemplation or introspection,"" appellees -- a teacher, several students, and parents -- filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, claiming that the statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  When it became apparent that neither the State's Attorney General nor the named defendants -- the State Department of Education, its Commissioner, and two local boards of education -- would defend the statute, the then-presiding Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly and the President of the State Senate (hereafter appellants) sought and obtained permission to intervene as defendants on behalf of the legislature, and thereafter carried the entire burden of defending the statute.  The District Court declared the statute unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  After appellants lost their posts as presiding legislative officers, they filed a notice in this Court appealing the judgment under 28 U.S.C.  1254(2).  Appellants' counsel having informed the Court that the new presiding legislative officers were withdrawing the legislature's appeal, appellees moved to dismiss on the ground that the withdrawal left the Court without a case or controversy.
Held:
1. The appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Appellants intervened and participated throughout this lawsuit only in their official capacities as presiding officers on behalf of the state legislature.  They no longer hold those offices, and the authority to pursue the lawsuit on behalf of the legislature has passed to their successors under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(1).  Their successors have withdrawn the legislature's appeal.  Moreover, appellants' intervention and participation as presiding legislative officers does not entitle them to appeal in their newly asserted roles as individual legislators and as representatives of the majority of the now-expired legislature that enacted the statute.  The record establishes that, throughout the proceedings in this case, appellants never sought or asserted participation in either of those 
Page 484 U. S. 73
 capacities, and that the only real party intervenor was the incumbent legislature.  Thus, appellants are not ""parties"" entitled to appeal the Court of Appeals' judgment under  1254(2).  Pp.  484 U. S. 77-81.
2. Dismissal of the appeal does not require that the judgments below be vacated.  The contention that no proper party defendant ever intervened in the case, because New Jersey law does not authorize the presiding legislative officers to represent the legislature in litigation, not only is directly contrary to appellants' explicit representations to the District Court, but appears to be wrong as a matter of state law, since the New Jersey Supreme Court has granted applications by the presiding legislative officers to intervene as parties respondent on behalf of the legislature in defense of a legislative enactment.  Moreover, this Court's procedure, under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, of vacating lower court judgments when a case becomes moot on appeal in order to allow future relitigation of the issues between the parties and to eliminate a judgment rendered ""unreviewable"" by happenstance, is inapplicable to this case.  This controversy did not become moot, nor was the judgment here rendered unreviewable, by appellants' loss of official status.  Rather, the authority to pursue the appeal on behalf of the legislature passed to appellants' successors in office, and the controversy ended when the legislature declined to pursue its appeal.

Rather, the authority to pursue the appeal on behalf of the legislature passed to appellants' successors in office, and the controversy ended when the legislature declined to pursue its appeal.  Pp.  484 U. S. 81-83.

487 U.S. 86

Syllabus 
To finance the purchase of land in Louisiana, petitioners borrowed money from a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and, in consideration for the loan, executed a note, a collateral mortgage, and personal guarantees.  When petitioners failed to pay an installment due on a renewal of the note, the bank filed suit for principal and interest in a Louisiana court, which suit was removed on diversity grounds to Federal District Court.  Petitioners alleged, as a defense against the bank's claim, that the land purchase and their note had been procured by the bank's misrepresentations overstating the amount of land and mineral acres in the tract, and falsely stating that there were no outstanding mineral leases on the property.  No references to the alleged representations appeared in the documents executed by petitioners, in the bank's records, or in the minutes of the bank's board of directors or loan committee.  While the suit was pending, a Louisiana official closed the bank because of its unsound condition, and appointed the FDIC as receiver.  The FDIC ultimately acquired petitioners' note, and was substituted as a plaintiff in this lawsuit.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the FDIC, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the word ""agreement"" in a provision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, 12 U.S.C.  1823(e), encompassed the kinds of material terms or warranties asserted by petitioners in their misrepresentation defense and, because  1823(e)'s requirements were not met, the defense was barred.  Section 1823(e) provides that no ""agreement"" tending to diminish or defeat the FDIC's ""right, title or interest"" in any asset acquired by the FDIC under the section shall be valid against the FDIC unless it shall have been (1) in writing, (2) executed contemporaneously with the bank's acquisition of the asset, (3) approved by the bank's board of directors or loan committee and reflected in the minutes of the board or committee, and (4) continuously, from the time of its execution, an official record of the bank.
Held:  A condition to payment of a note, including the truth of an express warranty, is part of the ""agreement"" to which the requirements of  1823(e) attach.  Because the representations alleged by petitioners 
Page 484 U. S. 87
 constituted such a condition and did not meet the statute's requirements, they cannot be asserted as a defense here.  Pp.  484 U. S. 90-96.
(a) The word ""agreement"" in  1823(e) is not limited to an express promise to perform an act in the future.  The essence of petitioners' defense is that the bank made certain warranties regarding the land, the truth of which was a condition to performance of their obligation to repay the loan.  As used in commercial and contract law, the term ""agreement"" often has a wider meaning than a promise, and embraces such a condition upon performance.  This common meaning of the word ""agreement"" must be assigned to its usage in  1823(e) if that section is to fulfill its intended purposes of allowing federal and state bank examiners to rely on a bank's records in evaluating the bank's assets, ensuring mature consideration of unusual loan transactions by senior bank officials, and preventing fraudulent insertion of new terms, with the collusion of bank employees, when a bank appears headed for failure.  Cf. D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U. S. 447.  Pp.  484 U. S. 90-93.
(b) There is no merit to petitioners' argument that, even if a misrepresentation concerning an existing fact can sometimes constitute an agreement covered by  1823(e), it at least does not do so when the misrepresentation was fraudulent and the FDIC had knowledge of the asserted defense when it acquired the note.  Neither fraud in the inducement nor the FDIC's knowledge thereof is relevant to the section's application.  No conceivable reading of the word ""agreement"" in  1823(e) could cause it to cover a representation or warranty that is bona fide, but to exclude one that is fraudulent.  The bank's alleged misrepresentations here did not constitute fraud in the factum, which would render the note void and take it out of  1823(e), but instead constituted only fraud in the inducement, which rendered the note voidable, but not void.  The bank therefore had and could transfer to the FDIC voidable title, which was enough to constitute ""title or interest"" in the note for the purpose of  1823(e).  Even if this Court had the power to engraft an equitable exception upon the statute's plain terms, the equities petitioners invoke are not the equities the statute regards as predominant.  Pp.  484 U. S. 93-96.
792 F.2d 541, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Winans was coauthor of a Wall Street Journal investment advice column which, because of its perceived quality and integrity, had an impact on the market prices of the stocks it discussed.  Although he was familiar with the Journal's rule that the column's contents were the Journal's confidential information prior to publication, Winans entered into a scheme with petitioner Felis and another stockbroker who, in exchange for advance information from Winans as to the timing and contents of the column, bought and sold stocks based on the column's probable impact on the market, and shared their profits with Winans.  On the basis of this scheme, Winans and Felis were convicted of violations of the federal securities laws and of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C.  1341, 1343, which prohibit the use of the mails or of electronic transmissions to execute ""any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises""; petitioner Carpenter was convicted of aiding and abetting.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Insofar as it affirmed petitioners' convictions under the securities laws, the judgment below is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  P.  484 U. S. 24.
2. Petitioners' conspiracy to trade on the Journal's confidential information is within the reach of the mail and wire fraud statutes.  Pp.  484 U. S. 25-28.
(a) The Journal had a ""property"" right in keeping confidential and making exclusive use, prior to publication, of the schedule and contents of Winans' columns, which right is protected by the statutes.  The intangible nature of the Journal's right cannot affect this determination, since McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, did not limit the scope of  1341 to the protection of tangible, as opposed to intangible, property rights, but merely distinguished protected property rights from unprotected intangible rights to honest and impartial government.  Pp.  484 U. S. 25-27.
(b) Petitioners' activities constituted a scheme to defraud the Journal within the meaning of the statutes.  It is irrelevant that petitioners might not have interfered with the Journal's use of its confidential information, publicized the information, deprived the Journal of the first public use of the information, or caused the Journal monetary loss, it 
Page 484 U. S. 20
 being sufficient that the Journal has been deprived of its important right to exclusive use of the information prior to disclosing it to the public.  The argument that Winans' conduct merely violated workplace rules, and did not amount to proscribed fraudulent activity, is untenable, since  1341 and 1343 reach any scheme to deprive .mother of property by means of fraud, including the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of property entrusted to one's care by another.  Here, Winans violated his fiduciary obligation to protect his employer's confidential information by exploiting that information for his personal benefit, all the while pretending to perform his duty of safeguarding it.  Furthermore, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that each of the petitioners acted with the required specific intent to defraud.  Pp.  484 U. S. 27-28.
(c) Petitioners' contention that the use of the wires and the mail to print and send the Journal to its customers is insufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement that the mails be used to execute the scheme at issue is rejected.  Circulation of the column to Journal customers was not only anticipated, but was an essential part of the scheme, since there would have been no effect on stock prices and no likelihood of profiting from the leaked information without such circulation.  P.  484 U. S. 28.

Section 6103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that tax returns and ""return information"" shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed except as authorized.  ""Return information"" is defined in  6103(b)(2) to include a taxpayer's identity, the nature, source, or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, overassessments, tax payments, or any other data with respect to a return or to the determination of the existence or amount of liability.  However,  6103(b)(2) also contains the proviso, known as the Haskell Amendment, that ""return information"" does not include data ""in a form"" which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.  Upon the Internal Revenue Service's slow response to petitioner's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the production of numerous records containing information relating to it, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court to compel release of the materials.  The court held that the IRS had correctly limited its search for and disclosure of the requested materials, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Haskell Amendment's ""in a form"" phrase contemplates agency reformulation of return information into a statistical study or some other composite product and not merely the deletion of the taxpayer's name and other identifying data.
Held:  The Haskell Amendment does not exempt from  6103(b)(2)'s definition of confidential ""return information"" material in IRS files which can be redacted to delete those parts which would identify a particular taxpayer.  If the mere removal of identifying details sufficed to put the information ""in a form"" envisioned by the Amendment, the remainder of the protected categories of information included in  6103(b)(2) would often be irrelevant, and the ""in a form"" phrase would itself be extremely awkward, confusing, and unnecessary.  Petitioner's contrary construction of the Amendment is likewise belied by other provisions of  6103 which set forth various exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality and recognize that ""return information"" remains such even when it does not identify a particular taxpayer.  Moreover, the legislative history also refutes petitioner's construction, since allowing the disclosure of 
Page 484 U. S. 10
 otherwise confidential return information merely by the redaction of identifying details would undercut  6103's primary purpose of limiting access to tax filings.  In fact, the Amendment was simply intended to permit continuation of the IRS' practice of releasing statistical studies and compilations that do not identify particular taxpayers.  Thus, since deletion of identifying data would not make otherwise protected return information discloseable, there is no merit to petitioner's contention that respondent has an FOIA duty to undertake such redaction.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 The issue here is whether a defendant's rights under the Due Process and Confrontation Clauses are violated when the Government forces a witness to take the stand solely to invoke his privilege against self- incrimination in front of the jury even though the Government already knew that the witness would refuse to testify. In this case, petitioner was convicted of mail fraud. At the trial, the Government called as a witness an unindicted co-conspirator who was alleged to have engaged in the same kind of conduct for which petitioner was indicted. The witness' attorney informed the prosecutor and the court that his client would invoke the privilege if he were called to testify, and the witness did invoke the privilege when he was called outside the presence of the jury. When the jury returned, the prosecution called the witness and he was permitted to testify after the trial court overruled petitioner's objection. Once again, after stating his name and place of residence, the witness invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify in response to five different questions. On appeal, a panel of the Sixth Circuit noted that this practice is "" 'so imbued with the ""potential for unfair prejudice"" that a trial judge should closely scrutinize any such request.'

Nonetheless, it held that the trial court did not commit reversible error when it permitted the witness to testify and gave a cautionary instruction to the jury not to consider the witness' actions as bearing on the guilt or innocence of any of the defendants. Ibid. The position of the Sixth Circuit, which is

 Petitioner James Williams was sentenced to death under a Texas capital punishment statute that requires the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, if permitted to live, would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. See Tex.Crim.Proc.Code.Ann., Art. 37.071(b)(2) (Vernon Supp. 1986-1987). To prove this circumstance, the State relied in large part on eyewitness testimony that petitioner had participated in a restaurant robbery 10 days before the murder. Petitioner never had been charged with, much less convicted of, this crime. The court did not caution the jury that it had to find petitioner had committed the crime by any particular standard of proof before considering the evidence in its calculation of future dangerousness. Indeed, the jury was encouraged not to do so by the State's attorney, who stated: 
 In his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner argued that Texas' sentencing scheme violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it permits the introduction of evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct at the sentencing hearing of a capital trial. Williams also contended, in the alternative, that Texas' sentencing scheme violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the State permits the introduction of unadjudicated offenses in capital-sentencing trials while forbidding the use of such evidence in noncapital-sentencing proceedings, see Jones v. State, 479 S.W. 2d 307 (Tex.Crim.App.1972). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected both claims. 814 F.2d 205 (1987). [484 U.S. 935 , 937]

|484 u.s. 3|"Commissioner v. McCoy
No. 87-75
Decided October 19, 1987
484 U.S. 3

Syllabus 
After the United States Tax Court sustained the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's determination that there was a deficiency in respondent's federal estate tax, respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals, but did not file the appeal bond required by the Internal Revenue Code to stay the assessment and collection of the deficiency.  The Commissioner therefore assessed the deficiency and issued a notice and demand for payment.  When the deficiency was not paid within 10 days, an addition to tax accrued under  6651(a)(3) of the Code.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed the Tax Court's decision that there was a deficiency.  Shortly thereafter, respondent paid the tax, but filed a petition with the Court of Appeals asking that the court ""forgive"" interest on the assessment and also the late payment penalty.  The court granted the requested relief ""in order to achieve a fair and just result.""
Held:  The Court of Appeals exceeded its jurisdictional authority when it granted the petition to forgive interest and the late payment penalty.  Section 7482(a) of the Code gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review Tax Court decisions ""in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury,"" while  7482(c)(1) provides that ""such courts shall have the power to affirm or . . . modify or . . . reverse"" the Tax Court's decision.  Thus, the Court of Appeals' only jurisdiction here was to review the Tax Court's decision that there was a deficiency and to affirm that decision upon determining that it was correct.  It was not empowered to decide other questions relating to interest and a penalty -- questions that were not presented to the Tax Court and that could not have been so presented under  6601(a) and 6651(a)(3) of the Code, which respectively make interest on a deficiency and accrued penalties separate and outside the scope of the petition to the Tax Court, and  6213(a), which indicates that the deficiency asserted here could be assessed only after the Tax Court had rendered its decision -- or to grant relief that the Tax Court itself, as a court of limited jurisdiction lacking general equitable powers, could not provide.
Certiorari granted; reversed.

 Linda S. MOOREv. GEORGIA.No. 86-6914 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 13, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 In Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 ( 1979), this Court held that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is constitutionally valid if the offender is not incarcerated. The following Term, however, in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U.S. 222, 64 L. Ed.2d 169 (1980) (per curiam ), this Court held that such a conviction may not be used under an enhanced penalty statute to convert a subsequent misdemeanor conviction into a felony with a prison term. 
 Here, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to a prison term under Ga.Code Ann. 40-6-391(C) (Supp.1987) which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on a person convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, where such person has at least two prior convictions for the same offense. Petitioner argued that Baldasar prohibited her conviction under 40-6-391( C), because this conviction relied upon her two prior, uncounseled convictions for driving under the influence. The Court of Appeals of Georgia 
Page 484 U.S. 904 , 905
 rejected this contention, and determined that Baldasar was inapplicable here because 40-6-391(C) merely imposes a minimum prison term based on petitioner's prior convictions, and does not ""increas[e] the maximum confinement authorized [or] conver[t] a misdemeanor offense into a felony ."" 181 Ga.App. 548, 549, 352 S.E.2d 821, 822 (1987) (emphasis added). 
 Possibly because this Court was sharply divided in Baldasar, with no opinion for reversal gaining more than three votes, courts attempting to apply that decision have come to different conclusions concerning its meaning. See Schindler v. Clerk of Circuit Court, 715 F.2d 341, 344 (CA7 1983) (""In light of . . . the failure of the Baldasar majority to agree upon a rationale for its result, the scope of the decision remains unclear "") cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1068 (1984). Some courts have applied Baldasar as the Georgia court did here, and have allowed the use of prior, uncounseled convictions in cases quite similar to this one. E.g., Commonwealth v. Thomas, 510 Pa. 106, 112-114, 507 A.2d 57, 60-61 (1986); State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 175-176 (N.D.1985). Others, however, have read Baldasar more broadly, and have disallowed the use of prior, uncounseled convictions in prosecutions akin to petitioner's . E.g., State v. Oehm, 9 Kan.App.2d 399, 401-403, 680 P.2d 309, 311-312 ( 1984); State v. Dowd, 478 A.2d 671, 677-678 (Me.1984). 
 Because the confusion over Baldasar's holding has led to uneven application of that case and conflicting decisions in the courts below, I would grant certiorari here to answer the outstanding questions concerning Baldasar's scope and proper application.

 Richard W. MOREY et ux. v. BARRINGTON PRESS, INC. No. 87-32 Supreme Court of the United States October 13, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. In White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U.S. 445, 451, 1166 (1982), we held that a claim "" for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action,"" and that such a request was not a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). In the years that have followed, we have not determined if White's holding applies only to fee requests under a separate statutory provision like 1988, or if it also renders ""collateral"" those fee requests made in cases where the fee award arises as an integral part of the underlying dispute between the parties. Consequently, several questions concerning the finality (and, as a result, the appealability) of judgments encompassing fee awards in cases of the latter type have been the subject of confusion in the Courts of Appeals. This case raises such a question. Here, respondent prevailed in its action seeking judgment on four promissory notes executed by petitioners. The District Court awarded respondent principal and interest "" plus reasonable attorney's fees incurred"" by respondent. App. to Pet. for Cert. D-7. The District Court did not fix an amount for the attorney's fees at that time. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment below; it mentioned, but did not specifically review, the District Court's award of attorney's fees. 752 F.2d 307, 308 (CA7 1985). On respondent's subsequent petition for fees, however, the District Court entertained petitioners' Illinois law challenge to the fee award, and determined that Illinois law prohibited a fee award in this case. 635 F.Supp. 1257 (ND Ill.1986). The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, finding that "" reservation of the determination of the amount of attorney's fees does not deprive the initial [district court] judgment of finality,"" and therefore the District Court could not reconsider respondent's entitlement to fees in its second decision. 816 F.2d 341, 342 (CA7 1987). The Courts of Appeals are sharply divided over the question presented here: whether an award of attorney's fees, when it arises out of a claimant's underlying cause of action, is final before that award is quantified. See Beckwith Machinery Co. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 
Page 484 U.S. 906 , 907
 815 F.2d 286, 288-289 (CA3 1987) (canvassing the Courts of Appeals decisions). Four Circuits have held that an attorney's fee award, when that award is not won in a collateral proceeding (such as a 1988 action), is not final until the amount of the award is quantified. Beckwith Machinery Co., supra, at 290; F.H. Krear & Co. v. Nineteen Named Trustees, 776 F.2d 1563, 1564 (CA2 1985); Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Auto Transportation, S.A., 763 F.2d 745, 751 (CA5 1985); Fort v. Roadway Express, Inc., 746 F.2d 744, 747 (CA11 1984). Two other Courts of Appeals have taken the approach applied by the Seventh Circuit here, according finality to all attorney's fees awards prior to their quantification. Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 807 F.2d 155, 157-158 (CA10 1986); Morgan v. Union Metal Mfg., 757 F.2d 792, 794-796 (CA6 1985). At least one other Court of Appeals has recognized the split, but has declined to take a position. Crossman v. Maccoccio, 792 F.2d 1, 3 (CA1 1986) (per curiam ). 
 Because the Courts of Appeals have divided in their attempt to apply the principles of our decision in White, I would grant certiorari in this case to resolve the conflict and answer the question presented here.

 815 F.2d 286, 288-289 (CA3 1987) (canvassing the Courts of Appeals decisions). Four Circuits have held that an attorney's fee award, when that award is not won in a collateral proceeding (such as a 1988 action), is not final until the amount of the award is quantified. Beckwith Machinery Co., supra, at 290; F.H. Krear & Co. v. Nineteen Named Trustees, 776 F.2d 1563, 1564 (CA2 1985); Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Auto Transportation, S.A., 763 F.2d 745, 751 (CA5 1985); Fort v. Roadway Express, Inc., 746 F.2d 744, 747 (CA11 1984). Two other Courts of Appeals have taken the approach applied by the Seventh Circuit here, according finality to all attorney's fees awards prior to their quantification. Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 807 F.2d 155, 157-158 (CA10 1986); Morgan v. Union Metal Mfg., 757 F.2d 792, 794-796 (CA6 1985). At least one other Court of Appeals has recognized the split, but has declined to take a position. Crossman v. Maccoccio, 792 F.2d 1, 3 (CA1 1986) (per curiam ). 
 Because the Courts of Appeals have divided in their attempt to apply the principles of our decision in White, I would grant certiorari in this case to resolve the conflict and answer the question presented here.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether under the Railway Labor Act an arbitrator exceeds the scope of his or her jurisdiction by awarding, without explicit authorization in the collective-bargaining agreement, pure penalty pay. See 45 U.S.C. 153, First (q). ""Pure penalty pay"" is a monetary penalty assessed for breach of the collective-bargaining agreement when there is no showing of compensatory loss from the breach. In the present case, the arbitrator found that petitioner violated the collective-bargaining agreement by contracting out work to nonunion members. The arbitrator also found that the named union employees failed to prove damages to support a compensatory award and that no provision of the agreement explicitly authorized the award of penalty pay but that penalty pay was supported by past practices in the railroad industry and of these parties. The District Court affirmed this award of pure penalty pay and the Fifth Circuit affirmed that decision in an unpublished memorandum. Judgt. order reported at 820 F.2d 1222 (1987). This case conflicts with Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline & Steamship Clerks, 657 F.2d 596 (CA4 1981), which held that pure penalty pay cannot be awarded, absent explicit contractual authorization. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Courts of Appeals over this important question of federal law, particularly since these rulings could easily result in the same collective-bargaining contract, or identical ones, being interpreted in different ways in different circuits.[ St. Louis Southwestern Railway v.

 Petitioner James Willie Brown has a 20-year history of severe mental illness. When he was arrested for murder in 1975, petitioner already had been institutionalized on three prior occasions. Over the next six years, petitioner was continually adjudged incompetent to stand trial. Petitioner spent most of that time institutionalized at Central State Hospital, where he was consistently diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. In 1977, the hospital reported that petitioner was competent to stand trial, but petitioner's mental condition deteriorated after he was transferred to the local jail and on the joint motion of the State and his counsel, he was recommitted to Central State as incompetent. Petitioner remained at Central State until 1980, when a hospital doctor again determined petitioner could stand trial. Although petitioner's doctors had noted his history of aggravated illness during periods of incarceration and had recommended that he be kept at the hospital until just before trial, petitioner was jailed until his competency trial in April 1981. During this time, a physician at the jail examined petitioner and once again found him incompetent; petitioner's counsel was never informed of this evaluation. 
 Petitioner filed a demand for speedy trial early in 1981, and a competency trial was scheduled before a special jury. The morning of trial, the court appointed Lewis Collins to evaluate petitioner's competency. Collins had received his Ph.D. from the Georgia State University only 10 days before. He was not a licensed psychologist, and in fact later failed the state licensing examination twice. He had received no formal training in conducting competency evaluations. Collins' entire evaluation of petitioner's competency consisted of one 20- minute interview. Collins did not talk to any of the doctors who previously had examined petitioner, he performed no psychological testing, and the only record he examined was a short discharge summary from Central State. From this meager examination, Collins concluded that petitioner was competent to stand trial. The jury agreed, and three months later petitioner was tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. 
 At the instant state habeas proceeding, a number of experts testified that Collins' qualifications and examination for competency were substandard. The trial court nevertheless determined without explanation that Collins ""was qualified by his education and experience to give an opinion as to the sanity of the Peti- [484 U.S. 874 , 876]

 Malcolm Rent JOHNSONv. OKLAHOMA.No. 86-7054 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 5, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would vacate the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant this petition for certiorari for two reasons. First, the trial court incorrectly decided an unsettled question of law concerning an accused's right to the assistance of experts in preparing his defense. Second, the trial court's instructions at the sentencing hearing, in combination with the prosecutor's closing argument, deprived petitioner of his right to have the sentencing jury consider all of the mitigating evidence he offered. [ Johnson v. Oklahoma 484 U.S. 878 (1987) ][878-Continued.] 
 I  
 Petitioner Malcolm Johnson was charged with the first-degree murder of Ura Thompson, an elderly woman who had been raped and suffocated in her apartment. Recognizing that the prosecution's case against petitioner rested largely on the opinion of a police chemist, who would testify that petitioner's hair, blood, semen, and clothing were consistent with physical evidence found in Thompson's apartment, petitioner's counsel requested the court prior to trial to appoint a chemist to aid in petitioner's defense. Counsel argued that a chemist was needed to challenge the police chemist's qualifications and testimony and to conduct an electrophoresis test, which even the prosecution conceded could show that petitioner was not the perpetrator of the crime. The trial court agreed with counsel that the appointment of a chemist was warranted, but denied the request on the ground that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals previously had rejected the view that criminal defendants were entitled to the assistance of such experts. Brief in Opposition 8. 
 At trial, the prosecution presented two kinds of evidence. First, the prosecution offered evidence showing that petitioner had in his possession at the time of his arrest several items missing from Thompson's apartment. Second, the prosecution pre- 
Page 484 U.S. 878 , 879
 sented the testimony of the police chemist. The prosecutor referred to the chemist's testimony as the ""real crux"" of the State's case against petitioner. Id., at 15. The jury convicted petitioner of first-degree murder. 
 During a separate sentencing proceeding, defense counsel offered mitigating evidence relating to petitioner's personal background. Witnesses testifying on behalf of petitioner stated, for example, that petitioner's father frequently had beaten petitioner and his mother, that petitioner's parents eventually had separated, that petitioner had grown up in poverty, and that petitioner as a youngster had suffered from a mysterious and debilitating illness requiring a long hospital stay. Immediately after defense counsel offered this evidence, the trial court instructed the jury. As part of the charge, the trial court stated: ""[Y] ou should not allow sympathy, sentiment or prejudice to affect you in reaching your decision. You should avoid any influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence."" Id., at 19. After the delivery of these instructions, the prosecutor gave his closing argument, in which he ridiculed the mitigating evidence that petitioner's counsel had offered. The prosecutor stated: 
 ""I've got great empathy for his folks. But so what? . . . [H] is parents divorced when he was young. Oh, wow. . . . That's a mitigating factor for violent conduct. That's bologna [sic]. . . . Deprivation builds character. We ought to have fewer silver spoons in the mouths of our children and a little more deprivation. He wants to use that as a mitigating circumstance. . . . I was offended by what happened in this courtroom when the little children were placed on the witness stand to try to generate sympathy for a cold- blooded killer. . . . So what if he was sick or retarded: What's that got to do with-we're dealing with what he is today. . . . Not whether he had a disease when he was a baby, not whether he was mildly retarded at some time in his life. Id., at 20-21. 
 At the close of the sentencing hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of death, and the court imposed that sentence.

We found Sixth Amendment violations in Henry and Maine, but not in Kuhlmann, relying on the slightly different factual circumstances of the cases.

 On May 2, 1983, 96-year-old Earl Baughman hired petitioner, 18-year- old Jeffrey Allen Muehleman, as a ""helper."" On May 4, petitioner took Baughman to the bank to cash his Social Security check.

 Andrew Weddington CRAIG and Francis Marion Anthonyv. NORTH CAROLINA.No. 86-7075 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 5, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of North Carolina, Cabarrus County. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant this petition for certiorari because the state courts failed to give proper consideration to a recantation by the prosecution's star witness that throws grave doubt on the propriety of sentencing petitioners to death. 
 I  
 A grand jury indicted petitioners Andrew Weddington Craig and Francis Marion Anthony in 1981 for the offenses of first-degree murder, common-law robbery, and robbery with a dangerous weapon. At trial, the prosecution attempted to prove that petitioners and Betty Jean Howie had robbed Seab and Edith Ritch and then had killed Edith Ritch by stabbing her repeatedly . Howie's testimony was the only evidence offered to show that petitioners had participated in the stabbing. Howie stated that she and petitioners had taken turns stabbing Edith Ritch with a pocketknife. This testimony was, at the very least, undermined 
Page 484 U.S. 887 , 888
 by medical testimony that the multiple stab wounds were ""very much uniform in depth, range, uniform in angle of penetration and probably uniform forcewise."" Pet. for Cert. 6. At the close of trial, petitioners were convicted of all charges and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed the convictions and sentences. 308 N.C. 446, 302 S.E.2d 740 (1983), Howie pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and received a sentence of life imprisonment. 
 A few months after the North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed petitioners' convictions and sentences, petitioner Anthony received an unsolicited letter from Howie stating that she wanted to ""g[o] back to court and tel[l] the truth"" about the case. Pet. for Cert. 7. Petitioners immediately filed a joint motion for appropriate relief, and the trial court held a hearing at which Howie testified. In her testimony, Howie stated that she alone had stabbed Edith Ritch, although petitioners had participated in the robbery and remained on the scene during the murder. Howie further testified that she was recanting her trial testimony over the objections of her family and her counsel, who had warned her that the recantation would expose her to further prosecution. Howie explained that ""I was trying to live with a lie and no one knows . . . what it has done to me, what it has taken me through."" Id., at 8. After listening to Howie's testimony, the trial court denied petitioners' motion for relief. In a cursory decision, the court first found that the recantation testimony was ""probably not true"" and ""in some instances [was] incredible."" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2. The court then stated that even if the recantation were true, it would not change the result of the prior proceedings because the recantation itself showed that petitioners had "" attempted to kill, or participated in the killing, or intended it, or contemplated that life may be taken in the commission of the felony robbery."" Id., at A-3. 
 II  
 The trial court's conclusion that Howie's recantation, if believed, would not change the result of the prior proceedings is insupportable under our case law. That conclusion rests on the view that a sentencer may permissibly impose the death sentence if the defendant ""contemplated that life may be taken in the commission"" of a felony. In Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987), however, this Court explicitly rejected such a view. We stated that the death penalty is supportable in felony-murder cases only upon a [484 U.S. 887 , 889]

No. 85-5
Argued March 3, 1986
Reargued October 15, 1986
Decided June 26, 1987
483 U.S. 711

Syllabus 
In 1977, the Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air (hereafter respondent) and the United States each filed suit to compel Pennsylvania to comply with certain provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act).  (See 478 U.S.  478 U. S. 546, an earlier decision in this case setting forth a detailed statement of the facts.)  A consent decree, approved by the Federal District Court in 1978, obligated Pennsylvania to establish a program for the inspection and maintenance of vehicle emissions systems in certain counties by August, 1980.  The State failed to do so, and protracted litigation ensued.  In 1983, the parties agreed to set June 1, 1984, as the date the state would commence the program.  Shortly after such agreement, respondent petitioned the District Court for attorney's fees and costs, pursuant to  304(d) of the Act, for the work performed after the issuance of the consent decree.  The court divided the work into phases and determined the lodestar amount for attorney's fees (the product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate) for each phase.  For certain phases, the court adjusted the figure upward by doubling the lodestar to reflect the risk presumably faced by respondent that it would not prevail on such phases of the litigation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's enhancement of the fee award.  The issue presented here is whether, under  304(d), when a plaintiff prevails, its attorney, under a contingent fee arrangement, should or may be awarded separate compensation for the risk of losing and not being paid.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
762 F.2d 272, reversed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTlCE SCALIA, concluded that  304(d) should be construed as not permitting enhancement of a reasonable lodestar fee to compensate for an attorney's assuming the risk of loss and of nonpayment, and that, even if  304(d) is construed to permit such enhancement in appropriate cases, it was error to do so in this case.  Pp.  483 U. S. 723-731.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that Congress did not intend to foreclose consideration of contingency in setting a reasonable fee under fee-shifting

 provisions such as  304(d), but that the District Court erred in employing a risk multiplier in the circumstances of this case.  Pp.  483 U. S. 731-734.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that Congress intended  304(d) to allow an upward adjustment, in appropriate circumstances, for a case taken on a contingent basis, and that the award in this case should be vacated and the case should be remanded to the District Court for further findings.

Decided June 26, 1987
483 U.S. 756

Syllabus 
Respondent and two other men (including Randy Williams) were charged with kidnaping, robbery, and murder.  Williams entered into a plea agreement and testified at respondent's separate Illinois Court trial that each of the men participated in the crime and that each shot the victim.  Respondent testified on direct examination that he had taken no part in the crime, but that the other men had come to him after the murder was committed, seeking his advice.  At the beginning of respondent's cross-examination, the prosecutor asked him:  ""Why didn't you tell this story to anybody when you got arrested?""  Defense counsel immediately objected and, out of the jury's hearing, requested a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor's question violated respondent s right to remain silent after arrest.  The judge denied the motion, but immediately sustained the objection and instructed the jury to ""ignore [the] question, for the time being.""  The prosecutor did not pursue the issue further, nor did he mention it during his closing argument.  The judge's instructions to the jury included a caution to ""disregard questions . . . to which objections were sustained.""  Respondent was convicted, but the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction.  The court rejected the state's argument that, if the prosecutor's question about respondent's post-arrest silence was prohibited by Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, the error was harmless under the standards of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18.  The Illinois Supreme Court reversed, holding that the prosecutor's improper question did not require reversal of the conviction under the circumstances of this case.  Respondent then sought habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, which denied the petition.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that, because respondent had received Miranda warnings at the time of his arrest, the prosecutor's question violated respondent's constitutional right to a fair trial.  The court further held that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman.
Held:  The prosecutor's question concerning respondent's post-arrest silence does not require reversal of the conviction.  Pp.  483 U. S. 761-767.
(a) No Doyle violation occurred in this case.  Doyle held that permitting the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant's silence at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, which contain 
Page 483 U. S. 757
 an implicit assurance that silence will carry no penalty, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Here, respondent received the ""implicit assurance"" of Miranda warnings.  However, the trial court did not permit the inquiry that Doyle forbids.  Instead, the court explicitly sustained an objection to the only question that touched upon respondent's post-arrest silence.  No further questioning or argument with respect to his silence occurred, and the court specifically advised the jury that it should disregard any questions to which an objection was sustained.  The prosecutor was not allowed to undertake impeachment on, or permitted to call attention to, respondent's silence.  Pp.  483 U. S. 761-765.
(b) The prosecutor's misconduct in attempting to violate the rule of Doyle did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.  The Illinois Supreme Court's finding, under Chapman, that the prosecutor's question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt indicates that it would find no due process violation under the facts here.  The sequence of events -- a single question, an immediate objection, and two curative instructions -- clearly indicates that the prosecutor's improper question did not violate respondent's due process rights.  Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court's determination that the properly admitted evidence was sufficient to prove respondent's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt further supports the conclusion that there was no due process violation.  Pp.  483 U. S. 765-767.
789 F.2d 438, reversed and remanded.

Held:  The prosecutor's question concerning respondent's post-arrest silence does not require reversal of the conviction.  Pp.  483 U. S. 761-767.
(a) No Doyle violation occurred in this case.  Doyle held that permitting the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant's silence at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, which contain 
Page 483 U. S. 757
 an implicit assurance that silence will carry no penalty, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Here, respondent received the ""implicit assurance"" of Miranda warnings.  However, the trial court did not permit the inquiry that Doyle forbids.  Instead, the court explicitly sustained an objection to the only question that touched upon respondent's post-arrest silence.  No further questioning or argument with respect to his silence occurred, and the court specifically advised the jury that it should disregard any questions to which an objection was sustained.  The prosecutor was not allowed to undertake impeachment on, or permitted to call attention to, respondent's silence.  Pp.  483 U. S. 761-765.
(b) The prosecutor's misconduct in attempting to violate the rule of Doyle did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.  The Illinois Supreme Court's finding, under Chapman, that the prosecutor's question was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt indicates that it would find no due process violation under the facts here.  The sequence of events -- a single question, an immediate objection, and two curative instructions -- clearly indicates that the prosecutor's improper question did not violate respondent's due process rights.  Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court's determination that the properly admitted evidence was sufficient to prove respondent's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt further supports the conclusion that there was no due process violation.  Pp.  483 U. S. 765-767.

Syllabus 
A Georgia trial court jury found petitioner guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.  Both petitioner and a coindictee (Thomas stevens) gave full confessions to the crime, and Stevens was tried later in a separate trial.  The Georgia Supreme Court, after ordering a second sentencing hearing for petitioner which resulted in reimposition of the death sentence, affirmed the sentence.  Throughout the state court proceedings, petitioner was represented by appointed counsel, Alvin Leaphart, who was an experienced and well respected local attorney.  After exhausting state collateral remedies, petitioner (represented by a different attorney) sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court on the ground that Leaphart's representation was constitutionally inadequate, particularly because of a conflict of interest, since Leaphart's law partner was appointed to represent Stevens at his trial, and Leaphart had assisted in that representation.  At each trial, the defendant's strategy was to emphasize the coindictee's culpability in order to avoid the death penalty.  Petitioner also based his Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective representation on Leaphart's failure to present any mitigating circumstances at the state court sentencing hearings and on his allegedly inadequate investigation of the possibility of doing so.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court rejected the Sixth Amendment claim, and the Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed.
Held:
1. There is no merit to petitioner's ineffective assistance claim based on Leaphart's alleged conflict of interest.  Even assuming that law partners are to be considered as one attorney in determining such a claim, requiring or permitting a single attorney to represent codefendants is not per se violative of constitutional guarantees of effective assistance of counsel.  Any overlap of counsel did not so infect Leaphart's representation as to constitute an active representation of competing interests.  Nor was an actual conflict established by the fact that Leaphart, who prepared the appellate briefs for both petitioner and Stevens, did not make a ""lesser culpability"" argument in petitioner's brief on his second appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.  That decision had a sound strategic basis and, as found by both the federal courts below, was not attributable to the fact that his partner was Stevens' lawyer, or to 
Page 483 U. S. 777
 the further fact that he assisted his partner in Stevens' representation.  Moreover, the record did not support petitioner's contention that, because of the asserted actual conflict of interest, Leaphart did not negotiate a plea bargain for a life sentence (the prosecutor, in fact, having refused to bargain) or to take advantage of petitioner's lesser culpability when compared to Stevens'.  Pp.  483 U. S. 783-788.
2. Nor did petitioner receive ineffective assistance because of Leaphart's failure to develop and present any mitigating evidence at either of the two state court sentencing hearings.  The evidence that might have been presented would have disclosed that petitioner had an exceptionally unhappy and unstable childhood.  Based on interviews with petitioner, his mother, and others, Leaphart decided that petitioner's interest would not be served by presenting such evidence.  His decision was supported by reasonable professional judgment, and thus met the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.  Pp.  483 U. S. 788-795.

483 U.S. 825

Syllabus 
The California Coastal Commission granted a permit to appellants to replace a small bungalow on their beachfront lot with a larger house upon the condition that they allow the public an easement to pass across their beach, which was located between two public beaches.  The County Superior Court granted appellants a writ of administrative mandamus and directed that the permit condition be struck.  However, the State Court of Appeal reversed, ruling that imposition of the condition did not violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as incorporated against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. Although the outright taking of an uncompensated, permanent, public access easement would violate the Takings Clause, conditioning appellants' rebuilding permit on their granting such an easement would be lawful land use regulation if it substantially furthered governmental purposes that would justify denial of the permit.  The government's power to forbid particular land uses in order to advance some legitimate police power purpose includes the power to condition such use upon some concession by the owner, even a concession of property rights, so long as the condition furthers the same governmental purpose advanced as justification for prohibiting the use.  Pp.  483 U. S. 831-837.
2. Here, the Commission's imposition of the access easement condition cannot be treated as an exercise of land use regulation power, since the condition does not serve public purposes related to the permit requirement.  Of those put forth to justify it -- protecting the public's ability to see the beach, assisting the public in overcoming a perceived ""psychological"" barrier to using the beach, and preventing beach congestion -- none is plausible.  Moreover, the Commission's justification for the access requirement unrelated to land use regulation -- that it is part of a comprehensive program to provide beach access arising from prior coastal permit decisions -- is simply an expression of the belief that the public interest will be served by a continuous strip of publicly accessible beach.  Although the State is free to advance its ""comprehensive program"" by exercising its eminent domain power and paying for access easements, it

 cannot compel coastal residents alone to contribute to the realization of that goal.  Pp.  483 U. S. 838-842.

Syllabus 
Wisconsin law places probationers in the legal custody of the State Department of Health and Social Services and renders them ""subject to . . . conditions set by the . . . rules and regulations established by the department.""  One such regulation permits any probation officer to search a probationer's home without a warrant as long as his supervisor approves and as long as there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the presence of contraband.  In determining whether ""reasonable grounds"" exist, an officer must consider a variety of factors, including information provided by an informant, the reliability and specificity of that information, the informant's reliability, the officer's experience with the probationer, and the need to verify compliance with the rules of probation and with the law.  Another regulation forbids a probationer to possess a firearm without a probation officer's advance approval.  Upon information received from a police detective that there were or might be guns in petitioner probationer's apartment, probation officers searched the apartment and found a handgun.  Petitioner was tried and convicted of the felony of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the state trial court having denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search after concluding that no warrant was necessary and that the search was reasonable.  The State Court of Appeals and the State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The warrantless search of petitioner's residence was ""reasonable"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because it was conducted pursuant to a regulation that is itself a reasonable response to the ""special needs"" of a probation system.  Pp.  483 U. S. 872-880.
(a) Supervision of probationers is a ""special need"" of the State that may justify departures from the usual warrant and probable cause requirements.  Supervision is necessary to ensure that probation restrictions are in fact observed, that the probation serves as a genuine rehabilitation period, and that the community is not harmed by the probationer's being at large.  Pp.  483 U. S. 873-875.
(b) The search regulation is valid because the ""special needs"" of Wisconsin's probation system make the warrant requirement impracticable and justify replacement of the probable cause standard with the regulation's ""reasonable grounds"" standard.  It is reasonable to dispense with the warrant requirement here, since such a requirement 
Page 483 U. S. 869
 would interfere to an appreciable degree with the probation system by setting up a magistrate, rather than the probation officer, as the determiner of how closely the probationer must be supervised, by making it more difficult for probation officials to respond quickly to evidence of misconduct, and by reducing the deterrent effect that the possibility of expeditious searches would otherwise create.  Moreover, unlike the police officer who conducts the ordinary search, the probation officer is required to have the probationer's welfare particularly in mind.  A probable cause requirement would unduly disrupt the probation system by reducing the deterrent effect of the supervisory arrangement and by lessening the range of information the probation officer could consider in deciding whether to search.  The probation agency must be able to act based upon a lesser degree of certainty in order to intervene before the probationer damages himself or society, and must be able to proceed on the basis of its entire experience with the probationer and to assess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of his life, character, and circumstances.  Thus, it is reasonable to permit information provided by a police officer, whether or not on the basis of firsthand knowledge, to support a probationary search.  All that is required is that the information provided indicates, as it did here, the likelihood of facts justifying the search.  Pp.  483 U. S. 875-880.
2. The conclusion that the regulation in question was constitutional makes it unnecessary to consider whether any search of a probationer's home is lawful when there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe contraband is present.   483 U. S.  880.

 William ""Billy"" MITCHELLv. Ralph KEMP, WardenNo. 85-5534 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 26, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), this Court held that the Sixth Amendment's promise of effective assistance of counsel is not breached unless the criminal defendant can show that his attorney's conduct fell beyond the bounds of professional competence and thereby prejudiced his defense. Id., at 687. Since Strickland was decided, the Court has never identified an instance of attorney dereliction that met its stringent standard. Most recently, this Court rejected a claim that inadequate investigation of mitigating circumstances constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in a capital case. See Burger v. Kemp, --- U.S . ___, 95 L.Ed.2d ___ (1987). Lest we permit the lower courts to conclude that the Sixth Amendment guarantees no more that that "" a person who happens to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused""-a notion expressly disavowed in Strickland, supra, 466 U.S., at 685-the Court should now give life to the Strickland standard. Accordingly, I would grant certiorari to consider the substantial allegation that counsel's performance, before the tribunal that sentenced petitioner to die, fell short of minimally effective representation. [ Mitchell v. Kemp 483 U.S. 1026 (1987) ][1026-Continued.] 
 I  
 On November 5, 1974, petitioner pleaded guilty to the murder of a 14- year-old boy in the course of a convenience-store robbery. At the sentencing proceeding conducted without a jury, the State called five witnesses and introduced documentary evidence in support of its contention that petitioner should receive the death penalty. Defense counsel called no witnesses and presented no mitigating evidence. The court sentenced petitioner to die. After affirmance of his conviction, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial. The District Court 
Page 483 U.S. 1026 , 1027
 concluded that the ""tactical decisions"" of petitioner's counsel were professionally reasonable. Mitchell v. Hopper, 564 F.Supp. 780, 786 (SD Ga.1983). The Court of Appeals, acknowledging that counsel's performance raised a ""difficult question,"" nevertheless affirmed on the ground that it was the result of strategic choices. 762 F.2d 886, 889-890 (CA11 1985). 
 The habeas corpus record before the District Court demonstrates that petitioner's appointed attorney made no attempt to interview any potential mitigating witnesses. Record, Vol. V, pp. 21-22. He spoke to no member of petitioner's family, with the exception of petitioner's father, with whom he spoke by telephone on two occasions. Counsel apparently initiated these contacts for the purpose of requesting that the family hire an attorney to relieve him of his obligation to represent petitioner. Id., at 23-23. Counsel made no inquiries into his client's academic, medical, or psychological history. 
 Nor did counsel pursue a vigorous defense with respect to the circumstances of the crime. He did not interview the police officer who witnessed petitioner's confession, which the state used to establish the existence of certain aggravating circumstances in support of the death sentence, even though petitioner had told him that the officer-the cousin of the victim-had held a gun to petitioner's head to extract the confession. Counsel's reason for not speaking to the officer was that, ""I personally don't like the man."" Record, Vol. VI, p. 35. Counsel did not interview the sole witness to the crime, who provided the key testimony for the prosecution at sentencing. Id., at 37. He filed no pretrial motions on petitioner's behalf. Id., at 45. 
 Counsel's failure to investigate mitigating circumstances left him ignorant of the abundant information that was available to an attorney exercising minimal diligence in fighting for Billy Mitchell's life. The affidavits of individuals who would have testified on petitioner's behalf fill 170 pages of the record in the District Court. Among these potential witnesses are family members, a city councilman, a former prosecutor, a professional football player, a bank vice-president, and several teachers, coaches, and friends. 
 Had defense counsel tapped these resources, he would have been able to present the sentencing judge with a picture of a youth who, despite growing up in ""the most poverty-stricken and crime-ridden section of Jacksonville, Florida,"" Record 989, had impressed his community as a person of exceptional character.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice BLACKMUN join, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), this Court held that the Sixth Amendment's promise of effective assistance of counsel is not breached unless the criminal defendant can show that his attorney's conduct fell beyond the bounds of professional competence and thereby prejudiced his defense. Id., at 687. Since Strickland was decided, the Court has never identified an instance of attorney dereliction that met its stringent standard. Most recently, this Court rejected a claim that inadequate investigation of mitigating circumstances constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in a capital case. See Burger v. Kemp, --- U.S . ___, 95 L.Ed.2d ___ (1987). Lest we permit the lower courts to conclude that the Sixth Amendment guarantees no more that that "" a person who happens to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused""-a notion expressly disavowed in Strickland, supra, 466 U.S., at 685-the Court should now give life to the Strickland standard. Accordingly, I would grant certiorari to consider the substantial allegation that counsel's performance, before the tribunal that sentenced petitioner to die, fell short of minimally effective representation. [ Mitchell v. Kemp 483 U.S. 1026 (1987) ][1026-Continued.] 
 I  
 On November 5, 1974, petitioner pleaded guilty to the murder of a 14- year-old boy in the course of a convenience-store robbery. At the sentencing proceeding conducted without a jury, the State called five witnesses and introduced documentary evidence in support of its contention that petitioner should receive the death penalty. Defense counsel called no witnesses and presented no mitigating evidence. The court sentenced petitioner to die. After affirmance of his conviction, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial. The District Court 
Page 483 U.S. 1026 , 1027
 concluded that the ""tactical decisions"" of petitioner's counsel were professionally reasonable. Mitchell v. Hopper, 564 F.Supp. 780, 786 (SD Ga.1983). The Court of Appeals, acknowledging that counsel's performance raised a ""difficult question,"" nevertheless affirmed on the ground that it was the result of strategic choices. 762 F.2d 886, 889-890 (CA11 1985). 
 The habeas corpus record before the District Court demonstrates that petitioner's appointed attorney made no attempt to interview any potential mitigating witnesses. Record, Vol. V, pp. 21-22. He spoke to no member of petitioner's family, with the exception of petitioner's father, with whom he spoke by telephone on two occasions. Counsel apparently initiated these contacts for the purpose of requesting that the family hire an attorney to relieve him of his obligation to represent petitioner. Id., at 23-23. Counsel made no inquiries into his client's academic, medical, or psychological history. 
 Nor did counsel pursue a vigorous defense with respect to the circumstances of the crime. He did not interview the police officer who witnessed petitioner's confession, which the state used to establish the existence of certain aggravating circumstances in support of the death sentence, even though petitioner had told him that the officer-the cousin of the victim-had held a gun to petitioner's head to extract the confession. Counsel's reason for not speaking to the officer was that, ""I personally don't like the man."" Record, Vol. VI, p. 35. Counsel did not interview the sole witness to the crime, who provided the key testimony for the prosecution at sentencing. Id., at 37. He filed no pretrial motions on petitioner's behalf. Id., at 45. 
 Counsel's failure to investigate mitigating circumstances left him ignorant of the abundant information that was available to an attorney exercising minimal diligence in fighting for Billy Mitchell's life. The affidavits of individuals who would have testified on petitioner's behalf fill 170 pages of the record in the District Court. Among these potential witnesses are family members, a city councilman, a former prosecutor, a professional football player, a bank vice-president, and several teachers, coaches, and friends. 
 Had defense counsel tapped these resources, he would have been able to present the sentencing judge with a picture of a youth who, despite growing up in ""the most poverty-stricken and crime-ridden section of Jacksonville, Florida,"" Record 989, had impressed his community as a person of exceptional character.

Argued February 24, 1987
Decided June 25, 1987
483 U.S. 435

Syllabus 
A general court-martial was convened under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (Code) in New York, where petitioner was serving in the Coast Guard, to try him for the sexual abuse of fellow coastguardsmen's minor daughters in his privately owned home in Alaska during a prior tour of duty.  The Code empowers courts-martial to try servicemen for such crimes.  However, the court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction under O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258, which held that a military tribunal may not try a serviceman charged with a crime that has no ""service connection,"" and Relford v. Commandant, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355, which enumerated numerous factors to be weighed in determining whether an offense is service-connected.  The Coast Guard Court of Military Review reversed the dismissal and reinstated the charges, and the Court of Military Appeals affirmed, concluding that the Alaska offenses were service-connected within the meaning of O'Callahan and Relford.
Held:  The jurisdiction of a court-martial depends solely on the accused's status as a member of the Armed Forces, and not on the ""service-connection"" of the offense charged.  Thus, O'Callahan is overruled.  The plain meaning of Art. I,  8, cl. 14, of the Constitution -- which grants Congress plenary power ""[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces"" -- supports the military status test, as was held in numerous decisions of this Court prior to O'Callahan. O'Callahan's service-connection test is predicated on the Court's less-than-accurate reading of the history of court-martial jurisdiction in England and in this country during the 17th and 18th centuries, which history is far too ambiguous to justify the restriction on Clause 14's plain language which the Court imported to it.  Clause 14 answers concerns about the general use of military courts for the trial of ordinary crimes by vesting in Congress, rather than the Executive, authority to make rules for military governance.  The Clause grants Congress primary responsibility for balancing the rights of servicemen against the needs of the military, and Congress' implementation of that responsibility is entitled to judicial deference.  That civil courts are ""ill-equipped"" to establish policies regarding matters of military concern is substantiated

Decided June 25, 1987
483 U.S. 468

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an employee of the Texas Highways Department, was injured while working on a ferry dock operated by the Department.  She filed suit against the Department and the State under  33 of the Jones Act, which provides that any seaman injured in the course of his employment may maintain an action for damages at law in federal district court, and which, in effect, applies the remedial provisions of the Federal Employer's Liability Act (FELA) to such suits.  The District Court dismissed the action as barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Although recognizing that Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, held that an employee of a state-operated railroad may bring an FELA action in federal court, the Court of Appeals held that the decision was inapplicable in light of Congress' failure to include in the Jones Act an unmistakably clear expression of its intention to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.  The court also held that Texas had not consented to being sued under the Jones Act.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
780 F.2d 1268, affirmed.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that the Eleventh Amendment bars a state employee from suing the State in federal court under the Jones Act.  Pp.  483 U. S. 472-495.
(a) Even though the express terms of the Eleventh Amendment's prohibition are limited to federal court suits ""in law or equity"" against a State by citizens of another State or a foreign country, the Amendment bars a citizen from suing his own State, Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, and prohibits admiralty suits against a State, Ex parte New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490, unless the State expressly waives its immunity and consents to suit in federal court.  Moreover, assuming that Congress can abrogate the Eleventh Amendment when it acts pursuant to the Commerce Clause, it must express its intent to do so in unmistakable language in the statute itself.  Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234.  Pp.  483 U. S. 472-474. 
Page 483 U. S. 469

(b) Congress has not expressed in unmistakable statutory language its intention to allow States to be sued in federal court under the Jones Act.  Although the Act extends to ""[a]ny"" injured seaman, this general authorization for federal court suits is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language that is sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment, which marks a constitutional distinction between the States and other employers of seamen.  Moreover, since both lower courts rejected petitioner's contention that Texas waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity, and since the petition for certiorari does not address this issue, it need not be considered here.  Pp.  483 U. S. 474-476.
(c) To the extent that Parden is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language, it is overruled.  Pp.  483 U. S. 476-478.
(d) Hans, which firmly established that the Eleventh Amendment embodies a broad constitutional principle of sovereign immunity, and the long line of subsequent cases that reaffirmed that principle, will not be overruled in the absence of ""special justification"" for such a departure from the doctrine of stare decisis.  The argument that the Amendment does not bar citizens' federal question actions against the States in federal court is not persuasive for several reasons.  The historical records show that, at most, the intentions of the Constitution's Framers and Ratifiers were ambiguous on the subject.  Moreover, since federal question actions unquestionably are ""suits in law or equity,"" the plain language of the Amendment refutes the argument.  Nor does the argument offer any satisfactory explanation for the overwhelming rejection of another amendment that would have allowed citizen suits against States for causes of action arising under treaties.  The principle of sovereign immunity has been deeply embedded in our federal system since its inception, and is required because of the sensitive problems inherent in making one sovereign appear against its will in the courts of another.  That States may not be sued absent waiver or congressional enactment is a necessary consequence of their role in a system of dual sovereignties.  Pp.  483 U. S. 478-488.
(e) The argument that the sovereign immunity doctrine has no application to citizens' admiralty suits against unconsenting States in federal courts is directly contrary to long-settled authority, including Ex parte New York, No. 1.  The suggestion that the latter case overruled settled law allowing such suits is not supported by the earlier cases cited, which, on balance, indicate that unconsenting States were immune from admiralty suits, and, at the very least, demonstrate that the question was not ""settled.""  Pp.  483 U. S. 488-493. 
Page 483 U. S. 470

JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that, regardless of the correctness of Hans as an original matter, Congress enacted the Jones Act and the FELA provisions which it incorporates on the assumption that, as Hans appears to have held, Article III of the Constitution contains an implicit limitation on suits brought by individuals against States.  The statutes cannot now be read to apply to States as though that assumption never existed.  Thus, Parden is properly overruled.  Pp.  483 U. S. 495-496.

United States Olympic Committee
No. 86-270
Argued March 24, 1987

483 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
Section 110 of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (Act) grants respondent United States Olympic Committee (USOC) the right to prohibit certain commercial and promotional uses of the word ""Olympic"" and various Olympic symbols.  Petitioner San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. (SFAA), a nonprofit California corporation, promoted the ""Gay Olympic Games,"" to be held in 1982, by using those words on its letterheads and mailings, in local newspapers, and on various merchandise sold to cover the costs of the planned Games.  The USOC informed the SFAA of the existence of the Act and requested that it terminate use of the word ""Olympic"" in its description of the planned Games.  When the SFAA failed to do so, the USOC brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive relief.  The court granted the USOC summary judgment and a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Act granted the USOC exclusive use of the word ""Olympic"" without requiring the USOC to prove that the unauthorized use was confusing and without regard to the defenses available to an entity sued for a trademark violation under the Lanham Act.  The court also found that the USOC's property right in the word and its associated symbols and slogans can be protected without violating the First Amendment.  The court did not reach the SFAA's claim that the USOC's enforcement of its rights was discriminatory in violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it held that the USOC is not a governmental actor to which the Constitution applies.
Held:
1. There is no merit to the SFAA's contention that  110 grants the USOC nothing more than a trademark in the word ""Olympic,"" and precludes its use by others only when it tends to cause confusion.  Nor is there any merit to the argument that  110's reference to Lanham Act remedies should be read as incorporating traditional defenses as well.  Section 110's language and legislative history indicate that Congress intended to grant the USOC exclusive use of the word ""Olympic"" without regard to whether use of the word tends to cause confusion, and that  110 does not incorporate defenses available under the Lanham Act.  Pp.  483 U. S. 528-530 
Page 483 U. S. 523

2. Also without merit is the SFAA's argument that the word ""Olympic"" is a generic word that constitutionally cannot gain trademark protection under the Lanham Act, and that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from granting a trademark in the word.  When a word acquires value as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money by an entity, that entity constitutionally may obtain a limited property right in the word.  Congress reasonably could conclude that the commercial and promotional value of the word ""Olympic"" was the product of the USOC's talents and energy, the end result of much time, effort, and expense.  In view of the history of the origins and associations of the word ""Olympic,"" Congress' decision to grant the USOC a limited property right in the word falls within the scope of trademark law protections, and thus within constitutional bounds.  Pp.  483 U. S. 532-535.
3. The First Amendment does not prohibit Congress from granting exclusive use of a word without requiring that the authorized user prove that an unauthorized use is likely to cause confusion.  The SFAA claims that its use of the word ""Olympic"" was intended to convey a political statement about the status of homosexuals in society, and that  110 may not suppress such speech.  However, by prohibiting the use of one word for particular purposes, neither Congress nor the USOC has prohibited the SFAA from conveying its message.  Section 110's restrictions on expressive speech are properly characterized as incidental to the primary congressional purpose of encouraging and rewarding the USOC's activities.  Congress has a broad public interest in promoting, through the USOC's activities, the participation of amateur athletes from the United States in the Olympic Games.  Even though  110's protection may exceed traditional rights of a trademark owner in certain circumstances, the Act's application to commercial speech is not broader than necessary to protect the legitimate congressional interests, and therefore does not violate the First Amendment.  Congress reasonably could find that the use of the word by other entities to promote an athletic event would directly impinge on the USOC's legitimate right of exclusive use.  The mere fact that the SFAA claims an expressive, as opposed to a purely commercial, purpose does not give it a First Amendment right to appropriate the value which the USOC's efforts have given to the word.  Pp.  483 U. S. 535-541.
4. The SFAA's claim that the USOC has enforced its  110 rights in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Fifth Amendment fails, because the USOC is not a governmental actor to whom the Fifth Amendment applies.  The fact that Congress granted it a corporate charter does not render the USOC a Government agent.  Moreover, Congress' intent to help the USOC obtain funding does not change the analysis.  Nor does the USOC perform functions that are traditionally the exclusive 
Page 483 U. S. 524
 prerogative of the Federal Government.  The USOC's choice of how to enforce its exclusive right to use the word ""Olympic"" simply is not a governmental decision.  Pp.  483 U. S. 542-547.

Nor is there any merit to the argument that  110's reference to Lanham Act remedies should be read as incorporating traditional defenses as well.  Section 110's language and legislative history indicate that Congress intended to grant the USOC exclusive use of the word ""Olympic"" without regard to whether use of the word tends to cause confusion, and that  110 does not incorporate defenses available under the Lanham Act.  Pp.  483 U. S. 528-530 
Page 483 U. S. 523

2. Also without merit is the SFAA's argument that the word ""Olympic"" is a generic word that constitutionally cannot gain trademark protection under the Lanham Act, and that the First Amendment prohibits Congress from granting a trademark in the word.  When a word acquires value as the result of organization and the expenditure of labor, skill, and money by an entity, that entity constitutionally may obtain a limited property right in the word.  Congress reasonably could conclude that the commercial and promotional value of the word ""Olympic"" was the product of the USOC's talents and energy, the end result of much time, effort, and expense.  In view of the history of the origins and associations of the word ""Olympic,"" Congress' decision to grant the USOC a limited property right in the word falls within the scope of trademark law protections, and thus within constitutional bounds.  Pp.  483 U. S. 532-535.
3. The First Amendment does not prohibit Congress from granting exclusive use of a word without requiring that the authorized user prove that an unauthorized use is likely to cause confusion.  The SFAA claims that its use of the word ""Olympic"" was intended to convey a political statement about the status of homosexuals in society, and that  110 may not suppress such speech.  However, by prohibiting the use of one word for particular purposes, neither Congress nor the USOC has prohibited the SFAA from conveying its message.  Section 110's restrictions on expressive speech are properly characterized as incidental to the primary congressional purpose of encouraging and rewarding the USOC's activities.  Congress has a broad public interest in promoting, through the USOC's activities, the participation of amateur athletes from the United States in the Olympic Games.  Even though  110's protection may exceed traditional rights of a trademark owner in certain circumstances, the Act's application to commercial speech is not broader than necessary to protect the legitimate congressional interests, and therefore does not violate the First Amendment.  Congress reasonably could find that the use of the word by other entities to promote an athletic event would directly impinge on the USOC's legitimate right of exclusive use.  The mere fact that the SFAA claims an expressive, as opposed to a purely commercial, purpose does not give it a First Amendment right to appropriate the value which the USOC's efforts have given to the word.  Pp.  483 U. S. 535-541.
4. The SFAA's claim that the USOC has enforced its  110 rights in a discriminatory manner in violation of the Fifth Amendment fails, because the USOC is not a governmental actor to whom the Fifth Amendment applies.  The fact that Congress granted it a corporate charter does not render the USOC a Government agent.  Moreover, Congress' intent to help the USOC obtain funding does not change the analysis.  Nor does the USOC perform functions that are traditionally the exclusive 
Page 483 U. S. 524
 prerogative of the Federal Government.  The USOC's choice of how to enforce its exclusive right to use the word ""Olympic"" simply is not a governmental decision.  Pp.  483 U. S. 542-547.

Syllabus 
Appellee, an unmarried mother, filed a child support suit in a Pennsylvania court against appellant, alleging that he was the child's father.  The judge denied appellant's pretrial motion seeking a ruling that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated by a state statute providing that the burden of proving paternity ""shall be by a preponderance of the evidence,"" and requesting a jury instruction that paternity must be established by clear and convincing evidence.  Applying the preponderance standard, the jury found that appellant was the father, but the judge later reconsidered his ruling on the burden of proof issue and granted appellant's motion for a new trial.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the statute was constitutional, and reinstated the jury's verdict.
Held:  Pennsylvania's preponderance standard for determining paternity is constitutionally permissible.  The preponderance standard is applied most frequently in litigation between private parties in every State and, more specifically, is the standard that is applied in paternity litigation in the majority of American jurisdictions that regard such proceedings as civil in nature (as does Pennsylvania).  Such a legislative judgment is entitled to a powerful presumption of validity when challenged under the Due Process Clause.  This case is not controlled by the holding in Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745, that the Constitution requires clear and convincing evidence before a State may terminate the parental relationship.  Appellant's contention to the contrary rests on the erroneous tacit assumption of an equivalence between the State's imposition of the legal obligations accompanying a biological relationship between parent and child and the State's termination of a fully existing parent-child relationship.  The collective judgment of the many state legislatures that adhere to a preponderance standard for paternity proceedings rests on legitimate and significant distinctions between termination and paternity proceedings.

Syllabus 
In 1975, federal statutes governing the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program required, as a condition of eligibility, that applicants for assistance assign to the State any right to receive child support payments for any family member included in the family unit, but a recipient of aid (the amount of which is determined by the number and income of persons in the family unit) could exclude a child for whom support payments were being made from the family unit if it was financially advantageous to do so, even though the child continued to live with the family.  The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) amended the AFDC program to require families to include in the filing unit all children living in the same home, including those for whom support payments were being received.  Under a separate amendment, the first $50 per month of child support collected by the State must be remitted to the family and not counted as income in determining its benefit level.  Thus, if the assigned support exceeded $50 plus the difference in the benefit level resulting from adding the child to the family unit, the family would suffer financially as compared with its total income prior to the amendment.  In a class action, the Federal District Court held that North Carolina's implementing regulations were in conformance with the statute, but that the 1984 statutory scheme violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and its equal protection component, as well as the Takings Clause of that Amendment.
Held:
1. The statutory scheme does not violate Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection principles.  The DEFRA amendment rationally serves both Congress' goal of decreasing federal expenditures, and the Government's separate interest in distributing benefits among competing needy families in a fair way.  It was also rational for Congress to adjust the AFDC program to reflect the fact that support money generally provides significant benefits for entire family units.  There is no 
Page 483 U. S. 588
 merit to the view that some form of ""heightened scrutiny"" must be applied because the amendment interferes with a family's fundamental right to live in the type of family unit it chooses by intruding on choices concerning family living arrangements.  The appropriate standard of review here is whether Congress had a ""rational basis"" for its decision.  Cf. Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U. S. 635.  Pp.  483 U. S. 598-603.
2. The DEFRA amendment does not violate the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause.  The family members other than the supported child have no claim, since they have no protected property rights to continued AFDC benefits at the same level as before the amendment.  Nor does the simple inclusion of the support income in the benefit calculation have any legal effect on the supported child's right to have it used for his or her benefit.  The argument that the requirement that an AFDC applicant must assign the support payments to the State, which then, in effect, remits the amount collected to the custodial parent as part of the AFDC payment to be used for the benefit of the entire family, modifies the child's interest in the use of the money so dramatically that it constitutes a taking of the child's property is refuted by three pertinent factors.  First, there is no such substantial ""economic impact"" on the child's right to have support funds used for his or her exclusive benefit as to constitute a ""taking.""  Second, the child holds no vested protectable expectation that the parent will continue to receive identical support payments on the child's behalf, and that the child will enjoy the same rights with respect to them.  Third, the character of the governmental action militates against a finding that the State or Federal Governments unconstitutionally take property through the AFDC program.  Pp.  483 U. S. 603-609.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, participated with other law enforcement officers in a warrantless search of respondents' home.  The search was conducted because petitioner believed that one Dixon, who was suspected of a bank robbery committed earlier that day, might be found there, but he was not.  Respondents filed a state court action against petitioner, asserting a claim for damages under the Fourth Amendment.  Petitioner removed the suit to Federal District Court and then filed a motion for dismissal or summary judgment, arguing that the Fourth Amendment claim was barred by his qualified immunity from civil damages liability.  Before any discovery occurred, the court granted summary judgment on the ground that the search was lawful.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the search's lawfulness could not be determined on summary judgment, because factual disputes precluded deciding as a matter of law that the search was supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances.  The court also held that petitioner was not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, since the right he allegedly violated -- the right of persons to be protected from warrantless searches of their homes unless the searching officers have probable cause and there are exigent circumstances -- was clearly established.
Held:
1. Petitioner is entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds if he can establish as a matter of law that a reasonable officer could have believed that the search comported with the Fourth Amendment, even though it actually did not.  Whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the ""objective legal reasonableness"" of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were ""clearly established"" at the time the action was taken.  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800.  In order to conclude that the right which the official allegedly violated is ""clearly established,"" the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  The Court of Appeals -- which apparently considered only the fact that the right to be free from warrantless searches of one's home unless the searching officers have probable cause 
Page 483 U. S. 636
 and there are exigent circumstances was clearly established -- erred by refusing to consider the argument that it was not clearly established that the circumstances with which petitioner was confronted did not constitute probable cause and exigent circumstances.  The relevant question here is the objective question whether a reasonable officer could have believed petitioner's warrantless search to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the searching officers possessed.  Petitioner's subjective beliefs about the search are irrelevant.  Pp.  483 U. S. 638-641.
2. There is no merit to respondents' argument that it is inappropriate to give officials alleged to have violated the Fourth Amendment -- and thus necessarily to have unreasonably searched or seized -- the protection of a qualified immunity intended only to protect reasonable official action.  Such argument is foreclosed by the fact that this Court has previously extended qualified immunity to officials who were alleged to have violated the Fourth Amendment.  Also without merit is respondents' suggestion that Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, be overruled by holding that qualified immunity may never be extended to officials who conduct unlawful warrantless searches.  Nor is there any merit to respondents' contention that no immunity should be provided to police officers who conduct unlawful warrantless searches of innocent third parties' homes in search of fugitives.

483 U.S. 669

Syllabus 
Respondent, a serviceman, volunteered for what was ostensibly a chemical warfare testing program, but in which he was secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) pursuant to an Army plan to test the effects of the drug on human subjects, whereby he suffered severe personality changes that led to his discharge and the dissolution of his marriage.  Upon being informed by the Army that he had been given LSD, respondent filed a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by the doctrine of Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, which precludes governmental FTCA liability for injuries to servicemen resulting from activity ""incident to service.""  Although agreeing with this holding, the Court of Appeals remanded the case upon concluding that respondent had at least a colorable constitutional claim under the doctrine of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, whereby a violation of constitutional rights can give rise to a damages action against the offending federal officials even in the absence of a statute authorizing such relief, unless there are ""special factors counseling hesitation"" or an ""explicit congressional declaration"" of another, exclusive remedy.  Respondent then amended his complaint to add Bivens claims and attempted to resurrect his FTCA claim.  Although dismissing the latter claim, the District Court refused to dismiss the Bivens claims, rejecting, inter alia, the Government's argument that the same considerations giving rise to the Feres doctrine should constitute ""special factors"" barring a Bivens action.  Although it then vacated the portion of its order ruling on the Bivens claims, the court subsequently reaffirmed its Bivens decision as to the individual federal employee defendants, ruling that Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, despite its broadly stated holding that servicemen may not maintain damages actions against superior officers for alleged constitutional violations, only bars Bivens actions when the claimed wrongs involve direct orders in the performance of military duty and the discipline and order necessary thereto, factors that were not involved here.  The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1292(b), and the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling on respondent's Bivens claims.  Although the issue had not been addressed in the District Court's order, 
Page 483 U. S. 670
 the Court of Appeals also ruled that recent precedent indicated that respondent might now have a viable FTCA claim, and therefore remanded.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' reinstatement of respondent's FTCA claim was in error, since  1292(b) authorizes an appeal only from the order certified by the District Court, and not from any other orders that may have been entered in the case.  The Court of Appeals' jurisdiction was therefore limited to the order refusing to dismiss respondent's Bivens claim.  The court's action was particularly erroneous, since the United States was not even a party to the appeal, the District Court having previously dismissed respondent's Bivens claim against the Government.  Pp.  483 U. S. 676-678.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that respondent can proceed with his Bivens claims notwithstanding Chappell.  Respondent's argument that there is no evidence that his injury was ""incident to service"" is unavailable to him, since the issue of service incidence was decided adversely to him by the Court of Appeals' original Feres ruling.  The argument that the chain-of-command concerns allegedly at the heart of Chappell are not implicated here, since the defendants were not respondent's superior officers, is also unavailing, because the argument ignores Chappell's plain statement that its Bivens analysis was guided by Feres.  Thus, a Bivens action should be disallowed whenever the serviceman's injury arises out of activity ""incident to service.""  As in Chappell, the ""special factors"" that counsel against a Bivens action in these circumstances are the constitutional authorization for Congress, rather than the judiciary, to make rules governing the military, the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment, Congress' establishment of a comprehensive internal system of military justice, and the greater degree of disruption respondent's chain-of-command rule would have on the military than does the ""incident to service"" test.  It is irrelevant to a ""special factors"" analysis whether current laws afford servicemen an ""adequate"" federal remedy for their injuries.  Similarly irrelevant is Chappell's statement that the Court was not there holding that military personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service, since that statement referred to traditional forms of relief designed to halt or prevent constitutional violations, rather than to the award of money damages, a new kind of cause of action.

Argued April 21, 1987
Decided June 25, 1987
483 U.S. 669

Syllabus 
Respondent, a serviceman, volunteered for what was ostensibly a chemical warfare testing program, but in which he was secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) pursuant to an Army plan to test the effects of the drug on human subjects, whereby he suffered severe personality changes that led to his discharge and the dissolution of his marriage.  Upon being informed by the Army that he had been given LSD, respondent filed a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) suit.  The District Court granted the Government summary judgment on the ground that the suit was barred by the doctrine of Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, which precludes governmental FTCA liability for injuries to servicemen resulting from activity ""incident to service.""  Although agreeing with this holding, the Court of Appeals remanded the case upon concluding that respondent had at least a colorable constitutional claim under the doctrine of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, whereby a violation of constitutional rights can give rise to a damages action against the offending federal officials even in the absence of a statute authorizing such relief, unless there are ""special factors counseling hesitation"" or an ""explicit congressional declaration"" of another, exclusive remedy.  Respondent then amended his complaint to add Bivens claims and attempted to resurrect his FTCA claim.  Although dismissing the latter claim, the District Court refused to dismiss the Bivens claims, rejecting, inter alia, the Government's argument that the same considerations giving rise to the Feres doctrine should constitute ""special factors"" barring a Bivens action.  Although it then vacated the portion of its order ruling on the Bivens claims, the court subsequently reaffirmed its Bivens decision as to the individual federal employee defendants, ruling that Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, despite its broadly stated holding that servicemen may not maintain damages actions against superior officers for alleged constitutional violations, only bars Bivens actions when the claimed wrongs involve direct orders in the performance of military duty and the discipline and order necessary thereto, factors that were not involved here.  The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C.  1292(b), and the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling on respondent's Bivens claims.  Although the issue had not been addressed in the District Court's order, 
Page 483 U. S. 670
 the Court of Appeals also ruled that recent precedent indicated that respondent might now have a viable FTCA claim, and therefore remanded.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' reinstatement of respondent's FTCA claim was in error, since  1292(b) authorizes an appeal only from the order certified by the District Court, and not from any other orders that may have been entered in the case.  The Court of Appeals' jurisdiction was therefore limited to the order refusing to dismiss respondent's Bivens claim.  The court's action was particularly erroneous, since the United States was not even a party to the appeal, the District Court having previously dismissed respondent's Bivens claim against the Government.  Pp.  483 U. S. 676-678.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that respondent can proceed with his Bivens claims notwithstanding Chappell.  Respondent's argument that there is no evidence that his injury was ""incident to service"" is unavailable to him, since the issue of service incidence was decided adversely to him by the Court of Appeals' original Feres ruling.  The argument that the chain-of-command concerns allegedly at the heart of Chappell are not implicated here, since the defendants were not respondent's superior officers, is also unavailing, because the argument ignores Chappell's plain statement that its Bivens analysis was guided by Feres.  Thus, a Bivens action should be disallowed whenever the serviceman's injury arises out of activity ""incident to service.""  As in Chappell, the ""special factors"" that counsel against a Bivens action in these circumstances are the constitutional authorization for Congress, rather than the judiciary, to make rules governing the military, the unique disciplinary structure of the Military Establishment, Congress' establishment of a comprehensive internal system of military justice, and the greater degree of disruption respondent's chain-of-command rule would have on the military than does the ""incident to service"" test.  It is irrelevant to a ""special factors"" analysis whether current laws afford servicemen an ""adequate"" federal remedy for their injuries.  Similarly irrelevant is Chappell's statement that the Court was not there holding that military personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service, since that statement referred to traditional forms of relief designed to halt or prevent constitutional violations, rather than to the award of money damages, a new kind of cause of action.

Syllabus 
Appellee Mayson, who had been employed at a nonprofit facility, open to the public, that was run by religious entities associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church), was discharged because he failed to qualify for a certificate that he was a member of the Church and eligible to attend its temples.  He, with other individuals purporting to represent a class, brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging religious discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that they were shielded from liability under  702 of the Act, which exempts religious organizations from Title VII's prohibition of religious discrimination in employment.  The plaintiffs contended that, if  702 was construed to allow religious employers to discriminate on religious grounds in hiring for nonreligious jobs, it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  Finding that Mayson's case involved nonreligious activities, the court held that, under the test set out in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  702 was unconstitutional as applied to secular activity because it had the primary effect of advancing religion.
Held:  Applying  702's exemption to religious organizations' secular activities does not violate the Establishment Clause.  There is ample room under that Clause for benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.  Section 702's exemption satisfies the first requirement of the three-part Lemon test that the challenged law serve a ""secular legislative purpose.""  This requirement is aimed at preventing the relevant governmental decisionmaker from abandoning neutrality and acting with the intent of promoting a particular point of view in religious matters.  It is a permissible legislative purpose (as here) to alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions.  Section 702 also satisfies Lemon's 
Page 483 U. S. 328
 second requirement that the challenged law have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion.  A law is not unconstitutional simply because it allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose.  For a law to have forbidden ""effects,"" the Government itself must have advanced religion through its own activities and influence.  The District Court's reliance on the facts that  702 singles out religious entities for a benefit, and is unsupported by long historical tradition, is unpersuasive.  Moreover, there is no merit to the contention that  702 offends equal protection principles by giving less protection to religious employers' employees than to secular employers' employees, and thus must be strictly scrutinized.  Where, as here, a statute does not discriminate among religions and, instead, is neutral on its face and motivated by a permissible purpose of limiting governmental interference with the exercise of religion, the proper inquiry is whether Congress has chosen a rational classification to further a legitimate end.  As applied to nonprofit activities of religious employers,  702 is rationally related to the legitimate purpose of alleviating significant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religious missions.  The third part of the Lemon test is also satisfied, since  702 does not impermissibly entangle church and state.  Rather, it effects a more complete separation of the two.  Pp.  483 U. S. 334-340.

Syllabus 
The federal mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.  1341, prohibits the use of the mails to execute
""any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.""
Petitioners Gray, a former Kentucky official, and McNally, a private individual, along with one Howard Hunt, the former chairman of the Commonwealth's Democratic Party, were charged with violating  1341 by devising a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth's citizens and government of their ""intangible right"" to have the Commonwealth's affairs conducted honestly, and to obtain money by means of false pretenses and the concealment of material facts.  After informing the jury of the charges, the District Court instructed the jury that the defendants' alleged scheme could be made out either by finding:  (1) that Hunt had de facto control over the award of the Commonwealth's workmen's compensation insurance contract; that he obtained commission payments from the company awarded this contract which were mailed to a company he owned and controlled with petitioners, without disclosing his ownership interest to commonwealth officials; and that petitioners aided in the scheme; or (2) that Gray had supervisory authority over the insurance when his company received payments; that he did not disclose his interest in the company to commonwealth officials; and that McNally aided and abetted him.  The jury convicted petitioners, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on a line of decisions holding that  1341 proscribes schemes to defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honest and impartial government.
Held:  The jury charge permitted a conviction for conduct not within the reach of  1341.  Pp.  483 U. S. 356-361.
(a) The language and legislative history of  1341 demonstrate that it is limited in scope to the protection of money or property rights, and does not extend to the intangible right of the citizenry to good government.  The argument that, because the statutory phrases ""to defraud"" and ""for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises"" appear in the disjunctive, they should be construed independently, so that ""a scheme or artifice to defraud"" 
Page 483 U. S. 351
 may include a scheme designed to deprive parties of intangible rights is not persuasive.  The words ""to defraud"" commonly refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods, and there is nothing to indicate that Congress meant to depart from this common understanding when it enacted  1341 in its present form.  Rather, the statute was amended to include the second phrase simply to make it clear that it reaches false promises and misrepresentations as to the future as well as other frauds involving money or property.  Pp.  483 U. S. 356-360.
(b) A state officer does not violate  1341 if he chooses an insurance agency to provide the State's insurance, but specifies that the agency must share its commissions with another agency in which the officer has an ownership interest, and hence profits from the commissions.  Here, there was no charge and the jury was not required to find that the Commonwealth itself was defrauded of any money or property or would have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance in the absence of the alleged scheme.  In fact, the commissions Hunt and Gray received were not the Commonwealth's money.  Nor was the jury charged that, to convict, it must find that the Commonwealth was deprived of control over how its money was spent.  Indeed, it would have paid the insurance premium to some agency, and Hunt and Gray simply asserted control that the Commonwealth might not otherwise have made over the payment of insurance commissions.  Moreover, although the Government relies in part on the assertion that petitioners obtained property by means of false representations to the company awarded the insurance contract, there was nothing in the charge that required such a finding.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a data-entry employee in a county Constable's office, was discharged for remarking to a coworker, after hearing of an attempt on the President's life, ""if they go for him again, I hope they get him.""  Respondent was not a commissioned peace officer, did not wear a uniform, was not authorized to make arrests or permitted to carry a gun, and was not brought by virtue of her job into contact with the public.  Her duties were purely clerical, were limited solely to the civil process function of the Constable's office, and did not involve her in the office's minimal law enforcement activity.  Her statement was made during a private conversation in a room not readily accessible to the public.  The Constable fired petitioner because of the statement.  She then brought suit in the Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that her discharge violated her First Amendment right to free speech under color of state law.

However, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for determination of an appropriate remedy, holding that respondent's remark had addressed a matter of public concern, and that the governmental interest in maintaining efficiency and discipline in the workplace did not outweigh society's First Amendment interest in protecting respondent's speech.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was tried with a codefendant for murder and related crimes.  The trial court dismissed the capital portion of petitioner's indictment.  It also denied his motions in which he requested that the jury not be ""death qualified,"" and that there be two juries, one for guilt and the other for sentencing, with the first not being ""death qualified.""  ""Death qualification"" occurs when prospective jurors are excluded for cause in light of their stated inability to set aside their strong opposition to the death penalty.  At trial, petitioner attempted to establish the affirmative defense of ""extreme emotional disturbance"" by having a social worker read from several psychological evaluations that were made following a previous arrest.  On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to rebut this defense by having the social worker read from another evaluation prepared by Dr. Robert J. G. Lange on the joint motion of the prosecution and counsel for petitioner following his murder arrest.  As read to the jury, the report set forth Dr. Lange's general observations about petitioner's mental state, but did not describe any statements petitioner made about the crimes with which he was charged.  After finding both defendants guilty, the jury imposed the maximum possible sentence on petitioner, and sentenced his codefendant to death.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed petitioner's conviction, holding that the jury's ""death qualification"" did not deprive petitioner of his right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, and that the trial judge had not erred in allowing the introduction of Dr. Lange's report.  The court ruled that petitioner had opened the door for the introduction of the report by his introducing earlier reports that were beneficial to him, and that the use of Dr. Lange's report did not violate petitioner's rights under Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454.
Held:
1. Petitioner was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury, representative of a fair cross-section of the community, because the prosecution was permitted to ""death-qualify"" the jury.  Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, which authorizes ""death qualification"" prior to the guilt phase of a bifurcated capital trial, controls this case involving a joint trial in which the death penalty was sought only against petitioner's codefendant.  The Commonwealth had legitimate interests in holding a joint trial where the defendants' conduct arose from 
Page 483 U. S. 403
 the same events, and in having a jury that could properly find the facts and apply the law at both phases of the trial as to both defendants, and assess the appropriateness of the death penalty for the codefendant.  Pp.  483 U. S. 415-421.
2. The prosecution's use of Dr. Lange's report solely to rebut petitioner's psychological evidence did not violate petitioner's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under Smith.  Where, as here, a defendant requests a psychological evaluation or presents psychiatric evidence, the prosecution may rebut this presentation with the report of the requested examination without implicating the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.  Because petitioner did not testify, and his entire strategy was to establish his ""mental status"" defense through the social worker's readings of earlier evaluations, the prosecution could not respond to petitioner's case unless it presented other psychological evidence.  Moreover, the use of Dr. Lange's report did not deny petitioner his right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Unlike the situation in Smith, petitioner's counsel himself requested Dr. Lange's evaluation, and presumably discussed it with his client.  Petitioner's argument that neither he nor his counsel could anticipate the report's use to rebut his ""mental status"" defense is unavailing.  Smith put counsel on notice that, if he intended to present such a defense, he could anticipate the use of psychological evidence in rebuttal.  Pp.  483 U. S. 421-425.

483 U.S. 402

Syllabus 
Petitioner was tried with a codefendant for murder and related crimes.  The trial court dismissed the capital portion of petitioner's indictment.  It also denied his motions in which he requested that the jury not be ""death qualified,"" and that there be two juries, one for guilt and the other for sentencing, with the first not being ""death qualified.""  ""Death qualification"" occurs when prospective jurors are excluded for cause in light of their stated inability to set aside their strong opposition to the death penalty.  At trial, petitioner attempted to establish the affirmative defense of ""extreme emotional disturbance"" by having a social worker read from several psychological evaluations that were made following a previous arrest.  On cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to rebut this defense by having the social worker read from another evaluation prepared by Dr. Robert J. G. Lange on the joint motion of the prosecution and counsel for petitioner following his murder arrest.  As read to the jury, the report set forth Dr. Lange's general observations about petitioner's mental state, but did not describe any statements petitioner made about the crimes with which he was charged.  After finding both defendants guilty, the jury imposed the maximum possible sentence on petitioner, and sentenced his codefendant to death.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed petitioner's conviction, holding that the jury's ""death qualification"" did not deprive petitioner of his right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, and that the trial judge had not erred in allowing the introduction of Dr. Lange's report.

No. 85-6725
Argued April 1, 1987
Decided June 23, 1987
483 U.S. 171

Syllabus 
In a tape-recorded telephone conversation with a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant arranging to sell cocaine, Angelo Lonardo, who had agreed earlier to find individuals to distribute the drug, said he had a ""gentleman friend"" (petitioner) who had some questions.  In a subsequent telephone call, the informant spoke to the ""friend"" about the drug's quality and the price, and later arranged with Lonardo for the sale to take place in a designated parking lot, where Lonardo would transfer the drug from the informant's car to the ""friend.""  The transaction took place as planned, and the FBI arrested Lonardo and petitioner immediately after Lonardo placed the drug into petitioner's car.  At petitioner's trial that resulted in his conviction of federal drug charges, including a conspiracy charge, the Government introduced, over petitioner's objection, Lonardo's telephone statements regarding the ""friend's"" participation in the transaction.  The District Court found that, considering both the events in the parking lot and Lonardo's statements, the Government had established by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy involving Lonardo and petitioner existed, that Lonardo's statements were made in the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that the statements thus satisfied Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E), which provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is made ""by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that Lonardo's statements were admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and also rejecting petitioner's contention that, because he could not cross-examine Lonardo (who exercised his right not to testify), admission of the statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.
Held:  Lonardo's out-of court statements were properly admitted against petitioner.  Pp.  483 U. S. 175-184.
(a) When the preliminary facts relevant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E) -- the existence of a conspiracy and the nonoffering party's involvement in it -- are disputed, the offering party must prove them by a preponderance of the evidence, not some higher standard of proof.  Rule of Evidence 104(a) requires that the court determine preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence, but the Rules do not define the standard of 
Page 483 U. S. 172
 proof.  The traditional requirement that such questions be established by a preponderance of proof, regardless of the burden of proof on the substantive issues, applies here.  Pp.  483 U. S. 175-176.
(b) There is no merit to petitioner's contention -- based on the ""bootstrapping rule"" of Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60, and United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 -- that a court, in determining the preliminary facts relevant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E), must look only to independent evidence other than the statements sought to be admitted.  Both Glasser and Nixon were decided before Congress enacted the Federal Rules of Evidence, and Rule 104(a) provides that, in determining preliminary questions concerning admissibility, the court ""is not bound by the rules of evidence"" (except those with respect to privileges), thus authorizing consideration of hearsay.  Such construction of Rule 104(a) does not fundamentally change the nature of the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  Out-of court statements are only presumed unreliable, and may be rebutted by appropriate proof, and individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  Thus, a per se rule barring consideration of Lonardo's statements during preliminary factfinding is not required.  Each of his statements was corroborated by independent evidence, consisting of the events that transpired at the parking lot.  Accordingly, it need not be decided whether, under Rule 104(a), the courts below could have relied solely upon Lonardo's hearsay statements to establish the preliminary facts for admissibility.  If Glasser and Nixon are interpreted as meaning that courts cannot look to the hearsay statements themselves for any purpose, they have been superseded by Rule 104(a).  It is sufficient in this case to hold that a court, in making a preliminary factual determination under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), may examine the hearsay statements sought to be admitted.  Pp.  483 U. S. 176-181.
(c) Admission of Lonardo's statements against petitioner did not violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause.  The requirements for admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) are identical to the requirements of the Clause, and since the statements were admissible under the Rule, there is no constitutional problem.  In this context, the Clause, as a general matter, requires the prosecution to demonstrate both the unavailability of the declarant and the indicia of reliability surrounding the out-of-court declaration.  However, a showing of unavailability is not required when the hearsay statement is the out-of-court declaration of a coconspirator.  United States v. Inadi, 475 U. S. 387.  Moreover, no independent inquiry into reliability is required when the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, such as the coconspirator exception.  Pp.  483 U. S. 181-184.

Syllabus 
Title 23 U.S.C.  158 (1982 ed., Supp. III) directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of otherwise allocable federal highway funds from States ""in which the purchase or public possession . . . of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful.""  South Dakota, which permits persons 19 years old or older to purchase beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol, sued in Federal District Court for a declaratory judgment that  158 violates the constitutional limitations on congressional exercise of the spending power under Art. I,  8, cl. 1, of the Constitution, and violates the Twenty-first Amendment.  The District Court rejected the State's claims, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Even if Congress, in view of the Twenty-first Amendment, might lack the power to impose directly a national minimum drinking age (a question not decided here),  158's indirect encouragement of state action to obtain uniformity in the States' drinking ages is a valid use of the spending power.  Pp.  483 U. S. 206-212.
(a) Incident to the spending power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds.  However, exercise of the power is subject to certain restrictions, including that it must be in pursuit of ""the general welfare.""  Section 158 is consistent with such restriction, since the means chosen by Congress to address a dangerous situation -- the interstate problem resulting from the incentive, created by differing state drinking ages, for young persons to combine drinking and driving -- were reasonably calculated to advance the general welfare.  Section 158 also is consistent with the spending power restrictions that, if Congress desires to condition the States' receipt of federal funds, it must do so unambiguously, enabling the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation; and that conditions on federal grants must be related to a national concern (safe interstate travel here).  Pp.  483 U. S. 206-209.
(b) Nor is  158 invalidated by the spending power limitation that the conditional grant of federal funds must not be independently barred by other constitutional provisions (the Twenty-first Amendment here).  Such limitation is not a prohibition on the indirect achievement of objectives 
Page 483 U. S. 204
 which Congress is not empowered to achieve directly, but, instead, means that the power may not be used to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.  Here, if South Dakota were to succumb to Congress' blandishments and raise its drinking age to 21, its action would not violate anyone's constitutional rights.  Moreover, the relatively small financial inducement offered by Congress here -- resulting from the State's loss of only 5% of federal funds otherwise obtainable under certain highway grant programs -- is not so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.

No. 85-2116
Argued March 30, 1987
Decided June 23, 1987
482 U.S. 219

Syllabus 
Respondent Ronald Calder, who had been released on bail after being arraigned in a Puerto Rico court on felony charges, was declared a fugitive from justice when he failed to appear at a preliminary hearing.  Believing that Calder had returned to his family's home in Iowa, Puerto Rico officials notified local authorities in Iowa, and Calder surrendered.  The Governor of Puerto Rico submitted to the Governor of Iowa a request for Calder's extradition.  After a hearing conducted by the Governor's counsel, and after unsuccessful negotiations between officials of the two jurisdictions for a reduction of the charges against Calder, Iowa's Governor denied the extradition request.  Puerto Rico then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking mandamus relief and a declaration that failure to deliver Calder upon presentation of proper extradition papers violated the Extradition Clause of the Federal Constitution and the Extradition Act.  The court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, that federal courts have no power to order a Governor to fulfill the State's obligation under the Extradition Clause to deliver up fugitives from justice.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Dennison's holding that the federal courts have no authority under the Constitution to compel performance by an asylum State of the mandatory, ministerial duty to deliver up fugitives upon proper demand can stand no longer.  Pp.  483 U. S. 224-229.
(a) When Dennison was decided in 1861, the practical power of the Federal Government was at its lowest ebb since the adoption of the Constitution.  Secession of States from the Union was a fact, and civil war was a threatening possibility.  Pp.  483 U. S. 224-225.
(b) The other proposition for which Dennison stands -- that the Extradition Clause's commands are mandatory and afford no discretion to executive officers of the asylum State -- is reaffirmed.  However, the Dennison holding as to the federal courts' authority to enforce the Extradition Clause rested on a fundamental premise -- that the States and the Federal Government in all circumstances must be viewed as coequal sovereigns -- which is not representative of current law.  It has long 
Page 483 U. S. 220
 been a settled principle that federal courts may enjoin unconstitutional action by state officials.  Considered de novo, there is no justification for distinguishing the duty to deliver fugitives from the many other species of constitutional duty enforceable in the federal courts.  Because the duty is directly imposed upon the States by the Constitution itself, there is no need to weigh the performance of the federal obligation against the powers reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment.  Even assuming, as respondents contend, that there is an ""executive common law"" of extradition, developed under Dennison, which provides a superior alternative to the ""ministerial duty"" to extradite provided for by the Constitution, no weight can be accorded to it.  Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the Constitution's requirements cannot overcome this Court's responsibility to enforce those requirements.  Pp.  483 U. S. 226-229.
2. It need not be determined what applicability the Extradition Clause, which refers only to ""States,"" may have to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, since the Extradition Act clearly applies.  Puerto Rico may predicate its mandamus action on the Act, without regard to the Clause's direct applicability.  Pp.  483 U. S. 229-230.

After a hearing conducted by the Governor's counsel, and after unsuccessful negotiations between officials of the two jurisdictions for a reduction of the charges against Calder, Iowa's Governor denied the extradition request.  Puerto Rico then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking mandamus relief and a declaration that failure to deliver Calder upon presentation of proper extradition papers violated the Extradition Clause of the Federal Constitution and the Extradition Act.  The court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the action was barred by the holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, that federal courts have no power to order a Governor to fulfill the State's obligation under the Extradition Clause to deliver up fugitives from justice.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Dennison's holding that the federal courts have no authority under the Constitution to compel performance by an asylum State of the mandatory, ministerial duty to deliver up fugitives upon proper demand can stand no longer.  Pp.  483 U. S. 224-229.
(a) When Dennison was decided in 1861, the practical power of the Federal Government was at its lowest ebb since the adoption of the Constitution.  Secession of States from the Union was a fact, and civil war was a threatening possibility.  Pp.  483 U. S. 224-225.
(b) The other proposition for which Dennison stands -- that the Extradition Clause's commands are mandatory and afford no discretion to executive officers of the asylum State -- is reaffirmed.  However, the Dennison holding as to the federal courts' authority to enforce the Extradition Clause rested on a fundamental premise -- that the States and the Federal Government in all circumstances must be viewed as coequal sovereigns -- which is not representative of current law.  It has long 
Page 483 U. S. 220
 been a settled principle that federal courts may enjoin unconstitutional action by state officials.  Considered de novo, there is no justification for distinguishing the duty to deliver fugitives from the many other species of constitutional duty enforceable in the federal courts.  Because the duty is directly imposed upon the States by the Constitution itself, there is no need to weigh the performance of the federal obligation against the powers reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment.  Even assuming, as respondents contend, that there is an ""executive common law"" of extradition, developed under Dennison, which provides a superior alternative to the ""ministerial duty"" to extradite provided for by the Constitution, no weight can be accorded to it.  Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the Constitution's requirements cannot overcome this Court's responsibility to enforce those requirements.  Pp.  483 U. S. 226-229.
2. It need not be determined what applicability the Extradition Clause, which refers only to ""States,"" may have to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, since the Extradition Act clearly applies.  Puerto Rico may predicate its mandamus action on the Act, without regard to the Clause's direct applicability.  Pp.  483 U. S. 229-230.

Syllabus 
Washington imposes a business and occupation (B & O) tax on the privilege of engaging in business activities in the State, including manufacturing in the State and making wholesale sales in the State.  The measure of the wholesale tax is the gross proceeds of sales, and the measure of the manufacturing tax is the value of the manufactured product.  However, under the B & O tax's ""multiple activities exemption,"" local manufacturers are exempted from the manufacturing tax for the portion of their output that is subject to the wholesale tax.  Application of the exemption results in local manufacturers' paying the wholesale tax on local sales, local manufacturers' paying only the manufacturing tax on their out-of-state sales, and out-of-state manufacturers' paying the wholesale tax on their sales in Washington.  The same tax rate is applicable to both wholesaling and manufacturing activities.  In both of the cases under review, which originated as state court tax refund suits by appellants, local manufacturers who sold their goods outside Washington and out-of-state manufacturers who sold their goods in Washington, the trial court held that the multiple activities exemption did not discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  In No. 85-1963, appellant Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. (Tyler) -- an out-of-state manufacturer who sold its products in Washington but had no property or employees in Washington, and whose solicitation of business in Washington was conducted by an independent contractor located in Washington -- also asserted that its business did not have a sufficient nexus with Washington to justify the collection of the tax on its wholesale sales there.  The trial court upheld the B & O tax.  The Washington Supreme Court affirmed in both cases.
Held:
1. Washington's manufacturing tax discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause because, through the operation of the multiple activities exemption, the tax is assessed only on those products manufactured in Washington that are sold to out-of-state customers.  The exemption for local manufacturers that sell their products 
Page 483 U. S. 233
 within the State has the same facially discriminatory consequences as the West Virginia tax exemption that was invalidated in Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, and the reasons for invalidating the tax in that case also apply to the Washington tax.  The facial unconstitutionality of Washington's tax cannot be alleviated by examining the effect of other States' tax legislation to determine whether specific interstate transactions are subject to multiple taxation.  Nor can Washington's imposition of the manufacturing tax on local goods sold outside the State be saved as a valid ""compensating tax.""  Manufacturing and wholesaling are not ""substantially equivalent events,"" id. at  467 U. S. 643, such that taxing the manufacture of goods sold outside the State can be said to compensate for the State's inability to impose a wholesale tax on such goods.  Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577, distinguished.  To the extent that the ruling here is inconsistent with the ruling in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 -- where the B & O tax was upheld as against claims that it unconstitutionally taxed unapportioned gross receipts and did not bear a reasonable relation to the taxpayer's in-state activities -- that case is overruled.  Pp.  483 U. S. 239-248.
2. The activities of Tyler's sales representative in Washington adequately support the State's jurisdiction to tax Tyler's wholesale sales to in-state customers.  The showing of a sufficient nexus cannot be defeated by the argument that the taxpayer's representative was properly characterized as an independent contractor, rather than an agent.  Cf. Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207.  Nor is there any merit to Tyler's contention that the B & O tax does not fairly apportion the tax burden between its activities in Washington and its activities in other States.  Such contention rests on the erroneous assumption that, through the B & O tax, Washington is taxing the unitary activity of manufacturing and wholesaling.  The manufacturing tax and the wholesaling tax are not compensating taxes for substantially equivalent events, and, thus, the activity of wholesaling -- whether by an in-state or an out-of-state manufacturer -- must be viewed as a separate activity conducted wholly within Washington that no other State has jurisdiction to tax.

483 U.S. 266

Syllabus 
This case presents the question whether the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution is violated by two Pennsylvania statutes which impose lump-sum annual taxes on the operation of trucks on Pennsylvania's highways.  One challenged statute requires that an identification marker be affixed to every truck over a specified weight, and imposes an annual flat fee ($25 from 1980 through March 1983) for such marker.  The statute exempts trucks registered in Pennsylvania by providing that the marker fee shall be deemed a part of the vehicle registration fee (which was increased when the $25 marker fee was enacted).  The marker fee was reduced to $5 (the administrative cost of issuing the marker) in 1982, when Pennsylvania enacted the second challenged statute, which, in general, imposes an annual axle tax on all trucks over a specified weight using Pennsylvania highways, and is assessed at the rate of $36 per vehicle axle.  The same statute that enacted the axle tax also reduced the registration fees for pertinent vehicle weight classes by the amount of the axle tax usually applicable to vehicles in such classes.  Appellant organizations, which represent interstate motor carriers whose vehicles are registered outside of Pennsylvania and who paid the $25 marker fee while it was in effect and are subject to the axle tax, brought separate actions in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania challenging the constitutionality of the $25 marker fee and of the axle tax on the ground, inter alia, that both taxes discriminated against interstate commerce, since the entire economic burden of each tax fell on out-of-state vehicles because the 1980 statute ""deemed"" the marker fee for Pennsylvania vehicles to be a part of the registration fee, and the 1982 legislation granted Pennsylvania vehicles a reduction in registration fees that offset the newly imposed axle tax.  The court accepted appellants' argument and held that the challenged taxes were unconstitutional.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the cases together, and reversed.
Held:
1. The challenged taxes are unconstitutional, because the methods by which they are assessed discriminate against interstate commerce in a way that contradicts the Commerce Clause's central purpose of guaranteeing 
Page 483 U. S. 267
 a free trade area among States.  The Clause prohibits a State, as here, from imposing a tax that places a much heavier burden on out-of-state businesses that compete in an interstate market than it imposes on its own residents who also engage in interstate commerce.  The challenged taxes do not pass the ""internal consistency"" test, under which a state tax must be of a kind that, if applied by every jurisdiction, there would be no impermissible interference with free trade.  The challenged taxes' inevitable effect is to threaten the free movement of commerce by placing a financial barrier around Pennsylvania.  Pp.  483 U. S. 280-287.
2. The challenged taxes cannot be upheld on the ground that they reflect a reasonable charge for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's roads when considered alongside the high price that Pennsylvania-based trucks pay in registration fees.  There is no merit to the contention that the axle tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce because domestic trucks, through payment of the registration fees, pay a higher price to use Pennsylvania's highways than those registered in other States.  Pp.  483 U. S. 287-289.
3. Nor can the challenged taxes be upheld on the ground that they are no different from flat user fees recently upheld in other cases.  Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority District v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707, and Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, distinguished.  Pp.  483 U. S. 289-292.
4. Earlier cases that support a State's authority to impose flat use taxes can no longer suffice to uphold flat taxes with the blatantly discriminatory consequences associated with Pennsylvania's marker fee and axle tax.  More recent decisions have rejected the approach to the Commerce Clause taken in the earlier cases that focused primarily on the character of the privilege, rather than the practical consequences of the tax.  A flat tax may not be upheld merely because the particular formula by which its charges are reckoned extends the same nominal privilege to interstate commerce that it extends to in-state activities.  Although out-of-state carriers obtain a privilege to use Pennsylvania's highways that is nominally equivalent to that which local carriers receive, imposition of the challenged taxes for a privilege that is several times more valuable to a local business than to its out-of-state competitors is unquestionably discriminatory, and thus offends the Commerce Clause.  While flat taxes may be valid when administrative difficulties make collection of more finely calibrated user charges impracticable, such justification is unavailable with regard to Pennsylvania's unapportioned marker fee and axle tax.

Syllabus 
A warrant to search a particular apartment in a multi-unit building was issued on the basis of a police officer's affidavit declaring, inter alia, that, through a search of the communal trash bin in the building's basement, the police had retrieved a bag containing evidence indicating that respondent was conducting an illegal bookmaking operation in the apartment.  After the search of the apartment yielded incriminating evidence, respondent was arrested and charged with a number of felonies.  Subsequently, a Magistrate granted respondent's motion to quash the warrant, ruling that the use of the evidence obtained from the warrantless search of the trash bin to support the search warrant for the apartment violated respondent's Fourth Amendment rights, and that the other supporting evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause.  The California Superior Court agreed, and dismissed the charges.  However, the State Court of Appeal reversed, concluding that, although the evidence found in the trash bin could not be used to support the warrant, there was sufficient other evidence to establish probable cause.  After the State Supreme Court denied both petitioner's and respondent's petitions for review, the State sought review in this Court, arguing that the California courts had erred in stating that the search of the trash was unconstitutional.
Held:  The writ of certiorari previously granted by this Court is dismissed as improvidently granted, since the Court's review of the question on which the writ was granted -- whether respondent retained an expectation of privacy in the bag that he placed in the communal trash bin -- would be premature in that that issue has never been the subject of an actual state court judgment, and is not properly presented in this case.  This Court reviews judgments, not statements in opinions.  Here, since the search warrant which was the sole focus of the litigation was deemed valid, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was entirely in the State's favor, and the fact that that court fortuitously addressed the trash bin issue in a way that may have been adverse to the State's long-term interests does not allow the State to claim status as a losing party for purposes of this Court's review.  If the case comes to trial and the State is barred from introducing the trash bin evidence because the Court of Appeal's decision constitutes the law of the case, the State will still have the 
Page 483 U. S. 308
 opportunity to appeal that order, and this Court will then have the chance to review a state court judgment on which the State Supreme Court has passed or declined review in a case that properly raises the issue.

Shortly after his trial for first-degree murder had commenced in an Arizona court, respondent and the prosecutor reached an agreement whereby respondent would plead guilty to second-degree murder and testify against other parties involved in the murder, in return for a specified prison term and a specified actual incarceration time.  The agreement also provided that, if respondent refused to testify ""this entire agreement is null and void and the original charge will be automatically reinstated,"" and that, ""[i]n the event this agreement becomes null and void, then the parties shall be returned to the positions they were in before this agreement.""  The trial court accepted the plea agreement and proposed sentence, and respondent testified against the other individuals, who were convicted of first-degree murder.  The Arizona Supreme Court reversed the latter convictions, remanding for retrial, and the prosecutor sought respondent's further cooperation, but was informed that respondent believed his obligation to testify under the agreement terminated when he was sentenced.  After the trial court refused to compel him to testify in pretrial proceedings, the State filed a new information charging him with first-degree murder.  The trial court denied his motion to quash the information on double jeopardy grounds, and the Arizona Supreme Court, in special proceedings filed by respondent, vacated his second-degree murder conviction and reinstated the original charges, holding that the plea agreement contemplated availability 
Page 483 U. S. 2
 of his testimony against the other individuals at both trial and retrial, that he had violated the agreement's terms, and that the agreement waived the defense of double jeopardy if it was violated.  The State then declined his offer to testify at the other individuals' retrial, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal.  He then unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court, but the Court of Appeals ultimately held that the State had violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause, concluding that he had not waived such rights by entering into the plea agreement.
Held:  Respondent's prosecution for first-degree murder did not violate double jeopardy principles, since his breach of the plea agreement removed the double jeopardy bar that otherwise would prevail, assuming that, under state law, second-degree murder is a lesser included offense of first-degree murder.  Pp.  483 U. S. 8-12.
(a) The record establishes that respondent understood the meaning of the agreement's provisions concerning the consequences of his breach of his promise to testify.  It is not significant that ""double jeopardy"" was not specifically waived by name in the agreement, since its terms are precisely equivalent to an agreement waiving a double jeopardy defense.  Pp.  483 U. S. 9-10.
(b) There is no merit to the view that, since there was a good faith dispute about whether respondent was bound to testify a second time, there could be no knowing and intelligent waiver of his double jeopardy defense until the extent of his obligation was decided.  Respondent knew that, if he breached the agreement, he could be retried, and he chose to seek a construction of the agreement in the State Supreme Court, rather than to testify at the retrial.  He cannot escape the State Supreme Court's finding that he had breached his promise to testify, and there was no indication that he did not fully understand the potential seriousness of the position he adopted.  Cf. United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82.  Pp.  483 U. S. 10-12.
(c) It is of no moment that, following the Arizona Supreme Court's decision, respondent offered to comply with the terms of the agreement, since at that point his second-degree murder conviction had been ordered vacated and the original charge reinstated.  The parties could have agreed that respondent would be relieved of the consequences of his refusal to testify if he were able to advance a colorable argument that a testimonial obligation was not owing, but permitting the State to enforce the agreement actually made does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Syllabus 
Section 15(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) prohibits ""any person"" from introducing into interstate commerce goods produced in violation of the minimum wage or overtime pay provisions of  6 and 7 of the Act.  Under a financing agreement with manufacturer Ely Group, Inc. (Ely), petitioner perfected a security interest in Ely's inventory.  After Ely began to fail financially, petitioner took possession of the inventory, part of which was manufactured during a period in which Ely's employees were not paid.  Concluding that such items were ""hot goods"" under  15(a)(1), the United States Department of Labor filed suits in two Federal District Courts, each of which granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the transportation or sale of the goods in interstate commerce.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the consolidated cases.
Held:  Section 15(a)(1) applies to secured creditors who acquire ""hot goods"" pursuant to a security agreement.  Pp.  483 U. S. 32-38.
(a) The goods produced during the period when Ely's employees were not paid were manufactured in violation of  6 and/or  7 of the Act, and are ""hot goods"" for the purposes of  15(a)(1).  Pp.  483 U. S. 32-33.
(b) As a corporate entity, petitioner falls within  15(a)(1)'s plain language, since that section prohibits ""any person"" from introducing ""hot goods"" into commerce, while the Act defines ""person"" to include corporations.  Petitioner's argument that  15(a)(1)'s exemptions for common carriers and good faith purchasers reflect a congressional intent that the ""hot goods"" prohibition should apply only to culpable parties, and not to ""innocent"" secured creditors, is not persuasive.  Congress' limitation of the effects of other FLSA provisions to culpable parties indicates that its failure to do so here was not inadvertent.  Rather,  15(a)(1)'s exemption of only two narrow categories of ""innocent"" persons suggests that all others, whether innocent or not, are covered.  There is no indication that Congress actually considered secured creditors when it enacted  15(a)(1), but, by claiming a general exemption for them, without any duty to ascertain compliance with the Act, petitioner would put them in a better position than good faith purchasers, whom Congress did specifically act to protect.  Detailed and particular FLSA exemptions cannot 
Page 483 U. S. 28
 be enlarged by implication to include persons not plainly and unmistakably within the Act's terms and spirit.  Pp.  483 U. S. 33-35.
(c) By excluding tainted goods from interstate commerce, the application of  15(a)(1) to secured creditors furthers the FLSA's goal of eliminating the competitive advantage enjoyed by goods produced under substandard labor conditions.  Moreover, prohibiting foreclosing creditors from selling ""hot goods"" also advances the Act's purpose of establishing decent wages and hours, since such creditors will be encouraged to insist that their debtors comply with the Act's minimum wage and overtime pay requirements.  Pp.  483 U. S. 35-38.
(d) Applying  15(a)(1) to secured creditors does not give employees a ""lien"" on, or priority in, ""hot goods"" superior to that of the creditors under state law, since creditors' rights in the goods as against the employer are unchanged by such application, while the employees acquire no possessory interest in the goods thereby.  Such application is simply an exercise of Congress' power to exclude contraband from interstate commerce.  Pp.  483 U. S. 38-39.

483 U.S. 44

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged with manslaughter for shooting her husband.  In order to refresh her memory as to the precise details of the shooting, she twice underwent hypnosis by a trained neuropsychologist.  These sessions were tape-recorded.  After the hypnosis, she remembered details indicating that her gun was defective and had misfired, which was corroborated by an expert witness' testimony.  However, the trial court ruled that no hypnotically refreshed testimony would be admitted, and limited petitioner's testimony to a reiteration of her statements to the doctor prior to hypnosis, as reported in the doctor's notes.  The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed her conviction, ruling that the limitations on her testimony did not violate her constitutional right to testify, and that criminal defendants' hypnotically refreshed testimony is inadmissible per se because it is unreliable.
Held:
1. Criminal defendants have a right to testify in their own behalf under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.  Pp.  483 U. S. 49-53.
2. Although the right to present relevant testimony is not without limitation, restrictions placed on a defendant's constitutional right to testify by a State's evidentiary rules may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.  Pp.  483 U. S. 53-56.
3. Arkansas' per se rule excluding all hypnotically refreshed testimony infringes impermissibly on a criminal defendant's right to testify on his or her own behalf.  Despite any unreliability that hypnosis may introduce into testimony, the procedure has been credited as instrumental in obtaining particular types of information.  Moreover, hypnotically refreshed testimony is subject to verification by corroborating evidence and other traditional means of assessing accuracy, and inaccuracies can be reduced by procedural safeguards such as the use of tape or video recording.  The State's legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not justify a per se exclusion, because the evidence may be reliable in an individual case.  Here, the expert's corroboration of petitioner's hypnotically enhanced memories and the trial judge's conclusion that the tape recordings indicated that the doctor did not suggest responses with

Argued April 27, 1987
Decided June 22, 1987
483 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
In an unsuccessful effort to increase the attractiveness of their financially troubled corporation to outside investors, respondents voluntarily surrendered some of their shares to the corporation, thereby reducing their combined percentage ownership from 72.5 percent to 68.5 percent.  Respondents received no consideration for the surrendered shares, and no other shareholders surrendered any stock.  The corporation eventually was liquidated.  On their 1976 and 1977 joint federal income tax returns, respondents claimed ordinary loss deductions for the full amount of their adjusted basis in the surrendered shares.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions, concluding that the surrendered stock was a contribution to the corporation's capital, and that, accordingly, the surrender resulted in no immediate tax consequences, and respondents' basis in the surrendered shares should be added to the basis of their remaining shares.  The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner's determination, but the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that respondents were entitled to deduct their basis in the surrendered shares immediately as an ordinary loss, less any resulting increase in the value of their remaining shares.
Held:  A dominant shareholder who voluntarily surrenders a portion of his shares to the corporation, but who retains control of the corporation, does not sustain an immediate loss deductible for income tax purposes.  Rather, the rule applicable to contributions to capital applies, so that the surrendering shareholder must reallocate his basis in the surrendered shares to the shares he retains, and deduct his loss, if any, when he disposes of the remaining shares.  This rule is not rendered inapplicable simply because a stock surrender is not a contribution to capital in the strict accounting sense, or because, unlike a typical contribution to capital, a surrender reduces the shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation.  Where, as here, a closely held corporation's shares are not traded on an open market, a stock surrender to that corporation often will not meet the requirement that an immediately deductible loss must be actually sustained during the taxable year, since there will be no reliable method of determining whether the surrender has resulted in a loss until the shareholder disposes of his remaining shares.  Moreover, 
Page 483 U. S. 90
 treating stock surrenders as ordinary losses might encourage shareholders in failing corporations to convert potential capital losses to ordinary losses by voluntarily surrendering their shares before the corporation fails, thereby avoiding the consequences of the rule requiring capital loss treatment for stock that becomes worthless.  Similarly, shareholders might be encouraged to transfer corporate stock rather than other property to the corporation in order to realize a current loss.  Pp.  483 U. S. 95-100.

This rule is not rendered inapplicable simply because a stock surrender is not a contribution to capital in the strict accounting sense, or because, unlike a typical contribution to capital, a surrender reduces the shareholder's proportionate interest in the corporation.  Where, as here, a closely held corporation's shares are not traded on an open market, a stock surrender to that corporation often will not meet the requirement that an immediately deductible loss must be actually sustained during the taxable year, since there will be no reliable method of determining whether the surrender has resulted in a loss until the shareholder disposes of his remaining shares.  Moreover, 
Page 483 U. S. 90
 treating stock surrenders as ordinary losses might encourage shareholders in failing corporations to convert potential capital losses to ordinary losses by voluntarily surrendering their shares before the corporation fails, thereby avoiding the consequences of the rule requiring capital loss treatment for stock that becomes worthless.  Similarly, shareholders might be encouraged to transfer corporate stock rather than other property to the corporation in order to realize a current loss.  Pp.  483 U. S. 95-100.

No. 86-177
Argued March 31, 1987
Decided June 22, 1987
483 U.S. 107

Syllabus 
Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole), obtained a bank loan for a power plant construction project which included an access road.  The loan was guaranteed by the federal Rural Electrification Administration (REA), which had the right to supervise the project, to approve certain contracts including the road construction agreement, and to require certain bidding procedures to be used.  Petitioner Conover, Seminole's procurement manager, and petitioner Tanner were friends and had engaged in several business deals together.  At about the time the contracts for construction of the road and for fill materials were awarded to Tanner's company upon favorable bidding specifications prepared by Conover's procurement department, Tanner paid Conover over $30,000, allegedly as payments on their personal transactions.  Thereafter, Conover helped resolve problems between Seminole and Tanner on terms favorable to Tanner, and, after the REA complained that Tanner's bond was not from an approved company, Conover sent letters to a new bonding company that misrepresented the road's state of completion.  On these facts, petitioners were indicted and convicted of conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371, and of committing mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341.  Before they were sentenced, petitioners filed a motion seeking permission to interview jurors, an evidentiary hearing, and a new trial based on a trial juror's statement that several jurors had consumed alcohol at lunch throughout the trial, causing them to sleep during the afternoons.  The District Court concluded that juror testimony on intoxication was inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) to impeach the jury's verdict, but invited petitioners to call nonjuror witnesses in support of their motion.  The only such evidence introduced was defense counsel's testimony that he had observed one of the jurors ""in a sort of giggly mood"" at trial, but did not bring this to anyone's attention at that time.  The judge pointed out that, although he had discussed with counsel during the trial the possibility that jurors were falling asleep, neither counsel nor courtroom employees had thereafter alerted him to such a problem, and he had observed none himself.  Thus, he denied the motion, and subsequently denied a similar motion based on another juror's affidavit which alleged widespread juror use of alcohol and drugs during the trial, but which 
Page 483 U. S. 108
 admitted that none of the jurors with whom the affiant drank were intoxicated, and that his own reasoning ability was affected only one time.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' convictions, holding that their actions constituted a conspiracy to defraud the United States under  371, and that this conspiracy was sufficient to establish a  1341 violation.  Thus, the court did not reach the question whether the evidence established the use of the mails for the purpose of defrauding Seminole.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing at which jurors would testify on juror alcohol and drug use during the trial.  Pp.  483 U. S. 116-127.
(a) Such testimony is barred by Rule 606(b), which embodies the long-accepted common law and federal rule on the subject, and which prohibits the impeachment of a verdict with a juror's testimony
""as to . . . the effect of anything upon his or any juror's mind or emotions . . except that [such testimony is admissible on the question] whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror.""
This Rule is supported by substantial policy considerations, including the need to assure full and frank discussion in the privacy of the jury room, to prevent the harassment of jurors by losing parties, and to preserve the community's trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople.  Petitioners' argument that substance abuse constitutes an improper ""outside influence"" about which jurors may testify under the Rule is without merit in light of contrary judicial interpretation of the common law rule, as well as Rule 606(b)'s plain language and legislative history.  Even if the Rule is interpreted to retain a common law exception allowing postverdict inquiry into juror incompetence in cases of ""substantial if not wholly conclusive evidence of incompetency,"" the record here falls far short of the extremely strong showing of incompetency that the exception requires.  Pp.  483 U. S. 116-126.
(b) An evidentiary hearing, including juror testimony on drug and alcohol use, was not required under petitioners' Sixth Amendment right to trial by a competent and unimpaired jury.  That right is adequately protected by several aspects of the trial process, including voir dire, the fact that the preverdict conduct of jurors is observable by the court, by counsel, by court personnel, and by other jurors, and by the fact that, as here, the trial court may allow a post-trial evidentiary hearing to impeach the verdict by nonjuror evidence of juror misconduct.  Pp.  483 U. S. 126-127.
2. To the extent the evidence established a conspiracy by petitioners to defraud Seminole, their actions did not violate  371, which prohibits conspiracies ""to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof.""  The Government's argument that Seminole, as the recipient of federal financial assistance, and the subject of federal supervision, must be 
Page 483 U. S. 109
 treated as ""the United States"" under  371 is untenable, in light of the statute's plain and unambiguous language and the Government's concession that Seminole is not an ""agency"" thereunder, and in the absence of any indication in the legislative history that  371 should be expanded to cover conspiracies to defraud those acting on behalf of the United States.  Given the immense variety of federal assistance arrangements, the Government's suggested requirement that there be ""substantial ongoing federal supervision"" of the defrauded nongovernmental intermediary before a crime against the United States occurs fails to provide any real guidance.  However, to the extent that the evidence was sufficient to establish that petitioners conspired to cause Seminole to make misrepresentations to the REA, petitioners'  371 convictions may stand.  On remand, the Court of Appeals must consider the sufficiency of the evidence on this charge.  Pp.  483 U. S. 128-132.
3. If, on remand, the premise on which the Court of Appeals based its affirmance of the mail fraud convictions under  1341 -- that petitioners' actions constituted a conspiracy to defraud the United States under  371 -- is rejected, that court must consider whether the evidence established a scheme to defraud Seminole through the use of the mails.  Pp.  483 U. S. 133-134.

No. 86-497
Argued April 21, 1987
Decided June 22, 1987*
483 U.S. 143

Syllabus 
In February 1978, petitioner Crown Life Insurance Co. terminated its relationship with its agent, respondent Malley-Duff & Associates (Malley-Duff), for failure to satisfy a production quota.  Alleging, inter alia, that the real reason for the termination was petitioners' desire to acquire its lucrative territory, Malley-Duff brought suit in March, 1981, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  The Federal District Court granted petitioners' summary judgment motion, dismissing the RICO claims on the ground that they were barred by Pennsylvania's 2-year fraud statute of limitations.  In the absence of a RICO statute of limitations, the court concluded that the 2-year statute was the best state law analogy.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the State's ""catchall"" 6-year residual statute of limitations contained the appropriate limitations period for all RICO claims arising in the State.
Held:
1. The 4-year statute of limitations applicable to Clayton Act civil enforcement actions, 15 U.S.C.  15b, applies in RICO civil enforcement actions.  Because the predicate acts that may establish a civil RICO violation are far ranging and cannot be reduced to a single generic classification, and because important RICO concepts were unknown to common law, there is a need for a uniform limitations period for civil RICO in order to avoid intolerable uncertainty for parties and time-consuming litigation.  The Clayton Act offers the closest analogy to civil RICO, in light of similarities in purpose and structure between the statutes, and the clear legislative intent to pattern RICO's civil enforcement provision on the Clayton Act's.  Moreover, the Clayton Act provides a far closer analogy to RICO than any state statute.  It is unlikely that Congress intended state ""catchall"" statutes of limitations to apply, or that such statutes would fairly serve the federal interests vindicated by RICO, and, in those States that do not have catchalls, any selection of a state statute would be at odds with RICO's sui generis nature.  RICO cases 
Page 483 U. S. 144
 commonly involve interstate transactions, and the possibility of a multiplicity of applicable state limitations periods presents the dangers of forum-shopping and of complex, expensive, and unnecessary litigation.  Application of a uniform federal period also avoids the possibility that application of unduly short state periods would thwart the legislative purpose of providing an effective remedy.  Section 15b is preferable to the ""catchall"" federal 5-year statute of limitations that applies in RICO criminal prosecutions, since that statute does not reflect any congressional balancing of the competing equities unique to RICO civil enforcement actions.  Pp.  483 U. S. 146-156.
2. Because this litigation was filed less than four years after Malley-Duff's termination as Crown Life's agent, which is the earliest time Malley-Duff's RICO action could have accrued, the litigation is timely.  Pp.  483 U. S. 156-157.

Louisiana's ""Creationism Act"" forbids the teaching of the theory of evolution in public elementary and secondary schools unless accompanied by instruction in the theory of ""creation science.""  The Act does not require the teaching of either theory unless the other is taught.  It defines the theories as ""the scientific evidences for [creation or evolution] and inferences from those scientific evidences.""  Appellees, who include Louisiana parents, teachers, and religious leaders, challenged the Act's constitutionality in Federal District Court, seeking an injunction and declaratory relief.  The District Court granted summary judgment to appellees, holding that the Act violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose.  Pp.  482 U. S. 585-594.
(a) The Act does not further its stated secular purpose of ""protecting academic freedom.""  It does not enhance the freedom of teachers to teach what they choose, and fails to further the goal of ""teaching all of the evidence.""  Forbidding the teaching of evolution when creation science is not also taught undermines the provision of a comprehensive scientific education.  Moreover, requiring the teaching of creation science with evolution does not give schoolteachers a flexibility that they did not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the presentation of theories, besides evolution, about the origin of life.  Furthermore, the contention that the Act furthers a ""basic concept of fairness"" by requiring the teaching of all of the evidence on the subject is without merit.  Indeed, the Act evinces a discriminatory preference for the teaching of creation science and against the teaching of evolution by requiring that curriculum guides be developed and resource services supplied for teaching creationism, but not for teaching evolution, by limiting membership on the resource services panel to ""creation scientists,"" and by forbidding school boards to discriminate against anyone who ""chooses to be a creation scientist"" or to teach creation science, while failing to protect those who choose to teach other theories or who refuse 
Page 482 U. S. 579
 to teach creation science.  A law intended to maximize the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of science instruction would encourage the teaching of all scientific theories about human origins.  Instead, this Act has the distinctly different purpose of discrediting evolution by counterbalancing its teaching at every turn with the teaching of creationism.  Pp.  482 U. S. 586-589.
(b) The Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.  The legislative history demonstrates that the term ""creation science,"" as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.  The Act's primary purpose was to change the public school science curriculum to provide persuasive advantage to a particular religious doctrine that rejects the factual basis of evolution in its entirety.  Thus, the Act is designed either to promote the theory of creation science that embodies a particular religious tenet or to prohibit the teaching of a scientific theory disfavored by certain religious sects.  In either case, the Act violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  482 U. S. 589-594.
2. The District Court did not err in granting summary judgment upon a finding that appellants had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.  Appellants relied on the ""uncontroverted"" affidavits of scientists, theologians, and an education administrator defining creation science as ""origin through abrupt appearance in complex form"" and alleging that such a viewpoint constitutes a true scientific theory.  The District Court, in its discretion, properly concluded that the postenactment testimony of these experts concerning the possible technical meanings of the Act's terms would not illuminate the contemporaneous purpose of the state legislature when it passed the Act.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an attorney who maintained both his residence and his law office in Mississippi and who was a member of the Mississippi and Louisiana State Bars, was denied admission to the Bar of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana because he neither lived nor had an office in Louisiana, as required by the court's local Rule 21.2.  He was also ineligible under the court's Rule 21.3.1, which requires continuous and uninterrupted Louisiana residence or maintenance of a Louisiana law office for continuing eligibility in the bar.  He sought a writ of prohibition from the Court of Appeals, alleging that the restrictions in the Rules were unconstitutional on their face and as applied to him.  The court remanded the case to the District Court for appropriate proceedings and entry of an appealable judgment.  That court upheld Rule 21.2 as constitutional.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court was not empowered to adopt Rules requiring members of the Louisiana Bar who apply for admission to its bar to live, or maintain an office, in Louisiana.  Pp.  482 U. S. 645-651.
(a) A district court has discretion to adopt local rules that are necessary to carry out its business, including rules governing admission to its bar.  However, this Court may exercise its inherent supervisory power (as it does here) to ensure that local rules are consistent with principles of right and justice.  Pp.  482 U. S. 645-646.
(b) Rule 21.2's residence requirement is unnecessary, and arbitrarily discriminates against out-of-state attorneys who are members of the Louisiana Bar and are willing to pay the necessary fees and dues in order to be admitted to the Eastern District Bar.  There is no reason to believe that such attorneys are less competent than resident attorneys.  Moreover, other more effective means of ensuring the competence of bar members are available to the district courts, including examination or seminar attendance requirements.  Nor does an alleged need for immediate availability of attorneys require a blanket rule that denies all nonresident attorneys admission to a district court bar.  As a practical matter, a high percentage of nonresident attorneys willing to take the state bar examination and pay the annual dues will reside in places reasonably 
Page 482 U. S. 642
 convenient to the district court.  Moreover, modern communication systems make it possible to minimize the problem of unavailability, and district courts also have alternative means to ensure prompt attendance at important conferences.  Pp.  482 U. S. 646-649.
(c) The in-state office requirement is similarly unnecessary and irrational.  It is not imposed on a lawyer residing in Louisiana whose only office is out-of-state and who is equally as unavailable to the court as a nonresident lawyer with an out-of-state office.  Nor does the mere fact that an attorney has an office in Louisiana warrant the assumption that he or she is more competent than an out-of-state member of the state bar.  Moreover, any need the court may have to ensure the availability of attorneys does not justify the in-state office requirement.  There is no link between residency within a State and proximity to a courthouse.  P.  482 U. S. 650.
(d) The contention that nonresident lawyers are not totally foreclosed from Eastern District practice because they can appear pro hac vice is unpersuasive.  Such alternative does not allow the nonresident attorney to practice on the same terms as a resident member of the bar.  In order to appear pro hac vice under the District Court's Rules, a lawyer must associate with a member of the court's bar.  Such association imposes a financial and administrative burden on nonresident counsel.  Furthermore, ""local"" counsel may be located much farther from the courthouse than the out-of-state counsel.

No. 85-1626

482 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
In 1973, petitioners in No. 85-1626 (hereinafter petitioners), including individual employees of Lukens Steel Co. (Lukens), brought suit in Federal District Court against Lukens and the employees' collective bargaining agents (Unions), asserting racial discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.  1981.  The court held that Pennsylvania's 6-year statute of limitations governing contract claims applied to  1981 claims, that Lukens had discriminated in certain respects, and that the Unions were also guilty of discriminatory practices in failing to challenge Lukens' discriminatory discharges of probationary employees, in failing and refusing to assert instances of racial discrimination as grievances, and in tolerating and tacitly encouraging racial harassment.  The court entered injunctive orders against Lukens and the Unions, reserving damages issues for further proceedings.  The Court of Appeals held that Pennsylvania's 2-year statute of limitations governing personal injury actions, rather than the 6-year statute, controlled the  1981 claims, but affirmed the liability judgment against the Unions.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals was correct in selecting the Pennsylvania 2-year limitations period governing personal injury actions as the most analogous state statute of limitations to govern all  1981 suits.  Section 1981 speaks not only to personal rights to contract, but also to personal rights to sue, to testify, and to equal rights under all laws for the security of persons and property; and all persons are to be subject to like punishments, taxes, and burdens of every kind.  Cf. Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261.  The Court of Appeals also properly concluded that the 2-year statute should be applied retroactively to petitioners here, even though the court overruled its prior 1977 and 1978 decisions that refused to apply Pennsylvania's 2-year personal injury statute to the  1981 claims involved in those cases.  Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, advises that nonretroactivity is appropriate in certain circumstances, including when the decision overrules clear Circuit precedent on which the complaining party is entitled to rely.  However, until the Court of 
Page 482 U. S. 657
 Appeals' 1977 decision, there had been no authoritative specification of which statute of limitations applied to an employee's  1981 claims, and hence no clear precedent on which petitioners could have relied when they filed their complaint in 1973.  As for the other Chevron factors, applying the 2-year statute here will not frustrate any federal law or result in inequity to the workers, who are charged with knowledge that it was an unsettled question as to how far back from the date of filing their complaint the damages period would reach.  Pp.  482 U. S. 660-664.
2. The courts below properly held that the Unions violated Title VII and  1981.  Because both courts agreed on the facts pertaining to whether the Unions had treated blacks and whites differently and intended to discriminate on the basis of race, this Court will not examine the record, absent the Unions' showing of extraordinary reasons for doing so.  There is no merit to the Unions' contention that the judgment rests on the erroneous legal premise that Title VII and  1981 are violated if a union passively sits by and does not affirmatively oppose the employer's racially discriminatory employment practices.  In fact, both courts below concluded that the case against the Unions was one of more than mere acquiescence, in that the Unions deliberately chose not to assert claims of racial discrimination by the employer.  Nor is there any merit to the argument that the only basis for Title VII liability was  703(c)(3)'s prohibition against a union's causing or attempting to cause illegal discrimination by an employer, which was not supported by the record.  Both courts found that the Unions had discriminated on the basis of race by the way in which they represented the workers, and the Court of Appeals held that the deliberate choice not to process grievances violated  703(c)(1), the plain language of which supports such conclusion.  Furthermore, the District Court properly rejected the Unions' explanation that, in order not to antagonize the employer, they did not include racial discrimination claims in grievances claiming other contract violations.  A union that intentionally fails to assert discrimination claims, either to avoid antagonizing the employer, and thus to improve chances of success on other issues, or in deference to the desires of its white membership, is liable under both Title VII and  1981, regardless of whether, as a subjective matter, its leaders are favorably disposed toward minorities.  Pp.  482 U. S. 664-669.
777 F.2d 113, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Respondent junkyard owner's business consists, in part, of dismantling automobiles and selling their parts. Pursuant to a New York statute authorizing warrantless inspections of automobile junkyards, police officers entered his junkyard and asked to see his license and records as to automobiles and vehicle parts in his possession.  He replied that he did not have such documents, which are required by the statute.  After announcing their intention to conduct an inspection of the junkyard pursuant to the statute, the officers, without objection by respondent, conducted the inspection and discovered stolen vehicles and parts.  Respondent, who was charged with possession of stolen property and unregistered operation as a vehicle dismantler, moved in state court to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the inspection, primarily on the ground that the administrative inspection statute was unconstitutional.  The court denied the motion, and the Appellate Division affirmed.  The New York Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statute violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.
Held:
1. A business owner's expectation of privacy in commercial property is attenuated with respect to commercial property employed in a ""closely regulated"" industry.  Where the owner's privacy interests are weakened and the government interests in regulating particular businesses are concomitantly heightened, a warrantless inspection of commercial premises, if it meets certain criteria, is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  482 U. S. 699-703.
2. Searches made pursuant to the New York statute fall within the exception to the warrant requirement for administrative inspections of ""closely regulated"" businesses.  Pp.  482 U. S. 703-712.
(a) The nature of the statute establishes that the operation of a junkyard, part of which is devoted to vehicle dismantling, is a ""closely regulated"" business.  Although the duration of a particular regulatory scheme has some relevancy, and New York's scheme regulating vehicle dismantlers can be said to be of fairly recent vintage, nevertheless, because widespread use of the automobile is relatively new, automobile junkyards and vehicle dismantlers have not been in existence very long, and thus do not have an ancient history of government oversight.  
Page 482 U. S. 692
 Moreover, the automobile junkyard business is simply a new branch of an industry -- general junkyards and secondhand shops -- that has existed, and has been closely regulated in New York, for many years.  Pp.  482 U. S. 703-707.
(b) New York's regulatory scheme satisfies the criteria necessary to make reasonable the warrantless inspections conducted pursuant to the inspection statute.  First, the State has a substantial interest in regulating the vehicle-dismantling and automobile junkyard industry because motor vehicle theft has increased in the State and because the problem of theft is associated with such industry.  Second, regulation of the industry reasonably serves the State's substantial interest in eradicating automobile theft, and warrantless administrative inspections pursuant to the statute are necessary to further the regulatory scheme.  Third, the statute provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.  It informs a business operator that regular inspections will be made, and also sets forth the scope of the inspection, notifying him as to how to comply with the statute and as to who is authorized to conduct an inspection.  Moreover, the ""time, place, and scope"" of the inspection is limited to impose appropriate restraints upon the inspecting officers' discretion.  Pp.  482 U. S. 708-712.
3. The New York inspection statute does not violate the Fourth Amendment on the ground that it was designed simply to give the police an expedient means of enforcing penal sanctions for possession of stolen property.  A State can address a major social problem both by way of an administrative scheme -- setting forth rules to guide an operator's conduct of its business and allowing government officials to ensure that such rules are followed -- and through penal sanctions.  Cf. United States v. Biswell, 406 U. S. 311.  New York's statute was designed to contribute to the regulatory goals of ensuring that vehicle dismantlers are legitimate businesspersons and that stolen vehicles and vehicle parts passing through automobile junkyards can be identified.  Nor is the administrative scheme unconstitutional simply because, in the course of enforcing it, an inspecting officer may discover evidence of crimes, besides violations of the scheme itself.  Moreover, there is no constitutional significance in the fact that police officers, rather than ""administrative"" agents, are permitted to conduct the administrative inspection.  So long as a regulatory scheme is properly administrative, it is not rendered illegal by the fact that the inspecting officer has the power to arrest individuals for violations other than those created by the scheme itself.

After a jury was sworn at respondent's Kentucky trial for committing sodomy with two minor girls, but before the presentation of evidence, the court conducted an in-chambers hearing to determine the girls' competency to testify.  Respondent, but not his counsel, was excluded from this hearing.  Under Kentucky law, when a child's competency to testify is raised, the judge is required to resolve whether the child is capable of observing, recollecting, and narrating the facts, and whether the child has a moral sense of the obligation to tell the truth.  Thus, during the hearing, the judge and the attorneys limited themselves to questions designed to determine whether the girls were capable of remembering basic facts and of distinguishing between truth and falsehood.  The judge ruled that both girls were competent to testify.  Before each girl began her substantive testimony in open court, the prosecutor repeated some of the background questions asked at the hearing, while respondent's counsel, on cross-examination, repeated other such questions, particularly those regarding the girls' ability to distinguish truth from lies.  After the girls' testimony was complete, respondent's counsel did not request that the court reconsider its competency rulings.  Respondent was convicted, but the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed, holding that respondent's exclusion from the competency hearing violated his right to confront the witnesses against him.
Held:
1. Respondent's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment were not violated by his exclusion from the competency hearing.  Pp.  482 U. S. 736-744.
(a) The Confrontation Clause's functional purpose is to promote reliability in criminal trials by ensuring a defendant an opportunity for cross-examination.  Pp.  482 U. S. 736-739.
(b) Rather than attempting to determine whether a competency hearing is a ""stage of trial"" (as opposed to a pretrial proceeding) subject to the Confrontation Clause's requirements, the more useful inquiry is whether excluding the defendant from the hearing interferes with his opportunity for cross-examination.  No such interference occurred here, because the two girls were cross-examined in open court with respondent present and available to assist his counsel, and because any questions 
Page 482 U. S. 731
 asked during the hearing could have been repeated during direct and cross-examination.  Moreover, the nature of the competency hearing militates against finding a Confrontation Clause violation, because questions at such hearings usually are limited to matters unrelated to basic trial issues.  In addition, the judge's responsibility to determine competency continues throughout the trial, so that a competency determination may be reconsidered on motion after the substantive examination of the child.  Pp.  482 U. S. 739-744.
2. Respondent's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated by his exclusion from the competency hearing.  The defendant's due process right to be present at critical stages of a criminal proceeding if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure is not implicated here in light of the particular nature of the competency hearing, whereby questioning was limited to competency issues and neither girl was asked about the substantive testimony she would give at trial.  There is no indication that respondent's presence at the hearing would have been useful in ensuring a more reliable competency determination.  Pp.  482 U. S. 745-747.

Syllabus 
After more than seven weeks in administrative segregation pending an investigation into his possible involvement in a state prison riot, respondent inmate was found guilty of misconduct by a prison hearing committee and sentenced to six months of disciplinary confinement solely on the basis of an officer's report of the statements of an undisclosed informant.  Respondent filed suit against petitioner prison officials for damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983, but was released on parole before any decision was rendered.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's entry of summary judgment against respondent, finding, inter alia, that his misconduct conviction constituted a denial of due process, since it was based solely on hearsay.  The District Court was instructed to enter summary judgment for respondent unless petitioners could establish an immunity defense, and was given authority to determine the appropriateness and availability of the relief respondent requested.  On remand, respondent pursued only his damages claim.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners on the basis of qualified immunity, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  While the appeal was pending, the State Corrections Bureau (Bureau) revised its regulations to include procedures for the use of confidential source information in inmate disciplinary proceedings.  The District Court then denied respondent's claim for attorney's fees on the ground that he was not a ""prevailing party"" as required by 42 U.S.C.  1988, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that its prior holding that his constitutional rights had been violated was ""a form of judicial relief.""  In the alternative, the court directed the District Court to reconsider whether respondent's suit was a ""catalyst"" for the amendment of the Bureau's regulations.
Held:  Respondent is not a ""prevailing party"" eligible for attorney's fees under  1988.  A plaintiff must receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to ""prevail.""  Respondent obtained neither a damages award, injunction, or declaratory judgment, nor a consent decree, settlement, or other relief without benefit of a formal judgment.  Pp.  482 U. S. 759-764.
(a) A favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff does not suffice to render him a 
Page 482 U. S. 756
 ""prevailing party.""  The Court of Appeals' treatment of its initial constitutional holding as ""a form of judicial relief"" -- presumably a form of declaratory judgment -- was in error, since the court neither granted nor ordered relief of any kind.  Even if respondent's nonmonetary claims were not rendered moot by his release from prison, and it could be said that those claims were kept alive by his interest in expunging his misconduct conviction from his prison record, his counsel never took the steps necessary to have a declaratory judgment or expungement order properly entered.  The argument that the Court of Appeals' initial holding is a ""vindication of rights"" that is at least the equivalent of declaratory relief ignores the fact that a judicial decree is not the end of the judicial process, but is rather the means of prompting some action (or cessation of action) by the defendant.  Here, respondent obtained nothing from petitioners.  Moreover, equating statements of law (even legal holdings en route to a final judgment for the defendant) with declaratory judgments has the practical effect of depriving the defendant of any valid defenses that a court might take into account in deciding whether to enter a declaratory judgment.  Furthermore, the same considerations that influence courts to issue declaratory judgments may not enter into the decision whether to include statements of law in opinions.  However, if they do, the court's decision is not appealable in the same manner as its entry of a declaratory judgment.  Pp.  482 U. S. 759-763.
(b) The alternative argument that a hearing is required to determine whether respondent's suit prompted the Bureau to amend its regulations also fails.  Even if respondent can demonstrate a clear causal link between his lawsuit and the amendment, and can ""prevail"" by having the State take action that his complaint did not in terms request, he did not obtain redress from that amendment, since he had long since been released from prison at the time it was issued.

482 U.S. 437

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  1920 provides that a federal court ""may tax"" specified items, including witness fees, as costs against the losing party, and  1821(b) states that a witness ""shall be paid"" a fee of $30 per day for court attendance.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) provides in part:
""Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.""
In No. 86-322, petitioners prevailed as the defendants in an antitrust action filed by respondent, and the Federal District Court awarded, as part of petitioners' costs, an amount for expert witness fees in excess of  1821(b)'s $30-per-day limit, holding that Rule 54(d) granted it discretion to exceed such limit.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that  1821(b)'s limit controlled.  In No. 86-328, petitioner prevailed in an action against it by respondents for alleged violations of federal civil rights statutes.  The Federal District Court refused to order respondents to reimburse petitioner for its expert witness fees to the extent they exceeded the $30-per-day limit, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  When a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its expert witnesses, a federal court is bound by the limits of  1821(b), absent contract or explicit statutory authority to the contrary.  There is no merit to petitioners' contentions that, since  1920 lists expenses which a court ""may"" tax as costs, it only authorizes taxation of such items, and does not preclude taxation for other items or amounts in excess of the  1821(b) fee; and that the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate power to tax expenses as costs.  If Rule 54(d) were so construed,  1920 would serve no role whatsoever.  The better view is that  1920 defines the term ""costs"" as used in Rule 54(d) and enumerates expenses that a federal court may tax as costs under the discretionary authority found in Rule 54(d).  Section 1920 is phrased permissibly because Rule 54(d) generally grants a federal court discretion to refuse to tax costs in favor of 
Page 482 U. S. 438
 the prevailing party.  Such discretion is not a power to evade the specific congressional command limiting the amount of witness fees.  Rather, it is solely a power to decline to tax, as costs, the items enumerated in  1920.  The dictum to the contrary in Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., 379 U. S. 227, is disapproved.  Henkel v. Chicago, S. P., M. & O. R. Co., 284 U.

Syllabus 
Upon shouting at police in an attempt to divert their attention from his friend during a confrontation, appellee was arrested for ""willfully . . . interrupt[ing] a city policeman . . . by verbal challenge during an investigation"" in violation of a municipal ordinance making it unlawful for any person ""to assault, strike or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty.""  After his acquittal in Municipal Court, appellee brought suit in Federal District Court challenging the ordinance's constitutionality and seeking, inter alia, damages and attorney's fees.  The District Court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance was substantially overbroad, since its literal wording punished and might deter a significant range of protected speech.
Held:
1. A municipal ordinance that makes it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his duty is substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid on its face under the First Amendment.  The ordinance in question criminalizes a substantial amount of, and is susceptible of regular application to, constitutionally protected speech, and accords the police unconstitutional enforcement discretion, as is demonstrated by evidence indicating that, although the ordinance's plain language is violated scores of times daily, only those individuals chosen by police in their unguided discretion are arrested.  Appellant's argument that the ordinance is not substantially overbroad because it does not inhibit the exposition of ideas, but simply bans unprotected ""core criminal conduct,"" is not persuasive.  Since the ordinance's language making it unlawful to ""assault"" or ""strike"" a police officer is expressly preempted by the State Penal Code, its enforceable portion prohibits verbal interruptions of police, and thereby deals with speech, rather than with core criminal conduct.  Moreover, although speech might be prohibited if it consists of ""fighting words"" that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace, the ordinance in question is not limited to such expressions, but broadly applies to speech that ""in any manner . . . interrupt[s] any policeman,"" and thereby impermissibly infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of individuals verbally to 
Page 482 U. S. 452
 oppose or challenge police action.  Appellant's contention that the ordinance's sweeping nature is both inevitable and essential to maintain public order is also without merit, since the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct or fighting words, but impermissibly provides police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that are simply annoying or offensive.  Pp.  482 U. S. 458-467.
2. Abstention -- assertedly to allow the state courts to reach a readily available limiting construction that would eliminate the ordinance's overbreadth -- would be inappropriate here.  Even if this case did not involve a First Amendment facial challenge, for which abstention is particularly inappropriate, the ordinance in question is plain and unambiguous, and thus is not susceptible to a limiting construction.  Moreover, it cannot be limited by severing discrete unconstitutional subsections, since its enforceable portion is unconstitutional in its entirety.  Even if the municipal courts had not had many opportunities to narrow the ordinance's scope, appellant's claim that state courts had not had the chance to construe the ordinance would be unavailing in light of the ordinance's nonambiguity.  Nor does the availability of certification to state courts under state law in itself render abstention appropriate where, as here, there is no uncertain question of state law to be resolved.  Pp.  482 U. S. 467-471.
3. Although the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order, the First Amendment requires that officers and municipalities respond with restraint in the face of verbal challenges to police action, since a certain amount of expressive disorder is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, and must be protected if that freedom would survive.  Pp.  482 U. S. 471-472.

Appellant's argument that the ordinance is not substantially overbroad because it does not inhibit the exposition of ideas, but simply bans unprotected ""core criminal conduct,"" is not persuasive.  Since the ordinance's language making it unlawful to ""assault"" or ""strike"" a police officer is expressly preempted by the State Penal Code, its enforceable portion prohibits verbal interruptions of police, and thereby deals with speech, rather than with core criminal conduct.  Moreover, although speech might be prohibited if it consists of ""fighting words"" that by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace, the ordinance in question is not limited to such expressions, but broadly applies to speech that ""in any manner . . . interrupt[s] any policeman,"" and thereby impermissibly infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of individuals verbally to 
Page 482 U. S. 452
 oppose or challenge police action.  Appellant's contention that the ordinance's sweeping nature is both inevitable and essential to maintain public order is also without merit, since the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to prohibit only disorderly conduct or fighting words, but impermissibly provides police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that are simply annoying or offensive.  Pp.  482 U. S. 458-467.
2. Abstention -- assertedly to allow the state courts to reach a readily available limiting construction that would eliminate the ordinance's overbreadth -- would be inappropriate here.  Even if this case did not involve a First Amendment facial challenge, for which abstention is particularly inappropriate, the ordinance in question is plain and unambiguous, and thus is not susceptible to a limiting construction.  Moreover, it cannot be limited by severing discrete unconstitutional subsections, since its enforceable portion is unconstitutional in its entirety.  Even if the municipal courts had not had many opportunities to narrow the ordinance's scope, appellant's claim that state courts had not had the chance to construe the ordinance would be unavailing in light of the ordinance's nonambiguity.  Nor does the availability of certification to state courts under state law in itself render abstention appropriate where, as here, there is no uncertain question of state law to be resolved.  Pp.  482 U. S. 467-471.
3. Although the preservation of liberty depends in part upon the maintenance of social order, the First Amendment requires that officers and municipalities respond with restraint in the face of verbal challenges to police action, since a certain amount of expressive disorder is inevitable in a society committed to individual freedom, and must be protected if that freedom would survive.  Pp.  482 U. S. 471-472.

Syllabus 
Appellee brought suit in California Superior Court against his former employer and appellants, two of its employees, alleging breach of contract and related causes of action arising from a dispute over commissions on securities sales.  After appellee refused to arbitrate, appellants filed a petition to compel arbitration under  2 and 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, which respectively provide that contractual arbitration provisions are valid and enforceable and mandate their judicial enforcement.  The demand for arbitration was based on a provision in a form appellee executed in connection with his employment application, whereby he agreed to arbitrate any dispute with his employer.  Appellee opposed arbitration on the ground that his suit was authorized by California Labor Code  229, which provides that wage collection actions may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate.  The court refused to compel arbitration, characterizing as ""controlling authority"" Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Ware, 414 U. S. 117, which upheld  229 in the face of a Supremacy Clause preemption challenge premised on an arbitration requirement in a New York Stock Exchange rule, which was promulgated pursuant to  6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act).  The State Court of Appeals affirmed.  Both lower courts refused to consider appellee's argument that appellants lacked ""standing"" to enforce the arbitration agreement, since they were not parties to it.
Held:
1. Under the Supremacy Clause,  2 of the Federal Arbitration Act preempts  229 of the California Labor Code.  In enacting  2, Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the States' power to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims that contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.  Ware is distinguishable on the ground that the language and policies of the 1934 Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder evidenced no clear federal intent to require arbitration.  The oblique reference to the Federal Arbitration Act in footnote 15 of Ware cannot fairly be read as a definitive holding that that Act does not preempt  229, since the footnote was concerned with federally created rights, and did not address the issue of federal preemption of state-created rights.  Pp.  482 U. S. 489-491. 
Page 482 U. S. 484

2. Appellee's contention that resolving in appellants' favor the question of their ""standing"" to enforce the agreement to arbitrate is a prerequisite under Article III of the Constitution to their maintenance of this appeal is rejected.  Appellee's ""standing"" argument -- which this Court does not reach because the lower courts did not address it -- simply presents the straightforward contract interpretation issue whether the arbitration provision inures to appellants' benefit and may be construed to cover the present dispute.  That issue may be resolved on remand, and its status as an alternative ground for denying arbitration does not prevent this Court from reviewing the lower courts' holdings on the preemption question.

Syllabus 
Having found petitioner guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and related crimes, the jury sentenced him to death after considering a presentence report prepared by the State of Maryland.  The report included a victim impact statement (VIS), as required by state statute.  The VIS was based on interviews with the family of the two victims, and it provided the jury with two types of information.  First, it described the severe emotional impact of the crimes on the family, and the personal characteristics of the victims.  Second, it set forth the family members' opinions and characterizations of the crimes and of petitioner.  The state trial court denied petitioner's motion to suppress the VIS, rejecting the argument that this information was irrelevant, unduly inflammatory, and therefore violative of the Eighth Amendment.  The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence, finding that the VIS did not inject an arbitrary factor into the sentencing decision.  The court concluded that a VIS serves an important interest by informing the sentencer of the full measure of harm caused by the crime.
Held:  The introduction of a VIS at the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial violates the Eighth Amendment, and therefore the Maryland statute is invalid to the extent it requires consideration of this information.  Such information is irrelevant to a capital sentencing decision, and its admission creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk that the jury may impose the death penalty in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Pp.  482 U. S. 503-509.
(a) The State's contention that the presence or absence of emotional distress of the victims' family and the victims' personal characteristics are proper sentencing considerations in a capital case is rejected.  In such a case, the sentencing jury must focus on the background and record of the accused and the particular circumstances of the crime.  The VIS information in question may be wholly unrelated to the blameworthiness of a particular defendant, and may cause the sentencing decision to turn on irrelevant factors such as the degree to which the victim's family is willing and able to articulate its grief, or the relative worth of the victim's character.  Thus, the evidence in question could improperly divert the jury's attention away from the defendant.  Moreover, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to provide a fair opportunity to 
Page 482 U. S. 497
 rebut such evidence without shifting the focus of the sentencing hearing away from the defendant.  Pp.  482 U. S. 503-507.
(b) The admission of the family members' emotionally charged opinions and characterizations of the crimes could serve no other purpose than to inflame the jury and divert it from deciding the case on the relevant evidence concerning the crime and the defendant.  Such admission is therefore inconsistent with the reasoned decisionmaking required in capital cases.  Pp.  482 U. S. 508-509.

Syllabus 
The United States, France, and 15 other countries have acceded to the Hague Evidence Convention, which prescribes procedures by which a judicial authority in one contracting state may request evidence located in another.  Plaintiffs brought suits (later consolidated) in Federal District Court for personal injuries resulting from the crash of an aircraft built and sold by petitioners, two corporations owned by France.  Petitioners answered the complaints without questioning the court's jurisdiction, and engaged in initial discovery without objection.  However, when plaintiffs served subsequent discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioners filed a motion for a protective order, alleging that the Convention dictated the exclusive procedures that must be followed since petitioners are French and the discovery sought could only be had in France.  A Magistrate denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals denied petitioners' mandamus petition, holding, inter alia, that, when a district court has jurisdiction over a foreign litigant, the Convention does not apply even though the information sought may be physically located within the territory of a foreign signatory to the Convention.
Held:
1. The Convention does not provide exclusive or mandatory procedures for obtaining documents and information located in a foreign signatory's territory.  The Convention's plain language, as well as the history of its proposal and ratification by the United States, unambiguously supports the conclusion that it was intended to establish optional procedures for obtaining evidence abroad.  Its preamble speaks in nonmandatory terms, specifying its purpose to ""facilitate"" discovery and to ""improve mutual judicial cooperation.""  Similarly, its text uses permissive language, and does not expressly modify the law of contracting states or require them to use the specified procedures or change their own procedures.  The Convention does not deprive the District Court of its jurisdiction to order, under the Federal Rules, a foreign national party to produce evidence physically located within a signatory nation.  Pp.  482 U. S. 529-540. 
Page 482 U. S. 523

2. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the Convention ""does not apply"" to discovery sought from a foreign litigant that is subject to an American court's jurisdiction.  Although they are not mandatory, the Convention's procedures are available whenever they will facilitate the gathering of evidence, and ""apply"" in the sense that they are one method of seeking evidence that a court may elect to employ.  Pp.  482 U. S. 640-641.
3. International comity does not require in all instances that American litigants first resort to Convention procedures before initiating discovery under the Federal Rules.  In many situations, Convention procedures would be unduly time-consuming and expensive, and less likely to produce needed evidence than direct use of the Federal Rules.  The concept of comity requires, in this context, a more particularized analysis of the respective interests of the foreign and requesting nations than a blanket ""first resort"" rule would generate.  Thus, the determination whether to resort to the Convention requires prior scrutiny in each case of the particular facts, sovereign interests, and likelihood that such resort will prove effective.

Decided June 15, 1987
482 U.S. 569

Syllabus 
Petitioner Board of Airport Commissioners of Los Angeles adopted a resolution banning all ""First Amendment activities"" within the ""Central Terminal Area"" at Los Angeles International Airport. Respondents, a nonprofit religious corporation and a minister for that organization, filed an action in Federal District Court challenging the resolution's constitutionality, after the minister had stopped distributing free religious literature in the airport's Central Terminal Area when warned against doing so by an airport officer.  The court held that the Central Terminal Area was a traditional public forum under federal law, and that the resolution was facially unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The resolution violates the First Amendment.  It is facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine regardless of whether the forum involved is a public or nonpublic forum (which need not be decided here).  The resolution's facial overbreadth is substantial, since it prohibits all protected expression and does not merely regulate expressive activity that might create problems such as congestion or the disruption of airport users' activities.  Under such a sweeping ban, virtually every individual who enters the airport may be found to violate the resolution by engaging in some ""First Amendment activit[y].""  The ban would be unconstitutional even if the airport were a nonpublic forum, because no conceivable governmental interest would justify such an absolute prohibition of speech.  Moreover, the resolution's words leave no room for a narrowing, saving construction by state courts.  Cf. Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360.  The suggestion that the resolution is not substantially overbroad because it is intended to reach only expressive activity unrelated to airport-related purposes is unpersuasive.  Much nondisruptive speech may not be airport related, but is still protected speech even in a nonpublic forum.  Moreover, the vagueness of the suggested construction -- which would result in giving airport officials the power to decide in the first instance whether a given activity is airport-related -- presents serious constitutional difficulty.

In 1957, appellant church purchased land on which it operated a campground, known as ""Lutherglen,"" as a retreat center and a recreational area for handicapped children.  The land is located in a canyon along the banks of a creek that is the natural drainage channel for a watershed area.  In 1978, a flood destroyed Lutherglen's buildings.  In response to the flood, appellee Los Angeles County, in 1979, adopted an interim ordinance prohibiting the construction or reconstruction of any building or structure in an interim flood protection area that included the land on which Lutherglen had stood.  Shortly after the ordinance was adopted, appellant filed suit in a California court, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinance denied appellant all use of Lutherglen, and seeking to recover damages in inverse condemnation for such loss of use.  The court granted a motion to strike the allegation, basing its ruling on Agins v. Tiburon, 24 Cal.3d 266, 598 P.2d 25, aff'd on other grounds, 447 U. S. 255, in which the California Supreme Court held that a landowner may not maintain an inverse condemnation suit based upon a ""regulatory"" taking, and that compensation is not required until the challenged regulation or ordinance has been held excessive in an action for declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus and the government has nevertheless decided to continue the regulation in effect.  Because appellant alleged a regulatory taking and sought only damages, the trial court deemed the allegation that the ordinance denied all use of Lutherglen to be irrelevant.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held:
1. The claim that the Agins case improperly held that the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not require compensation as a remedy for ""temporary"" regulatory takings -- those regulatory takings which are ultimately invalidated by the courts -- is properly presented in this case.  In earlier cases, this Court was unable to reach the question because either the regulations considered to be in issue by the state courts did not effect a taking or the factual disputes yet to be resolved by state authorities might still lead to the conclusion that no taking had occurred.  Here, the California Court of Appeal assumed 
Page 482 U. S. 305
 that the complaint sought damages for the uncompensated ""taking"" of all use of Lutherglen by the ordinance, and relied on the California Supreme Court's Agins decision for the conclusion that the remedy for the taking was limited to nonmonetary relief, thus isolating the remedial question for this Court's consideration.  MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U. S. 340; Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U. S. 172; San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego, 450 U. S. 621; and Agins, all distinguished.  Pp.  482 U. S. 311-313.
2. Under the Just Compensation Clause, where the government has ""taken"" property by a land use regulation, the landowner may recover damages for the time before it is finally determined that the regulation constitutes a ""taking"" of his property.  The Clause is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.  A landowner is entitled to bring an action in inverse condemnation as a result of the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to compensation.  While the typical taking occurs when the government acts to condemn property in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, the doctrine of inverse condemnation is predicated on the proposition that a taking may occur without such formal proceedings.  ""Temporary"" regulatory takings which, as here, deny a landowner all use of his property, are not different in kind from permanent takings for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation.  Once a court determines that a taking has occurred, the government retains the whole range of options already available -- amendment of the regulation, withdrawal of the invalidated regulation, or exercise of eminent domain.  But where the government's activities have already worked a taking of all use of property, no subsequent action by the government can relieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the period during which the taking was effective.  Invalidation of the ordinance without payment of fair value for the use of the property during such period would be a constitutionally insufficient remedy.  Pp.  482 U. S. 314-322.

Syllabus 
In 1957, appellant church purchased land on which it operated a campground, known as ""Lutherglen,"" as a retreat center and a recreational area for handicapped children.  The land is located in a canyon along the banks of a creek that is the natural drainage channel for a watershed area.  In 1978, a flood destroyed Lutherglen's buildings.

No. 85-1722
Argued March 24, 1987
Decided June 9, 1987
482 U.S. 342

Syllabus 
Respondents, prison inmates and members of the Islamic faith, brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 contending that two policies adopted by New Jersey prison officials prevented them from attending Jumu'ah, a Muslim congregational service held on Friday afternoons, and thereby violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  The first such policy, Standard 853, required inmates in respondents' custody classifications to work outside the buildings in which they were housed and in which Jumu'ah was held, while the second, a policy memorandum, prohibited inmates assigned to outside work from returning to those buildings during the day.  The Federal District Court concluded that no constitutional violation had occurred, but the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, ruling that the prison policies could be sustained only if the State showed that the challenged regulations were intended to and did serve the penological goal of security, and that no reasonable method existed by which prisoners' religious rights could be accommodated without creating bona fide security problems.  The court also held that the expert testimony of prison officials should be given due weight on, but is not dispositive of, the accommodation issue.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in placing the burden on prison officials to disprove the availability of alternative methods of accommodating prisoners' religious rights.  That approach fails to reflect the respect and deference the Constitution allows for the judgment of prison administrators.  P.  482 U. S. 350.
2. The District Court's findings establish that the policies challenged here are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, and therefore do not offend the Free Exercise Clause.  Both policies have a rational connection to the legitimate governmental interests in institutional order and security invoked to justify them, as is demonstrated by findings that Standard 853 was a response to critical overcrowding and was designed to ease tension and drain on the facilities during that part of the day when the inmates were outside, and that the policy memorandum was necessary since returns from outside work details generated congestion and delays at the main gate, a high-risk area, and since the 
Page 482 U. S. 343
 need to decide return requests placed pressure on guards supervising outside work details.  Rehabilitative concerns also support the policy memorandum, in light of testimony indicating that corrections officials sought thereby to simulate working conditions and responsibilities in society.  Although the policies at issue may prevent some Muslim prisoners from attending Jumu'ah, their reasonableness is supported by the fact that they do not deprive respondents of all forms of religious exercise, but instead allow participation in a number of Muslim religious ceremonies.  Furthermore, there are no obvious, easy alternatives to the policies, since both of respondents' suggested accommodations would, in the judgment of prison officials, have adverse effects on the prison institution.  Placing all Muslim inmates in inside work details would be inconsistent with the legitimate concerns underlying Standard 853, while providing weekend labor for Muslims would require extra supervision that would be a drain on scarce human resources.  Both proposed accommodations would also threaten prison security by fostering ""affinity groups"" likely to challenge institutional authority, while any special arrangements for one group would create a perception of favoritism on the part of other inmates.  Pp.  482 U. S. 350-353.
3. Even where claims are made under the First Amendment, this Court will not substitute its judgment on difficult and sensitive matters of institutional administration for the determinations of those charged with the formidable task of running a prison.  P.  482 U. S. 353.

No. 86-461
Argued April 1, 1987
Decided June 9, 1987
482 U.S. 369

Syllabus 
In Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U. S. 1, the Court held that the mandatory language and structure of a Nebraska parole-release statute created an ""expectancy of release,"" a liberty interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Montana statute at issue in this case provides that a prisoner eligible for parole ""shall"" be released when there is a reasonable probability that no detriment will result to him or the community, and specifies that parole shall be ordered for the best interests of society, and when the State Board of Pardons (Board) believes that the prisoner is able and willing to assume the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.  After being denied parole, respondent prisoners filed a civil rights action against petitioners, the Board and its Chair, alleging that the Board denied them due process by failing to apply the statutorily mandated criteria in determining parole eligibility, and failing adequately to explain its reasons for parole denials.  Although acknowledging that the case was controlled by principles established in Greenholtz, the District Court ruled that respondents were not entitled to due process protections in connection with their parole denials, concluding that, because the Board is required to make determinations with respect to the best interests of the community and the prisoner, its discretion is too broad to provide a prisoner with a liberty interest in parole release.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, finding the Montana statute virtually indistinguishable in structure and language from the statute considered in Greenholtz.
Held:  When scrutinized under the Greenholtz standards, the Montana statute clearly creates a liberty interest in parole release that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although, as in Greenholtz, the release decision here is ""necessarily . . . subjective and predictive"" and the Board's discretion ""very broad,"" nevertheless, the Montana statute, like the Nebraska statute, uses mandatory language (""shall"") to create a presumption that parole release will be granted when the designated findings are made.  This presumption exists whether, as in Greenholtz, the statute mandates release ""unless"" the required findings are made, or whether, as here, release is necessary ""when"" or ""if"" the findings are made or is mandated ""subject to"" them.  Moreover, the ""substantive predicates"" of release in Montana are similar 
Page 482 U. S. 370
 to those in Nebraska, since each statute requires consideration of the impact of release on both the prisoner and the community, of the prisoner's ability to lead a law-abiding life, and of whether release will cause a ""detriment to . . . the community,"" and each statute vests the State's parole board with equivalent discretion.  That the Montana statute places significant limits on the Board's discretion is further demonstrated by its replacement of an earlier statute which allowed absolute discretion, its specifying as its purpose the creation of restrictions on that discretion, and its addition of a provision authorizing judicial review of parole-release decisions.  Pp.  482 U. S. 373-381.  792 F.2d 1404, affirmed.

Argued April 21, 1987
Decided June 9, 1987
482 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
Caterpillar Tractor Co. (Caterpillar) hired respondents to work at its San Leandro, California, facility in positions covered by its collective bargaining agreement with a union.  Respondents eventually assumed management and other positions outside the bargaining unit, and allegedly were repeatedly assured by Caterpillar that, if the San Leandro facility ever closed, Caterpillar would employ them at other facilities.  Subsequently, they were downgraded to unionized positions, but allegedly assured that the downgrades were temporary.  However, Caterpillar later notified them that its San Leandro plant would close and that they would be laid off.  Respondents then filed this action, based solely on state law, in a California state court, alleging that Caterpillar thereby breached their individual employment contracts.  Caterpillar removed the action to Federal District Court, arguing that removal was proper because any individual employment contracts made with respondents were, as a matter of federal substantive labor law, merged into and superseded by the collective bargaining agreement.  Respondents denied that they alleged any federal claim, and sought remand of the action to the state court.  The Federal District Court held that removal was proper, and dismissed the case when respondents refused to amend the complaint to attempt to state a claim under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, which confers federal jurisdiction as to suits for violations of collective bargaining agreements.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the case was improperly removed.
Held:  Respondents' state law complaint for breach of the individual employment contracts is not removable to Federal District Court.  Pp.  482 U. S. 391-399.
(a) The presence or absence of federal question jurisdiction that will support removal is governed by the ""well-pleaded complaint rule,"" under which federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the properly pleaded complaint.  Ordinarily, a case may not be removed on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of preemption, even if the defense is anticipated in the complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.  However, under the ""complete preemption doctrine,"" which is a corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule, once an area of state law has been completely preempted, any claim purportedly 
Page 482 U. S. 387
 based on that preempted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law.  Pp.  482 U. S. 391-394.
(b) Respondents' state law contract claims are not ""completely preempted""  301 claims.  Section 301 governs claims founded directly on rights created by collective bargaining agreements and claims substantially dependent on analysis of such agreements.  However, respondents alleged that Caterpillar breached individual employment contracts with them, and  301 says nothing about the content or validity of such contracts.  Although respondents, as bargaining unit employees at the time of the plant closing, could have brought suit under the collective agreement, they, as masters of the complaint, chose not to do so.  Moreover, their complaint is not substantially dependent upon interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  482 U. S. 394-395.
(c) J. I. Case Co. v. NLRB, 321 U. S. 332, does not support Caterpillar's contention that, when respondents returned to the collective bargaining unit, their individual employment contracts were subsumed into, or eliminated by, the collective bargaining agreement so as to be preempted by  301.  That decision does not stand for the general proposition that all individual employment contracts are inevitably superseded by a subsequent collective agreement.  The fact that an employer may raise such a question in state court and might ultimately prove that the employee's claims are preempted does not establish that they are removable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 395-398.
(d) There is no merit to Caterpillar's argument that  301 preempts a state law claim when the employer raises only a defense that requires a court to interpret or apply a collective bargaining agreement, such as Caterpillar's defense claiming that, in its collective bargaining agreement, its unionized employees waived any preexisting individual employment contract rights.  The presence of a federal question, even a  301 question, in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule.  Pp.  482 U. S. 398-399.
786 F.2d 928, affirmed.

Moreover, their complaint is not substantially dependent upon interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  482 U. S. 394-395.
(c) J. I. Case Co. v. NLRB, 321 U. S. 332, does not support Caterpillar's contention that, when respondents returned to the collective bargaining unit, their individual employment contracts were subsumed into, or eliminated by, the collective bargaining agreement so as to be preempted by  301.  That decision does not stand for the general proposition that all individual employment contracts are inevitably superseded by a subsequent collective agreement.  The fact that an employer may raise such a question in state court and might ultimately prove that the employee's claims are preempted does not establish that they are removable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 395-398.
(d) There is no merit to Caterpillar's argument that  301 preempts a state law claim when the employer raises only a defense that requires a court to interpret or apply a collective bargaining agreement, such as Caterpillar's defense claiming that, in its collective bargaining agreement, its unionized employees waived any preexisting individual employment contract rights.  The presence of a federal question, even a  301 question, in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule.  Pp.  482 U. S. 398-399.
786 F.2d 928, affirmed.

482 U.S. 400

Syllabus 
The Extradition Act, which implements the Extradition Clause of Article IV, requires an asylum State to give up to a demanding State a fugitive against whom a properly certified indictment has been lodged.  After a California custody decree was modified to give Richard Smolin sole custody of his minor children and he secured a California warrant to obtain custody, he and his father picked up the children in Louisiana, where they were living with their mother.  The mother then swore out an affidavit charging the Smolins with kidnaping, on the basis of which an information was filed charging them with violating a Louisiana statute prohibiting a parent's intentional taking of his own child from any person to whom custody has been awarded by any state court of competent jurisdiction.  After the Governor of Louisiana formally notified the Governor of California of the charges and demanded that the Smolins be delivered up for trial, the California Superior Court granted them a writ of habeas corpus to block the extradition warrants against them.  Taking judicial notice of the California custody orders, the court concluded that the Smolins were not substantially charged with crime under Louisiana law.  Although the California Court of Appeal then issued a writ of mandate on the ground that the Superior Court had abused its discretion, the State Supreme Court reversed, finding that the California custody decrees were properly considered by the Superior Court, and that, under the full faith and credit provisions of the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, those decrees conclusively established that Richard Smolin was the childrens' lawful custodian at the time he took them.  The court ruled that the Smolins had not been substantially charged with a crime, since, under Louisiana law, the lawful custodian of children cannot be guilty of kidnaping them.
Held:  The Extradition Act prohibits the California Supreme Court from refusing to permit extradition.  The language, history, and subsequent construction of the Act establish that extradition is meant to be a summary procedure, and that the asylum State's courts may do no more than ascertain whether (a) the extradition documents on their face are in order; (b) the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding 
Page 482 U. S. 401
 State; (c) the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and (d) the petitioner is a fugitive.  Here, the only such inquiry in doubt is whether the Smolins have been charged with a crime in Louisiana, which question must be answered in the affirmative, since the information charging them is in proper form, and they do not dispute that the wife's affidavit, and documents incorporated by reference therein, set forth facts that clearly satisfy each element of the crime defined in the state parental kidnaping statute.  Their contention that the requirement of Roberts v. Reilly, 116 U. S. 80,  116 U. S. 95, that the person demanded be ""substantially charged"" permits an inquiry by the asylum State into whether the charging instrument is sufficient to withstand a generalized motion to dismiss or common law demurrer is without merit.  To the contrary, the asylum State may do no more than ascertain whether the requisites of the Extradition Act have been met, and may not entertain defenses or determine the guilt or innocence of the charged party.  Thus, it is for the Louisiana courts to determine whether the wife's affidavit is fraudulent, whether the California custody decrees establish Richard Smolin as the children's lawful custodian under the full faith and credit provision of the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act, and whether the Smolins were, accordingly, not guilty of violating the Louisiana statute.

Syllabus 
Florida's sentencing guidelines law assigns points for particular offenses and other factors and provides a presumptive sentence range for a defendant's composite score, within which the sentencing judge has unreviewable discretion to fix a sentence without written explanation.  If the judge wishes to depart from the range, however, he must give clear and convincing written reasons based on facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the sentence he imposes is subject to appellate review.  At the time petitioner committed the sexual battery and other crimes for which he was convicted, the sentencing guidelines would have resulted in a presumptive sentence of 3 /2 to 4 1/2 years' imprisonment.  However, the guidelines were subsequently revised to increase the number of points assigned to sexual offenses, and, at the time petitioner was sentenced, called for a presumptive sentence of 5 1/2 to 7 years for his crimes.  The sentencing judge, rejecting petitioner's ex post facto argument, applied the revised guidelines to impose a 7-year sentence.  The State District Court of Appeal vacated the sentence, but the State Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  Application of the revised guidelines law to petitioner, whose crimes occurred before the law's effective date, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I of the Federal Constitution.  The revised law evidences all of the elements necessary to bring it within the ex post facto prohibition.  Pp.  482 U. S. 429-435.
(a) The revised guidelines law is retrospective, in that it changes the legal consequences of acts committed before its effective date.  The State's argument that there was no ex post facto violation, since the law provides for continuous review of the guidelines, and thereby gave petitioner ""fair warning"" that he would be sentenced under the guidelines in effect on his sentencing date is not persuasive, since the law did not warn petitioner of the specific punishment prescribed for his crimes.  The ex post facto prohibition cannot be avoided merely by adding to a law notice of the obvious fact that it might be changed.  Pp.  482 U. S. 430-431.
(b) The revised guidelines law is more onerous than the law in effect at the time of petitioner's crimes, in that it substantially disadvantages petitioner and similarly situated sexual offenders and has no ameliorative features.  The State's contention that the change in laws is not disadvantageous because the trial judge could have imposed a 7-year 
Page 482 U. S. 424
 sentence under the old guidelines by departing from the presumptive sentence range then in existence is without merit, since the revised law foreclosed petitioner's ability to challenge the sentence on review because it is within the new presumptive range.  Pp.  482 U. S. 431-433.
(c) The revised guidelines law is not merely a procedural change, since it increases the quantum of punishment for sexual offenses.  The State's contention that the increase operates only as a ""procedural guidepost"" for the exercise of judicial discretion within the same statutorily imposed sentencing limits is not persuasive.  The Court of Appeals decisions cited as authority, which sustained the United States Parole Commission's guidelines against ex post facto claims, are inapposite.  Unlike the federal guidelines, Florida's revised sentencing law was enacted by the state legislature, and has the force and effect of law.  Nor do the revised guidelines simply provide flexible ""guideposts,"" but instead create strict standards that must be met before the sentencing judge can depart from the presumptive sentence range.

ON EXCEPTIONS TO REPORT OF SPECIAL MASTER
The 1949 Pecos River Compact between New Mexico and Texas divides the water of the Pecos River between the States, but, because of the river's irregular flow, does not specify a particular amount of water to be delivered by New Mexico to Texas each year.  Instead, Article III(a) of the Compact provides that
""New Mexico shall not deplete by man's activities the flow of the Pecos River at the New Mexico-Texas state line below an amount which will give to Texas a quantity of water equivalent to that available to Texas under the 1947 condition.""
In 1974, Texas filed this original action to resolve a dispute between the States with respect to the ""1947 condition"" and other matters.  A Special Master was appointed, and this Court previously adopted his report specifying the methodology to be used in calculating Texas' entitlement to water.  The case is now before the Court on both parties' exceptions to the Master's recent report calculating the acre-feet shortfall of water that should have been delivered to Texas for the years 1950-1983, and recommending that, in addition to performing its ongoing obligation under the Compact, New Mexico be ordered to make up the accumulated shortfall by delivering a specified amount of water each year for 10 years, with a penalty in kind, i.e., ""water interest,"" for any bad-faith failure to deliver the additional amounts.

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act (Act) defines ""disability"" as the ""inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment. . . .""  42 U.S.C.  423(d)(1)(A).  The Act also provides that an individual
""shall be determined to be under a disability only if his . . . impairment [is] of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other . . . substantial gainful work. . . .""
 423(d)(2)(A).  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) has established a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a person is disabled.  In step two of that process, the ""severity regulation"" provides:
""If you do not have any impairment . . . which significantly limits your . . . ability to do basic work activities, we will find that you do not have a severe impairment and are, therefore, not disabled.  We will not consider your age, education, and work experience.""
Respondent applied for disability benefits, but the appropriate state agency determined that she was not disabled.  In light of the medical evidence and evidence of her activities, the Social Security Administration (SSA) Administrative Law Judge concluded that her medically determinable impairments were not severe under the severity regulation, and the SSA's Appeals Council denied her request for review.  The Federal District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that the Act does not authorize benefits denials based solely on a determination that the claimant is not severely impaired, and that  423(d)(2)(A) requires that both medical and vocational factors such as age, education, and work experience be considered in determining disability.  The court rejected the Secretary's contention that the 1984 amendments to the Act endorsed step two of the disability evaluation process, and invalidated the severity regulation.
Held:
1. The severity regulation is valid on its face under the language of the Act and the legislative history.   482 U. S.  142-152.
(a) The severity regulation is not inconsistent with  423(d)(1)(A), which defines ""disability"" in terms of the effect an impairment has on a 
Page 482 U. S. 138
 person's ability to function in the workplace.  The regulation adopts precisely this functional approach to determining the effects of medical impairments, when it requires the claimant to show that he has an ""impairment . . . which significantly limits"" ""the abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs.""  If the impairment is not severe enough to so limit the claimant, by definition it does not prevent the claimant from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.  Moreover,  423(d)(5)(A) expressly gives the Secretary the authority to place the burden of showing a medically determinable impairment on the claimant.  The requirement of a threshold showing of severity also is consistent with the legislative history of  423(d)(1)(A).  Pp.  482 U. S. 146-147.
(b) The severity regulation is not inconsistent with  423(d)(2)(A), which restricts disability benefit eligibility to claimants whose medically severe impairments prevent them from doing their previous work and any other substantial gainful work in the national economy.  If a claimant is unable to show that he has a medically severe impairment, he is not eligible for benefits, and there is no reason for the Secretary to consider his age, education, and work experience.  The legislative history reinforces this understanding of the statutory language.   482 U. S.  147-149.
(c) In enacting  4(a)(1) of the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C.  423(d)(2)(C), Congress expressed its approval of the severity regulation both in the statute and in the accompanying Reports, recognizing that the Secretary may make an initial determination of medical severity, and that he need not consider the claimant's age, education, and experience unless he finds ""a medically severe combination of impairments.""   482 U. S.  149-162.
2. The severity regulation increases the efficiency and reliability of the disability evaluation process by identifying at an early stage those claimants whose medical impairments are so slight that it is unlikely they would be found to be disabled even if their age, education, and experience were taken into account.   482 U. S.  153-154.

Under financial instruments commonly known as ""Ginnie Maes,"" the issuing private financial institution has the primary obligation of making timely principal and interest payments.  However, in order to attract investors into the private mortgage market, Ginnie Maes also contain a provision whereby the Government National Mortgage Association, a Government corporation, guarantees payment if the issuer defaults.  After state taxing officials included the value of appellant's Ginnie Mae portfolio in calculating net assets, appellant filed suit challenging its annual property tax assessment.  The state courts rejected appellant's contention that the Ginnie Maes could not be taxed under the constitutional principle of intergovernmental tax immunity and under Revised Statutes  3701, which exempts from state taxation ""all stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States.""
Held:  Ginnie Maes are not exempt from state taxation under  3701.  The statutory phrase ""other obligations of the United States"" refers only to obligations or securities of the same type as those specifically enumerated.  Ginnie Maes are fundamentally different from the enumerated instruments, in that the Government's obligation as guarantor is secondary and contingent.  Nor is the indirect, contingent, and unliquidated promise that the Government makes in Ginnie Maes the type of obligation that is protected by the constitutional principle of intergovernmental tax immunity.  The purpose of that principle is to prevent States from taxing federal obligations in a manner which has an adverse effect on the United States' borrowing ability.  Ginnie Maes' failure to include a binding governmental promise to pay specified sums at specified dates renders any threat to the federal borrowing power far too attenuated to support constitutional immunity.

No. 85-1772
Argued March 23, 1987
Decided June 8, 1987
482 U.S. 193

Syllabus 
After the Federal Government, in 1976, issued oil and gas leases for lands underlying Utah Lake, a navigable body of water located in Utah, the State brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that it, rather than the United States, had title to the lakebed under the equal footing doctrine.  Under that doctrine, the United States holds the lands under navigable waters in the Territories in trust for the future States, and, absent a prior conveyance by the Federal Government to third parties, a State acquires title to such lands upon entering the Union on an ""equal footing"" with the original 13 States.  The Utah Enabling Act of 1894 provided that Utah was to be so admitted.  The United States answered in the District Court that title to the lakebed remained in federal ownership by operation of a United States Geological Survey official's selection of the lake as a reservoir site in 1889 pursuant to an 1888 Act that provided that all lands which might be so selected were reserved as the property of the United States, and were not subject to entry, settlement, or occupation.  Although the 1888 Act was repealed in 1890, the 1890 Act provided that
""reservoir sites heretofore located or selected shall remain segregated and reserved from entry or settlement as provided by [the 1888 Act].""
The District Court granted summary judgment for the United States, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Title to Utah Lake's bed passed to Utah under the equal footing doctrine upon Utah's admission to the Union.  Pp.  482 U. S. 200-209.
(a) Even assuming, arguendo, that a federal reservation of the lakebed -- as opposed to a conveyance by the Federal Government to a third party -- could defeat Utah's claim to title under the equal footing doctrine, such defeat was not accomplished on the facts here.  There is a strong presumption against finding congressional intent to defeat a State's title, and, in light of the longstanding policy of the Federal Government's holding land under navigable waters for the ultimate benefit of future States absent exceptional circumstances, an intent to defeat a State's equal footing entitlement could not be inferred from the mere act of reservation itself.  The United States would not merely be required to establish that Congress clearly intended to include land under navigable 
Page 482 U. S. 194
 waters within the federal reservation, but would additionally have to establish that Congress affirmatively intended to defeat the future State's title to such land.  Pp.  482 U. S. 200-202.
(b) The 1888 Act fails to make sufficiently plain a congressional intent to include the bed of Utah Lake within the Federal Government's reservation.  The Act's language did not necessarily refer to lands under navigable waters, which lands were already the property of the United States, and were already exempt from sale, entry, settlement, or occupation under the general land laws.  Moreover, the concerns that motivated Congress to enact the statute -- concerns as to homesteaders' possible monoplization of and speculation in arid lands suitable for reservoir sites or irrigation works -- had nothing to do with the beds of navigable waters.  There is no merit to the Federal Government's contention that, in view of remarks made by the Geological Survey in reserving Utah Lake, Congress' enactment of the 1890 Act ratified the Survey's reservation of the lakebed.  The Survey's references to the ""segregation"" of the lakebed, placed in the proper context, could refer to the segregation of the lands adjacent to the lake.  Moreover, neither the language nor the legislative history of the 1890 Act supports the conclusion that Congress intended to ratify a reservation of the lakebed.   482 U. S.  202-207.
(c) Even assuming that Congress did intend to reserve the lakebed in either the 1888 Act or the 1890 Act, Congress did not clearly express an intention to defeat Utah's claim to the lakebed under the equal footing doctrine upon entry into statehood.  The 1888 Act's structure and history strongly suggest that Congress had no such intent.  Moreover, the transfer of title of the lakebed to Utah would not necessarily prevent the Federal Government from subsequently developing a reservoir or water reclamation project at the lake, in any event.  The broad sweep of the 1888 Act, which had the practical effect of reserving all of the public lands in the West from settlement, cannot be reconciled with an intent to defeat the States' title to the land under navigable waters under the equal footing doctrine.   482 U.

No. 86-44
Argued March 3, 1987
Decided June 8, 1987
482 U.S. 220

Syllabus 
Respondents were customers of petitioner Shearson/American Express Inc. (Shearson), a brokerage firm registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under customer agreements providing for arbitration of any controversy relating to their accounts.  Respondents filed suit in Federal District Court against Shearson and its representative (also a petitioner here) who handled their accounts, alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions in  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and SEC Rule 10b-5, and of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  Petitioners moved to compel arbitration of the claims pursuant to  3 of the Federal Arbitration Act, which requires a court to stay its proceedings if it is satisfied that an issue before it is arbitrable under an arbitration agreement.  The District Court held that respondents' Exchange Act claims were arbitrable, but that their RICO claim was not.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the RICO claim, but reversed as to the Exchange Act claims.
Held:
1. The Arbitration Act establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration, requiring that the courts rigorously enforce arbitration agreements.  This duty is not diminished when a party bound by an agreement raises a claim founded on statutory rights. The Act's mandate may be overridden by a contrary congressional command, but the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show that Congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.  Such intent may be discernible from the statute's text, history, or purposes.  Pp.  482 U. S. 225-227.
2. Respondents' Exchange Act claims are arbitrable under the provisions of the Arbitration Act.  Congressional intent to require a judicial forum for the resolution of  10(b) claims cannot be deduced from  29(a) of the Exchange Act, which declares void an agreement to waive ""compliance with any provision of [the Act].""  Section 29(a) only prohibits waiver of the Act's substantive obligations, and thus does not void waiver of  27 of the Act, which confers exclusive district court jurisdiction of violations of the Act, but which does not impose any statutory duties.  
Page 482 U. S. 221
 Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, which held that claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which has similar anti-waiver and jurisdictional provisions, were not subject to compulsory arbitration under an arbitration agreement, does not control here.  That case must be read as barring waiver of a judicial forum only where arbitration is inadequate to protect the substantive rights at issue.  Cf. Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506.  There is no merit to respondents' contention, based on Wilko, that their arbitration agreements effected an impermissible waiver of the Exchange Act's substantive protections.  Even if Wilko's assumptions regarding arbitration were valid at the time it was decided -- when there was judicial mistrust of the arbitral process -- such assumptions do not hold true today for arbitration procedures (such as those involved here) subject to the SEC's oversight authority under the intervening changes in the regulatory structure of the securities laws.  Nor does the legislative history support respondents' argument that, even if  29(a) as enacted does not void predispute arbitration agreements, Congress subsequently has indicated that  29(a) should be so interpreted.  Pp.  482 U. S. 227-238.
3. Respondents' RICO claim is also arbitrable under the Arbitration Act.  Nothing in RIC0's text or legislative history even arguably evinces congressional intent to exclude civil RICO claims for treble damages under 18 U.S.C.  1964(c) from the Arbitration Act's dictates.  Nor is there any irreconcilable conflict between arbitration and RIC0's underlying purposes.  Cf. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614.  Neither the potential complexity of RICO claims nor the ""overlap"" between RICO's civil and criminal provisions renders  1964(c) claims nonarbitrable.  Moreover, the public interest in the enforcement of RICO does not preclude submission of such claims to arbitration.  The legislative history of  1964(c) emphasized the remedial role of the treble-damages provision.  Its policing function, although important, was a secondary concern.  The private attorney general role for the typical RICO plaintiff does not support a finding that there is an irreconcilable conflict between arbitration and enforcement of RICO.  Pp.  482 U. S. 238-242.

|482 u.s. 270|"Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers
No. 85-792
Argued November 10, 1986
Decided June 8, 1987*
482 U.S. 270

Syllabus 
In October, 1982, petitioner Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) issued an order which, inter alia, granted petitioner Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. and another railroad the right to conduct operations using the tracks of a third, newly consolidated carrier.  In April, 1983, respondent Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) filed a ""Petition for Clarification"" asking the ICC to declare that the earlier order did not authorize the tenant railroads to use their own crews on routes they had not previously served.  In an order served on May 18, 1983, the ICC denied the petition, ruling that its prior decision did not require clarification, since the tenant railroads' trackage rights applications had proposed that they use their own crews and the Commission's approval of the applications authorized such operations.  BLE and respondent United Transportation Union then filed timely petitions for reconsideration of the May 18 order, contending, inter alia, that the tenant railroads' crewing procedures violated employee protections that had been included in the original order.  In an order served on October 25, 1983, the ICC denied these petitions, responding in detail to the unions' contentions.  On respondent unions' petitions for review, the Court of Appeals vacated the ICC orders of May 18 and October 25, rejecting the threshold claim that its review was time-barred, and ruling for the unions on the merits.
Held:
1. Although respondent unions' petitions for Court of Appeals review of the ICC's October 25, 1983, order were timely filed, they should have been dismissed, since the order itself, whereby the Commission refused to reconsider its May 18, 1983, order refusing to clarify its prior approval order, is unreviewable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 277-284.
(a) Since an ICC order in a rail proceeding is ""final on the date on which it is served,"" the unions' petitions for review of the October 25 order, which petitions were filed with the Court of Appeals on December 
Page 482 U. S. 271
 16 and 23, 1983, were timely under the Hobbs Act, which requires that any person aggrieved by an ICC final order file a review petition within 60 days after the order's entry.  P.  482 U. S. 277.
(b) Only when a petition to reopen and reconsider an agency order alleges new evidence or changed circumstances is the agency's refusal to reopen subject to judicial review, and then only as to whether such refusal was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.  Where, as here, the petition to reopen is based not on new data, but only on alleged ""material error,"" the agency's denial of the petition is not subject to judicial review.  Such an appeal would place before the court precisely the same substance that could have been brought before it by timely appeal from the original order.  Review in that circumstance would serve no purpose if the reconsideration petition were filed within the agency's discretionary review period (and within the period for judicial review of the original order), since the petition would toll the judicial review period, and thereby preserve a direct appeal of the original order until reconsideration was denied.  On the other hand, if the reconsideration petition were untimely filed, judicial review would serve only the peculiar purpose of extending indefinitely the time within which seriously mistaken agency orders could be judicially overturned, since it would have to be shown not only that the original agency decision was unlawful, but that it was so unlawful that refusal to reconsider it is an abuse of discretion.  It is irrelevant that the ICC's order discussed respondent unions' substantive claims at length, since it is the Commission's formal action, rather than its discussion, that is dispositive as to whether reconsideration was in fact granted or denied.  Pp.  482 U. S. 277-281.
(c) In addition to being implicit in the Hobbs Act's 60-day limitation on seeking judicial review, nonreviewability of refusals to reopen for material error is established by 5 U.S.C.  701(a)(2), which precludes judicial review of action ""committed to agency discretion by law.""  Refusals to reopen have traditionally been reviewed only when new evidence or changed circumstances are alleged, and it is impossible to devise an adequate standard of review when only material error is alleged.  Application of the ordinary standards for reviewing errors of law and fact would entirely frustrate the Hobbs Act's time limitation, and the only other alternative -- some form of ""clearly erroneous"" standard -- would produce the strange result that only really bad mistakes (whatever that term might mean when considerable discretion is already afforded to agencies) would escape the time limitation.  Nor does agency action become reviewable merely because the agency gives a ""reviewable"" reason -- i.e., a reason that courts are well qualified to consider -- for that action.  Pp.  482 U. S. 281-284. 
Page 482 U. S. 272

2. Although the petition for Court of Appeals review of the ICC's May 18, 1983, order was timely filed, it should have been dismissed, since the order itself, which denied BLE's petition for clarification of the earlier trackage rights approval order, is not appealable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 284-287.
(a) Even though the petition for judicial review was filed more than 60 days after the May 18 order was served, it was nonetheless effective, because respondent unions' timely petitions for administrative reconsideration stayed the running of the Hobbs Act's filing period until the ICC denied reconsideration.  Although a contrary conclusion is suggested by the language of 49 U.S.C. 10327(i), which provides that, notwithstanding the statutory provision authorizing ICC reconsideration of its orders, a Commission action is final and can be appealed on the day it is served, in view of prior constructions of similar language in 5 U.S.C.  704, that language must be construed merely to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for reconsideration before seeking judicial review, but not to prevent reconsideration petitions that are actually filed from rendering orders under reconsideration nonfinal.

			"|"Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers
No. 85-792
Argued November 10, 1986
Decided June 8, 1987*
482 U.S. 270

Syllabus 
In October, 1982, petitioner Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) issued an order which, inter alia, granted petitioner Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. and another railroad the right to conduct operations using the tracks of a third, newly consolidated carrier.  In April, 1983, respondent Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) filed a ""Petition for Clarification"" asking the ICC to declare that the earlier order did not authorize the tenant railroads to use their own crews on routes they had not previously served.  In an order served on May 18, 1983, the ICC denied the petition, ruling that its prior decision did not require clarification, since the tenant railroads' trackage rights applications had proposed that they use their own crews and the Commission's approval of the applications authorized such operations.  BLE and respondent United Transportation Union then filed timely petitions for reconsideration of the May 18 order, contending, inter alia, that the tenant railroads' crewing procedures violated employee protections that had been included in the original order.  In an order served on October 25, 1983, the ICC denied these petitions, responding in detail to the unions' contentions.  On respondent unions' petitions for review, the Court of Appeals vacated the ICC orders of May 18 and October 25, rejecting the threshold claim that its review was time-barred, and ruling for the unions on the merits.
Held:
1. Although respondent unions' petitions for Court of Appeals review of the ICC's October 25, 1983, order were timely filed, they should have been dismissed, since the order itself, whereby the Commission refused to reconsider its May 18, 1983, order refusing to clarify its prior approval order, is unreviewable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 277-284.
(a) Since an ICC order in a rail proceeding is ""final on the date on which it is served,"" the unions' petitions for review of the October 25 order, which petitions were filed with the Court of Appeals on December 
Page 482 U. S. 271
 16 and 23, 1983, were timely under the Hobbs Act, which requires that any person aggrieved by an ICC final order file a review petition within 60 days after the order's entry.  P.  482 U. S. 277.
(b) Only when a petition to reopen and reconsider an agency order alleges new evidence or changed circumstances is the agency's refusal to reopen subject to judicial review, and then only as to whether such refusal was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.  Where, as here, the petition to reopen is based not on new data, but only on alleged ""material error,"" the agency's denial of the petition is not subject to judicial review.  Such an appeal would place before the court precisely the same substance that could have been brought before it by timely appeal from the original order.  Review in that circumstance would serve no purpose if the reconsideration petition were filed within the agency's discretionary review period (and within the period for judicial review of the original order), since the petition would toll the judicial review period, and thereby preserve a direct appeal of the original order until reconsideration was denied.  On the other hand, if the reconsideration petition were untimely filed, judicial review would serve only the peculiar purpose of extending indefinitely the time within which seriously mistaken agency orders could be judicially overturned, since it would have to be shown not only that the original agency decision was unlawful, but that it was so unlawful that refusal to reconsider it is an abuse of discretion.  It is irrelevant that the ICC's order discussed respondent unions' substantive claims at length, since it is the Commission's formal action, rather than its discussion, that is dispositive as to whether reconsideration was in fact granted or denied.  Pp.  482 U. S. 277-281.
(c) In addition to being implicit in the Hobbs Act's 60-day limitation on seeking judicial review, nonreviewability of refusals to reopen for material error is established by 5 U.S.C.  701(a)(2), which precludes judicial review of action ""committed to agency discretion by law.""  Refusals to reopen have traditionally been reviewed only when new evidence or changed circumstances are alleged, and it is impossible to devise an adequate standard of review when only material error is alleged.  Application of the ordinary standards for reviewing errors of law and fact would entirely frustrate the Hobbs Act's time limitation, and the only other alternative -- some form of ""clearly erroneous"" standard -- would produce the strange result that only really bad mistakes (whatever that term might mean when considerable discretion is already afforded to agencies) would escape the time limitation.  Nor does agency action become reviewable merely because the agency gives a ""reviewable"" reason -- i.e., a reason that courts are well qualified to consider -- for that action.  Pp.  482 U. S. 281-284. 
Page 482 U. S. 272

2. Although the petition for Court of Appeals review of the ICC's May 18, 1983, order was timely filed, it should have been dismissed, since the order itself, which denied BLE's petition for clarification of the earlier trackage rights approval order, is not appealable.  Pp.  482 U. S. 284-287.
(a) Even though the petition for judicial review was filed more than 60 days after the May 18 order was served, it was nonetheless effective, because respondent unions' timely petitions for administrative reconsideration stayed the running of the Hobbs Act's filing period until the ICC denied reconsideration.  Although a contrary conclusion is suggested by the language of 49 U.S.C. 10327(i), which provides that, notwithstanding the statutory provision authorizing ICC reconsideration of its orders, a Commission action is final and can be appealed on the day it is served, in view of prior constructions of similar language in 5 U.S.C.  704, that language must be construed merely to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for reconsideration before seeking judicial review, but not to prevent reconsideration petitions that are actually filed from rendering orders under reconsideration nonfinal.  Pp.  482 U. S. 284-285.
(b) If BLE's petition is treated as a genuine ""Petition for Clarification"" -- i. e., as seeking only a specification, one way or the other, of what the original order meant -- its denial is unappealable because BLE could not be considered ""aggrieved"" under the Hobbs Act by the ICC's unambiguous explanation in the order of what the earlier order meant.  If, as is more likely, BLE's petition was actually treated by the parties as a petition to reopen based on what BLE felt to be a serious error of law, the petition's denial is unreviewable under the Court's analysis, supra, since BLE put forth no new evidence or changed circumstances.

 June 8, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Oklahoma, Fourth Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether a state court may proceed to adjudicate a case after a removal petition has been filed in federal court . The respondents in this case brought a negligence action against the petitioner and an individual defendant in state court. After seven days of trial, the trial court dismissed the individual defendant. Petitioner then filed a removal petition in federal court, alleging diversity of citizenship. The state trial court proceeded despite the removal petition and the jury rendered a verdict against petitioner. Subsequently, the District Court held that the case was not properly removed because the individual defendant was dismissed on the merits and not, as petitioner contended, with the consent of the plaintiffs. The District Court remanded the case and the state trial court entered judgment against petitioner on the basis of the previously rendered jury verdict. 
 The trial court and the Oklahoma Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that the verdict against it is void under 28

No. 86-341
Argued March 24, 1987
Decided June 1, 1987
482 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
After appellant closed its poultry packaging and processing plant and laid off most of the employees who worked there, the Director of Maine's Bureau of Labor Standards filed suit to enforce the provisions of a state statute requiring employers, in the event of a plant closing, to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not covered by an express contract providing for severance pay.  The State Superior Court granted the Director summary judgment, holding appellant liable under the statute, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contentions that the state statute was preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
Held:
1. The Maine severance pay statute is not preempted by ERISA, since it does not ""relate to any employee benefit plan"" under that statute's preemption provision, 29 U.S.C.  1144(a).  Appellant's contention that any state law pertaining to a type of employee benefit listed in ERISA, such as severance pay, necessarily regulates an employee benefit plan, and is therefore preempted, fails in light of the plain meaning and underlying purpose of  1144(a) and the overall objectives of ERISA itself.  Pp.  482 U. S. 7-19.
(a) Section 1144(a) does not refer to state laws relating simply to ""employee benefits,"" but expressly states that state laws are superseded 
Page 482 U. S. 2
 insofar as they ""relate to any employee benefit plan"" (emphasis added).   In fact, ERISA uses the words ""benefit"" and ""plan"" separately throughout the statute, and nowhere treats them as equivalent.  Given the basic difference between the two concepts, Congress' choice of language is significant in its preemption of only the latter, which cannot be read out of ERISA.  In order to be preempted, a state statute must have some connection with, or reference to, a plan.  Pp.  482 U. S. 7-8.
(b) Premption of the Maine statute would not further the purpose of ERISA preemption, which is to allow plans to adopt a uniform scheme for coordinating complex administrative activities, unaffected by conflicting regulatory requirements in differing States.  The Maine statute neither establishes, nor requires an employer to maintain, a plan that would embody a set of administrative practices vulnerable to the burden imposed by a patchwork, multistate regulatory scheme.  In fact, the theoretical possibility of a one-time, lump-sum severance payment triggered by a single event requires no administrative scheme whatsoever to meet the employer's statutory obligation.  Pp.  482 U. S. 8-15.
(c) Similarly, the Maine statute does not implicate the regulatory concerns of ERISA itself, which was enacted to ensure administrative integrity in the operation of plans by preventing potential fiduciary abuse.  The Maine statute neither establishes a plan nor generates any administrative activity capable of being abused.  Pp.  482 U. S. 15-16.
(d) Appellant's contention that failure to preempt the Maine statute will allow employers to circumvent ERISA, by persuading States to require types of plans the employers would otherwise have established on their own, has no force with respect to a state statute that, as here, does not establish a plan, generates no ERISA-covered program activity, presents no risk that otherwise applicable federal requirements will be evaded by an employer or dislodged by a State, and creates no prospect that an employer will face difficulty in operating a unified administrative benefit payment scheme.  Holland v. Burlington Industries, Inc., 772 F.2d 1140, summarily aff'd, 477 U.S. 901, and Gilbert v. Burlington Industries, Inc., 765 F.2d 320, summarily aff'd, 477 U.S. 901, distinguished.  Pp.  482 U. S. 16-19.
(e) Where, as here, a state statute creates no danger of conflict with a federal statute, there is no reason to disable it from attempting to address uniquely local social and economic problems.  P.  482 U. S. 19.
2. The Maine severance pay statute is not preempted by the NLRA.  Appellant's argument that the statute's establishment of a minimum labor standard impermissibly intrudes upon the collective bargaining process was rejected in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, and is without merit here.  Although the statute does 
Page 482 U. S. 3
 give employees something for which they might otherwise have had to bargain, that is true of any state law that substantively regulates employment conditions.  Moreover, appellant's argument that this case is distinguishable from Metropolitan Life because the statutory obligation at issue here is optional, in that it applies only in the absence of an agreement between employer and employees, is not persuasive, since, in fact, the parties' freedom to devise their own severance pay arrangements strengthens the case that the statute works no intrusion on collective bargaining.  Thus, the statute is a valid and unexceptional exercise of the State's police power, and is compatible with the NLRA.  Pp.  482 U. S. 19-22.

Labor Relations Board
No. 85-1208
Argued March 2, 1987
Decided June 1, 1987
482 U.S. 27

Syllabus 
This case involves interpretation of the ruling in NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc., 406 U. S. 272, that the new employer, succeeding to another's business, had an obligation to bargain with the union representing the predecessor's employees.  Sterlingwale Corp., which had operated a textile dyeing and finishing plant, laid off all of its production employees in February, 1982, and finally went out of business in late summer.  During this period, one of its former officers and the president of one of its major customers formed petitioner company, intending to engage in one aspect of Sterlingwale's business and to take advantage of its assets and its workforce.  Petitioner acquired Sterlingwale's plant, real property, equipment, and some of its remaining inventory, and began operating out of Sterlingwale's former facilities and hiring employees in September, 1982, with an initial hiring goal of one full shift of workers.  In October, 1982, the union that had represented Sterlingwale's production and maintenance employees for almost 30 years requested petitioner to recognize it as the bargaining agent for petitioner's employees, and to begin collective bargaining.  Petitioner refused the request.  At that time, a majority of petitioner's employees were ex-Sterlingwale employees, as also was true in mid-January, 1983, when petitioner met its initial hiring goal of one shift of workers.  By mid-April, 1983, petitioner had reached two shifts, and, for the first time, ex-Sterlingwale employees were in the minority.  The same working conditions existed as under Sterlingwale, and over half of petitioner's business came from ex-Sterlingwale customers.  In November, 1982, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that in refusing to bargain petitioner violated  8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that (1) petitioner was a ""successor"" to Sterlingwale, (2) the proper date for determining whether the majority of petitioner's employees were ex-Sterlingwale employees (necessary to require petitioner to bargain with the union) was not mid-April, when petitioner had two shifts working, but mid-January, when petitioner had obtained a ""representative complement"" of employees, (3) the union's October, 1982, demand for bargaining (necessary to trigger petitioner's 
Page 482 U. S. 28
 obligation), although premature, was ""of a continuing nature,"" and was still in effect in mid-January, and (4) petitioner thus committed an unfair labor practice in refusing to bargain.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's decision, and the Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.
Held:
1. A ""successor"" employer's obligation to bargain is not limited to the situation (as in Burns) where the union in question only recently was certified before the transition in employers.  Where, as here, a union certified for more than one year has a rebuttable presumption of majority status, that status continues despite the change in employers.  Although the new employer is not bound by the substantive provisions of the predecessor's bargaining agreement, it has an obligation to bargain with the union so long as it is in fact a successor of the old employer and the majority of its employees were employed by its predecessor.  Pp.  482 U. S. 36-41.
2. Petitioner was a ""successor"" to Sterlingwale.  The Board's approach in determining this question, approved in Burns, is based upon the totality of the circumstances, and requires that the Board focus on whether there is ""substantial continuity"" between the enterprises, with particular emphasis on the retained employees' perspective as to whether their job situations are essentially unaltered.  The Board's determination that there was ""substantial continuity"" here, and that petitioner was Sterlingwale's successor, is supported by substantial evidence in the record.  It is not dispositive that there was a 7-month hiatus between Sterlingwale's demise and petitioner's start-up, or that employees were hired through newspaper advertisements, rather than through Sterlingwale's employment records.  Pp.  482 U. S. 42-46.
3. The Board's ""substantial and representative complement"" rule -- which fixes the moment when the determination is to be made as to whether a majority of the successor's employees are former employees of the predecessor, a moment that triggers the successor's bargaining obligation -- is reasonable in the successorship context.  Petitioner's proposal that majority status be determined instead at the ""full complement"" stage, so that all the employees would have a voice in the selection of their bargaining representative, fails to consider the employees' significant interest in being represented as soon as possible.  Nor does the Board's rule place an unreasonable burden on the employer.  The application of the Board's rule to the facts of this case, moreover, is supported by substantial record evidence.  Pp.  482 U. S. 46-52.
4. The Board's ""continuing demand"" rule -- whereby a union's premature demand for bargaining continues in effect until the successor acquires a ""substantial and representative complement"" of employees that triggers its obligation to bargain -- also is reasonable in the successorship 
Page 482 U. S. 29
 context.  The rule places a minimal burden on the successor, and makes sense in light of the union's position.  It would make no sense to require the union repeatedly to renew its bargaining demand in the hope of having it correspond with the ""substantial and representative complement"" date when, with little trouble, the employer can regard a previous demand as a continuing one.  Pp.  482 U. S. 52-54.

S. 272, that the new employer, succeeding to another's business, had an obligation to bargain with the union representing the predecessor's employees.  Sterlingwale Corp., which had operated a textile dyeing and finishing plant, laid off all of its production employees in February, 1982, and finally went out of business in late summer.  During this period, one of its former officers and the president of one of its major customers formed petitioner company, intending to engage in one aspect of Sterlingwale's business and to take advantage of its assets and its workforce.  Petitioner acquired Sterlingwale's plant, real property, equipment, and some of its remaining inventory, and began operating out of Sterlingwale's former facilities and hiring employees in September, 1982, with an initial hiring goal of one full shift of workers.  In October, 1982, the union that had represented Sterlingwale's production and maintenance employees for almost 30 years requested petitioner to recognize it as the bargaining agent for petitioner's employees, and to begin collective bargaining.  Petitioner refused the request.  At that time, a majority of petitioner's employees were ex-Sterlingwale employees, as also was true in mid-January, 1983, when petitioner met its initial hiring goal of one shift of workers.  By mid-April, 1983, petitioner had reached two shifts, and, for the first time, ex-Sterlingwale employees were in the minority.  The same working conditions existed as under Sterlingwale, and over half of petitioner's business came from ex-Sterlingwale customers.  In November, 1982, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that in refusing to bargain petitioner violated  8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that (1) petitioner was a ""successor"" to Sterlingwale, (2) the proper date for determining whether the majority of petitioner's employees were ex-Sterlingwale employees (necessary to require petitioner to bargain with the union) was not mid-April, when petitioner had two shifts working, but mid-January, when petitioner had obtained a ""representative complement"" of employees, (3) the union's October, 1982, demand for bargaining (necessary to trigger petitioner's 
Page 482 U. S. 28
 obligation), although premature, was ""of a continuing nature,"" and was still in effect in mid-January, and (4) petitioner thus committed an unfair labor practice in refusing to bargain.  The Board affirmed the ALJ's decision, and the Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order.
Held:
1. A ""successor"" employer's obligation to bargain is not limited to the situation (as in Burns) where the union in question only recently was certified before the transition in employers.  Where, as here, a union certified for more than one year has a rebuttable presumption of majority status, that status continues despite the change in employers.  Although the new employer is not bound by the substantive provisions of the predecessor's bargaining agreement, it has an obligation to bargain with the union so long as it is in fact a successor of the old employer and the majority of its employees were employed by its predecessor.  Pp.  482 U. S. 36-41.
2. Petitioner was a ""successor"" to Sterlingwale.  The Board's approach in determining this question, approved in Burns, is based upon the totality of the circumstances, and requires that the Board focus on whether there is ""substantial continuity"" between the enterprises, with particular emphasis on the retained employees' perspective as to whether their job situations are essentially unaltered.  The Board's determination that there was ""substantial continuity"" here, and that petitioner was Sterlingwale's successor, is supported by substantial evidence in the record.  It is not dispositive that there was a 7-month hiatus between Sterlingwale's demise and petitioner's start-up, or that employees were hired through newspaper advertisements, rather than through Sterlingwale's employment records.  Pp.  482 U. S. 42-46.
3. The Board's ""substantial and representative complement"" rule -- which fixes the moment when the determination is to be made as to whether a majority of the successor's employees are former employees of the predecessor, a moment that triggers the successor's bargaining obligation -- is reasonable in the successorship context.  Petitioner's proposal that majority status be determined instead at the ""full complement"" stage, so that all the employees would have a voice in the selection of their bargaining representative, fails to consider the employees' significant interest in being represented as soon as possible.  Nor does the Board's rule place an unreasonable burden on the employer.  The application of the Board's rule to the facts of this case, moreover, is supported by substantial record evidence.  Pp.  482 U. S. 46-52.
4. The Board's ""continuing demand"" rule -- whereby a union's premature demand for bargaining continues in effect until the successor acquires a ""substantial and representative complement"" of employees that triggers its obligation to bargain -- also is reasonable in the successorship 
Page 482 U. S. 29
 context.  The rule places a minimal burden on the successor, and makes sense in light of the union's position.  It would make no sense to require the union repeatedly to renew its bargaining demand in the hope of having it correspond with the ""substantial and representative complement"" date when, with little trouble, the employer can regard a previous demand as a continuing one.  Pp.  482 U. S. 52-54.

Syllabus 
Title 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(2) gives the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate jurisdiction over a variety of cases involving the Federal Government in which the District Court's jurisdiction was based, ""in whole or in part,"" on 28 U.S.C.  1346(a)(2), the Little Tucker Act, ""except that jurisdiction of an appeal in a case brought in a district court under [the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)] . . . shall be governed by"" provisions vesting jurisdiction in the regional Federal Courts of Appeals.  Respondents, a Japanese-American organization and individuals, brought suit in District Court seeking damages and declaratory relief for the tangible and intangible injuries suffered when, during World War II, the Federal Government removed approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans from their homes and placed them in internment camps.  Jurisdiction was based on the Little Tucker Act and the FTCA.  The District Court concluded that all claims were barred, but the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of certain Little Tucker Act claims.  The court held that it, rather than the Federal Circuit, had jurisdiction over the appeal.  Although noting that  1295(a)(2) generally grants the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction of appeals in cases involving nontax Little Tucker Act claims, the court concluded that Congress did not intend the Federal Circuit to hear such appeals when they also included FTCA claims.
Held:  The Federal Circuit, rather than the appropriate regional court of appeals, has jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court's decision of a ""mixed"" case raising both a nontax Little Tucker Act claim and an FTCA claim.   482 U. S.  68-76.
(a) Section 1295(a)(2) clearly establishes that the Federal Circuit has exclusive appellate jurisdiction of a case raising only a nontax Little Tucker Act claim, and that the appropriate regional court of appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction of a case raising only an FTCA claim.  However,  1295(a)(2)'s language does not clearly address a ""mixed"" case, and is thus inherently ambiguous on this point.   482 U. S.  68-69.
(b) Given this ambiguity, the more plausible reading of  1295(a)(2) is the Solicitor General's view that the section's ""except"" clause merely describes claims that do not suffice to create Federal Circuit jurisdiction, and that, thus, such claims must be heard in that court if they are joined 
Page 482 U. S. 65
 with claims that fall within its exclusive jurisdiction.  The proximity of the except clause to the ""granting"" clause at the beginning of  1295(a)(2) suggests that the except clause's failure to repeat the granting clause's ""in whole or in part"" phrase in characterizing FTCA claims was not accidental.  Moreover, the except clause's description of the excepted tax cases by reference to the basis of ""the claim"" suggests that the clause was directed at cases raising one, rather than multiple, claims.  Respondents' contention that the except clause indicates not only that FTCA claims fail to create Federal Circuit jurisdiction but also that the presence of such a claim renders inapplicable that court's otherwise exclusive jurisdiction over nontax Little Tucker Act claims is not persuasive.  Although it has some force, respondents' argument, which ultimately is based on a comparison of the language of the except clauses in  1295(a)(2) and 1295(a)(1), is more attenuated than the Solicitor General's view that rests simply on the variation between  1295(a)(2)'s own clauses.   482 U. S.  69-71.
(c) Given the comprehensive statutory framework, under which the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over every appeal from a Tucker Act or nontax Little Tucker Act claim, and the legislative history's strong expressions of the need for judicial uniformity in this area, it seems likely that Congress would have rendered explicit any intended exceptions.   482 U. S.  71-73.
(d) Also unpersuasive is respondents' argument that a congressional intent to deprive the Federal Circuit in ""mixed"" cases of its exclusive jurisdiction over nontax Little Tucker Act claims is evidenced by a congressional Report statement that FTCA appeals, because they frequently involve application of state law, would continue to be brought in the regional courts of appeals.  When viewed as a whole, the legislative history establishes that Congress intended for centralized determination of nontax Little Tucker Act claims to predominate over regional adjudication of FTCA claims.   482 U. S.  73-76.

Syllabus 
Respondent inmates brought a class action challenging two regulations promulgated by the Missouri Division of Corrections.  The first permits correspondence between immediate family members who are inmates at different institutions within the Division's jurisdiction, and between inmates ""concerning legal matters,"" but allows other inmate correspondence only if each inmate's classification/treatment team deems it in the best interests of the parties.  The second regulation permits an inmate to marry only with the prison superintendent's permission, which can be given only when there are ""compelling reasons"" to do so.  Testimony indicated that generally only a pregnancy or the birth of an illegitimate child would be considered ""compelling.""  The Federal District Court found both regulations unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The lower courts erred in ruling that Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, and its progeny require the application of a strict scrutiny standard of review for resolving respondents' constitutional complaints.  Rather, those cases indicate that a lesser standard is appropriate whereby inquiry is made into whether a prison regulation that impinges on inmates' constitutional rights is ""reasonably related"" to legitimate penological interests.  In determining reasonableness, relevant factors include (a) whether there is a ""valid, rational connection"" between the regulation and a legitimate and neutral governmental interest put forward to justify it, which connection cannot be so remote as to render the regulation arbitrary or irrational; (b) whether there are alternative means of exercising the asserted constitutional right that remain open to inmates, which alternatives, if they exist, will require a measure of judicial deference to the corrections officials' expertise; (c) whether and the extent to which accommodation of the asserted right will have an impact on prison staff, on inmates' liberty, and on the allocation of limited prison resources, which impact, if substantial, will require particular deference to corrections officials; and (d) whether the regulation represents an ""exaggerated response"" to prison concerns, the existence of a ready alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at de minimis 
Page 481 U. S. 79
 costs to valid penological interests being evidence of unreasonableness.   482 U. S.  84-91.
2. The Missouri inmate correspondence regulation is, on the record here, reasonable and facially valid.  The regulation is logically related to the legitimate security concerns of prison officials, who testified that mail between prisons can be used to communicate escape plans, to arrange violent acts, and to foster prison gang activity.  Moreover, the regulation does not deprive prisoners of all means of expression, but simply bars communication with a limited class of people -- other inmates -- with whom authorities have particular cause to be concerned.  The regulation is entitled to deference on the basis of the significant impact of prison correspondence on the liberty and safety of other prisoners and prison personnel, in light of officials' testimony that such correspondence facilitates the development of informal organizations that threaten safety and security at penal institutions.  Nor is there an obvious, easy alternative to the regulation, since monitoring inmate correspondence clearly would impose more than a de minimis cost in terms of the burden on staff resources required to conduct item-by-item censorship, and would create an appreciable risk of missing dangerous communications.  The regulation is content-neutral, and does not unconstitutionally abridge the First Amendment rights of prison inmates.  Pp.  482 U. S. 91-93.
3. The constitutional right of prisoners to marry is impermissibly burdened by the Missouri marriage regulation.   482 U. S.  94-99.
(a) Prisoners have a constitutionally protected right to marry under Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U. S. 374.  Although such a marriage is subject to substantial restrictions as a result of incarceration, sufficient important attributes of marriage remain to form a constitutionally protected relationship.  Butler v. Wilson, 415 U.S. 953, distinguished.   482 U. S.  94-96.
(b) The regulation is facially invalid under the reasonable relationship test.  Although prison officials may regulate the time and circumstances under which a marriage takes place, and may require prior approval by the warden, the almost complete ban on marriages here is not, on the record, reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.  The contention that the regulation serves security concerns by preventing ""love triangles"" that may lead to violent inmate confrontations is without merit, since inmate rivalries are likely to develop with or without a formal marriage ceremony.   Moreover, the regulation's broad prohibition is not justified by the security of fellow inmates and prison staff, who are not affected where the inmate makes the private decision to marry a civilian.  Rather, the regulation represents an exaggerated response to the claimed security objectives, since allowing marriages unless the warden finds a threat to security, order, or the public safety represents 
Page 482 U. S. 80
 an obvious, easy alternative that would accommodate the right to marry while imposing a de minimis burden.  Nor is the regulation reasonably related to the articulated rehabilitation goal of fostering self-reliance by female prisoners.  In requiring refusal of permission to marry to all inmates absent a compelling reason, the regulation sweeps much more broadly than is necessary, in light of officials' testimony that male inmates' marriages had generally caused them no problems, and that they had no objections to prisoners marrying civilians.

No. 86-1053
Decided June 1, 1987
482 U.S. 117

Syllabus 
Because Asphalt Products Co. (APC) kept its books, and prepared its 1974 federal income tax return, on a cash receipts and disbursement basis, its reported 1974 taxable income did not fully reflect that its 1974 year-end inventories and accounts receivable were substantially higher than in prior years.  APC's 1974 return also claimed a deduction for the expense of driving two trucks to APC from their place of purchase, even though they detoured to pick up equipment bought by APC's shareholders in their individual capacities.  After determining that APC was required to compute its 1974 income on an accrual basis and disallowing the truck transportation deduction as a personal expense of the shareholders, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  6653(a)(1), added to the resulting deficiency a penalty in the amount of 5% of the full alleged underpayment, contending that the use of the wrong accounting method and the deduction of the truck transportation expense constituted negligence.  Although concluding that APC's use of cash-basis accounting was nonnegligent, the Tax Court agreed that APC had negligently deducted the truck transportation expense, and therefore added to APC's deficiency -- almost all of which was due to the change in accounting methods -- a negligence penalty computed by reference to the full amount of the deficiency.  Affirming the finding that the truck transportation deduction was negligent, the Court of Appeals nevertheless reversed the imposition of the negligence penalty on the full amount of the deficiency, concluding that the penalty ""should be applied only to that portion of the deficiency attributable to the disallowed deduction.""
Held:  Section 6653(a)(1)'s plain language -- whereby, if ""any part of any underpayment"" is due to negligence, the Commissioner shall add to the tax a penalty of ""5 percent of the underpayment"" -- clearly establishes that the penalty is imposed on the entire amount of ""the underpayment,"" not just on the ""part of [the] underpayment"" attributable to negligence.  This conclusion is supported by the Government's plausible interest in 
Page 482 U. S. 118
 deterring negligent tax preparation, and by the statute's explicit limitation of other penalties to the amount of a negligent or fraudulent underpayment.
Certiorari denied in No. 86-1054.  Certiorari granted in No. 86-1063; 796 F.2d 843, reversed.

Affirming the finding that the truck transportation deduction was negligent, the Court of Appeals nevertheless reversed the imposition of the negligence penalty on the full amount of the deficiency, concluding that the penalty ""should be applied only to that portion of the deficiency attributable to the disallowed deduction.""
Held:  Section 6653(a)(1)'s plain language -- whereby, if ""any part of any underpayment"" is due to negligence, the Commissioner shall add to the tax a penalty of ""5 percent of the underpayment"" -- clearly establishes that the penalty is imposed on the entire amount of ""the underpayment,"" not just on the ""part of [the] underpayment"" attributable to negligence.  This conclusion is supported by the Government's plausible interest in 
Page 482 U. S. 118
 deterring negligent tax preparation, and by the statute's explicit limitation of other penalties to the amount of a negligent or fraudulent underpayment.

 Even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the application for a stay and the petition for certiorari. Petitioner raises a substantial claim that the trial court's instruction to the jury unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to petitioner in violation of Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307 (1985). 
 Petitioner William Tucker was tried for murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, armed robbery, and aggravated sodomy. Intent was a crucial issue at trial. Trial testimony indicated that, on the day of the crime, Tucker was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which he had been using heavily since his father's death less than three months earlier. Both the prosecutor and the defense attorney focused their closing remarks on Tucker's state of mind and his ability vel non to form the requisite criminal intent. 
 The trial court's instruction to the jury included the following charge on the burden of proof with respect to the defendant's criminal intent: 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, a crime is the violation of the Statute of this State in which there shall be a union or joint operation of act and intention, or criminal negligence. 
 Now, I'm going to give you certain presumptions. A person is presumed to be of sound mind and discretion, but the presumption may be rebutted. The acts of a person of sound mind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person's will. A person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act. But, these presumptions may be rebutted. The person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention, but the trier of facts, and that's you the jury, may find such intention upon consideration of the words, conduct, demeanor and other circumstances connected with the act for which the accused is prosecuted. Tr. Transcr. 822-823 (emphasis added). 
 After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of murder, kidnaping with bodily injury and robbery by intimidation. After a sentencing hearing, Tucker was sentenced to death. [481 U.S. 1073 , 1075]

No. 86-87
Argued January 21, 1987
Decided May 26, 1987
481 U.S. 739

Syllabus 
The Bail Reform Act of 1984 (Act) requires courts to detain prior to trial arrestees charged with certain serious felonies if the Government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence, after an adversary hearing, that no release conditions ""will reasonably assure . . . the safety of any other person and the community.""  18 U.S.C.  3142(e) (1982 ed., Supp. III).  The Act provides arrestees with a number of procedural rights at the detention hearing, including the right to request counsel, to testify, to present witnesses, to proffer evidence, and to cross-examine other witnesses.  The Act also specifies the factors to be considered in making the detention decision, including the nature and seriousness of the charges, the substantiality of the Government's evidence, the arrestee's background and characteristics, and the nature and seriousness of the danger posed by his release.  Under the Act, a decision to detain must be supported by written findings of fact and a statement of reasons, and is immediately reviewable.  After a hearing under the Act, the District Court ordered the detention of respondents, who had been charged with 35 acts of racketeering activity.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  3142(e)'s authorization of pretrial detention on the ground of future dangerousness is facially unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment's substantive due process guarantee.
Held:
1. Given the Act's legitimate and compelling regulatory purpose and the procedural protections it offers,  3142(e) is not facially invalid under the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  481 U. S. 746-752.
(a) The argument that the Act violates substantive due process because the detention it authorizes constitutes impermissible punishment before trial is unpersuasive.  The Act's legislative history clearly indicates that Congress formulated the detention provisions not as punishment for dangerous individuals, but as a potential solution to the pressing societal problem of crimes committed by persons on release.  Preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal.  Moreover, the incidents of detention under the Act are not excessive in relation to that goal, since the Act carefully limits the circumstances under which detention may be sought to the most serious of crimes, the arrestee is entitled to a prompt hearing, the maximum length of detention 
Page 481 U. S. 740
 is limited by the Speedy Trial Act, and detainees must be housed apart from convicts.  Thus, the Act constitutes permissible regulation, rather than impermissible punishment.  Pp.  481 U. S. 746-748.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the Due Process Clause categorically prohibits pretrial detention that is imposed as a regulatory measure on the ground of community danger.  The Government's regulatory interest in community safety can, in appropriate circumstances, outweigh an individual's liberty interest.  Such circumstances exist here.  The Act narrowly focuses on a particularly acute problem -- crime by arrestees -- in which the Government's interests are overwhelming.  Moreover, the Act operates only on individuals who have been arrested for particular extremely serious offenses, and carefully delineates the circumstances under which detention will be permitted.  Pp.  481 U. S. 748-751.
(c) The Act's extensive procedural safeguards are specifically designed to further the accuracy of the likelihood-of-future-dangerousness determination, and are sufficient to withstand respondents' facial challenge, since they are more than ""adequate to authorize the pretrial detention of at least some [persons] charged with crimes.""  Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253,  467 U. S. 264.  Pp.  481 U. S. 751-752.
2. Section 3142(e) is not facially unconstitutional as violative of the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  The contention that the Act violates the Clause because it allows courts essentially to set bail at an infinite amount for reasons not related to the risk of flight is not persuasive.  Nothing in the Clause's text limits the Government's interest in the setting of bail solely to the prevention of flight.  Where Congress has mandated detention on the basis of some other compelling interest -- here, the public safety -- the Eighth Amendment does not require release on bail.  Pp.  481 U. S. 752-755.

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(c) provides that, when a State appeals a federal court decision granting a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner, the habeas petitioner shall be released from custody ""unless the court or justice or judge rendering the decision, or the court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or a judge or justice of either court shall otherwise order.""  Rule 23(d) states that initial orders issued pursuant to Rule 23(c) shall
""govern review in the court of appeals and in the Supreme Court unless for special reasons shown . . . the order shall be modified, or an independent order respecting custody, enlargement or surety shall be made.""
Respondent, a prisoner serving a state court sentence, filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court, which found that his constitutional rights had been violated at his state court trial and ordered that a writ of habeas corpus ""shall issue unless within 30 days"" the State granted a new trial.  The court subsequently denied petitioners' motion to stay its order pending appeal, basing its denial on Third Circuit authority that, under Rules 23(c) and (d), a federal court deciding whether to release a successful habeas petitioner could consider only the risk that the prisoner would not appear for subsequent proceedings, not his danger to the community, and finding that petitioners had failed to show such risk here. The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for a stay of the District Court's order releasing respondent.
Held:  In deciding under Rules 23(c) and (d) whether to stay pending appeal a district court order granting relief to a habeas petitioner, federal courts are not restricted to considering only the petitioner's risk of flight.  The history of federal habeas corpus practice indicates that a court has broad discretion in conditioning a judgment granting habeas relief, and a court's denial of enlargement to a successful habeas petitioner pending review of the habeas order has the same effect as a stay of that order.  Since habeas corpus proceedings are civil in nature, federal courts, in deciding under the Rule whether to release a successful habeas petitioner pending the State's appeal, should be guided by the traditional standards governing stays of civil judgments -- whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; 
Page 481 U. S. 771
 whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and where the public interest lies.  Although Rule 23(c) creates a presumption favoring release of a successful habeas petitioner pending appeal, and Rule 23(d) creates a presumption of correctness of the District Court's order, such presumptions may be overcome if so indicated by the traditional stay factors, which contemplate individualized judgments in each case.  Thus, consideration may be given to such factors as the possibility of the prisoner's flight; the risk that the prisoner will pose a danger to the public if released; the State's interest in continuing custody and rehabilitation pending a final determination on appeal; and the prisoner's substantial interest in release pending appeal.  Respondent's contention that matters of ""traditional state concern"" such as the prisoner's danger to the community should not be considered in determining whether to release the prisoner pending appeal is unpersuasive.  Any strain on federal-state relations that arises from federal habeas jurisdiction comes about because of the granting of habeas relief itself, not the existence of habeas courts' discretion to refuse enlargement of a successful habeas petitioner pending appeal.  Nor is there any merit to respondent's contention that staying a successful habeas petitioner's release pending appeal because of dangerousness is repugnant to the concept of substantive due process.

Syllabus 
In an agreement settling a suit in which they had been named as defendants, two of the petitioners consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from infringing the trademark of respondent leather goods manufacturer (hereinafter respondent).  Subsequently, upon submission of an affidavit by respondent's attorneys, the District Court found probable cause to believe that petitioners were engaged in conduct violative of the injunction.  The court therefore granted the request of respondent's attorneys for appointment as special counsel to represent the Government in the investigation and prosecution of a criminal contempt action against petitioners.  Ultimately, a jury convicted petitioners of either criminal contempt or of aiding and abetting that contempt.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contention that the appointment of respondent's attorneys as special counsel violated their right to be prosecuted by an impartial prosecutor.  The court stated, inter alia, that the judge's supervision of a contempt prosecution is generally sufficient to prevent the danger that the special prosecutor will use the threat of prosecution as a bargaining chip in civil negotiations.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
780 F.2d 179, reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II, III-A, and IV, concluding that:
1. District courts have authority to appoint private attorneys to prosecute criminal contempt actions.  Pp.  481 U. S. 793-802.
(a) Although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(b) does not authorize the appointment of private attorneys, its reference to such appointments acknowledges the long-settled rule that courts possess inherent authority to initiate contempt proceedings for disobedience to their orders, which authority necessarily includes the ability to appoint a private attorney to prosecute the contempt.  The contention that only the United States Attorney's Office may bring a contempt prosecution is unavailing, since the Judiciary must have an independent means to vindicate 
Page 481 U. S. 788
 its own authority without dependence on another Branch to decide whether proceedings should be initiated.  Pp.  481 U. S. 793-796.
(b) Courts' authority to initiate contempt prosecutions is not limited to the summary punishment of in-court contempts, but extends to out-of-court contempts as well.  The underlying basis for the contempt power is the need to address disobedience to court orders regardless of whether such disobedience interferes with the conduct of trial.  The distinction between in-court and out-of-court contempts has been drawn not to define when a court has authority to initiate a contempt prosecution, but to prescribe the procedures that must attend the exercise of that authority.  Thus, although proceedings in response to out-of-court contempts are sufficiently criminal in nature to warrant the imposition of many procedural protections, this does not mean that their prosecution can be undertaken only by the Executive Branch, and it should not obscure the fact that the limited purpose of such proceedings is to vindicate judicial authority.  Pp.  481 U. S. 797-801.
(c) In order to ensure that courts will exercise their inherent power of self-protection only as a last resort, they should ordinarily request the appropriate prosecuting authority to prosecute contempt actions, and should appoint a private prosecutor only if that request is denied.  Pp.  481 U. S. 801-802.
2. Counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order may not be appointed to undertake criminal contempt prosecutions for alleged violations of that order.  A private attorney appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt should be as disinterested as a public prosecutor, since the attorney is appointed solely to pursue the public interest in vindication of the court's authority.  In a case where a prosecutor also represents an interested party, however, the legal profession's ethical rules may require that the prosecutor take into account an interest other than the Government's.  This creates an intolerable danger that the public interest will be compromised, and produces at least the appearance of impropriety.  The fact that the judge makes the initial decision to proceed with a contempt prosecution is not sufficient to quell concern that the interested prosecutor may be influenced by improper motives, since the prosecutor exercises considerable discretion in matters that are critical to the, case but outside the court's supervision.  The requirement of a disinterested prosecutor is consistent with this Court's earlier decisions recognizing that prosecutors need not be as disinterested as judges.  Most such cases require the court's informed speculation as to whether the prosecutor is subject to extraneous influence, whereas such influence is a virtual certainty in cases such as the present.  Pp.  481 U. S. 802-809.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-B that the harmless

 error doctrine cannot apply when a court appoints counsel for an interested party as contempt prosecutor, since such error is so fundamental and pervasive that it requires reversal without regard to the facts or circumstances of the particular case.  Pp.  481 U. S. 809-814.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the District Court's error in appointing respondent's attorneys to prosecute the contempts requires reversal of the convictions.  The appointments were defective because the federal courts have no constitutional power to prosecute contemners for disobedience of court judgments, and no power derivative of that to appoint attorneys to conduct contempt prosecutions.  In light of the discretion allowed prosecutors, which is so broad that decisions not to prosecute are ordinarily unreviewable, it would be impossible to conclude with any certainty that these prosecutions would have been brought had the court simply referred the matter to the Executive Branch.

Syllabus 
In an agreement settling a suit in which they had been named as defendants, two of the petitioners consented to the entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting them from infringing the trademark of respondent leather goods manufacturer (hereinafter respondent).  Subsequently, upon submission of an affidavit by respondent's attorneys, the District Court found probable cause to believe that petitioners were engaged in conduct violative of the injunction.  The court therefore granted the request of respondent's attorneys for appointment as special counsel to represent the Government in the investigation and prosecution of a criminal contempt action against petitioners.  Ultimately, a jury convicted petitioners of either criminal contempt or of aiding and abetting that contempt.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contention that the appointment of respondent's attorneys as special counsel violated their right to be prosecuted by an impartial prosecutor.  The court stated, inter alia, that the judge's supervision of a contempt prosecution is generally sufficient to prevent the danger that the special prosecutor will use the threat of prosecution as a bargaining chip in civil negotiations.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
780 F.2d 179, reversed.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II, III-A, and IV, concluding that:
1. District courts have authority to appoint private attorneys to prosecute criminal contempt actions.  Pp.  481 U. S. 793-802.
(a) Although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(b) does not authorize the appointment of private attorneys, its reference to such appointments acknowledges the long-settled rule that courts possess inherent authority to initiate contempt proceedings for disobedience to their orders, which authority necessarily includes the ability to appoint a private attorney to prosecute the contempt.  The contention that only the United States Attorney's Office may bring a contempt prosecution is unavailing, since the Judiciary must have an independent means to vindicate 
Page 481 U. S. 788
 its own authority without dependence on another Branch to decide whether proceedings should be initiated.  Pp.  481 U. S. 793-796.
(b) Courts' authority to initiate contempt prosecutions is not limited to the summary punishment of in-court contempts, but extends to out-of-court contempts as well.  The underlying basis for the contempt power is the need to address disobedience to court orders regardless of whether such disobedience interferes with the conduct of trial.  The distinction between in-court and out-of-court contempts has been drawn not to define when a court has authority to initiate a contempt prosecution, but to prescribe the procedures that must attend the exercise of that authority.  Thus, although proceedings in response to out-of-court contempts are sufficiently criminal in nature to warrant the imposition of many procedural protections, this does not mean that their prosecution can be undertaken only by the Executive Branch, and it should not obscure the fact that the limited purpose of such proceedings is to vindicate judicial authority.  Pp.  481 U. S. 797-801.
(c) In order to ensure that courts will exercise their inherent power of self-protection only as a last resort, they should ordinarily request the appropriate prosecuting authority to prosecute contempt actions, and should appoint a private prosecutor only if that request is denied.  Pp.  481 U. S. 801-802.
2. Counsel for a party that is the beneficiary of a court order may not be appointed to undertake criminal contempt prosecutions for alleged violations of that order.  A private attorney appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt should be as disinterested as a public prosecutor, since the attorney is appointed solely to pursue the public interest in vindication of the court's authority.  In a case where a prosecutor also represents an interested party, however, the legal profession's ethical rules may require that the prosecutor take into account an interest other than the Government's.  This creates an intolerable danger that the public interest will be compromised, and produces at least the appearance of impropriety.  The fact that the judge makes the initial decision to proceed with a contempt prosecution is not sufficient to quell concern that the interested prosecutor may be influenced by improper motives, since the prosecutor exercises considerable discretion in matters that are critical to the, case but outside the court's supervision.  The requirement of a disinterested prosecutor is consistent with this Court's earlier decisions recognizing that prosecutors need not be as disinterested as judges.  Most such cases require the court's informed speculation as to whether the prosecutor is subject to extraneous influence, whereas such influence is a virtual certainty in cases such as the present.  Pp.  481 U. S. 802-809.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-B that the harmless 
Page 481 U. S. 789
 error doctrine cannot apply when a court appoints counsel for an interested party as contempt prosecutor, since such error is so fundamental and pervasive that it requires reversal without regard to the facts or circumstances of the particular case.  Pp.  481 U. S. 809-814.

Syllabus 
Title 8 U.S.C.  1326 provides that any alien who has been deported and thereafter enters the United States is guilty of a felony.  Respondents, Mexican nationals, were arrested and deported after a group hearing at which they purportedly waived their rights to apply for suspension of deportation and to appeal.  Subsequently, respondents were again arrested in this country and indicted on charges of violating  1326.  However, the District Court dismissed the indictments, ruling that respondents could collaterally attack their previous deportation orders.  The court found that they had not understood the Immigration Judge's explanation of suspension of deportation, and concluded that the reliability of the proceedings had been totally undermined by the fact that they had not made knowing and intelligent waivers of their right to that remedy or their right to appeal.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, since a material element of the offense prohibited by  1326 was a ""lawful"" deportation order, principles of fundamental fairness required a pretrial review of the underlying deportation to determine whether respondents received due process of law.  Because they did not fully understand the proceedings, the court found a due process violation rendering the deportation order unlawful, and therefore not a proper basis for the charges against respondents.
Held:
1. The text, legislative history, and background of  1326 indicate that Congress did not intend the validity of an underlying deportation order to be contestable in a  1326 prosecution.  Section 1326's express language does not suggest that only a ""lawful"" deportation may be an element of the offense, thereby permitting a collateral challenge.  Moreover, in enacting  1326, Congress had available to it at least one predecessor statute containing express language that would have permitted collateral challenges, but failed to include that language in  1326.  While there was, at the time of  1326's enactment, some case law suggesting that collateral attacks might be permissible under certain circumstances, that principle was not so unequivocally established that Congress must have intended to incorporate it into  1326.  Furthermore, the Immigration and Nationality Act does include sections -- particularly 8 U.S.C.  1105(a) -- dealing with judicial review of deportation 
Page 481 U. S. 829
 orders, which, although not directly applicable to this case, indicate that Congress considered and addressed some of the various circumstances in which challenges to deportation orders might arise without mentioning  1326.  Pp.  481 U. S. 833-837.
2. Due process requires that a collateral challenge to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense be permitted where the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.  Pp.  481 U. S. 837-842.
(a) Depriving an alien of the right to have the disposition of a deportation hearing reviewed in a judicial forum requires, at a minimum, that review be made available in any subsequent proceeding in which the result of the deportation proceeding is used to establish an element of a criminal offense.  Pp.  481 U. S. 837-839.
(b) Respondents' deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair, and violated due process.  By permitting waivers of the right to appeal that were not the result of considered or intelligent judgment by respondents, the Immigration Judge completely deprived them of their right to judicial review of the deportation proceeding.  This deprivation precludes the use of the deportation orders to prove  1326 violations.  Pp.  481 U. S. 839-840.
(c) Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55, is distinguishable from the instant case, since it assumed the opportunity to challenge the underlying decision in a judicial forum, precisely that which was denied respondents here.  Pp.  481 U. S. 840-842.

Syllabus 
Respondent, an electrical apprentice employed by Florida Power and Light Company (Florida Power), was injured while assigned to a job that required her to perform tasks allegedly beyond the scope of her training and experience.  She brought suit in a Florida court against petitioner unions (collectively referred to as the Union), alleging that, ""pursuant to contracts and agreements"" between the Union and Florida Power, ""to which . . . [she] was a third-party beneficiary,"" and ""pursuant to the relationship by and between"" the Union and her, the Union had a duty of care to ensure her a safe workplace, which it had breached by allowing her to be assigned to work in a dangerous location.  The Union removed the action to federal court on the grounds that its alleged duty arose solely from the collective bargaining agreement, and therefore that any breach of its duty was actionable solely under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.  The Union then moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely under the applicable federal statute of limitations.  Respondent argued that the basic nature of her action was a state common-law ""suit in tort,"" and prayed that the case be remanded to the state court.  The District Court granted the Union's motion to dismiss, holding that the Union's alleged duty flowed from the collective bargaining agreement, and that respondent's claim thus was preempted by  301, and was untimely under federal law.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. Respondent's claim is not sufficiently independent of the collective bargaining agreement to withstand  301's preemptive force.  Pp.  481 U. S. 855-862.
(a) The interests in interpretive uniformity and predictability that require that labor contract disputes be resolved by reference to federal common law also require that the meaning given a contract phrase or term be subject to uniform federal interpretation, whether the question arises in the context of a suit for breach of contract or in a suit alleging liability in tort.  Thus, an employee's state law tort action that necessarily rests on an interpretation of terms in the collective bargaining 
Page 481 U. S. 852
 agreement is preempted by  301.  Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202.  Pp.  471 U. S. 855-859.
(b) Under Florida law, the employer, not the labor union, owes employees a duty to furnish a reasonably safe workplace.  A union may assume a responsibility to employees by accepting a duty of care through a contractual arrangement, and, under Florida law, if a party breaches a contractual duty, the aggrieved party may bring either an action for breach of contract or a tort action for the injury suffered as a result of the contractual breach.  However, the threshold inquiry for determining if a cause of action exists is an examination of the contract to ascertain what duties were accepted by each of the parties and the scope of those duties.  Respondent's complaint alleges precisely this type of tortious breach of contract claim, and her allegations of negligence are significant only if the Union, under the collective bargaining agreement, assumed the duty of care that it allegedly breached.  Thus, questions of contract interpretation underlie any finding of tort liability, and respondent is precluded from evading  301's preemptive force by casting her claim as a state law tort action.  Pp.  481 U. S. 859-862.
2. If respondent's suit is treated as a  301 claim, it must be determined whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations under federal law.  Because the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that respondent's claim was not preempted, it is appropriate for that court to consider, in the first instance, whether the period of limitations adopted by the District Court is applicable to respondent's claim.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death 
Page 481 U.S. 1063 , 1064
 presented to Justice POWELL and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 2973 (1976), I would grant the application for stay of execution and the petition for certiorari, and would vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 Even if I did not take this view, however, I would still grant the application for a stay. Tucker's petition for certiorari raises the question whether inflammatory and prejudicial photographs of the victim's body introduced at trial violated his constitutional right to ""fundamental fairness and a reliable sentencing determination."" Pet. for Cert. i. This question is sufficiently similar to a question that will be decided by the Court in Thompson v. Oklahoma, No. 86-6169 (Feb. 23, 1987), --- U.S . ___ 1 that the petition should be held by the Court pending our disposition of the question in Thompson. [Footnote 2] 

 I find particularly disturbing the Court of Appeals' treatment of this question. In deciding that the grant of certiorari in Thompson did not ""sufficiently suggest that 'new law' relevant to the present case [was] near at hand,"" the court stated: 
 [1064-Continued.] 
[DCQ!]] Plainly, any doubt that the Court of Appeals had about which issue prompted the Court to grant certiorari should have been resolved in favor of the defendant facing the death penalty. Moreover, given that this Court may restrict its grant of certiorari to those questions it wishes to hear, it seems to me most inappropriate for the court to have engaged in speculation about the possible insignificance of our grant on one of the questions in Tucker's petition. 
 The relationship between the questions presented by Tucker and Thompson justifies delaying consideration of the former on the ground that it will be illuminated by the disposition of the latter. I dissent. 
Footnote 1 Among the questions presented in Thompson is:
Footnote 2 It is true that in Thompson the court below found that admission of the photographs at issue was error, but harmless, while here the court found no error in the admission of the photographs. This difference is not significant. In Thompson, in order to overturn the State court's determination of harmless error, we would have to find both that the admission of the photographs at issue violated the defendant's due process rights under the Federal Constitution, and that the error was not harmless . In order to overturn the State Court's determination that no error occurred in Tucker, we would have to find only the first of these, namely that the admission of the photographs at issue violated these same Federal Constitutional rights. Plainly, any standard we might develop in deciding whether sufficient prejudice existed to render an error harmful would be applicable in a decision whether sufficient possibility of prejudice existed to render admission of evidence error. The possibility that the analysis in Thompson will shed light on Tucker is therefore sufficient to justify a hold.

 I find particularly disturbing the Court of Appeals' treatment of this question. In deciding that the grant of certiorari in Thompson did not ""sufficiently suggest that 'new law' relevant to the present case [was] near at hand,"" the court stated: 
 [1064-Continued.] 
[DCQ!]] Plainly, any doubt that the Court of Appeals had about which issue prompted the Court to grant certiorari should have been resolved in favor of the defendant facing the death penalty. Moreover, given that this Court may restrict its grant of certiorari to those questions it wishes to hear, it seems to me most inappropriate for the court to have engaged in speculation about the possible insignificance of our grant on one of the questions in Tucker's petition. 
 The relationship between the questions presented by Tucker and Thompson justifies delaying consideration of the former on the ground that it will be illuminated by the disposition of the latter. I dissent. 
Footnote 1 Among the questions presented in Thompson is:
Footnote 2 It is true that in Thompson the court below found that admission of the photographs at issue was error, but harmless, while here the court found no error in the admission of the photographs. This difference is not significant. In Thompson, in order to overturn the State court's determination of harmless error, we would have to find both that the admission of the photographs at issue violated the defendant's due process rights under the Federal Constitution, and that the error was not harmless . In order to overturn the State Court's determination that no error occurred in Tucker, we would have to find only the first of these, namely that the admission of the photographs at issue violated these same Federal Constitutional rights. Plainly, any standard we might develop in deciding whether sufficient prejudice existed to render an error harmful would be applicable in a decision whether sufficient possibility of prejudice existed to render admission of evidence error. The possibility that the analysis in Thompson will shed light on Tucker is therefore sufficient to justify a hold.

No. A-820
Decided May 21, 1987
481 U.S. 1301

Syllabus 
The United States Postal Service's application to stay the Court of Appeals' mandate enforcing an arbitrator's decision requiring the reinstatement of Edward Hyde as a postal worker is granted pending the filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari.  Although the District Court set aside the arbitrator's reinstatement order following Hyde's discharge for dereliction of duty upon his conviction for unlawful delay of the mail, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a court may set aside an arbitrator's award as contrary to public policy only when the award itself violates established law or compels unlawful conduct.  There is a reasonable probability that four Justices will eventually grant certiorari in this case, since the Court has already granted certiorari in Misco, Inc. v. United Paperworkers International Union, 768 F.2d 739 (CA5), cert. granted, 479 U.S. 1029, which raises the identical public policy issue.  Moreover, the stay equities favor the applicant, whose ability to impress the seriousness of its mission upon its workers would be seriously impaired by even the temporary reinstatement of a convicted criminal, whereas continuation of the status quo will not work an irreparable harm on Hyde, who has not worked for the applicant for almost three years.

 Edward Earl JOHNSON v. Don CABANA, Acting Commissioner, Mississippi Department of CorrectionsNo. 86-6919 (A-842) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 19, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to JUSTICE WHITE and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 2973 (1976), I would grant the application for stay of execution and the petition for certiorari, and would vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 Even if I did not take this view, I would still grant the application for a stay and the petition for certiorari. Petitioner raises a substantial claim that, since trial, he has become incompetent and therefore may not be executed. In Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. ___ (1986), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of convicted prisoners found to be incompetent. The Court rested its holding on the lack of ""retributive value [in] executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life."" Id., 106 S.Ct. at 2602. The Court also relied on ""the natural abhorrence civilized societies feel at killing one who has no capacity to come to grips with his own conscience or deity."" Ibid. In a concurring opinion, Justice POWELL stated: 
Page 481 U.S. 1061 , 1062
 ishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it."" Id., 106 S.Ct. at 2608-09.
 Petitioner's claim is founded on an affidavit by a licensed clinical psychologist stating his findings as to petitioner's sanity. Following a five-hour evaluation of petitioner, and after a review of petitioner's medical records and of statements by others acquainted with petitioner, the affiant concluded: 
 The plausibility of this conclusion is buttressed by the affidavit of a psychiatrist, who evaluated petitioner prior to his trial. That evaluation ""revealed substantial mental defects,"" and the affiant diagnosed that petitioner had ""suffered from brain dysfunction"" from birth, and ""suffered from [an] organic brain syndrome"" that intermittently caused personality and behavioral changes. He concluded ""that [petitioner's] mental problems were severe."" Id., at 3-4. 
 Petitioner first presented this evidence to the Mississippi Supreme Court pursuant to the State's post-conviction procedures set forth in Miss. Stat.Ann. 99-19-57(2)(b). In response, the State submitted affidavits that disputed petitioner's claims. The Mississippi Supreme Court did not hold a hearing in this matter, nor did it even consider the affidavits presented by the State. Instead, the court simply concluded, without explanation, that it did ""not find it necessary to consider [the State's affidavits] because Petitioner fails to make out a prima facie case of present insanity by his affidavits."" Johnson v. State, --- So.2d ___, ___ n. 1 (No. DP-16, May 18, 1987) (slip op. 1, n. 1). The court summarily held that petitioner's evidence was insufficient standing alone to raise ""a reasonable probability"" that petitioner is presently ""insane."" Id., at ___. 
 The Constitution does not require an indigent prisoner to produce more than what petitioner has in order to meet the burden of coming forward. There is nothing amiss, at least facially, in petitioner's affidavits. The affidavits were prepared by licensed professionals, not by family members or friends. Compare Evans v. [481 U.S. 1061 , 1063]

No. 85-2099
Argued March 2, 1987
Decided May 18, 1987
481 U.S. 551

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in a Pennsylvania trial court, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal.  In respondent's subsequent postconviction proceedings, the trial court, as required by state law, appointed counsel to assist her.  Counsel reviewed the trial record; consulted with respondent; concluded that there were no arguable bases for collateral review; advised the trial court in writing of his conclusion; and requested permission to withdraw.  After reviewing the record, the court agreed that there were no arguably meritorious issues and dismissed the proceedings.  Respondent acquired new appointed counsel and appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, which concluded that counsel's conduct in the trial court violated respondent's constitutional rights, and remanded the case for further proceedings.  The Superior Court relied on Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738, which held that (1) when an attorney appointed to represent an indigent defendant on direct appeal finds the case to be wholly frivolous, he must request the court's permission to withdraw and submit a brief referring to anything in the record arguably supporting the appeal, (2) a copy of the brief must be furnished the indigent, and time must be allowed for him to raise any points that he chooses, and (3) the court itself must then decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.
Held:  The court below improperly relied on the Federal Constitution to extend the Anders procedures to these collateral postconviction proceedings.  Denial of counsel to indigents on first appeal as of right amounts to discrimination against the poor in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Anders established a prophylactic framework that is relevant when, and only when, a litigant has a previously established Constitutional right to counsel.  The right to appointed counsel extends to only the first appeal of right, and, since a defendant has no federal constitutional right to counsel when pursuing a discretionary appeal on direct review of his conviction, Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, a fortiorari, he has no such right when attacking, in postconviction proceedings, a conviction that has become final upon exhaustion of the appellate process.  The Anders procedures do not apply to a state-created right to counsel on postconviction review just because they are applied to the right to counsel on first appeal as of right. Respondent's access to a lawyer was the 
Page 481 U. S. 552
 result of the State's decision, not the command of the Federal Constitution.  The procedures followed by her trial counsel in the postconviction proceedings fully comported with the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause.  States have no obligation to provide postconviction relief, and when they do, the fundamental fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause does not require that the State supply a lawyer as well.  Nor was the equal protection guarantee of meaningful access violated in this case.  Moreover, there is no merit to respondent's contention that, once the State has granted a prisoner access to counsel on postconviction review, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that counsel's actions comport with the Anders procedures.  Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, distinguished.  Pennsylvania made a valid choice to give prisoners the assistance of counsel in postconviction proceedings without requiring the full panoply of procedural protections that the Constitution requires be given to defendants who are in a fundamentally different position -- at trial and on first appeal as of right.

481 U.S. 573

Syllabus 
Respondent Union fined two of its members (Schoux and Choate), who worked as supervisors, for violating its constitution by working for employers that did not have a collective bargaining agreement with the Union.  The employers filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), alleging that the Union had violated  8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union
""to restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.""
An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) agreed, finding, inter alia, that (1) Schoux and Choate were supervisors within the meaning of  2(11) of the Act, (2) under the ""reservoir doctrine,"" they were also employer representatives for the purposes of ""collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances"" covered by  8(b)(1)(B), even though neither performed such duties, since  2(11) supervisors form the logical ""reservoir"" from which the employer is likely to select his future representatives for collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, and (3) the Union had restrained or coerced the employers within the meaning of  8(b)(1)(B) even though the Union did not have a collective bargaining relationship with the employers at the time of the fines, since the Union's action could have the effect of forcing the representatives to quit, and since, in any event, the Union intended to represent the employers' employees in the future.  The NLRB adopted the ALJ's findings and conclusions, entered an order against the Union, and sought enforcement of its order in the Court of Appeals.  Reversing the finding of a  8(b)(1)(B) violation, the court agreed that Schoux and Choate were employer representatives for  8(b)(1)(B) purposes, but rejected the NLRB's conclusion that the Union intended to represent the employers' employees. T he court held that, if a union does not represent or intend to represent the complaining employer's employees, there can be no  8(b)(1)(B) violation when the union disciplines its members who are the employer's designated bargaining representatives. 
Page 481 U. S. 574

Held:  A union does not violate  8(b)(1)(B) when it disciplines a supervisor union member who does not participate as the employer's representative in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, and whose employer has not entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the union.  Pp.  481 U. S. 580-596.
(a) Union discipline of a supervisor-member is prohibited under  8(b)(1)(B) only when that member engages in  8(b)(1)(B) activities -- that is, collective bargaining, grievance adjustment, or some other closely related activity, such as contract interpretation.  Union discipline violates  8(b)(1)(B) only when it may adversely affect the supervisor's future conduct in performing  8(b)(1)(B) duties, and such an adverse effect exists only when the supervisor is disciplined for behavior that occurs while the supervisor has  8(b)(1)(B) duties.  The general impact of union discipline on the supervisor's loyalty to the employer is insufficient to create a  8(b)(1)(B) violation.  Florida Power & Light Co. v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790; American Broadcasting Cos. v. Writers Guild, West, Inc., 437 U. S. 411.  The NLRB's ""reservoir doctrine,"" involving discipline of supervisors who have no  8(b)(1)(B) duties, cannot be reconciled with the Act's structure or the limited construction of  8(b)(1)(B) in Florida Power and American Broadcasting Cos.  Thus, the Union's discipline of Schoux and Choate was not an unfair labor practice.  Pp.  481 U. S. 580-589.
(b) Furthermore, the absence of a collective bargaining relationship between the employers and the Union when the latter enforced its no-contract-no-work rule against its supervisor-members made the possibility that the Union's discipline of the supervisors would coerce the employers too attenuated to form the basis of an unfair labor practice charge.  Such discipline will not affect the manner in which employer representatives perform grievance adjustment or collective bargaining tasks.  Nor did the Union's discipline of the supervisors coerce the employers in their selection of  8(b)(1)(B) representatives.  Although any union member who valued union membership would be less willing to serve if the cost of service were loss of membership, which, in turn, would limit the size of the supervisor pool from which an employer could select its representatives, this minimal effect on the employer's selection of  8(b)(1)(B) representatives is insufficient to support a  8(b)(1)(B) charge.  Moreover, an employer is not restrained or coerced in the selection of its representatives because a union member must accept union expulsion or other discipline to continue in a supervisory position.  Since union members have a right to resign from a union at any time and avoid imposition of union discipline, the employer may require that its representatives leave the union.  Pp.  481 U. S. 589-596.

Thus, the Union's discipline of Schoux and Choate was not an unfair labor practice.  Pp.  481 U. S. 580-589.
(b) Furthermore, the absence of a collective bargaining relationship between the employers and the Union when the latter enforced its no-contract-no-work rule against its supervisor-members made the possibility that the Union's discipline of the supervisors would coerce the employers too attenuated to form the basis of an unfair labor practice charge.  Such discipline will not affect the manner in which employer representatives perform grievance adjustment or collective bargaining tasks.  Nor did the Union's discipline of the supervisors coerce the employers in their selection of  8(b)(1)(B) representatives.  Although any union member who valued union membership would be less willing to serve if the cost of service were loss of membership, which, in turn, would limit the size of the supervisor pool from which an employer could select its representatives, this minimal effect on the employer's selection of  8(b)(1)(B) representatives is insufficient to support a  8(b)(1)(B) charge.  Moreover, an employer is not restrained or coerced in the selection of its representatives because a union member must accept union expulsion or other discipline to continue in a supervisory position.  Since union members have a right to resign from a union at any time and avoid imposition of union discipline, the employer may require that its representatives leave the union.  Pp.  481 U. S. 589-596.

Syllabus 
Respondent professor, a United States citizen born in Iraq, filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, his former employer and its tenure committee, alleging that, by denying him tenure nearly three years before, they had discriminated against him on the basis of his Arabian race in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1981.  The court held that the claim was not barred under the Pennsylvania 6-year statute of limitations, but granted summary judgment for petitioners upon finding that  1981 does not reach discrimination claims based on Arabian ancestry.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit acknowledged that its recent Goodman case had overruled its earlier decisions by applying Pennsylvania's 2-year personal injury statute of limitations, rather than the 6-year period, in  1981 cases, but ruled that respondent's claim was not time-barred, since Goodman should not be applied retroactively under Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97.  However, the court reversed the District Court on the merits, holding that respondent had properly alleged racial discrimination in that, although Arabs are Caucasians under current racial classifications, Congress, when it passed what is now  1981, did not limit its protections to those who today would be considered members of a race different from the defendant's.  The court said that, at a minimum,  1981 reaches discrimination directed against an individual because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive subgrouping of homo sapiens.  Because the record was insufficient to determine whether respondent had been subjected to the sort of prejudice that  1981 would redress, the case was remanded.
Held:
1. Respondent's claim was not time-barred.  When respondent filed suit, it was clearly established in the Third Circuit that a  1981 plaintiff had six years to bring an action.  The Court of Appeals correctly held that its Goodman decision should not be applied retroactively, since Chevron indicated that it is manifestly inequitable to apply statute of limitations decisions retroactively when they overrule clearly established Circuit precedent on which the complaining party was entitled to rely.  Pp.  481 U. S. 608-609. 
Page 481 U. S. 605

2. A person of Arabian ancestry may be protected from racial discrimination under  1981.  The Court of Appeals properly rejected petitioners' contention that, as a Caucasian, respondent cannot allege the type of discrimination that  1981 forbids, since that section does not encompass claims of discrimination by one Caucasian against another.  That position assumes that all those who might be deemed Caucasians today were thought to be of the same race when  1981 became law.  In fact, 19th-century sources commonly described ""race"" in terms of particular ethnic groups, including Arabs, and do not support the claim that Arabs and other present-day ""Caucasians"" were then considered to be a single race.  Moreover,  1981's legislative history indicates that Congress intended to protect identifiable classes of persons who are subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics.  However, a distinctive physiognomy is not essential to qualify for  1981 protection.  Thus, if respondent can prove that he was subjected to intentional discrimination based on the fact that he was born an Arab, rather than solely on the place or nation of his origin or his religion, he will have made out a  1981 case.  Pp.  481 U. S. 609-613.
784 F.2d 505, affirmed.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  BRENNAN, J., filed a concurring opinion, post p.  481 U. S. 614. 
Page 481 U. S. 606

Respondent, a citizen of the United States born in Iraq, was an associate professor at St. Francis College, one of the petitioners here.  In January, 1978, he applied for tenure; the Board of Trustees denied his request on February 23, 1978.  He accepted a l-year, nonrenewable contract and sought administrative reconsideration of the tenure decision, which was denied on February 6, 1979.  He worked his last day at the college on May 26, 1979.  In June, 1979, he filed complaints with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission.  The state agency dismissed his claim and the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter on August 6, 1980.
On October 30, 1980, respondent filed a pro se complaint in the District Court alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and claiming discrimination based on national origin, religion, and/or race.  Amended complaints were filed, adding claims under 42 U.S.C.  1981, 1983, 1985(3), 1986, and state law.  The District Court dismissed the  1986 and 1985(3) and Title VII claims as untimely, but held that the  1981 and 1983 claims were not barred by the Pennsylvania 6-year statute of limitations.  The court at that time also ruled that, because the complaint alleged denial of tenure because respondent was of the Arabian race, an action under  1981 could be maintained.  Defendants' motion for summary judgment came up before a different judge, who construed the pleadings as asserting only discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion, which  1981 did not cover.  Even if racial discrimination was deemed to have been alleged, the District Court ruled that  1981 does not reach claims of discrimination based on Arabian ancestry. [Footnote 1]
The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' claim that the  1981 claim had not been timely filed.  Under the Court of Appeals' holding in Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 
Page 481 U. S. 607
 113 (1985), that the Pennsylvania 2-year statute of limitations governed  1981 cases, respondent's suit would have been barred.  The Court of Appeals, however, relying on Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97 (1971), held that Goodman should not be retroactively applied, and that this suit was timely under its pre-Goodman cases which had borrowed the State's 6-year statute.
Reaching the merits, the Court of Appeals held that respondent had alleged discrimination based on race, and that although, under current racial classifications, Arabs are Caucasians, respondent could maintain his  1981 claim. [Footnote 2]  Congress, when it passed what is now  1981, had not limited its protections to those who today would be considered members of a race different from the race of the defendant.  Rather, the legislative history of the section indicated that Congress intended to embrace ""at the least, membership in a group that is ethnically and physiognomically distinctive.""  784 F.2d 505, 517 (1986).  Section 1981, ""at a minimum,"" reaches
""discrimination directed against an individual because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive sub-grouping of homo sapiens.""
Ibid.  Because respondent had not had full discovery and the record was not sufficient to determine whether he had been subjected to the sort of prejudice  1981 would redress, respondent was to be given the opportunity to prove his case. [Footnote 3]
We granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 812 (1986), limited to the statute of limitations issue and the question whether a person of Arabian ancestry was protected from racial discrimination under  1981, and now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
Page 481 U. S. 608


We agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent's claim was not time-barred.  Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261 (1985), required that, in selecting the applicable state statute of limitations in  1983 cases, the lower federal courts should choose the state statute applicable to other personal injury torts.  Thereafter, the Third Circuit in Goodman held that Wilson applies to  1981 cases as well, and that the Pennsylvania 2-year statute should apply.  The Court of Appeals in this case, however, held that, when respondent filed his suit, which was prior to Wilson v. Garcia, it was clearly established in the Third Circuit that a  1981 plaintiff had six years to bring an action, and that Goodman should not be applied retroactively to bar respondent's suit.
Insofar as what the prevailing law was in the Third Circuit, we have no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeals.  Under controlling precedent in that Circuit, respondent had six years to file his suit, and it was filed well within that time.  See 784 F.2d at 512-513.  We also assume, but do not decide, that Wilson v. Garcia controls the selection of the applicable state statute of limitations in  1981 cases.  The Court of Appeals, however, correctly held that its decision in Goodman should not be retroactively applied to bar respondent's action in this case.  The usual rule is that federal cases should be decided in accordance with the law existing at the time of decision.  Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473,  453 U. S. 486, n. 16 (1981); Thorpe v. Durham Housing Authority, 393 U. S. 268,  393 U. S. 281 (1969); United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103,  5 U. S. 110 (1801).  But Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, counsels against retroactive application of statute of limitations decisions in certain circumstances.  There, the Court held that its decision specifying the applicable state statute of limitations should be applied only prospectively, because it overruled clearly established Circuit precedent on which the complaining party was entitled to rely, because retroactive application would be inconsistent with the purpose 
Page 481 U. S. 609
 of the underlying substantive statute, and because such application would be manifestly inequitable.  The Court of Appeals found these same factors were present in this case, and foreclosed retroactive application of its decision in Goodman.  We perceive no good reason for not applying Chevron where Wilson has required a Court of Appeals to overrule its prior cases.  Nor has petitioner persuaded us that there was any error in the application of Chevron in the circumstances existing in this case.

Section 1981 provides:
""All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.""
Although  1981 does not itself use the word ""race,"" the Court has construed the section to forbid all ""racial"" discrimination in the making of private as well as public contracts.  Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160,  427 U. S. 168,  427 U. S. 174-175 (1976).  Petitioner college, although a private institution, was therefore subject to this statutory command.  There is no disagreement among the parties on these propositions.  The issue is whether respondent has alleged racial discrimination within the meaning of  1981.
Petitioners contend that respondent is a Caucasian, and cannot allege the kind of discrimination  1981 forbids.  Concededly, McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U. S. 273 (1976), held that white persons could maintain a  1981 suit; but that suit involved alleged discrimination against a white person in favor of a black, and petitioner submits that the section does not encompass claims of discrimination 
Page 481 U. S. 610
 by one Caucasian against another.  We are quite sure that the Court of Appeals properly rejected this position.
Petitioner's submission rests on the assumption that all those who might be deemed Caucasians today were thought to be of the same race when  1981 became law in the 19th century; and it may be that a variety of ethnic groups, including Arabs, are now considered to be within the Caucasian race. [Footnote 4]  The understanding of ""race"" in the 19th century, however, was different.  Plainly, all those who might be deemed Caucasian today were not thought to be of the same race at the time  1981 became law.
In the middle years of the 19th century, dictionaries commonly referred to race as a ""continued series of descendants from a parent who is called the stock,"" N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 666 (New 
Page 481 U. S. 611
 York 1830) (emphasis in original), ""[t]he lineage of a family,"" 2 N. Webster, A Dictionary of the English Language 411 (New Haven 1841), or ""descendants of a common ancestor,"" J. Donald, Chambers' Etymological Dictionary of the English Language 415 (London 1871).  The 1887 edition of Webster's expanded the definition somewhat:  ""The descendants of a common ancestor; a family, tribe, people or nation, believed or presumed to belong to the same stock.""  N. Webster, Dictionary of the English Language 589 (W. Wheeler ed. 1887).  It was not until the 20th century that dictionaries began referring to the Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro races, 8 The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 4926 (1911), or to race as involving divisions of mankind based upon different physical characteristics.  Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 794 (3d ed.1916).  Even so, modern dictionaries still include among the definitions of race ""a family, tribe, people, or nation belonging to the same stock.""  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1870 (1971); Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 969 (1986).
Encyclopedias of the 19th century also described race in terms of ethnic groups, which is a narrower concept of race than petitioners urge.  Encyclopedia Americana in 1858, for example, referred to various races such as Finns, vol. 5, p. 123, gypsies, 6 id. at 123, Basques, 1 id. at 602, and Hebrews, 6 id. at 209.  The 1863 version of the New American Cyclopaedia divided the Arabs into a number of subsidiary races, vol. 1, p. 739; represented the Hebrews as of the Semitic race, 9 id. at 27, and identified numerous other groups as constituting races, including Swedes, 15 id. at 216, Norwegians, 12 id. at 410, Germans, 8 id. at 200, Greeks, 8 id. at 438, Finns, 7 id. at 513, Italians, 9 id. at 644-645 (referring to mixture of different races), Spanish, 14 id. at 804, Mongolians, 11 id. at 651, Russians, 14 id. at 226, and the like.  The Ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica also referred to Arabs, vol. 2, p. 245 (1878), Jews, 13 id. at 685 (1881), and other ethnic groups such as Germans, 10 id. at 
Page 481 U. S. 612
 473 (1879), Hungarians, 12 id. at 365 (1880), and Greeks, 11 id. at 83 (1880), as separate races.
These dictionary and encyclopedic sources are somewhat diverse, but it is clear that they do not support the claim that, for the purposes of  1981, Arabs, Englishmen, Germans, and certain other ethnic groups are to be considered a single race.  We would expect the legislative history of  1981, which the Court held in Runyon v. McCrary had its source in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, 144, to reflect this common understanding, which it surely does.  The debates are replete with references to the Scandinavian races, Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 499 (1866) (remarks of Sen. Cowan), as well as the Chinese, id. at 523 (remarks of Sen. Davis), Latin, id. at 238 (remarks of Rep. Kasson during debate of home rule for the District of Columbia), Spanish, id. at 251 (remarks of Sen. Davis during debate of District of Columbia suffrage), and Anglo-Saxon races, id. at 542 (remarks of Rep. Dawson).  Jews, ibid., Mexicans, see ibid. (remarks of Rep. Dawson), blacks, passim, and Mongolians, id. at 498 (remarks of Sen. Cowan), were similarly categorized.  Gypsies were referred to as a race.  Ibid. (remarks of Sen. Cowan).  Likewise, the Germans:
""Who will say that Ohio can pass a law enacting that no man of the German race . . . shall ever own any property in Ohio, or shall ever make a contract in Ohio, or ever inherit property in Ohio, or ever come into Ohio to live, or even to work?  If Ohio may pass such a law, and exclude a German citizen . . . because he is of the German nationality or race, then may every other State do so.""
Id. at 1294 (remarks of Sen. Shellabarger).
There was a reference to the Caucasian race, but it appears to have been referring to people of European ancestry.  Id. at 523 (remarks of Sen. Davis).
The history of the 1870 Act reflects similar understanding of what groups Congress intended to protect from intentional 
Page 481 U. S. 613
 discrimination.  It is clear, for example, that the civil rights sections of the 1870 Act provided protection for immigrant groups such as the Chinese.  This view was expressed in the Senate.  Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 1536, 3658, 3808 (1870).  In the House, Representative Bingham described  16 of the Act, part of the authority for  1981, as declaring
""that the States shall not hereafter discriminate against the immigrant from China and in favor of the immigrant from Prussia, nor against the immigrant from France and in favor of the immigrant from Ireland.""
Id. at 3871.
Based on the history of  1981, we have little trouble in concluding that Congress intended to protect from discrimination identifiable classes of persons who are subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics.  Such discrimination is racial discrimination that Congress intended  1981 to forbid, whether or not it would be classified as racial in terms of modern scientific theory. [Footnote 5]  The Court of Appeals was thus quite right in holding that  1981, ""at a minimum,"" reaches discrimination against an individual ""because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive subgrouping of homo sapiens.""  It is clear from our holding, however, that a distinctive physiognomy is not essential to qualify for  1981 protection.  If respondent, on remand, can prove that he was subjected to intentional discrimination based on the fact that he was born an Arab, rather than solely on the place or nation of his origin, or his religion, he will have made out a case under  1981.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.
It is so ordered. 
Page 481 U. S. 614

[Footnote 1]
The  1983 claim was dismissed for want of state action.  The pendent state claims were also dismissed.
[Footnote 2]
The Court of Appeals thus rejected petitioners' claim that respondent's complaint alleged only national origin and religious discrimination, assertedly not reached by  1981.
[Footnote 3]
The Court of Appeals also held that the individual members of the tenure committee were subject to liability under  1981.  The District Court was also to reconsider its dismissal of the pendent state claims.
[Footnote 4]
There is a common popular understanding that there are three major human races -- Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid.  Many modern biologists and anthropologists, however, criticize racial classifications as arbitrary and of little use in understanding the variability of human beings.  It is said that genetically homogeneous populations do not exist, and traits are not discontinuous between populations; therefore, a population can only be described in terms of relative frequencies of various traits.  Clear-cut categories do not exist.  The particular traits which have generally been chosen to characterize races have been criticized as having little biological significance.  It has been found that differences between individuals of the same race are often greater than the differences between the ""average"" individuals of different races.  These observations and others have led some, but not all, scientists to conclude that racial classifications are for the most part sociopolitical, rather than biological, in nature.  S. Molnar, Human Variation (2d ed.1983); S. Gould, The Mismeasure of Man (1981); M. Banton & J. Harwood, The Race Concept (1975); A. Montagu, Man's Most Dangerous Myth (1974); A. Montagu, Statement on Race (3d ed.1972); Science and the Concept of Race (M. Mead, T. Dobzhansky, E. Tobach, & R. Light eds.1968); A. Montagu, The Concept of Race (1964); R.

Sci. J. 71 (1965); Washburn, The Study of Race, 65 American Anthropologist 521 (1963).
[Footnote 5]
We note that, under prior cases, discrimination by States on the basis of ancestry violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U. S. 475,  347 U. S. 479 (1954); Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633,  332 U. S. 646 (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81,  320 U. S. 100 (1943).  See also Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24,  334 U.

Rather, the legislative history of the section indicated that Congress intended to embrace ""at the least, membership in a group that is ethnically and physiognomically distinctive.""  784 F.2d 505, 517 (1986).  Section 1981, ""at a minimum,"" reaches
""discrimination directed against an individual because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive sub-grouping of homo sapiens.""
Ibid.  Because respondent had not had full discovery and the record was not sufficient to determine whether he had been subjected to the sort of prejudice  1981 would redress, respondent was to be given the opportunity to prove his case. [Footnote 3]
We granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 812 (1986), limited to the statute of limitations issue and the question whether a person of Arabian ancestry was protected from racial discrimination under  1981, and now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
Page 481 U. S. 608


We agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent's claim was not time-barred.  Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261 (1985), required that, in selecting the applicable state statute of limitations in  1983 cases, the lower federal courts should choose the state statute applicable to other personal injury torts.  Thereafter, the Third Circuit in Goodman held that Wilson applies to  1981 cases as well, and that the Pennsylvania 2-year statute should apply.  The Court of Appeals in this case, however, held that, when respondent filed his suit, which was prior to Wilson v. Garcia, it was clearly established in the Third Circuit that a  1981 plaintiff had six years to bring an action, and that Goodman should not be applied retroactively to bar respondent's suit.
Insofar as what the prevailing law was in the Third Circuit, we have no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeals.  Under controlling precedent in that Circuit, respondent had six years to file his suit, and it was filed well within that time.  See 784 F.2d at 512-513.  We also assume, but do not decide, that Wilson v. Garcia controls the selection of the applicable state statute of limitations in  1981 cases.  The Court of Appeals, however, correctly held that its decision in Goodman should not be retroactively applied to bar respondent's action in this case.  The usual rule is that federal cases should be decided in accordance with the law existing at the time of decision.  Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473,  453 U. S. 486, n. 16 (1981); Thorpe v. Durham Housing Authority, 393 U. S. 268,  393 U. S. 281 (1969); United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103,  5 U. S. 110 (1801).  But Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, supra, counsels against retroactive application of statute of limitations decisions in certain circumstances.  There, the Court held that its decision specifying the applicable state statute of limitations should be applied only prospectively, because it overruled clearly established Circuit precedent on which the complaining party was entitled to rely, because retroactive application would be inconsistent with the purpose 
Page 481 U. S. 609
 of the underlying substantive statute, and because such application would be manifestly inequitable.  The Court of Appeals found these same factors were present in this case, and foreclosed retroactive application of its decision in Goodman.  We perceive no good reason for not applying Chevron where Wilson has required a Court of Appeals to overrule its prior cases.  Nor has petitioner persuaded us that there was any error in the application of Chevron in the circumstances existing in this case.

Section 1981 provides:
""All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.""
Although  1981 does not itself use the word ""race,"" the Court has construed the section to forbid all ""racial"" discrimination in the making of private as well as public contracts.  Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160,  427 U. S. 168,  427 U. S. 174-175 (1976).  Petitioner college, although a private institution, was therefore subject to this statutory command.  There is no disagreement among the parties on these propositions.  The issue is whether respondent has alleged racial discrimination within the meaning of  1981.
Petitioners contend that respondent is a Caucasian, and cannot allege the kind of discrimination  1981 forbids.  Concededly, McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U. S. 273 (1976), held that white persons could maintain a  1981 suit; but that suit involved alleged discrimination against a white person in favor of a black, and petitioner submits that the section does not encompass claims of discrimination 
Page 481 U. S. 610
 by one Caucasian against another.  We are quite sure that the Court of Appeals properly rejected this position.
Petitioner's submission rests on the assumption that all those who might be deemed Caucasians today were thought to be of the same race when  1981 became law in the 19th century; and it may be that a variety of ethnic groups, including Arabs, are now considered to be within the Caucasian race. [Footnote 4]  The understanding of ""race"" in the 19th century, however, was different.  Plainly, all those who might be deemed Caucasian today were not thought to be of the same race at the time  1981 became law.
In the middle years of the 19th century, dictionaries commonly referred to race as a ""continued series of descendants from a parent who is called the stock,"" N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 666 (New 
Page 481 U. S. 611
 York 1830) (emphasis in original), ""[t]he lineage of a family,"" 2 N. Webster, A Dictionary of the English Language 411 (New Haven 1841), or ""descendants of a common ancestor,"" J. Donald, Chambers' Etymological Dictionary of the English Language 415 (London 1871).  The 1887 edition of Webster's expanded the definition somewhat:  ""The descendants of a common ancestor; a family, tribe, people or nation, believed or presumed to belong to the same stock.""  N. Webster, Dictionary of the English Language 589 (W. Wheeler ed. 1887).  It was not until the 20th century that dictionaries began referring to the Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro races, 8 The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia 4926 (1911), or to race as involving divisions of mankind based upon different physical characteristics.  Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 794 (3d ed.1916).  Even so, modern dictionaries still include among the definitions of race ""a family, tribe, people, or nation belonging to the same stock.""  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1870 (1971); Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 969 (1986).
Encyclopedias of the 19th century also described race in terms of ethnic groups, which is a narrower concept of race than petitioners urge.  Encyclopedia Americana in 1858, for example, referred to various races such as Finns, vol. 5, p. 123, gypsies, 6 id. at 123, Basques, 1 id. at 602, and Hebrews, 6 id. at 209.  The 1863 version of the New American Cyclopaedia divided the Arabs into a number of subsidiary races, vol. 1, p. 739; represented the Hebrews as of the Semitic race, 9 id. at 27, and identified numerous other groups as constituting races, including Swedes, 15 id. at 216, Norwegians, 12 id. at 410, Germans, 8 id. at 200, Greeks, 8 id. at 438, Finns, 7 id. at 513, Italians, 9 id. at 644-645 (referring to mixture of different races), Spanish, 14 id. at 804, Mongolians, 11 id. at 651, Russians, 14 id. at 226, and the like.  The Ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica also referred to Arabs, vol. 2, p. 245 (1878), Jews, 13 id. at 685 (1881), and other ethnic groups such as Germans, 10 id. at 
Page 481 U. S. 612
 473 (1879), Hungarians, 12 id. at 365 (1880), and Greeks, 11 id. at 83 (1880), as separate races.
These dictionary and encyclopedic sources are somewhat diverse, but it is clear that they do not support the claim that, for the purposes of  1981, Arabs, Englishmen, Germans, and certain other ethnic groups are to be considered a single race.  We would expect the legislative history of  1981, which the Court held in Runyon v. McCrary had its source in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, 144, to reflect this common understanding, which it surely does.  The debates are replete with references to the Scandinavian races, Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 499 (1866) (remarks of Sen. Cowan), as well as the Chinese, id. at 523 (remarks of Sen. Davis), Latin, id. at 238 (remarks of Rep. Kasson during debate of home rule for the District of Columbia), Spanish, id. at 251 (remarks of Sen. Davis during debate of District of Columbia suffrage), and Anglo-Saxon races, id. at 542 (remarks of Rep. Dawson).  Jews, ibid., Mexicans, see ibid. (remarks of Rep. Dawson), blacks, passim, and Mongolians, id. at 498 (remarks of Sen. Cowan), were similarly categorized.  Gypsies were referred to as a race.  Ibid. (remarks of Sen. Cowan).  Likewise, the Germans:
""Who will say that Ohio can pass a law enacting that no man of the German race . . . shall ever own any property in Ohio, or shall ever make a contract in Ohio, or ever inherit property in Ohio, or ever come into Ohio to live, or even to work?  If Ohio may pass such a law, and exclude a German citizen . . . because he is of the German nationality or race, then may every other State do so.""
Id. at 1294 (remarks of Sen. Shellabarger).
There was a reference to the Caucasian race, but it appears to have been referring to people of European ancestry.  Id. at 523 (remarks of Sen. Davis).
The history of the 1870 Act reflects similar understanding of what groups Congress intended to protect from intentional 
Page 481 U. S. 613
 discrimination.  It is clear, for example, that the civil rights sections of the 1870 Act provided protection for immigrant groups such as the Chinese.  This view was expressed in the Senate.  Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 1536, 3658, 3808 (1870).  In the House, Representative Bingham described  16 of the Act, part of the authority for  1981, as declaring
""that the States shall not hereafter discriminate against the immigrant from China and in favor of the immigrant from Prussia, nor against the immigrant from France and in favor of the immigrant from Ireland.""
Id. at 3871.
Based on the history of  1981, we have little trouble in concluding that Congress intended to protect from discrimination identifiable classes of persons who are subjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics.  Such discrimination is racial discrimination that Congress intended  1981 to forbid, whether or not it would be classified as racial in terms of modern scientific theory. [Footnote 5]  The Court of Appeals was thus quite right in holding that  1981, ""at a minimum,"" reaches discrimination against an individual ""because he or she is genetically part of an ethnically and physiognomically distinctive subgrouping of homo sapiens.""  It is clear from our holding, however, that a distinctive physiognomy is not essential to qualify for  1981 protection.  If respondent, on remand, can prove that he was subjected to intentional discrimination based on the fact that he was born an Arab, rather than solely on the place or nation of his origin, or his religion, he will have made out a case under  1981.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.
It is so ordered. 
Page 481 U. S. 614

[Footnote 1]
The  1983 claim was dismissed for want of state action.  The pendent state claims were also dismissed.
[Footnote 2]
The Court of Appeals thus rejected petitioners' claim that respondent's complaint alleged only national origin and religious discrimination, assertedly not reached by  1981.
[Footnote 3]
The Court of Appeals also held that the individual members of the tenure committee were subject to liability under  1981.  The District Court was also to reconsider its dismissal of the pendent state claims.
[Footnote 4]
There is a common popular understanding that there are three major human races -- Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid.  Many modern biologists and anthropologists, however, criticize racial classifications as arbitrary and of little use in understanding the variability of human beings.  It is said that genetically homogeneous populations do not exist, and traits are not discontinuous between populations; therefore, a population can only be described in terms of relative frequencies of various traits.  Clear-cut categories do not exist.  The particular traits which have generally been chosen to characterize races have been criticized as having little biological significance.  It has been found that differences between individuals of the same race are often greater than the differences between the ""average"" individuals of different races.  These observations and others have led some, but not all, scientists to conclude that racial classifications are for the most part sociopolitical, rather than biological, in nature.  S. Molnar, Human Variation (2d ed.1983); S. Gould, The Mismeasure of Man (1981); M. Banton & J. Harwood, The Race Concept (1975); A. Montagu, Man's Most Dangerous Myth (1974); A. Montagu, Statement on Race (3d ed.1972); Science and the Concept of Race (M. Mead, T. Dobzhansky, E. Tobach, & R. Light eds.1968); A. Montagu, The Concept of Race (1964); R. Benedict, Race and Racism (1942); Littlefield, Lieberman, & Reynolds, Redefining Race:  The Potential Demise of a Concept in Physical Anthropology, 23 Current Anthropology 641 (1982); Biological Aspects of Race, 17 Int'l Soc. Sci. J. 71 (1965); Washburn, The Study of Race, 65 American Anthropologist 521 (1963).
[Footnote 5]
We note that, under prior cases, discrimination by States on the basis of ancestry violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U. S. 475,  347 U. S. 479 (1954); Oyama v. California, 332 U. S. 633,  332 U. S. 646 (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81,  320 U. S. 100 (1943).  See also Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24,  334 U.

After their synagogue was painted with anti-Semitic slogans, phrases, and symbols, petitioners brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the desecration by respondents violated 42 U.S.C.  1982.  The District Court dismissed petitioners' claims, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that discrimination against Jews is not racial discrimination under  1982.
Held:
1. A charge of racial discrimination within the meaning of  1982 cannot be made out by alleging only that the defendants were motivated by racial animus.  It is also necessary to allege that that animus was directed toward the kind of group that Congress intended to protect when it passed the statute.  P.  481 U. S. 617.
2. Jews can state a  1982 claim of racial discrimination, since they were among the peoples considered to be distinct races, and hence within the protection of the statute at the time it was passed.

Syllabus 
Appellant, a totally disabled veteran whose main source of income is federal veterans' benefits, was held in contempt by the state trial court for failure to pay child support, the amount of which had been fixed by the court after considering appellant's benefits to be income under a Tennessee statute.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the Veterans' Administration (VA) has exclusive jurisdiction to specify payments of child support from the disability benefits it provides.  The court determined that Congress intended disability benefits to support the beneficiary and his dependents, and held that the trial court's order directing appellant to pay a portion of those benefits as child support or be held in contempt did not undermine a substantial federal interest.
Held:  A state court has jurisdiction to hold a disabled veteran in contempt for failing to pay child support, even if the veteran's only means of satisfying this obligation is to utilize veterans' benefits received as compensation for a service-connected disability.  The Tennessee statute, as construed by the state courts to authorize an award of disability benefits as child support, is not preempted under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, since it does not conflict with federal law.  Pp.  481 U. S. 625-636.
(a) Title 38 U.S.C.  3107(a)(2), which gives the VA discretionary authority to apportion disability compensation on behalf of a veteran's children, is not an exclusive grant of authority to the VA to order that child support be paid from disability benefits, and does not indicate that exercise of the VA's discretion could yield independent child support determinations in conflict with existing state court orders.  Moreover, the implementing regulations, which simply authorize apportionment if ""the veteran is not reasonably discharging his or her [child support] responsibility . . . ,"" contain few guidelines for apportionment, and no specific procedures for bringing claims.  Furthermore, to construe  3107(a)(2) as preemptive could open for reconsideration a vast number of existing divorce decrees affecting disabled veterans, and lead in future cases to piecemeal litigation before the state courts and the VA.  Given the traditional authority of state courts over child support, their unparalleled familiarity with local economic factors affecting the issue, and their experience in applying state statutes that contain detailed support guidelines and procedures, it seems certain that Congress would have been 
Page 481 U. S. 620
 more explicit had it meant the VA's apportionment power to displace state court authority.  Pp.  481 U. S. 626-628.
(b) Title 38 U.S.C.  211(a), which provides that VA decisions on benefits for veterans and their dependents are final, conclusive, and not subject to review by any other federal official or federal court, does not vest exclusive jurisdiction in the VA, nor preempt state court jurisdiction to enforce a veteran's child support obligation.  Section 211(a) makes no reference to state court jurisdiction.  Moreover, its purpose of achieving uniformity in the administration of veterans' benefits is not threatened by state child support contempt proceedings, which do not review the disability eligibility decisions that are the primary focus of the section.  Furthermore, since the VA is not a party in a contempt proceeding, it is not subjected to an additional litigation burden, the prevention of which is also a purpose of  211(a).  Pp.  481 U. S. 628-630.
(c) State court jurisdiction is not preempted by 38 U.S.C.  3101(a), which provides that veterans' benefits payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary, shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure.  Neither of  3101(a)'s purposes -- to avoid the VA's being placed in the position of a collection agency and to prevent the deprivation and depletion of veterans' means of subsistence -- is constrained by allowing the state courts to hold appellant in contempt.  The VA is not obliged to participate in the state proceedings or pay benefits directly to appellee.  Moreover, the legislative history establishes that disability benefits are intended to provide compensation for disabled veterans and their families. Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655, Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U. S. 572, and Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46, distinguished.  Pp.  481 U. S. 630-634.
(d) Provisions of the Child Support Enforcement Act, which provide that moneys payable by the Government to any individual are subject to child support enforcement proceedings (42 U.S.C.  659(a)), but which specifically exclude VA disability benefits, do not establish a congressional intent to exempt such benefits from legal process.  Section 659(a) was intended to create a limited waiver of sovereign immunity so that state courts could issue valid orders directed against Government agencies attaching funds in their possession.  Thus, although veterans' disability benefits may be exempt from attachment while in the VA's hands, once they are delivered to the veteran, a state court can require that they be used to satisfy a child support order.  Pp.  481 U. S. 634-635.

Under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, and its progeny, the right to an impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibits the exclusion of venire members for cause in capital cases unless their stated opposition to the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as jurors.  Davis v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 122, in effect established a per se rule requiring the vacation of a death sentence imposed by a jury from which a potential juror, who has conscientious scruples against the death penalty but who nevertheless, under Witherspoon, is eligible to serve, has been erroneously excluded for cause.  At voir dire during petitioner's capital murder trial, the trial judge in eight instances denied the prosecutor's motions to dismiss for cause venire members who expressed some degree of doubt about the death penalty.  The prosecutor used peremptory challenges to remove those eight panel members.  When venire member Bounds, although initially somewhat confused in her response, stated that she could reach a guilty verdict and vote to impose the death penalty, the trial judge nevertheless excused her for cause on the motion of the prosecutor, who by then had exercised all of his peremptory challenges.  The judge acknowledged that he had made the prosecutor use peremptory challenges against venire members whose opposition to the death penalty was unequivocal.  Ultimately, the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence.  Although acknowledging that Bounds was clearly qualified to be a juror, the court concluded that her erroneous exclusion did not prejudice petitioner, since that error simply corrected other errors the trial judge committed in refusing to dismiss venire members for cause after they unequivocally stated that they could not vote to impose the death penalty.
Held:  The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded.
472 So.2d 409, reversed in part and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B-l, and IV, concluding that:
1. Venire member Bounds was clearly qualified to be seated as a juror under Witherspoon and its progeny.  Thus, the trial court was not authorized to exclude her for cause.  Pp.  481 U. S. 657-659. 
Page 481 U. S. 649

2. Davis is reaffirmed.  Witherspoon violations constitute reversible constitutional error, and cannot be subjected to harmless error review.  Pp.  481 U. S. 659-667.
(a) The State Supreme Court's analysis is rejected if and to the extent it is based on the reasoning that the trial judge restored one of the State's peremptory challenges by determining that he had erred in denying one of the Witherspoon motions, and that Bounds' erroneous removal for cause was therefore harmless, since the State would have used its restored challenge to remove her in any case.  This ""unexercised peremptory"" argument wrongly assumes that the crucial question is whether a particular prospective juror is excluded due to the court's erroneous ruling.  Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether the composition of the jury panel as a whole could possibly have been affected by the error.  However, the jury selection process requires a series of on-the-spot decisions weighing the relative objectionableness of a particular venire member against the number of peremptory challenges available at that time.  Thus, the nature of the selection process defies any attempt to establish that an erroneous Witherspoon exclusion is harmless.  Pp.  481 U. S. 661-666.
(b) The State's argument that Bounds' exclusion was a single technical error that should be considered harmless because it did not have any prejudicial effect is unavailing under Davis.  Pp.  481 U. S. 666-667.
3. The State Supreme Court's judgment cannot stand insofar as it imposes the death sentence.  P.  481 U. S. 668.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-B-2 that, since it appears that prosecutors often use peremptory challenges to remove venire members who have expressed any degree of hesitation against imposing the death penalty, and because courts generally do not review the prosecution's reasons for exercising peremptory challenges, it cannot be said that an erroneous exclusion for cause of a scrupled, yet eligible, venire member is an isolated incident having no prejudicial effect in any particular case.  The constitutional right to an impartial jury is so basic to a fair trial that its infraction can never be treated as harmless error.  Pp.  481 U. S. 667-668.
JUSTICE POWELL, agreed that the trial court erred in removing Bounds for cause, and that Davis therefore requires petitioner's resentencing.  But the proper exclusion by means of peremptory challenges of other jurors who might have shared Bounds' views did not exacerbate the prejudice created by her removal, and has no significance to the decision of this case.  Witherspoon and its progeny do not restrict the traditional rights of prosecutors to remove peremptorily jurors believed to be unwilling to impose lawful punishment.  Pp.  481 U. S. 669-672.

Under Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135, the Government has no Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) liability for injuries to members of the military service arising out of or in the course of activity incident to service.  Respondent's husband, a helicopter pilot for the Coast Guard, was killed when his helicopter crashed during a rescue mission.  Shortly before the crash, air traffic controllers from the Federal Aviation Administration, a civilian agency of the Federal Government, had assumed positive radar control over the helicopter.  After receiving veterans' benefits for her husband's death, respondent filed an FTCA action seeking damages from the Government on the ground that the controllers' negligence had caused the crash.  The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint relying exclusively on Feres.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing Feres from cases such as the present in which negligence is alleged on the part of a Government employee who is not a member of the military.  Finding the effect of a suit on military discipline to be the Feres doctrine's primary justification, the court ruled that Feres did not bar respondent's suit, since there was no indication that the conduct or decisions of military personnel would be subjected to scrutiny if the case proceeded to trial.
Held:  The Feres doctrine bars an FTCA action on behalf of a service member killed during an activity incident to service, even if the alleged negligence is by civilian employees of the Federal Government.  Pp.  481 U. S. 686-692.
(a) This Court and the lower federal courts have consistently applied the Feres doctrine since its inception, and have never suggested that the military status of the alleged tortfeasor is crucial.  Nor has Congress seen fit to change the Feres standard in the more than 35 years since it was articulated.  Pp.  481 U. S. 686-688.
(b) The three broad rationales underlying Feres refute the critical significance ascribed to the status of the alleged tortfeasor by the Court of Appeals.  First, the distinctively federal character of the relationship between the Government and Armed Forces personnel necessitates a federal remedy that provides simple, certain, and uniform compensation, unaffected by the fortuity of the situs of the alleged negligence.  Second, the statutory veterans' disability and death benefits system 
Page 481 U. S. 682
 provides the sole remedy for service-connected injuries.  Third, even if military negligence is not specifically alleged in a service member's FTCA suit, military discipline may be impermissibly affected by the suit, since the judgments and decisions underlying the military mission are necessarily implicated, and the duty and loyalty that service members owe to their services and the country may be undermined.  Pp.  481 U. S. 688-691.
(c) Respondent's husband's death resulted from the rescue mission, a primary duty of the Coast Guard, and the mission was an activity incident to his service.  Respondent received statutory veterans' benefits on behalf of her husband's death.  Because respondent's husband was acting pursuant to standard Coast Guard Operating Procedures, the potential that this suit could implicate military discipline is substantial.  Thus, this case falls within the heart of the Feres doctrine.  Pp.  481 U. S. 691-692.

As a means of ameliorating the problem of extreme fractionation of Indian lands that, pursuant to federal statutes dating back to the end of the 19th century, were allotted to individual Indians and held in trust by the United States, and that, through successive generations, had been splintered into multiple undivided interests by descent or devise, Congress enacted  207 (later amended) of the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983.  As originally enacted,  207 provided that no undivided fractional interest in such lands shall descend by intestacy or devise, but, instead, shall escheat to the tribe
""if such interest represents 2 percentum or less of the total acreage in such tract and has earned to its owner less than $100 in the preceding year before it is due to escheat.""
No provision for the payment of compensation to the owners of the interests covered by  207 was made.  Appellees are members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and either are, or represent, heirs or devisees of Tribe members who died while the original terms of  207 were in effect and who owned fractional interests subject to  207.  Appellees filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that  207 resulted in a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  The District Court held that the statute was constitutional, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that appellees' decedents had a right, derived from the original Sioux allotment statute, to control disposition of their property at death, that appellees had standing to invoke such right, and that the taking of the right without compensation to decedents' estates violated the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. Appellees have standing to challenge  207, which has deprived them of the fractional interests they otherwise would have inherited.  This is sufficient injury-in-fact to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III of the Constitution.  Moreover, the concerns of the prudential standing doctrine are also satisfied, even though appellees do not assert that their own property rights have been taken unconstitutionally, but rather that their decedents' right to pass the property at death has been taken.  For decedent Indians with trust property, federal statutes require the Secretary of the Interior to assume the general 
Page 481 U. S. 705
 role of the executor or administrator of the estate in asserting the decedent's surviving claims.  Here, however, the Secretary's responsibilities in that capacity include the administration of the statute that appellees claim is unconstitutional, so that he cannot be expected to assert decedents' rights to the extent that they turn on the statute's constitutionality.  Under these circumstances, appellees can appropriately serve as their decedents' representatives for purposes of asserting the latters' Fifth Amendment rights.  Pp.  481 U. S. 711-712.
2. The original version of  207 effected a ""taking"" of appellees' decedents' property without just compensation.  Determination of the question whether a governmental property regulation amounts to a ""taking"" requires ad hoc factual inquiries as to such factors as the impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action.  Here, the relative impact of  207 upon appellees' decedents can be substantial.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the income generated by the parcels in question may be properly thought of as de minimis, their value may not be.  Although appellees' decedents retain full beneficial use of the property during their lifetimes, as well as the right to convey it inter vivos, the right to pass on valuable property to one's heirs is itself a valuable right.  However, the extent to which any of appellees' decedents had investment-backed expectations in passing on the property is dubious.  Also weighing weakly in favor of the statute is the fact that there is something of an ""average reciprocity of advantage,"" Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393,  260 U. S. 415, to the extent that owners of escheatable interests maintain a nexus to the Tribe, and consolidation of lands in the Tribe benefits Tribe members, since consolidated lands are more productive than fractionated lands.  But the character of the Government regulation here is extraordinary, since it amounts to virtually the abrogation of the right to pass on property to one's heirs, which right has been part of the Anglo-American legal system since feudal times.  Moreover,  207 effectively abolishes both descent and devise of the property interest even when the passing of the property to the heir might result in consolidation of property -- as, for instance, when the heir already owns another undivided interest in the property -- which is the governmental purpose sought to be advanced.

No. 86-281
Argued April 28, 1987
Decided May 18, 1987
481 U.S. 736

Syllabus 
Upon his convictions for one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, petitioner was sentenced to concurrent prison terms on all three counts and to concurrent special parole terms on the two possession counts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conspiracy conviction and one of the possession convictions, but, applying the so-called ""concurrent sentence doctrine,"" declined to review the second possession conviction because the sentences on the two possession counts were concurrent.
Held:  The judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to consider petitioner's challenge to his second possession conviction.  Since, in addition to the concurrent prison and parole terms, the District Court imposed a $50 assessment on petitioner on each count pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3013 (1982 ed., Supp. III), and since petitioner's liability to pay the total $150 assessment depends on the validity of each of his three convictions, petitioner is not in fact serving concurrent sentences.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 18, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of California, Fourth Appellate District. 
 The motion of respondent Ronald Lee Sabo for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The motion of respondent Angela Marie Zizzo for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 During a routine helicopter patrol a deputy sheriff observed what he believed to be marijuana plants growing inside a 15 by 20 foot greenhouse located in respondents' back yard. The helicopter hovered at 400 to 500 feet and circled the greenhouse in order to give the deputy a better look at the marijuana. Based on this observation a search warrant issued and deputies seized the marijuana. A trial court held the marijuana inadmissible as evidence and the California Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the deputy's observation of the greenhouse from the hovering helicopter violated the Fourth Amendment. People v. Sabo, 185 Cal.App.3d 845, 230 Cal.Rptr. 170 (1986). The Court of Appeals distinguished California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. ___ (1986 ), on the ground that there the observation of marijuana was made from a fixed-wing aircraft flying in navigable airspace at an altitude over 1,000 feet. The court concluded that here the helicopter was not in navigable airspace as that term is defined at 49 U.S.C. 1301(29), but recognized that the helicopter was lawfully positioned because federal regulations allow operation of helicopters at altitudes less than the minimum permitted to fixed-wing aircraft, [ California v. Sabo 481 U.S. 1058 (1987) ][1058-Continued.] 
provided that the helicopter operates without hazard to persons or property, see 14 CFR 91.79(d) (1986).* The court expressed concern about the capabilities of helicopters to furnish ""a platform for aerial surveillance,"" id., 230 Cal.Rptr. at 175, and held that the search in this case infringed on a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
 The Court of Appeals' holding that the helicopter was not in navigable airspace is questionable, and even if this is technically correct it remains true, as the court conceded, that the helicopter was lawfully positioned when the deputy observed the marijuana in respondents' greenhouse. While it is certainly possible that helicopter surveillance could be unreasonably intrusive on account of interminable hovering, raising clouds of dust, creating unreasonable noise, and so forth, nothing in the record indicates that any such factor was present in this case. The decision below is a highly questionable interpretation of our decision in California v. Ciraolo. I would grant certiorari. 
[Footnote *] Title 49 U.S.C. 1301(29) defines navigable airspace as ""airspace above the minimum altitudes of flight prescribed by regulations issued under this chapter, . . . includ[ing] airspace needed to insure safety in take-off and landing of aircraft."" The Court of Appeals reasoned that a helicopter flying below 1000 feet is not above a specified minimum flight altitude and hence not in navigable airspace.

No. 85-1973
Argued February 24, 1987
Decided May 4, 1987
481 U.S. 497

Syllabus 
Under Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, the third or ""value"" prong of the tripartite test for judging whether material is obscene requires the trier of fact to determine ""whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.""  After petitioners, both of whom were attendants at adult bookstores, sold certain magazines to police, they were separately charged with the offense of ""obscenity"" under Illinois law.  Both trial courts instructed the respective juries that, to convict, they must find, inter alia, that the magazines were without ""value.""  The juries were also instructed to judge whether the material was obscene by determining how it would be viewed by ordinary adults in the whole State of Illinois.  The State Appellate Court affirmed both petitioners' convictions, rejecting their contention that the ""value"" issue must be determined solely on an objective basis, and not by reference to ""contemporary community standards.""
Held:
1. In a prosecution for the sale of allegedly obscene materials, the jury should not be instructed to apply community standards in deciding the value question.  Only the first and second prongs of the Miller test -- appeal to prurient interest and patent offensiveness -- should be decided with reference to ""contemporary community standards.""  The ideas that a work represents need not obtain majority approval to merit protection, and the value of that work does not vary from community to community based on the degree of local acceptance it has won.  The proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious value in the allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.  The instruction at issue therefore violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  481 U. S. 500-501.
2. Whether petitioners' convictions should be reversed outright, or are subject to salvage because the erroneous instruction constituted harmless error, will not be decided by this Court, since the State Appellate Court has not considered the harmless error issue.  Under Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, in the absence of error that renders a trial fundamentally unfair, a conviction should be affirmed where the reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial established guilt beyond 
Page 481 U. S. 498
 a reasonable doubt.  Here, since the jurors were not precluded from considering the value question, petitioners' convictions should stand despite the erroneous ""community standards"" instruction if the appellate court concludes that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could find ""value"" in the magazines petitioners sold.

No. 85-2121
Argued March 31, 1987
Decided May 4, 1987
481 U.S. 520

Syllabus 
After being advised of his Miranda rights while in custody for killing his son, respondent stated that he did not wish to answer any questions until a lawyer was present.  All questioning then ceased and respondent was placed in the police captain's office, since there was no secure detention area.  Following her questioning in another room, respondent's wife insisted that she be allowed to speak with her husband.  Although reluctant at first, the police allowed the meeting in the office on the condition that an officer be present.  Using a recorder placed in plain sight, the officer taped a brief conversation, during which the wife expressed despair, and respondent told her not to answer questions until a lawyer was present.  The prosecution used the tape to rebut respondent's insanity defense, the trial court having refused to suppress it upon finding that the police's actions were not a subterfuge to avoid the dictates of Miranda.  Respondent was convicted and sentenced to death, but the Arizona Supreme Court reversed, holding that the police had impermissibly interrogated respondent within the meaning of Miranda.  Noting police admissions that they knew it was ""possible"" that respondent might make incriminating statements if he saw his wife, the court relied on the ruling in Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, that ""interrogation"" includes a practice -- whether actual questioning or ""its functional equivalent"" -- that the police know is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect.  According to Innis, the likelihood-of-response question focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.
Held:  The police's actions following respondent's refusal to be questioned without a lawyer did not constitute interrogation or its functional equivalent.  The purpose of Miranda and Innis is to prevent the government from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment.  This purpose is not implicated here, since respondent was not subjected to compelling influences, psychological ploys, or direct questioning.  There is no evidence that the police allowed the wife to meet with respondent in order to obtain incriminating statements.  Moreover, police testimony, which the trial court found credible, indicated a number of legitimate reasons for an officer's presence at the meeting, including the wife's safety and various security considerations.  Furthermore, an examination of the situation 
Page 481 U. S. 521
 from respondent's perspective demonstrates the improbability that he would have felt he was being coerced to incriminate himself simply because he was told his wife would be allowed to speak to him.  Although the police were indeed aware that it was ""possible"" respondent would incriminate himself while talking to his wife, police do not ""interrogate"" a suspect simply by hoping he will confess.  Thus, respondent's statements to his wife were voluntary, and their use at his trial was not prohibited by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  481 U. S. 525-530.

|481 u.s. 537|"Board of Directors, Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte
No. 86-421
Argued March 30, 1987
Decided May 4, 1987
481 U.S. 537

Syllabus 
Rotary International is a nonprofit corporation composed of local Rotary Clubs.  Its purposes are to provide humanitarian service, to encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and to help build world peace and good will.  Individuals are admitted to local club membership according to a ""classification system"" based on business, professional, and institutional activity in the community.  Although women are permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, receive awards, and form auxiliary organizations, the Rotary constitution excludes women from membership.  Because it had admitted women to active membership, the Duarte, California, Rotary Club's membership in the international organization was terminated.  That club and two of its women members filed a suit alleging that the termination violated California's Unruh Act (Act), which entitles all persons, regardless of sex, to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, and services in all business establishments in the State.  The state trial court entered judgment for Rotary International, concluding that neither it nor the Duarte Club is a ""business establishment"" within the meaning of the Act.  However, the State Court of Appeal reversed on this point, and rejected the contention that Rotary's policy of excluding women is protected by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, the court ordered the Duarte Club's reinstatement, and enjoined the enforcement of the gender requirements against it.
Held:
1. The Unruh Act does not violate the First Amendment by requiring California Rotary Clubs to admit women.  Pp.  481 U. S. 544-549.
(a) Application of the Act to local Rotary Clubs does not interfere unduly with club members' freedom of private association.  In determining whether a particular association is sufficiently intimate or private to warrant constitutional protection, consideration must be given to factors such as size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship.  Here, the relationship among Rotary Club members does not warrant protection, in light of the potentially large size of local clubs, the high turnover rate among club members, the inclusive nature of each club's membership, the public purposes behind clubs' service activities, and the fact that the clubs encourage the

(b) Application of the Act to California Rotary Clubs does not violate the First Amendment right of expressive association.  Although clubs engage in a variety of commendable service activities that are protected by the First Amendment, the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women will affect in any significant way the existing members' ability to carry out those activities.  Moreover, the Act does not require clubs to abandon or alter their classification and admission systems, but, in fact, will permit them to have an even more representative membership with a broadened capacity for service.  Even if the Act does work some slight infringement of members' rights, that infringement is justified by the State's compelling interests in eliminating discrimination against women and in assuring them equal access to public accommodations.

			"|"Board of Directors, Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte
No. 86-421
Argued March 30, 1987
Decided May 4, 1987
481 U.S. 537

Syllabus 
Rotary International is a nonprofit corporation composed of local Rotary Clubs.  Its purposes are to provide humanitarian service, to encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and to help build world peace and good will.  Individuals are admitted to local club membership according to a ""classification system"" based on business, professional, and institutional activity in the community.  Although women are permitted to attend meetings, give speeches, receive awards, and form auxiliary organizations, the Rotary constitution excludes women from membership.  Because it had admitted women to active membership, the Duarte, California, Rotary Club's membership in the international organization was terminated.  That club and two of its women members filed a suit alleging that the termination violated California's Unruh Act (Act), which entitles all persons, regardless of sex, to full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, and services in all business establishments in the State.  The state trial court entered judgment for Rotary International, concluding that neither it nor the Duarte Club is a ""business establishment"" within the meaning of the Act.  However, the State Court of Appeal reversed on this point, and rejected the contention that Rotary's policy of excluding women is protected by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, the court ordered the Duarte Club's reinstatement, and enjoined the enforcement of the gender requirements against it.
Held:
1. The Unruh Act does not violate the First Amendment by requiring California Rotary Clubs to admit women.  Pp.  481 U. S. 544-549.
(a) Application of the Act to local Rotary Clubs does not interfere unduly with club members' freedom of private association.  In determining whether a particular association is sufficiently intimate or private to warrant constitutional protection, consideration must be given to factors such as size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others are excluded from critical aspects of the relationship.  Here, the relationship among Rotary Club members does not warrant protection, in light of the potentially large size of local clubs, the high turnover rate among club members, the inclusive nature of each club's membership, the public purposes behind clubs' service activities, and the fact that the clubs encourage the

 participation of strangers in, and welcome media coverage of, many of their central activities.  Pp.  481 U. S. 544-547.
(b) Application of the Act to California Rotary Clubs does not violate the First Amendment right of expressive association.  Although clubs engage in a variety of commendable service activities that are protected by the First Amendment, the evidence fails to demonstrate that admitting women will affect in any significant way the existing members' ability to carry out those activities.

No. 85-1259
Argued January 21, 1987
Decided April 28, 1987
481 U.S. 412

Syllabus 
The Clean Water Act (Act) authorizes injunctive relief against violators (33 U.S.C.  1319(b)) and subjects them to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day ( 1319(d)).  After denying petitioner's timely demand for a jury trial in the Government's suit for relief under  1319(b) and 1319(d), the District Court imposed civil penalties and granted injunctive relief against petitioner.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that the Seventh Amendment entitled him to a jury trial on the civil penalties claim.  The court held, inter alia, that the District Court had exercised statutorily conferred equitable power in assessing monetary penalties.
Held:
1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial to determine liability in actions by the Government seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief under the Act.  An examination of the nature of such actions and of the remedies sought demonstrates that they are more analogous to ""Suits at common law"" within the meaning of the Amendment than they are to cases traditionally tried in courts of equity.  Pp.  481 U. S. 417-425.
(a) A Government suit under  1319(d) is analogous to an action in debt within the jurisdiction of English courts of law prior to the Seventh Amendment's enactment, and therefore should be tried by a jury.  The Government's argument that the action is more analogous to an action by the English sovereign to abate a public nuisance is debatable, but irrelevant for Seventh Amendment purposes, since that Amendment requires trial by jury in actions unheard of at common law.  Both a public nuisance action and an action in debt could be asserted by the sovereign to seek relief for an injury to the public in numerous contexts.  The conclusion that both are appropriate analogies to a  1319(d) action is sufficient here, particularly in light of the Court's characterization of the relief sought infra.  Pp.  481 U. S. 418-421.
(b) Unlike public nuisance actions which relied on the injunctive relief provided by equity courts, the text and legislative history of  1319(d) demonstrate that suits thereunder are intended to punish culpable individuals, and thus yield a type of remedy that at common law could only be enforced in a court of law.  The contention that a  1319(d) suit is similar to an equitable action for disgorgement of profits is not persuasive, since the latter is a remedy only for restitution, a more limited 
Page 481 U. S. 413
 form of relief than a civil penalty.  The Government's contention that its  1319(b) injunction action provides jurisdiction for incidental monetary relief without the necessity of a jury trial also fails, since equity courts may not enforce civil penalties, and the Government knew when it filed suit that relief would be limited primarily to civil penalties, because petitioner had already sold most of the property at issue.  The potential penalty of $23 million could hardly be considered ""incidental"" to the modest equitable relief sought.  Moreover, the Government was free to pursue its  1319(b) claim independent of its  1319(d) claim.  By choosing to combine them, it preserved petitioner's right to a jury trial on the legal claim and all issues common to both claims, and cannot abridge that right by characterizing the legal claim as ""incidental.""  Pp.  481 U. S. 422-425.
2. The Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a jury trial to assess civil penalties under the Act.  The fact that trial judges assess those penalties does not violate the Amendment, since assessment cannot be Said to involve the substance of a common law right to, nor a fundamental element of, a jury trial, as is necessary to implicate the Amendment.  Congress has an unquestioned right to fix civil penalties, and may delegate that right to trial judges, particularly where, as here, highly discretionary calculations that take into account multiple factors are necessary.  Pp.  481 U. S. 425-427.

Maintenance of Way Employes
No. 86-39
Argued February 23, 1987
Decided April 28, 1987
481 U.S. 429

Syllabus 
Respondent Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes (BMWE), which represents railroad employees nationwide, had a dispute over renewal of a collective bargaining agreement with a small railroad that is a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries, Inc. (Guilford), which also owns other railroads.  After exhausting the settlement procedures mandated by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), BMWE instituted a lawful strike against the Guilford railroads.  BMWE later extended its picketing to other railroads (including petitioners) with which Guilford interchanged traffic.  In petitioners' consolidated actions, the Federal District Court entered a preliminary injunction against BMWE's picketing of any railroads other than those involved in the primary dispute.  The court held that the ""substantial alignment"" test governs interpretation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,  1 and 4 of which bar federal courts from issuing injunctions against activities ""growing out of"" a ""labor dispute.""  Under the test, the scope of lawful strike activity is confined to activities that further the union's economic interests in a labor dispute, and that are directed at the primary employer and other substantially aligned employers -- those having an ownership interest in, or providing essential services or facilities to, the primary employer.  The court concluded that none of the petitioners were ""substantially aligned"" with Guilford, and that, thus, BMWE's secondary activity did not grow out of a labor dispute under the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and could be enjoined.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter an injunction.
Held:  Under the Norris-LaGuardia Act, a federal court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin secondary picketing in railway labor disputes.  Pp.  481 U. S. 437-453.
(a) The historical background of the Norris-LaGuardia Act -- particularly the legislative history showing that Congress was responding to what it considered to be unduly restrictive judicial construction of the anti-injunction provisions of  20 of the Clayton Act -- reveals that Congress intended to preclude courts from enjoining secondary as well as 
Page 481 U. S. 430
 primary activity, and that railroads were to be treated no differently from other industries in such regard.  Pp.  481 U. S. 437-440.
(b) Section 13(c) of the Norris-LaGuardia Act defines ""labor dispute"" as including
""any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment . . . regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee,""
and  13(a) provides that a case shall be held to ""grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry.""  Under the plain meaning of this language, BMWE's dispute with the primary employer here was unquestionably a labor dispute, and the secondary activity against petitioners grew out of that dispute.  Section 13(c)'s definition of ""labor dispute"" should not be narrowed by adoption of a test of ""substantial alignment"" of a picketed secondary employer with the primary employer.  Congress intended the definition of ""labor dispute"" to be broad, and adoption of the substantial alignment test would require courts, contrary to Congress' intent, to second-guess which activities are truly in a union's economic interest in a labor dispute.  Moreover, nothing in the Norris-LaGuardia Act or the RLA distinguishes permissible from impermissible secondary activities, and any judicial attempt to limit  13(c)'s language would make the lawfulness of a strike depend upon judicial views of social and economic policy, which is what the Norris-LaGuardia Act was designed to forestall.  Pp.  481 U. S. 440-443.
(c) Petitioners' contention that the injunction here was valid because, under the RLA, it is illegal for a union to resort to secondary picketing after the parties have exhausted the RLA's major dispute resolution procedures, is without merit.  Although the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not deprive a federal court of jurisdiction to enjoin compliance with the RLA's major dispute resolution provisions -- involving negotiation, mediation, voluntary arbitration, and conciliation -- the RLA does not expressly limit the scope of self-help available to a union once its resolution provisions have been exhausted.  The RLA's silence in this regard does not indicate that Congress viewed an express prohibition of secondary picketing to be superfluous, and intended to prohibit such picketing.  Cf. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369.  There is no merit to petitioners' contentions that the prohibition in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) against some forms of secondary activity should govern construction of the RLA.  Congressional policy, as expressed in the NLRA, remains that neither employers nor the NLRB are permitted to seek injunctions against the secondary conduct of railway employees.  Nor is there any merit to the argument that a ban on secondary picketing may be inferred from the general language of  2 
Page 481 U. S. 431
 First of the RLA, which places on employees the duty to attempt to settle disputes, and thereby avoid any interruption to interstate commerce.  Nothing in the RLA indicates that Congress intended to permit federal courts to enjoin secondary activity as a means to settle strikes and avoid interruptions to commerce.  Furthermore, the RLA provides a mechanism for the Executive Branch to intervene and interrupt any self-help measures by invoking an Emergency Board, thereby imposing a minimum 60-day cooling-off period.  If the Board's recommendations are not initially accepted by the parties, Congress may enforce the Board's recommendation by statute, as was done in this case.  Allowing secondary picketing in the self-help period is not inconsistent with the structure or purpose of the Act, and may in fact increase the likelihood of settlement prior to self-help.

No. 86-337
Argued March 25, 1987
Decided April 28, 1987
481 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
Section 306 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 -- which prohibits discriminatory state taxation of railroad property -- provides, in  306(b)(1), that a State may not
""assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value . . . than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.""
Section 306(c) includes, inter alia, provisions declaring an exception from the provisions of the Tax Injunction Act, conferring jurisdiction on district courts to prevent violations of  306(b), and stating that ""[t]he burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by State law.""  Petitioner railroad filed this action in the Federal District Court, alleging that respondents, Oklahoma taxation authorities and their members had discriminated against petitioner in the assessment of state property taxes for the 1982 tax year, particularly by overvaluing petitioner's property.  In Oklahoma, the determination of tax liability involves determining the value of the entire railroad system and allocating a portion of that value to Oklahoma, and then assessing the taxable value of the railroad's property at only a certain percentage of true market value, which, during the tax year in question, was concededly the same assessment ratio employed with respect to all other commercial and industrial property in the State.  Petitioner's claim of discriminatory taxation was based solely upon the State's overvaluation of the ""true market value"" of petitioner's entire railroad system.  Holding that  306 does not permit the exercise of federal .jurisdiction to review such claims of discriminatory state taxation unless the railroad shows purposeful overvaluation with discriminatory intent, the District Court found that no such showing had been made here, and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 306 permits federal court review of petitioner's claim of alleged overvaluation of its property.  Pp.  481 U. S. 460-464.
(a) Respondents' contention that  306 never permits district court review of claims of discriminatory taxation based upon overvaluation of railroad property is without merit.  The language of  306(b)(1) makes 
Page 481 U. S. 455
 clear that, in order to compare the actual assessment ratios applicable to railroad property and to other commercial and industrial property, it is necessary to determine what the ""true market values"" are.  The obstacle to respondents' position that the first occurrence of the phrase ""true market value"" in the statute should be read as ""state determined market value"" is the language of  306(c) stating that the burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by state law.  It would be inconsistent to allocate the burden of proof as to an issue which could not be litigated in federal court in the first place.  The additional provisions of  306(c) instructing the district courts as to methods for proving the assessment ratio for ""other commercial and industrial property"" do not, as respondents claim, raise an implication that the State's valuation of a railroad's property may not be proved at all.  Pp.  481 U. S. 460-463.
(b) The position of the courts below that district courts may not review claims of discriminatory taxation based upon overvaluation of railroad property unless the plaintiff first makes a preliminary showing of intentional discrimination is also untenable.  Section 306(b) speaks only in terms of ""acts"" which ""unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce""; nowhere does it refer to the actor's intent.  Moreover,  306(c) provides that relief may be granted only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of railroad property exceeds by at least 5% the assessment ratio for other commercial and industrial property.

			"|"Burlington Northern Railroad Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Commission
No. 86-337
Argued March 25, 1987
Decided April 28, 1987
481 U.S. 454

Syllabus 
Section 306 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 -- which prohibits discriminatory state taxation of railroad property -- provides, in  306(b)(1), that a State may not
""assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value . . . than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.""
Section 306(c) includes, inter alia, provisions declaring an exception from the provisions of the Tax Injunction Act, conferring jurisdiction on district courts to prevent violations of  306(b), and stating that ""[t]he burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by State law.""  Petitioner railroad filed this action in the Federal District Court, alleging that respondents, Oklahoma taxation authorities and their members had discriminated against petitioner in the assessment of state property taxes for the 1982 tax year, particularly by overvaluing petitioner's property.  In Oklahoma, the determination of tax liability involves determining the value of the entire railroad system and allocating a portion of that value to Oklahoma, and then assessing the taxable value of the railroad's property at only a certain percentage of true market value, which, during the tax year in question, was concededly the same assessment ratio employed with respect to all other commercial and industrial property in the State.  Petitioner's claim of discriminatory taxation was based solely upon the State's overvaluation of the ""true market value"" of petitioner's entire railroad system.  Holding that  306 does not permit the exercise of federal .jurisdiction to review such claims of discriminatory state taxation unless the railroad shows purposeful overvaluation with discriminatory intent, the District Court found that no such showing had been made here, and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 306 permits federal court review of petitioner's claim of alleged overvaluation of its property.  Pp.  481 U. S. 460-464.
(a) Respondents' contention that  306 never permits district court review of claims of discriminatory taxation based upon overvaluation of railroad property is without merit.  The language of  306(b)(1) makes 
Page 481 U. S. 455
 clear that, in order to compare the actual assessment ratios applicable to railroad property and to other commercial and industrial property, it is necessary to determine what the ""true market values"" are.  The obstacle to respondents' position that the first occurrence of the phrase ""true market value"" in the statute should be read as ""state determined market value"" is the language of  306(c) stating that the burden of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed by state law.  It would be inconsistent to allocate the burden of proof as to an issue which could not be litigated in federal court in the first place.  The additional provisions of  306(c) instructing the district courts as to methods for proving the assessment ratio for ""other commercial and industrial property"" do not, as respondents claim, raise an implication that the State's valuation of a railroad's property may not be proved at all.  Pp.  481 U. S. 460-463.
(b) The position of the courts below that district courts may not review claims of discriminatory taxation based upon overvaluation of railroad property unless the plaintiff first makes a preliminary showing of intentional discrimination is also untenable.  Section 306(b) speaks only in terms of ""acts"" which ""unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce""; nowhere does it refer to the actor's intent.  Moreover,  306(c) provides that relief may be granted only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of railroad property exceeds by at least 5% the assessment ratio for other commercial and industrial property.  That provision makes sense as a prohibition on the litigation of de minimis disparate impact claims, and does not support the view that Congress intended to reach only claims of intentional discrimination by overvaluation.  Pp.  481 U. S. 463-464.
(c) The contentions that injunctive relief against state taxation offends principles of comity, and that restrictions on valuation actions under  306 are necessary to avoid crowded federal dockets and unreasonable delay of the state tax collection process, involve policy considerations that may have weighed heavily with legislators who considered the Act and its predecessors.  This Court is not free to reconsider such policy matters.  P.  481 U. S. 464.

481 U.S. 465

Syllabus 
The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (Act) requires registration, reporting, and disclosure by persons engaging in propaganda on behalf of foreign powers.  The Act uses the term ""political propaganda"" to identify those expressive materials subject to its requirements, and defines the term as, inter alia, any communication intended to influence the United States' foreign policies.  Appellee, a member of the California State Senate, wished to show three Canadian films identified by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as ""political propaganda"" under the Act, but did not want to be publicly regarded as a disseminator of ""political propaganda.""  He therefore brought suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the application of the term ""political propaganda"" to the films.  The District Court granted the injunction, holding that the risk of damage to appellee's reputation established his standing to challenge the constitutionality of the use of the term ""political propaganda,"" and that such use violated the First Amendment.  According to the District Court, the public believes that materials to which the term ""political propaganda"" applies have been ""officially censured,"" and therefore those materials are rendered unavailable to people like appellee because of the risk of being seen in an unfavorable light by the public.  In the District Court's view, the conscious use of such a pejorative label was an unnecessary, and therefore invalid abridgment of speech.
Held:
1. Appellee has standing to challenge the Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" as a violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.  481 U. S. 472-477.
(a) That the identification of the films in question as ""political propaganda"" threatens to cause appellee cognizable injury is established by uncontradicted affidavits indicating that his exhibition of the films would substantially harm his chances for reelection and adversely affect his reputation in the community.  Even if he could minimize these risks by providing viewers with a statement about the high quality of the films and his reasons for agreeing with them, the statement would be ineffective among those citizens who shunned the films as ""political propaganda.""  Moreover, the need to take such affirmative steps would itself constitute a cognizable injury to appellee.  Pp.  481 U. S. 472-476. 
Page 481 U. S. 466

(b) The risk of injury to appellee's reputation can be traced to appellants' conduct, since it stems from DOJ's application of the term ""political propaganda"" to the films.  P.  481 U. S. 476.
(c) Granting appellee's requested relief would at least partially redress the complained-of injury, since a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional would eliminate the need to choose between exhibiting the films and incurring the risk of injury to appellee's reputation.  Pp.  481 U. S. 476-477.
2. The Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" is constitutional.  The District Court's holding to the contrary erroneously rests on potential public misunderstanding of the Act's effect, rather than on what the Act actually says, requires, or prohibits.  Pp.  481 U. S. 477-485.
(a) As defined in the Act, the term ""political propaganda"" not only includes slanted, misleading advocacy in the popular, pejorative sense, but also encompasses materials that are completely accurate and merit the highest respect.  Pp.  481 U. S. 477-478.
(b) Since the Act neither inhibits appellee's access to the films nor prohibits, edits, or restrains the distribution of materials to which the term ""political propaganda"" applies, it places no burden on protected expression.  To the contrary, it simply requires the disseminators of propaganda to make additional disclosures to better enable the public to evaluate the material's impact, allows them to add further information that they think germane, and thereby actually fosters freedom of speech.  It is, in fact, the District Court's injunction that wrongfully withholds information -- the fact that the films have been deemed to be ""political propaganda"" -- on the paternalistic assumption that the public will misunderstand, and therefore misuse the information.  Pp.  481 U. S. 480-483.
(c) Although the Act's definition of ""political propaganda"" has existed since 1942, there is no evidence that public misunderstanding or the fear thereof has actually interfered with the exhibition of a significant number of foreign-made films.  Pp.  481 U. S. 483-484.
(d) The Act's use of the term ""political propaganda"" is neutral, evenhanded, and without pejorative connotation, and is therefore constitutionally permissible.  Pp.  481 U. S. 484-485.

No. 86-1381
Decided April 27, 1987
481 U.S. 400

Syllabus 
An information charging respondent with felony sexual assault upon his ex-wife's 12-year-old daughter was dismissed, on respondent's motion, on the ground that he could be prosecuted only for incest under state law, because the victim was his stepdaughter.  Respondent was then tried, convicted, and sentenced upon a new information charging him with incest.  On his appeal to the Montana Supreme Court, it was discovered that, at the time of the assault in question, the incest statute did not apply to sexual assaults against stepchildren, and that the amended statute under which respondent was tried had not become effective until after the assault.  After concluding that the conviction was void under the Montana Constitution's ex post facto law prohibition, the court held that the Federal Constitution's Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited retrial on the ground that sexual assault and incest are the ""same [offense] in law and fact,"" Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161,  432 U. S. 167, n. 6.  As an alternative ground of decision, the court noted that respondent ""was convicted of a crime which did not exist on the date of the charged offense,"" and held that a retrial after such a conviction also would subject respondent to double jeopardy.
Held:  Although Montana's ex post facto law clause prevents the State from convicting respondent of incest, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent his trial on the related charge of sexual assault, where his incest conviction was reversed on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence and there is no suggestion that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to convict him, see Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, and where the State originally sought to try him for sexual assault, but, at his behest, tried him instead for incest.  Brown v. Ohio, supra, distinguished.  Moreover, the Clause does not forbid retrial because respondent was convicted of a nonexistent crime, but, in fact, permits retrial after a conviction is reversed because of a defect in the charging instrument.  Under the Montana court's reading of the sexual assault statute, respondent's conduct apparently was criminal at the time he engaged in it, 
Page 481 U. S. 401
 and, thus, the State simply relied on the wrong statute in its second information.
Certiorari granted; 224 Mont. 187, 728 P.2d 1339, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.
In 1984, the State of Montana filed an information in the Yellowstone County District Court charging respondent with felony sexual assault in violation of Mont.Code Ann.  455-502 (1981).  The affidavit in support of the information indicated that the assault took place during the summer of 1983, and that the victim was the daughter of respondent's ex-wife.  The victim was 12 years old at the time of the offense.  Four days before trial, respondent filed a motion to dismiss the information, arguing that, because the victim was his stepdaughter, he could be prosecuted only for incest, under Mont.Code Ann.  45-5-507 (1983), not sexual assault.  Respondent argued that incest was merely a specific instance of sexual assault, and that the Montana Legislature had not intended incestuous acts to be subject to prosecution under the more general sexual assault statute.  On the morning of the trial, the State District Court held a hearing and then granted the motion.  The State promptly filed a new information charging respondent with incest, and proceeded to trial.  A jury convicted respondent.  The judge sentenced respondent to 10 years' imprisonment, but suspended 5 years of the sentence.
Respondent appealed his conviction to the Montana Supreme Court, raising a number of claims not directly relevant to the issue before this Court.  One of respondent's claims was that he could not lawfully be convicted of incest, because the victim was not his stepdaughter within the meaning of the Montana incest statute.  In the course of considering this claim, the State discovered that, at the time of the assault, the incest statute had not applied to sexual assaults against stepchildren.  The amended statute under which respondent was tried had not become effective until 
Page 481 U. S. 402
 October 1, 1983, three months after the assault in question.  On March 6, 1986, the State filed a motion bringing this matter to the attention of the Montana Supreme Court.
After briefing on the questions raised by the State's motion, the Montana Supreme Court concluded that the conviction was void because retroactive application of the amended statute would violate the ex post facto law prohibition of the Montana Constitution, Art. II,  31.  It also held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibited retrial of respondent.  It stated that
""[i]f the offense charged in the second trial is the same in law and fact as the offense charged in the first trial, the double jeopardy clause prohibits successive trials.""
224 Mont. 187, 190, 728 P.2d 1339, 1340 (1986) (citing Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161,  432 U. S. 167, n. 6 (1977)).  The court then analyzed the elements of sexual assault and incest and concluded that they were the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.  Relying on this conclusion and Brown v. Ohio, it held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred retrial.  As an alternative ground of decision, it noted that respondent ""was convicted of a crime which did not exist on the date of the charged offense.""  224 Mont. at 192, 728 P.2d at 1342.  In the court's view, a retrial after a conviction for committing a nonexistent crime also would subject respondent to double jeopardy.
It is a ""venerable principl[e] of double jeopardy jurisprudence"" that
""[t]he successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, Burks v. United States, [437 U.S. 1 (1978)], poses no bar to further prosecution on the same charge.""
United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82,  437 U. S. 90-91 (1978).  See generally 3 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure  24.4 (1984).  Justice Harlan explained the basis for this rule:
""Corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing one whose 
Page 481 U. S. 403
 guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial.  It would be a high price indeed for society to pay were every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.  From the standpoint of a defendant, it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution.  In reality, therefore, the practice of retrial serves defendants' rights as well as society's interest.""
United States v. Tateo, 377 U. S. 463,  377 U. S. 466 (1964).  See Burks v. United States, supra, at  437 U. S. 16.
Although Montana's ex post facto law clause prevents Montana from convicting respondent of incest, we see no reason why the State should not be allowed to put respondent to a trial on the related charge of sexual assault.  There is no suggestion that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to convict respondent.  See Burks v. United States, supra. [Footnote 1]  Montana originally sought to try respondent for sexual assault.  At respondent's behest, Montana tried him instead for incest.  In these circumstances, trial of respondent for sexual assault, after reversal of respondent's incest conviction on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence, does not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.
The principal federal authority relied on by the Montana Supreme Court was our decision in Brown v. Ohio, supra.  The petitioner in that case had been convicted of joyriding.  After serving a term of imprisonment on that conviction, he was charged with auto theft.  We concluded that the charges 
Page 481 U. S. 404
 of joyriding and theft punished a single offense, and thus that retrial was impermissible.  But the Brown analysis is not apposite in this case. [Footnote 2]  In Brown, the defendant did not overturn the first conviction; indeed, he served the prison sentence assessed as punishment for that crime.  Thus, when the State sought to try him for auto theft, it actually was seeking a second conviction for the same offense.  By contrast, respondent in this case sought, and secured, invalidation of his first conviction.  This case falls squarely within the rule that retrial is permissible after a conviction is reversed on appeal.
The Montana court also suggested that the Double Jeopardy Clause would forbid retrial because respondent was convicted of an offense that did not exist when respondent had committed the acts in question.  But, under the Montana court's reading of the Montana sexual assault statute, respondent's conduct apparently was criminal at the time he engaged in it.  If that is so, the State simply relied on the wrong statute in its second information.  It is clear that the Constitution permits retrial after a conviction is reversed because of a defect in the charging instrument.  E.g., United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662,  163 U. S. 672 (1896).
We grant Montana's petition for a writ of certiorari [Footnote 3] and reverse the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court. [Footnote 4]  The 
Page 481 U. S. 405
 case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BRENNAN would deny the petition for certiorari.
[Footnote 1]
Nor was the jury's conviction of respondent on the charge of incest an implied acquittal of the offense of sexual assault; there would have been an implied acquittal only if the jury had been presented with charges of both sexual assault and incest and had chosen to convict respondent of incest.  See Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957).
[Footnote 2]
We explicitly noted in Brown that the case did not raise ""the double jeopardy questions that may arise . . . after a conviction is reversed on appeal.""  432 U.S. at  432 U. S. 165, n. 6.
[Footnote 3]
As JUSTICE STEVENS implicitly acknowledges, we have jurisdiction over this petition under 28 U.S.C.  1267(3).  The Montana court's decision ""fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law,"" and ""the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion.""  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1040-1041 (1983).
[Footnote 4]
We express no opinion on the correctness, as a matter of federal constitutional law, of the Montana Supreme Court's conclusion that sexual assault and incest are the ""same"" offenses.

II,  31.  It also held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution prohibited retrial of respondent.  It stated that
""[i]f the offense charged in the second trial is the same in law and fact as the offense charged in the first trial, the double jeopardy clause prohibits successive trials.""
224 Mont. 187, 190, 728 P.2d 1339, 1340 (1986) (citing Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161,  432 U. S. 167, n. 6 (1977)).  The court then analyzed the elements of sexual assault and incest and concluded that they were the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.  Relying on this conclusion and Brown v. Ohio, it held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred retrial.  As an alternative ground of decision, it noted that respondent ""was convicted of a crime which did not exist on the date of the charged offense.""  224 Mont. at 192, 728 P.2d at 1342.  In the court's view, a retrial after a conviction for committing a nonexistent crime also would subject respondent to double jeopardy.
It is a ""venerable principl[e] of double jeopardy jurisprudence"" that
""[t]he successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, Burks v. United States, [437 U.S. 1 (1978)], poses no bar to further prosecution on the same charge.""
United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82,  437 U. S. 90-91 (1978).  See generally 3 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure  24.4 (1984).  Justice Harlan explained the basis for this rule:
""Corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing one whose 
Page 481 U. S. 403
 guilt is clear after he has obtained such a trial.  It would be a high price indeed for society to pay were every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.  From the standpoint of a defendant, it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution.  In reality, therefore, the practice of retrial serves defendants' rights as well as society's interest.""
United States v. Tateo, 377 U. S. 463,  377 U. S. 466 (1964).  See Burks v. United States, supra, at  437 U. S. 16.
Although Montana's ex post facto law clause prevents Montana from convicting respondent of incest, we see no reason why the State should not be allowed to put respondent to a trial on the related charge of sexual assault.  There is no suggestion that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to convict respondent.  See Burks v. United States, supra. [Footnote 1]  Montana originally sought to try respondent for sexual assault.  At respondent's behest, Montana tried him instead for incest.  In these circumstances, trial of respondent for sexual assault, after reversal of respondent's incest conviction on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence, does not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.
The principal federal authority relied on by the Montana Supreme Court was our decision in Brown v. Ohio, supra.  The petitioner in that case had been convicted of joyriding.  After serving a term of imprisonment on that conviction, he was charged with auto theft.  We concluded that the charges 
Page 481 U. S. 404
 of joyriding and theft punished a single offense, and thus that retrial was impermissible.  But the Brown analysis is not apposite in this case. [Footnote 2]  In Brown, the defendant did not overturn the first conviction; indeed, he served the prison sentence assessed as punishment for that crime.  Thus, when the State sought to try him for auto theft, it actually was seeking a second conviction for the same offense.  By contrast, respondent in this case sought, and secured, invalidation of his first conviction.  This case falls squarely within the rule that retrial is permissible after a conviction is reversed on appeal.
The Montana court also suggested that the Double Jeopardy Clause would forbid retrial because respondent was convicted of an offense that did not exist when respondent had committed the acts in question.  But, under the Montana court's reading of the Montana sexual assault statute, respondent's conduct apparently was criminal at the time he engaged in it.  If that is so, the State simply relied on the wrong statute in its second information.  It is clear that the Constitution permits retrial after a conviction is reversed because of a defect in the charging instrument.  E.g., United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662,  163 U. S. 672 (1896).
We grant Montana's petition for a writ of certiorari [Footnote 3] and reverse the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court. [Footnote 4]  The 
Page 481 U. S. 405
 case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BRENNAN would deny the petition for certiorari.
[Footnote 1]
Nor was the jury's conviction of respondent on the charge of incest an implied acquittal of the offense of sexual assault; there would have been an implied acquittal only if the jury had been presented with charges of both sexual assault and incest and had chosen to convict respondent of incest.  See Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957).
[Footnote 2]
We explicitly noted in Brown that the case did not raise ""the double jeopardy questions that may arise . . . after a conviction is reversed on appeal.""  432 U.S. at  432 U. S. 165, n. 6.
[Footnote 3]
As JUSTICE STEVENS implicitly acknowledges, we have jurisdiction over this petition under 28 U.S.C.  1267(3).  The Montana court's decision ""fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law,"" and ""the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion.""  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1040-1041 (1983).
[Footnote 4]
We express no opinion on the correctness, as a matter of federal constitutional law, of the Montana Supreme Court's conclusion that sexual assault and incest are the ""same"" offenses."|

Syllabus 
Arkansas imposes a tax on receipts from sales of tangible personal property, but exempts numerous items, including newspapers and ""religious, professional, trade, and sports journals and/or publications printed and published within this State"" (magazine exemption).  Appellant publishes in Arkansas a general interest magazine that includes articles on a variety of subjects, including religion and sports.  In 1984, relying on Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, appellant sought a refund of sales tax it had paid since 1982, asserting that the magazine exemption must be construed to include its magazine, and that subjecting its magazine to the sales tax, while sales of newspapers and other magazines were exempt, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  After appellee denied the refund claim, appellant sought review in State Chancery Court, stating an additional claim under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and 1988 for injunctive relief and attorney's fees.  That court granted appellant summary judgment, construing the magazine exemption to include appellant because its magazine was published and printed in Arkansas.  The Arkansas Supreme Court reversed, holding that the magazine exemption applies only to religious, professional, trade, or sports periodicals.  The court rejected the claim that the exemption granted to other publications discriminated against appellant, ruling that success on this claim would avail appellant nothing, since it would still be subject to tax even if the exemption fell.  The court also refused to find that appellant's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated, ruling that the sales tax was a permissible ""ordinary form of taxation"" to which publishers are not immune.  Accordingly, the court did not consider appellant's attorney's fees claim.
Held:
1. Appellant has standing to challenge the Arkansas sales tax scheme.  Appellee's argument that appellant has not asserted an injury that this Court can redress, since appellant concededly publishes neither a newspaper nor a religious, professional, trade, or sports journal, is unpersuasive, since it would effectively insulate underinclusive statutes from constitutional challenge.  Appellant has alleged a sufficient personal stake in this litigation's outcome, in that the State Supreme Court's holding stands as a total bar to appellant's relief, and its constitutional attack 
Page 481 U. S. 222
 holds the only promise of escape from the burden imposed upon it by the challenged statute.  P.  481 U. S. 227.
2. The Arkansas sales tax scheme that taxes general interest magazines, but exempts newspapers and religious, professional, trade, and sports journals, violates the First Amendment's freedom of the press guarantee.  Pp.  481 U. S. 227-234.
(a) Even though there is no evidence of an improper censorial motive, the Arkansas tax burdens rights protected by the First Amendment by discriminating against a small group of magazines, including appellant's, which are the only magazines that pay the tax.  Such selective taxation is one of the types of discrimination identified in Minneapolis Star.  Indeed, its use here is even more disturbing than in that case, because the Arkansas statute requires official scrutiny of publications' content as the basis for imposing a tax.  This is incompatible with the First Amendment, whose requirements are not avoided merely because the statute does not burden the expression of particular views expressed by specific magazines, and exempts other members of the media that might publish discussions of the various subjects contained in appellant's magazine.  Pp.  481 U. S. 227-231.
(b) Appellee has not satisfied its heavy burden of showing that its discriminatory tax scheme is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.  The State's general interest in raising revenue does not justify selective imposition of the sales tax on some magazines and not others, based solely on their content, since revenues could be raised simply by taxing businesses generally.  Furthermore, appellee's assertion that the magazine exemption serves the state interest of encouraging ""fledgling"" publishers is not persuasive, since the exemption is not narrowly tailored to achieve that end.  To the contrary, the exemption is both overinclusive and underinclusive in that it exempts the enumerated types of magazines regardless of whether they are ""fledgling"" or are lucrative and well established, while making general interest magazines and struggling specialty magazines on other subjects ineligible for favorable tax treatment.  Moreover, although the asserted state need to ""foster communication"" might support a blanket exemption of the press from the sales tax, it cannot justify selective taxation of certain publishers.  Pp.  481 U. S. 231-232.
3. Since the state courts have not yet indicated whether they will exercise jurisdiction over appellant's claims under  1983 and 1988, this Court remands to give them an opportunity to do so.  Pp.  481 U. S. 233-234.

Syllabus 
Under the ""all events"" test, as embodied in Treasury Regulations, an accrual-basis taxpayer is entitled to deduct a business expense for the taxable year in which all events have occurred which determine the fact of the taxpayer's liability, and in which the amount of that liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.  In the year at issue, a consolidated federal income tax return was filed by General Dynamics Corporation and several of its wholly owned subsidiaries (hereafter respondent).  Respondent is an accrual-basis taxpayer whose fiscal year is the calendar year.  Beginning in 1972, it became a self-insurer with regard to its employee medical care plan.  To receive medical payment reimbursements, employees must submit claims forms to employee benefits personnel, who verify eligibility and forward worthy claims to the plan's administrators, whose claims processors review the claims and approve covered expenses for payment.  To account for the delay between the provision of medical services and the payment of claims, respondent established reserve accounts reflecting its liability for medical care received, but still not paid for, as of December 31, 1972.  On its amended 1972 tax return, respondent sought a refund based on its claimed deduction of its reserve as an accrued expense.  The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction, but the Claims Court sustained it, holding that ""all events"" which determined the fact of respondent's liability had taken place when its employees received covered services, and that the amount of liability could be determined with reasonable accuracy.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Where the filing of claims is a condition precedent to liability, an accrual-basis taxpayer providing medical benefits to its employees cannot deduct at the close of the taxable year an estimate of its obligation to pay for medical care obtained by employees or their qualified dependents during the final quarter of the year, claims for which have not been reported to the employer.  Pp.  481 U. S. 242-247.
(a) The proposed deduction fails the ""all events"" test, because it depends on a mere estimate of respondent's liability based on events that had not occurred before the close of the 1972 taxable year.  The last event necessary to fix respondent's liability was not the receipt of medical 
Page 481 U. S. 240
 care by covered individuals, but the filing of properly documented claims forms.  Such filing is not a mere technicality, nor is the possibility that some employees might not file claims after receiving services ""extremely remote and speculative.""  Pp.  481 U. S. 242-245.
(b) Respondent has not demonstrated that its liability as to any medical care claims was firmly established as of the close of the 1972 taxable year.  Although the parties stipulated that respondent had not received claims for all services rendered during the year by the year's end, and that some claims received had not been processed at that time, respondent failed to show what portion of the claims had been filed by the end of the year, or even that it knew of specific claims that had been filed, but not yet processed.  The fact that respondent may have been able to make a reasonably accurate actuarial estimate of how many claims would be filed for the last quarter of 1972 cannot justify a deduction.  If the ""all events"" test permitted such a deduction, Congress would not have retained 26 U.S.C.  832(b)(5), which allows insurance companies to deduct additions to reserves for ""incurred but not reported"" claims.

Syllabus 
Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 forbids the discharge of employees in the commercial motor transportation industry in retaliation for refusing to operate motor vehicles that do not comply with applicable safety standards or for filing complaints alleging such noncompliance.  The statute provides for the Secretary of Labor's initial investigation of an employee's discharge and, upon a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the employee was discharged in violation of the Act, requires the Secretary to order the employee's temporary reinstatement by the employer, who may then request an evidentiary hearing and a final decision from the Secretary.  This request does not operate to stay the preliminary reinstatement order.  The statute requires that the employer be notified of the employee's complaint, but does not specify procedures for employer participation in the Secretary's initial investigation.  After appellee, a trucking company subject to  405's requirements, discharged one of its drivers for allegedly intentionally damaging his assigned truck, the employee unsuccessfully sought relief under a governing collective bargaining agreement, contending that he was discharged in retaliation for having previously complained of safety violations.  He then filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that his discharge violated  405.  Appellee was notified of the complaint, and a field investigator, pursuant to pertinent Department rules, interviewed the discharged employee and other employees, obtaining statements substantiating the retaliatory discharge claim.  Appellee was afforded an opportunity to meet with the investigator and submit a written statement detailing the basis for the employee's discharge, but it was not provided with the substance of the evidence collected by the investigator.  Ultimately, a preliminary administrative order was issued ordering the employee's reinstatement with backpay.  Appellee then filed this action in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that  405, to the extent it empowered the Secretary to order temporary reinstatement without first conducting an evidentiary hearing, deprived appellee of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.  The court granted an injunction and, later, summary judgment for appellee. 
Page 481 U. S. 253

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
624 F.Supp.197, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that:
1. The Secretary's issuance, after entry of the District Court's judgment, of a final reinstatement order following an evidentiary hearing requested by appellee pursuant to  405 does not render this appeal moot.  Although appellee's obligation to reinstate the employee with backpay now flows from the Secretary's final order, not the preliminary order to which the District Court's injunction and order of summary judgment were directed, the controversy between appellee and the Secretary as to the constitutional adequacy of the Secretary's procedures prior to the issuance of the preliminary reinstatement order falls within the ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" exception to the actual case-and-controversy requirement.  Pp.  481 U. S. 257-258.
2. The District Court properly held that the Secretary's  405 procedures unconstitutionally deprived appellee of Fifth Amendment procedural due process by failing to provide appellee with the substance of the evidence supporting the employee's complaint before ordering the employee's temporary reinstatement.  However, the lack of an evidentiary hearing before temporary reinstatement did not deny procedural due process.  Pp.  481 U. S. 258-268.
(a) Determining the adequacy of the preliminary reinstatement procedures requires consideration of the Government's interests in promoting highway safety and protecting employees from retaliatory discharge; the employer's interest in controlling the makeup of its workforce and, in this case, appellee's property interest -- concededly entitled to due process protections -- in its contractual right to discharge employees for cause; the employee's interest in not being discharged for having complained about unsafe conditions; the risk of erroneous deprivations through the challenged procedures; and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.  Pp.  481 U. S. 262-263.
(b) In view of the legislative balancing of interests here, due process requires pre-reinstatement notice of the employee's allegations, notice of the substance of the relevant supporting evidence, an opportunity to submit a written response, and an opportunity to meet with the investigator and present statements from rebuttal witnesses.  These procedures provide a reliable initial check against mistaken decisions, cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532; Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U. S. 134, and minimum due process in this context does not require employer confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses before preliminary reinstatement, where a prompt post-reinstatement evidentiary hearing is available.  Appellee's contention that requiring 
Page 481 U. S. 254
 an evidentiary hearing as part of the process leading to preliminary reinstatement would not impose a significant additional burden on the Secretary, since  405 provides that a subsequent evidentiary hearing, if requested by the employer, must be ""expeditiously conducted"" in any event, is not persuasive.  Pp.  481 U. S. 263-267.
JUSTICE BRENNAN agreed that the Secretary's procedures unconstitutionally deprived appellee of procedural due process by failing to inform it of the substance of the evidence supporting the employee's complaint, but concluded that where, as here, there are factual disputes pertaining to the validity of a deprivation of a property interest, and there is no assurance that adequate final process will be prompt, the pre-reinstatement procedures are unconstitutional unless they give the employer an opportunity to test the strength of the evidence by confronting and cross-examining adverse witnesses and by presenting witnesses on its own behalf.  Pp.  481 U. S. 269-271.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that the District Court erred in holding that a full trial-type hearing was necessary prior to termination, so long as the employer was afforded an adequate post-termination hearing at a meaningful time, and also expressed the view that withholding the witnesses' names and statements prior to ordering the temporary reinstatement, in light of  405's purpose, did not violate appellee's due process rights.  Pp.  481 U. S. 271-272.
JUSTICE STEVENS agreed with the Court's judgment insofar as it affirmed the District Court, but concluded that the District Court's judgment should be affirmed in toto, expressing the view that, in this case, the Government's interest in highway safety did not justify the entry of a reinstatement order on the basis of evidence that was not disclosed to the employer and tested by cross-examination in an adversary proceeding before the order became effective.

Syllabus 
Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 forbids the discharge of employees in the commercial motor transportation industry in retaliation for refusing to operate motor vehicles that do not comply with applicable safety standards or for filing complaints alleging such noncompliance.  The statute provides for the Secretary of Labor's initial investigation of an employee's discharge and, upon a finding of reasonable cause to believe that the employee was discharged in violation of the Act, requires the Secretary to order the employee's temporary reinstatement by the employer, who may then request an evidentiary hearing and a final decision from the Secretary.  This request does not operate to stay the preliminary reinstatement order.  The statute requires that the employer be notified of the employee's complaint, but does not specify procedures for employer participation in the Secretary's initial investigation.  After appellee, a trucking company subject to  405's requirements, discharged one of its drivers for allegedly intentionally damaging his assigned truck, the employee unsuccessfully sought relief under a governing collective bargaining agreement, contending that he was discharged in retaliation for having previously complained of safety violations.  He then filed a complaint with the Department of Labor alleging that his discharge violated  405.  Appellee was notified of the complaint, and a field investigator, pursuant to pertinent Department rules, interviewed the discharged employee and other employees, obtaining statements substantiating the retaliatory discharge claim.  Appellee was afforded an opportunity to meet with the investigator and submit a written statement detailing the basis for the employee's discharge, but it was not provided with the substance of the evidence collected by the investigator.  Ultimately, a preliminary administrative order was issued ordering the employee's reinstatement with backpay.  Appellee then filed this action in Federal District Court, seeking injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that  405, to the extent it empowered the Secretary to order temporary reinstatement without first conducting an evidentiary hearing, deprived appellee of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment.  The court granted an injunction and, later, summary judgment for appellee. 
Page 481 U. S. 253

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
624 F.Supp.197, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that:
1. The Secretary's issuance, after entry of the District Court's judgment, of a final reinstatement order following an evidentiary hearing requested by appellee pursuant to  405 does not render this appeal moot.  Although appellee's obligation to reinstate the employee with backpay now flows from the Secretary's final order, not the preliminary order to which the District Court's injunction and order of summary judgment were directed, the controversy between appellee and the Secretary as to the constitutional adequacy of the Secretary's procedures prior to the issuance of the preliminary reinstatement order falls within the ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" exception to the actual case-and-controversy requirement.  Pp.  481 U. S. 257-258.
2. The District Court properly held that the Secretary's  405 procedures unconstitutionally deprived appellee of Fifth Amendment procedural due process by failing to provide appellee with the substance of the evidence supporting the employee's complaint before ordering the employee's temporary reinstatement.  However, the lack of an evidentiary hearing before temporary reinstatement did not deny procedural due process.  Pp.  481 U. S. 258-268.
(a) Determining the adequacy of the preliminary reinstatement procedures requires consideration of the Government's interests in promoting highway safety and protecting employees from retaliatory discharge; the employer's interest in controlling the makeup of its workforce and, in this case, appellee's property interest -- concededly entitled to due process protections -- in its contractual right to discharge employees for cause; the employee's interest in not being discharged for having complained about unsafe conditions; the risk of erroneous deprivations through the challenged procedures; and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.  Pp.  481 U. S. 262-263.
(b) In view of the legislative balancing of interests here, due process requires pre-reinstatement notice of the employee's allegations, notice of the substance of the relevant supporting evidence, an opportunity to submit a written response, and an opportunity to meet with the investigator and present statements from rebuttal witnesses.  These procedures provide a reliable initial check against mistaken decisions, cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532; Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U. S. 134, and minimum due process in this context does not require employer confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses before preliminary reinstatement, where a prompt post-reinstatement evidentiary hearing is available.  Appellee's contention that requiring 
Page 481 U. S. 254
 an evidentiary hearing as part of the process leading to preliminary reinstatement would not impose a significant additional burden on the Secretary, since  405 provides that a subsequent evidentiary hearing, if requested by the employer, must be ""expeditiously conducted"" in any event, is not persuasive.  Pp.  481 U. S. 263-267.
JUSTICE BRENNAN agreed that the Secretary's procedures unconstitutionally deprived appellee of procedural due process by failing to inform it of the substance of the evidence supporting the employee's complaint, but concluded that where, as here, there are factual disputes pertaining to the validity of a deprivation of a property interest, and there is no assurance that adequate final process will be prompt, the pre-reinstatement procedures are unconstitutional unless they give the employer an opportunity to test the strength of the evidence by confronting and cross-examining adverse witnesses and by presenting witnesses on its own behalf.

Syllabus 
In 1978, petitioner, a black man, was convicted in a Georgia trial court of armed robbery and murder, arising from the killing of a white police officer during the robbery of a store.  Pursuant to Georgia statutes, the jury at the penalty hearing considered the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of petitioner's conduct, and recommended the death penalty on the murder charge.  The trial court followed the recommendation, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed.  After unsuccessfully seeking postconviction relief in state courts, petitioner sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court.  His petition included a claim that the Georgia capital sentencing process was administered in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In support of the claim, petitioner proffered a statistical study (the Baldus study) that purports to show a disparity in the imposition of the death sentence in Georgia based on the murder victim's race and, to a lesser extent, the defendant's race.  The study is based on over 2,000 murder cases that occurred in Georgia during the 1970's, and involves data relating to the victim's race, the defendant's race, and the various combinations of such persons' races.  The study indicates that black defendants who killed white victims have the greatest likelihood of receiving the death penalty.  Rejecting petitioner's constitutional claims, the court denied his petition insofar as it was based on the Baldus study, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision on this issue.  It assumed the validity of the Baldus study, but found the statistics insufficient to demonstrate unconstitutional discrimination in the Fourteenth Amendment context or to show irrationality, arbitrariness, and capriciousness under Eighth Amendment analysis.
Held:
1. The Baldus study does not establish that the administration of the Georgia capital punishment system violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  481 U. S. 291-299.
(a) To prevail under that Clause, petitioner must prove that the decisionmakers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose.  Petitioner offered no evidence specific to his own case that would support an 
Page 481 U. S. 280
 inference that racial considerations played a part in his sentence, and the Baldus study is insufficient to support an inference that any of the decisionmakers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose.  This Court has accepted statistics as proof of intent to discriminate in the context of a State's selection of the jury venire, and in the context of statutory violations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  However, the nature of the capital sentencing decision and the relationship of the statistics to that decision are fundamentally different from the corresponding elements in the venire selection or Title VII cases.  Petitioner's statistical proffer must be viewed in the context of his challenge to decisions at the heart of the State's criminal justice system.  Because discretion is essential to the criminal justice process, exceptionally clear proof is required before this Court will infer that the discretion has been abused.  Pp.  481 U. S. 292-297.
(b) There is no merit to petitioner's argument that the Baldus study proves that the State has violated the Equal Protection Clause by adopting the capital punishment statute and allowing it to remain in force despite its allegedly discriminatory application.  For this claim to prevail, petitioner would have to prove that the Georgia Legislature enacted or maintained the death penalty statute because of an anticipated racially discriminatory effect.  There is no evidence that the legislature either enacted the statute to further a racially discriminatory purpose or maintained the statute because of the racially disproportionate impact suggested by the Baldus study.  Pp.  481 U. S. 297-299.
2. Petitioner's argument that the Baldus study demonstrates that the Georgia capital sentencing system violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment must be analyzed in the light of this Court's prior decisions under that Amendment.  Decisions since Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, have identified a constitutionally permissible range of discretion in imposing the death penalty.  First, there is a required threshold below which the death penalty cannot be imposed, and the State must establish rational criteria that narrow the decisionmaker's judgment as to whether the circumstances of a particular defendant's case meet the threshold.  Second, States cannot limit the sentencer's consideration of any relevant circumstance that could cause it to decline to impose the death penalty.  In this respect, the State cannot channel the sentencer's discretion, but must allow it to consider any relevant information offered by the defendant.  Pp.  481 U. S. 299-306.
3. The Baldus study does not demonstrate that the Georgia capital sentencing system violates the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.  481 U. S. 306-313.
(a) Petitioner cannot successfully argue that the sentence in his case is disproportionate to the sentences in other murder cases.  On the one 
Page 481 U. S. 281
 hand, he cannot base a constitutional claim on an argument that his case differs from other cases in which defendants did receive the death penalty.  The Georgia Supreme Court found that his death sentence was not disproportionate to other death sentences imposed in the State.  On the other hand, absent a showing that the Georgia capital punishment system operates in an arbitrary and capricious manner, petitioner cannot prove a constitutional violation by demonstrating that other defendants who may be similarly situated did not receive the death penalty.  The opportunities for discretionary leniency under state law do not render the capital sentences imposed arbitrary and capricious.  Because petitioner's sentence was imposed under Georgia sentencing procedures that focus discretion ""on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant,"" it may be presumed that his death sentence was not ""wantonly and freakishly"" imposed, and thus that the sentence is not disproportionate within any recognized meaning under the Eighth Amendment.  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,  428 U. S. 206,  428 U. S. 207.  Pp.  481 U. S. 306-308.
(b) There is no merit to the contention that the Baldus study shows that Georgia's capital punishment system is arbitrary and capricious in application.  The statistics do not prove that race enters into any capital sentencing decisions or that race was a factor in petitioner's case.  The likelihood of racial prejudice allegedly shown by the study does not constitute the constitutional measure of an unacceptable risk of racial prejudice.  The inherent lack of predictability of jury decisions does not justify their condemnation.  On the contrary, it is the jury's function to make the difficult and uniquely human judgments that defy codification and that build discretion, equity, and flexibility into the legal system.  Pp.  481 U. S. 308-312.
(c) At most, the Baldus study indicates a discrepancy that appears to correlate with race, but this discrepancy does not constitute a major systemic defect.  Any mode for determining guilt or punishment has its weaknesses and the potential for misuse.  Despite such imperfections, constitutional guarantees are met when the mode for determining guilt or punishment has been surrounded with safeguards to make it as fair as possible.  Pp.  481 U. S. 312-313.
4. Petitioner's claim, taken to its logical conclusion, throws into serious question the principles that underlie the entire criminal justice system.  His claim easily could be extended to apply to other types of penalties and to claims based on unexplained discrepancies correlating to membership in other minority groups and even to gender.  The Constitution does not require that a State eliminate any demonstrable disparity that correlates with a potentially irrelevant factor in order to 
Page 481 U. S. 282
 operate a criminal justice system that includes capital punishment.  Petitioner's arguments are best presented to the legislative bodies, not the courts.  Pp.  481 U. S. 314-319.

Syllabus 
The federal statute governing the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program requires participating States to consider a family's ""income and resources"" in determining whether it is needy, and prohibits the payment of benefits in any month in which either income or resources exceed state-prescribed limits.  Because income and resources are separately computed and generally subject to different state limits, whether and for how long a family that acquires a sum of money is rendered ineligible for AFDC benefits may depend on whether the sum is classified as income or as a resource.  Prior to 1981, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) required that States treat any income acquired in a given month as a resource in following months.  However, because of HHS' concern that recipients that acquired a large amount of income had an incentive to spend it as quickly as possible in order to reduce their resources to a level beneath the state limit, Congress amended the AFDC statute to provide that recipients who receive income exceeding the State's standard of need are ineligible for benefits for as many months as that income would last if the recipients spent an amount equal to the State's standard each month.  In response to this amendment, the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) revised its AFDC regulations to treat various lump-sum payments, including personal injury awards, as income rather than resources, although the regulations continued to treat property damage awards as resources.  Respondents, personal injury award recipients who were thereby rendered ineligible for AFDC benefits under Virginia's revised regulations, filed a class action in Federal District Court against the Secretary of HHS and petitioner Commissioner of VDSS.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the class, holding that the common meaning of ""income"" precluded application of the term to personal injury awards, and that it was irrational to treat personal injury awards as income while treating property damage awards as resources.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
774 F.2d 1270, reversed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that respondents have not demonstrated 
Page 481 U. S. 369
 that Virginia's policy of treating personal injury awards as income is inconsistent with the AFDC statute or HHS' regulations.  Pp.  481 U. S. 374-383.
(a) Virginia's revised regulations are consistent with the meaning of ""income"" as used in the AFDC statute.  Respondents' premise that the common usage of ""income"" as involving gain excludes personal injury awards because of their purely compensatory nature is false, since such awards often compensate for the loss of gain in the form of lost wages, and, to that extent at least, must be considered income.  More importantly, the AFDC statute itself contradicts respondents' contention, as is demonstrated by Heckler v. Turner, 470 U. S. 184, in which it was held that, under a provision not involved here, the part of an employee's salary that is allocated to work-related expenses -- clearly not a ""gain"" in the sense that respondents use that term -- is properly treated as ""income"" under the statute.  Pp.  481 U. S. 374-376.
(b) The fact that personal injury awards are expressly excluded from income under the Internal Revenue Code, the Food Stamp Program, and the HHS poverty guidelines does not mean that such awards are automatically excluded from ""income"" but, in fact, supports the opposite proposition that they are included when, as in the AFDC statute, Congress is silent on the subject.  Moreover, no presumption of a common definition of ""income"" can be inferred from the fact that the AFDC statute, the Food Stamp Program, and the HHS poverty guidelines all attempt to define who is needy, since the explicit differences in the three programs' treatment of ""income"" are too great.  Pp.  481 U. S. 376-377.
(c) Virginia's treatment of personal injury awards is consistent with the administrative and legislative history of the AFDC statute.  Contrary to respondents' contention, the evidence indicates that HHS has for many years interpreted the statute at least to permit the inclusion of such awards in ""income,"" which interpretation is entitled to deference.  Pp.  481 U. S. 377-380.
(d) There is no merit to the contention that personal injury awards must be treated as resources because healthy bodies are resources and personal injury awards merely compensate for healthy bodies.  The AFDC statute and regulations count only real and personal property as ""resources.""  Pp.  481 U. S. 380-381.
(e) Treating property damage awards as resources does not violate an HHS regulation requiring that eligibility conditions not result in arbitrary exclusions or inequitable treatment, since property damage awards can be distinguished from personal injury awards on the ground that they merely restore resources to previous levels.  Moreover, HHS' conclusion that Virginia's regulations are consistent with HHS' regulations is entitled to substantial deference.  Pp.  481 U. S. 381-383.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the Virginia regulations should not be upheld on an endorsement of the Virginia interpretation but, 
Page 481 U. S. 370

			"|"Lukhard v. Reed
No. 85-1358
Argued January 14, 1987
Decided April 22, 1987
481 U.S. 368

Syllabus 
The federal statute governing the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program requires participating States to consider a family's ""income and resources"" in determining whether it is needy, and prohibits the payment of benefits in any month in which either income or resources exceed state-prescribed limits.  Because income and resources are separately computed and generally subject to different state limits, whether and for how long a family that acquires a sum of money is rendered ineligible for AFDC benefits may depend on whether the sum is classified as income or as a resource.  Prior to 1981, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) required that States treat any income acquired in a given month as a resource in following months.  However, because of HHS' concern that recipients that acquired a large amount of income had an incentive to spend it as quickly as possible in order to reduce their resources to a level beneath the state limit, Congress amended the AFDC statute to provide that recipients who receive income exceeding the State's standard of need are ineligible for benefits for as many months as that income would last if the recipients spent an amount equal to the State's standard each month.  In response to this amendment, the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) revised its AFDC regulations to treat various lump-sum payments, including personal injury awards, as income rather than resources, although the regulations continued to treat property damage awards as resources.  Respondents, personal injury award recipients who were thereby rendered ineligible for AFDC benefits under Virginia's revised regulations, filed a class action in Federal District Court against the Secretary of HHS and petitioner Commissioner of VDSS.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the class, holding that the common meaning of ""income"" precluded application of the term to personal injury awards, and that it was irrational to treat personal injury awards as income while treating property damage awards as resources.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
774 F.2d 1270, reversed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that respondents have not demonstrated 
Page 481 U. S. 369
 that Virginia's policy of treating personal injury awards as income is inconsistent with the AFDC statute or HHS' regulations.  Pp.  481 U. S. 374-383.
(a) Virginia's revised regulations are consistent with the meaning of ""income"" as used in the AFDC statute.  Respondents' premise that the common usage of ""income"" as involving gain excludes personal injury awards because of their purely compensatory nature is false, since such awards often compensate for the loss of gain in the form of lost wages, and, to that extent at least, must be considered income.  More importantly, the AFDC statute itself contradicts respondents' contention, as is demonstrated by Heckler v. Turner, 470 U. S. 184, in which it was held that, under a provision not involved here, the part of an employee's salary that is allocated to work-related expenses -- clearly not a ""gain"" in the sense that respondents use that term -- is properly treated as ""income"" under the statute.  Pp.  481 U. S. 374-376.
(b) The fact that personal injury awards are expressly excluded from income under the Internal Revenue Code, the Food Stamp Program, and the HHS poverty guidelines does not mean that such awards are automatically excluded from ""income"" but, in fact, supports the opposite proposition that they are included when, as in the AFDC statute, Congress is silent on the subject.  Moreover, no presumption of a common definition of ""income"" can be inferred from the fact that the AFDC statute, the Food Stamp Program, and the HHS poverty guidelines all attempt to define who is needy, since the explicit differences in the three programs' treatment of ""income"" are too great.  Pp.  481 U. S. 376-377.
(c) Virginia's treatment of personal injury awards is consistent with the administrative and legislative history of the AFDC statute.  Contrary to respondents' contention, the evidence indicates that HHS has for many years interpreted the statute at least to permit the inclusion of such awards in ""income,"" which interpretation is entitled to deference.  Pp.  481 U. S. 377-380.
(d) There is no merit to the contention that personal injury awards must be treated as resources because healthy bodies are resources and personal injury awards merely compensate for healthy bodies.  The AFDC statute and regulations count only real and personal property as ""resources.""  Pp.  481 U. S. 380-381.
(e) Treating property damage awards as resources does not violate an HHS regulation requiring that eligibility conditions not result in arbitrary exclusions or inequitable treatment, since property damage awards can be distinguished from personal injury awards on the ground that they merely restore resources to previous levels.  Moreover, HHS' conclusion that Virginia's regulations are consistent with HHS' regulations is entitled to substantial deference.  Pp.  481 U. S. 381-383.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the Virginia regulations should not be upheld on an endorsement of the Virginia interpretation but,

 flatly, on the deference owed the Secretary of HHS in his interpretation of the complex governing statutes.  Pp.  481 U. S. 383-384.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in a separate postconviction proceeding.  In that proceeding, the trial judge instructed the advisory jury not to consider, and himself refused to consider, evidence of mitigating circumstances not specifically enumerated in the Florida death penalty statute.  Following unsuccessful appeals and state and federal collateral proceedings, petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, claiming that the advisory jury and the sentencing judge had been precluded by law from considering evidence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.  The District Court denied the application, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner was sentenced to death in proceedings that did not comport with the requirement that the sentencer may neither refuse to consider nor be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence.  Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104; Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586.  Under the circumstances of this case, petitioner's death sentence cannot stand.

No. 86-71
Argued March 2, 1987
Decided April 21, 1987*
481 U.S. 69

Syllabus 
The federal Williams Act and implementing regulations govern hostile corporate stock tender offers by requiring, inter alia, that offers remain open for at least 20 business days.  An Indiana Act applies to certain business corporations chartered in Indiana that have specified levels of shares or shareholders within the State and that opt into the Act's protection.  The Indiana Act provides that the acquisition of ""control shares"" in such a corporation -- shares that, but for the Act, would bring the acquiring entity's voting power to or above certain threshold levels -- does not include voting rights unless a majority of all preexisting disinterested shareholders so agree at their next regularly scheduled meeting.  However, the stock acquiror can require a special meeting within 50 days by following specified procedures.  Appellee Dynamics Corporation announced a tender offer that would have raised its ownership interest in CTS Corporation above the Indiana Act's threshold.  Dynamics also filed suit in Federal District Court alleging federal securities violations by CTS.  After CTS opted into the Indiana Act, Dynamics amended its complaint to challenge the Act's validity.  The District Court granted Dynamics' motion for declaratory relief, ruling that the Act is preempted by the Williams Act, and violates the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, adopting the holding of the plurality opinion in Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, that the Williams Act preempts state statutes that upset the balance between target company management and a tender offeror.  The court based its preemption finding on the view that the Indiana Act, in effect, imposes at least a 50-day delay on the consummation of tender offers, and that this conflicts with the minimum 20-day, hold-open period under the Williams Act.  The court also held that the state Act violates the Commerce Clause, since it deprives nonresidents of the valued opportunity to accept tender offers from other nonresidents, and that it violates the conflict-of-laws ""internal affairs"" doctrine in that it has a direct, intended, and 
Page 481 U. S. 70
 substantial effect on the interstate market in securities and corporate control.
Held:
1. The Indiana Act is consistent with the provisions and purposes of the Williams Act, and is not preempted thereby.  Pp.  481 U. S. 78-87.
(a) The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from the coercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as a group, and thereby furthers the Williams Act's basic purpose of placing investors on an equal footing with takeover bidders.  Moreover, the Indiana Act avoids the problems the plurality discussed in MITE, since it does not give either management or the offeror an advantage in communicating with shareholders, nor impose an indefinite delay on offers, nor allow the state government to interpose its views of fairness between willing buyers and sellers.  Thus, the Act satisfies even the MITE plurality's broad interpretation of the Williams Act.  Pp.  481 U. S. 81-84.
(b) The possibility that the Indiana Act will delay some tender offers does not mandate preemption.  The state Act neither imposes an absolute 50-day delay on the consummation of tender offers nor precludes offerors from purchasing shares as soon as federal law permits.  If an adverse shareholder vote is feared, the tender offer can be conditioned on the shares' receiving voting rights within a specified period.  Furthermore, even assuming that the Indiana Act does impose some additional delay, the MITE plurality found only that ""unreasonable"" delays conflict with the Williams Act.  Here, it cannot be said that a 50-day delay is unreasonable, since that period falls within a 60-day period Congress established for tendering shareholders to withdraw their unpurchased shares.  If the Williams Act were construed to preempt any state statute that caused delays, it would preempt a variety of state corporate laws of hitherto unquestioned validity.  The longstanding prevalence of state regulation in this area suggests that, if Congress had intended to preempt all such state laws, it would have said so.  Pp.  481 U. S. 84-87.
2. The Indiana Act does not violate the Commerce Clause.  The Act's limited effect on interstate commerce is justified by the State's interests in defining attributes of its corporations' shares, and in protecting shareholders.  Pp.  481 U. S. 87-94.
(a) The Act does not discriminate against interstate commerce, since it has the same effect on tender offers whether or not the offeror is an Indiana domiciliary or resident.  That the Act might apply most often to out-of-state entities who launch most hostile tender offers is irrelevant, since a claim of discrimination is not established by the mere fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies.  Pp.  481 U. S. 87-88. 
Page 481 U. S. 71

(b) The Act does not create an impermissible risk of inconsistent regulation of tender offers by different States.  It simply and evenhandedly exercises the State's firmly established authority to define the voting rights of shareholders in Indiana corporations, and thus subjects such corporations to the law of only one State.  Pp.  481 U. S. 88-89.
(c) The Court of Appeals' holding that the Act unconstitutionally hinders tender offers ignores the fact that a State, in its role as overseer of corporate governance, enacts laws that necessarily affect certain aspects of interstate commerce, particularly with respect to corporations with shareholders in other States.  A State has interests in promoting stable relationships among parties involved in its corporations, and in ensuring that investors have an effective voice in corporate affairs.  The Indiana Act validly furthers these interests by allowing shareholders collectively to determine whether the takeover is advantageous to them.  The argument that Indiana has no legitimate interest in protecting nonresident shareholders is unavailing, since the Act applies only to corporations incorporated in Indiana that have a substantial number of shareholders in the State.  Pp.  481 U. S. 89-93.
(d) Even if the Act should decrease the number of successful tender offers for Indiana corporations, this would not offend the Commerce Clause.  The Act does not prohibit any resident or nonresident from offering to purchase, or from purchasing, shares in Indiana corporations, or from attempting thereby to gain control.  It only provides regulatory procedures designed for the better protection of the corporations' shareholders.  The Commerce Clause does not protect the particular structure or methods of operation in a market.  Pp.  481 U. S. 93-94.

Syllabus 
Under United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, attorneys for the Civil Division (CD) of the Department of Justice (DOJ) may not automatically obtain disclosure of grand jury materials for use in a civil suit, but must instead seek a district court disclosure order under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which order is available upon a showing of ""particularized need.""  After an extensive investigation, a grand jury that had been convened by attorneys from the DOJ's Antitrust Division (AD) was discharged upon their conclusion that, although respondents had engaged in price fixing violative of the Sherman Act, criminal prosecution was unwarranted under the circumstances.  Subsequently, in preparation for a possible civil action against respondents, the AD attorneys reviewed materials furnished to the grand jury and concluded that respondents had violated the False Claims Act, primary enforcement responsibility for which rests in the CD.  Because they wished to consult with CD lawyers and also with the appropriate local United States Attorney before bringing suit, the AD lawyers obtained a Rule 6(e) order allowing them to disclose grand jury material to six named Government attorneys.  The District Court denied respondents' motions to vacate the disclosure order and to enjoin the Government from using the grand jury information in the anticipated civil suit.  However, after allowing the Government to file a complaint under seal, the Court of Appeals reversed both aspects of the District Court's denial of relief to respondents, holding that, because the AD attorneys were now involved only in civil proceedings, they were forbidden from making continued use of grand jury information without first obtaining a court order, and that disclosure to the six attorneys for consultation purposes was not supported by an adequate showing of ""particularized need.""  Nonetheless, the court took no action with respect to the complaint, concluding that it disclosed nothing about the grand jury investigation.
Held:
1. An attorney who conducted a criminal prosecution may make continued use of grand jury materials in the civil phase of the dispute without obtaining a court order to do so under Rule 6(e).  The Rule forbids a Government attorney to ""disclose"" material, which word cannot be interpreted 
Page 481 U. S. 103
 to embrace a solitary reexamination of grand jury material in the privacy of an attorney's office.  Thus, by its plain language, the Rule merely prohibits those who already have legitimate access to grand jury material from revealing the material to others not authorized to receive it.  Respondents' contention that disclosure to unauthorized outsiders will result inevitably when a civil complaint is filed is refuted by the record, which indicates that the complaint the DOJ filed did not quote or refer to any grand jury transcripts, documents, or witnesses, refer to the existence of a grand jury, or indirectly disclose grand jury material.  Pp.  481 U. S. 107-111.
2. Pursuant to the considerations described in Sells, there was a ""particularized need"" for disclosure of the grand jury materials to the CD lawyers and the United States Attorney.  Disclosure was requested to enable the AD lawyers to obtain the full benefit of the experience and expertise of the other Government lawyers, and thus serves the public purpose of efficient, effective, and evenhanded enforcement of federal statutes.  Since the contemplated use of the material might result in a decision not to proceed with a civil action, the disclosure could have the effect of saving the Government, the potential defendants, and the witnesses costly and time-consuming discovery.  The disclosure's public benefits clearly outweigh its dangers, since it poses comparatively little risk to grand jury secrecy, to the integrity of the grand jury itself, or to the normal civil limitations on the Government's discovery and investigative powers.  The Court of Appeals exaggerated the significance of potential alternative information sources by means of discovery under the Antitrust Civil Process Act.  Wide discretion must be afforded district courts in evaluating the appropriateness of disclosure, and the District Court here did not abuse its discretion.  Pp.  481 U. S. 111-117.

Since the contemplated use of the material might result in a decision not to proceed with a civil action, the disclosure could have the effect of saving the Government, the potential defendants, and the witnesses costly and time-consuming discovery.  The disclosure's public benefits clearly outweigh its dangers, since it poses comparatively little risk to grand jury secrecy, to the integrity of the grand jury itself, or to the normal civil limitations on the Government's discovery and investigative powers.  The Court of Appeals exaggerated the significance of potential alternative information sources by means of discovery under the Antitrust Civil Process Act.  Wide discretion must be afforded district courts in evaluating the appropriateness of disclosure, and the District Court here did not abuse its discretion.  Pp.  481 U. S. 111-117.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a state prisoner, filed a habeas corpus action in Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2254.  The court dismissed the petition on the merits.  On petitioner's appeal to the Court of Appeals, respondent for the first time interposed the defense that petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies.  The court rejected petitioner's argument that the nonexhaustion defense had been waived by the failure to assert it in the District Court, and remanded the cause to the District Court with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.
Held:  Where the State fails to raise an arguably meritorious nonexhaustion defense in the district court, the court of appeals should exercise discretion in each case to determine whether the interests of comity and federalism, and the interests of justice, will be better served by addressing the merits forthwith or by requiring a series of additional state and district court proceedings before reviewing the petitioner's claim.  The failure to exhaust state remedies does not deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction to consider the merits of a habeas corpus application.  The appellate court is not required to dismiss for nonexhaustion notwithstanding the State's failure to raise the issue below; nor is the appellate court obligated to regard the State's omission as an absolute waiver of the claim.  The history of the exhaustion doctrine supports the middle course announced in this case.  The Court of Appeals' judgment in this case is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings, because the court simply held that the nonexhaustion doctrine could not be waived, and made no attempt to determine whether the interests of justice would be better served by addressing the merits of the habeas petition or by requiring additional state proceedings before doing so.  Pp.  481 U. S. 131-136.

Syllabus 
Petitioner brothers, along with other members of their family, planned and effected the escape of their father from prison, where he was serving a life sentence for having killed a guard during a previous escape.  Petitioners entered the prison with a chest filled with guns, armed their father and another convicted murderer, later helped to abduct, detain, and rob a family of four, and watched their father and the other convict murder the members of that family with shotguns.  Although they both later stated that they were surprised by the shooting, neither petitioner made any effort to help the victims, but drove away in the victims' car with the rest of the escape party.  After the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed petitioners' individual convictions for capital murder under that State's felony murder and accomplice liability statutes, petitioners collaterally attacked their death sentences in state postconviction proceedings, alleging that Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, which had been decided in the interim, required reversal.  However, the State Supreme Court determined that they should be executed, holding that Enmund requires a finding of ""intent to kill,"" and interpreting that phrase to include situations in which the defendant intended, contemplated, or anticipated that lethal force would or might be used, or that life would or might be taken in accomplishing the underlying felony.  Despite finding that petitioners did not specifically intend that the victims die, plan the homicides in advance, or actually fire the shots, the court ruled that the requisite intent was established by evidence that petitioners played an active part in planning and executing the breakout and in the events that lead to the murders, and that they did nothing to interfere with the killings nor to disassociate themselves from the killers afterward.  Although only one of the petitioners testified that he would have been willing to kill, the court found that both of them could have anticipated the use of lethal force.
Held:  Although petitioners neither intended to kill the victims nor inflicted the fatal wounds, the record might support a finding that they had the culpable mental state of reckless indifference to human life.  The Eighth Amendment does not prohibit the death penalty as disproportionate in 
Page 481 U. S. 138
 the case of a defendant whose participation in a felony that results in murder is major and whose mental state is one of reckless indifference.  A survey of state felony murder laws and judicial decisions after Enmund indicates a societal consensus that that combination of factors may justify the death penalty even without a specific ""intent to kill.""  Reckless disregard for human life also represents a highly culpable mental state that may support a capital sentencing judgment in combination with major participation in the felony resulting in death.

Syllabus 
Under Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, a defendant is deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment when his codefendant's incriminating confession is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the codefendant.  At petitioner's and his brother's joint trial for the felony murder of a gas station attendant, the court allowed the State, over petitioner's objection, to introduce the brother's videotaped confession that he had killed the attendant who had just shot petitioner.  The brother did not himself testify, and the court warned the jury that his confession was not to be used against petitioner.  The State also called a witness who testified about a conversation with petitioner which recited essentially the same facts as the brother's confession.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction, adopting the reasoning of the plurality opinion in Parker v. Randolph, 442 U. S. 62, that Bruton did not require the brother's confession to be excluded, because petitioner had himself confessed and his confession ""interlocked"" with his brother's.
Held:
1. Where a nontestifying codefendant's confession facially incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and even if the defendant's own confession is admitted against him.  The Parker plurality's view that Bruton is inapplicable to cases involving interlocking confessions is rejected in favor of JUSTICE BLACKMUN's view in Parker that, although introduction of the defendant's own interlocking confession cannot cure the Confrontation Clause violation caused by introduction of the nontestifying codefendant's confession, it might, in some cases, render that violation harmless.  The Parker plurality's view is predicated on the erroneous theory that, when the defendant has himself confessed, introduction of the codefendant's confession will seldom, if ever, be of the ""devastating"" character required by Bruton to prove a Confrontation Clause violation.  Although Bruton did consider ""devastating"" effect, it did so in the context of justification for excluding the entire category of codefendant confessions that implicate the defendant, and not as a factor whose existence must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  The assumption 
Page 481 U. S. 187
 that an interlocking confession precludes devastation is rendered untenable by the infinite variability of inculpatory statements and their likely effect on juries.  In fact, ""interlocking"" bears an inverse relationship to devastation, since a codefendant's confession that corroborates the defendant's alleged confession significantly harms the defendant's case, whereas one that is positively incompatible gives credence to the defendant's assertion that his own alleged confession was nonexistent or false.  The ""interlocking"" nature of a codefendant's confession pertains not to its harmfulness but to its reliability, which, although relevant to whether the confession should be admitted as evidence against the defendant, is irrelevant to the questions whether the jury is likely to obey the instruction to disregard it or whether the jury's failure to do so is likely to be inconsequential.  Pp.  481 U. S. 189-193.
2. Although a codefendant's interlocking confession incriminating the defendant may not be admitted at trial, the defendant's own confession may be considered in assessing whether his codefendant's statements are supported by sufficient ""indicia of reliability"" to be directly admissible against him (assuming the codefendant's ""unavailability"") despite the lack of opportunity for cross-examination, and may be considered on appeal in assessing whether any Confrontation Clause violation was harmless.

Syllabus 
Respondent and Benjamin Williams were charged with murder, robbery, and assault.  At their joint trial, Williams' confession was admitted over respondent's objection.  The confession had been redacted to omit all reference to respondent -- indeed, to omit all indication that anyone other than Williams and a third accomplice participated in the crime.  In his confession, Williams described a conversation he had with the third accomplice as they drove to the victims' home, during which the accomplice said that he would have to kill the victims after robbing them.  At the time the confession was admitted, the jury was admonished not to use it in any way against respondent.  Williams did not testify.  Respondent's testimony indicated that she had been in the car with Williams and the third accomplice, but had not heard their conversation.  Respondent insisted that she had not intended to rob or kill anyone.  Respondent was convicted of felony murder and assault to commit murder, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Federal District Court denied respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to a new trial under Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123.  Bruton held that a defendant is deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause when his nontestifying codefendant's confession naming him as a participant in the crime is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the codefendant.  The Court of Appeals held that Bruton requires the same result when the codefendant's confession is redacted to omit any reference to the defendant, but the defendant is nonetheless linked to the confession by evidence properly admitted against him at trial.
Held:  The Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant's name, but any reference to her existence.  The Bruton Court recognized a very narrow exception to the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions in the situation when the facially incriminating confession of a nontestifying codefendant is introduced at a joint trial and the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant.  In that situation, Bruton explained, the 
Page 481 U. S. 201
 risk that the jury will not follow its instructions is so great, and the consequences of that failure so vital to the defendant, that jurors will be assumed incapable of obeying their instructions.  There are two important distinctions between this case and Bruton which cause it to fall outside the narrow exception Bruton created.  First, in Bruton, the codefendant's confession expressly implicated the defendant as his accomplice, whereas here the confession was not incriminating on its face, but became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.  Where the necessity of such linkage is involved, there does not exist the overwhelming probability of jurors' inability to disregard incriminating inferences that is the foundation of Bruton.  Second, evidence requiring linkage differs from evidence incriminating on its face in the practical effects which application of the Bruton exception would produce.  If limited to facially incriminating confessions, Bruton can be complied with by redaction.  If extended to confessions incriminating by connection, not only is that not possible, but it is not even possible to predict the admissibility of a confession in advance of trial.  Compliance with the Court of Appeals' overbroad reading of Bruton could not be achieved without enormous costs to the criminal justice system.  Pp.  481 U. S. 206-211.

Syllabus 
Under Texas law, a judgment creditor can secure and execute a lien on a judgment debtor's property unless the debtor files a supersedeas bond in at least the amount of the judgment, interest, and costs.  Appellant obtained a jury verdict of $10.53 billion in its Texas state court suit alleging that appellee tortiously had induced a third oil company to breach a contract to sell its shares to appellant.  Because it was clear that appellee would not be able to post a bond in the necessary amount, the verdict had substantial adverse effects on appellee's business and financial situation.  Accordingly, even before the trial court entered judgment on the verdict, appellee filed suit in Federal District Court alleging that the Texas proceedings violated its rights under the Federal Constitution and various federal statutes.  Appellee did not present these claims to the state court.  Appellant argued, inter alia, that the Federal District Court should abstain from hearing the case under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  The District Court rejected this contention, and, concluding that appellee's constitutional claims had ""a very clear probability of success,"" issued a preliminary injunction barring any action to enforce the state court's judgment, which had now been entered.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, that Younger abstention was unnecessary, because the state interests at stake differed in both kind and degree from those present in the cases in which this Court has held that Younger applied, and because Texas had failed to 
Page 481 U. S. 2
 provide adequate procedures for adjudication of appellee's federal claims.
Held:  The lower federal courts should have abstained under the principles of federalism enunciated in Younger.  Pp.  481 U. S. 10-18.
(a) Younger abstention helps to avoid unwarranted determination of federal constitutional questions.  Here, because appellee chose not to present its constitutional claims to the Texas courts, it is impossible to determine whether the governing Texas statutes and procedural rules actually involved those claims.  Moreover, the Texas Constitution contains an ""open courts"" provision that appears to address appellee's claims more specifically than does the Federal Constitution.

These include enforcing the orders and judgments of the States' courts.  Federal injunctions in such cases would interfere with the execution of state judgments on grounds that challenge the very process by which those judgments were obtained.

481 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Under Texas law, a judgment creditor can secure and execute a lien on a judgment debtor's property unless the debtor files a supersedeas bond in at least the amount of the judgment, interest, and costs.  Appellant obtained a jury verdict of $10.53 billion in its Texas state court suit alleging that appellee tortiously had induced a third oil company to breach a contract to sell its shares to appellant.  Because it was clear that appellee would not be able to post a bond in the necessary amount, the verdict had substantial adverse effects on appellee's business and financial situation.  Accordingly, even before the trial court entered judgment on the verdict, appellee filed suit in Federal District Court alleging that the Texas proceedings violated its rights under the Federal Constitution and various federal statutes.  Appellee did not present these claims to the state court.  Appellant argued, inter alia, that the Federal District Court should abstain from hearing the case under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  The District Court rejected this contention, and, concluding that appellee's constitutional claims had ""a very clear probability of success,"" issued a preliminary injunction barring any action to enforce the state court's judgment, which had now been entered.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, that Younger abstention was unnecessary, because the state interests at stake differed in both kind and degree from those present in the cases in which this Court has held that Younger applied, and because Texas had failed to 
Page 481 U. S. 2
 provide adequate procedures for adjudication of appellee's federal claims.
Held:  The lower federal courts should have abstained under the principles of federalism enunciated in Younger.  Pp.  481 U. S. 10-18.
(a) Younger abstention helps to avoid unwarranted determination of federal constitutional questions.  Here, because appellee chose not to present its constitutional claims to the Texas courts, it is impossible to determine whether the governing Texas statutes and procedural rules actually involved those claims.  Moreover, the Texas Constitution contains an ""open courts"" provision that appears to address appellee's claims more specifically than does the Federal Constitution.  Thus, it is entirely possible that the Texas courts would have resolved this case on state statutory or constitutional grounds, without reaching appellee's federal constitutional questions.  Pp.  481 U. S. 10-12.
(b) Younger abstention is mandated if the State's interests in the proceedings are so important that exercise of the federal judicial power would disregard the comity extended between the States and the National Government.  Here, the argument that the exercise of the District Court's power did not implicate a ""vital"" or ""important"" state interest misreads this Court's precedents, which repeatedly have recognized that the States have important interests in administering certain aspects of their judicial systems.  These include enforcing the orders and judgments of the States' courts.

Syllabus 
In enacting the federal labor relations statutes, Congress did not include a statute of limitations expressly applicable to claims against unions for breach of their duty of fair representation.  Thus, in DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, this Court ""borrowed"" from  10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act its 6-month statute of limitations period for use in ""hybrid"" suits that combine unfair labor practice claims with duty of fair representation claims.  Section 10(b) provides that no complaint may issue based on an unfair labor practice that occurred more than six months prior to the filing of a charge and the service of a copy thereof on the person against whom the charge is made.  Although petitioner's complaint in his hybrid suit against respondents -- his employer, his union, and his union representative -- was filed less than six months after the  10(b) statute of limitations began to run, the District Court granted summary judgment to respondents because the summonses and complaints were not mailed nor service acknowledgments made until after the 6-month period.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, under DelCostello,  10(b) requires in hybrid suits that both the filing and service of the complaint be made within the 6-month period.
Held:  The action was timely commenced because the complaint was filed within the 6-month period.  When the underlying cause of action is based on federal law and the absence of an express federal statute of limitations makes it necessary for a federal court to borrow a limitations period from another statute, the action is not barred if it has been ""commenced"" within the borrowed time period by the filing of a complaint with the court in compliance with Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The mere act of borrowing a statute of limitations to apply to a federal cause of action does not require that that statute's service provisions also be adopted, since Rules 4(a) and (j) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure normally require the plaintiff to serve the summons and a copy of the complaint within 120 days.  When borrowing a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action, this Court borrows no more than is necessary to fill a gap left by Congress.  DelCostello simply borrowed  10(b)'s limitations period, and did not substitute  10(b) for the Federal Rules.  Pp.  481 U. S. 38-40.

Syllabus 
The ""preemption clause"" ( 514(a)) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides that ERISA supersedes all state laws insofar as they ""relate to any employee benefit plan,"" but ERISA's ""saving clause"" ( 514(b)(2)(A)) excepts from the preemption clause any state law that ""regulates insurance.""  ERISA's ""deemer clause"" ( 514(b)(2)(B)) provides that no employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be an insurance company for purposes of any state law ""purporting to regulate insurance.""  On the basis of a work-related injury occurring in Mississippi in 1975, respondent began receiving permanent disability benefits under his employer's ERISA-regulated welfare benefit plan, under which claims were handled by petitioner, the employer's insurer.  However, after two years, petitioner terminated respondent's benefits, and during the following three years his benefits were reinstated and terminated by petitioner several times.  Respondent ultimately instituted a diversity action against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging tort and breach of contract claims under Mississippi common law for petitioner's failure to pay benefits under the insurance policy.  The court granted summary judgment for petitioner, finding that respondent's common law claims were preempted by ERISA.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  ERISA preempts respondent's suit under state common law for alleged improper processing of his claim for benefits under the ERISA-regulated benefit plan.  Pp.  481 U. S. 44-57.
(a) The common law causes of action asserted in respondent's complaint, each based on alleged improper processing of a benefit claim under an employee benefit plan, ""relate to"" an employee benefit plan, and therefore fall under ERISA's preemption clause.  Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724,  471 U. S. 739; Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,  463 U. S. 96-100.  The preemption clause is not limited to state laws specifically designed to affect employee benefit plans.  Pp.  481 U. S. 47-48.
(b) Under the guidelines set forth in Metropolitan Life, respondent's causes of action under state decisional common law -- particularly the cause, presently asserted, based on the Mississippi law of bad faith -- do not fall under ERISA's saving clause, and thus are not excepted from 
Page 481 U. S. 42
 preemption.  A common-sense understanding of the language of the saving clause excepting from preemption a state law that ""regulates insurance"" does not support the argument that the Mississippi law of bad faith falls under the clause.  To ""regulate"" insurance, a law must not just have an impact on the insurance industry, but must be specifically directed toward that industry.  Mississippi Supreme Court decisions establish that its law of bad faith applies to any breach of contract, not merely a breach of an insurance contract.  Neither do the factors for interpreting the phrase ""business of insurance"" under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which factors are appropriate for consideration here) support the assertion that the Mississippi law of bad faith ""regulates insurance"" for purposes of ERISA's saving clause.  Pp.  481 U. S. 48-51.
(c) Moreover, interpretation of the saving clause must be informed by the legislative intent concerning ERISA's civil enforcement provisions.  The language and structure of those provisions support the conclusion that they were intended to provide exclusive remedies for ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of benefit claims.  ERISA's detailed provisions set forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans.  The policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.  The conclusion that ERISA's civil enforcement provisions were intended to be exclusive is also confirmed by the legislative history of those provisions, particularly the history demonstrating that the preemptive force of ERISA's enforcement provisions was modeled after the powerful preemptive force of  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.

Syllabus 
Section 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides that a participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action to, inter alia, recover benefits due him under the terms of an employee benefit plan.  Under 28 U.S.C.  1441(a), any civil action brought in state court of which the federal district courts have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant to the appropriate federal district court.  Petitioner insurer underwrites an ERISA-covered plan set up by petitioner employer to pay benefits to salaried employees disabled by sickness or accident.  After petitioners' doctors found that respondent employee was fit to resume working, his plan benefits were discontinued, his supplemental claim for benefits was denied, and his employment was terminated when he refused to return to work.  He then filed suit in state court for reimplementation of his benefits and for related common law contract and tort claims, but petitioners removed the suit to federal court, alleging federal question jurisdiction over the disability claim by virtue of ERISA and pendent jurisdiction over the remaining claims.  The District Court found the case properly removable, and granted summary judgment for petitioners on the merits.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the District Court lacked removal jurisdiction, finding that the complaint purported to state only state law causes of action, and that the ""well-pleaded complaint"" rule, under which a cause of action ""arises under"" federal law for jurisdictional purposes only when the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint raises federal law issues, did not allow removal predicated on the basis that the state law claims were subject to the federal defense of ERISA preemption.  The court also held that the doctrine of Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, which permits the removal of cases purporting to state only state law causes of action in labor cases preempted by  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), did not apply to this case. 
Page 481 U. S. 59

Held:
1. Under Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, ante p.  481 U. S. 41, respondent's common law contract and tort claims are preempted by ERISA, and this lawsuit falls directly under  502(a)(1)(B), which provides an exclusive federal cause of action for resolution of suits by beneficiaries to recover benefits from a covered plan.  Pp.  481 U. S. 62-63.
2. Common law causes of action filed in state court that are preempted by ERISA and come within the scope of  502(a)(1)(B) are removable to federal court under 28 U.S.C.  1441(b).  The Avco doctrine applies in this situation to recharacterize a state law complaint displaced by  502(a)(1)(B) as an action arising under federal law, even though the defense of ERISA preemption does not appear on the face of the complaint, as is normally required for removal by the ""well-pleaded complaint"" rule.  That Congress meant to so completely preempt this subject area that any claim is necessarily federal in character is established by the language of  502's jurisdictional subsection (f), which closely parallels that of  301 of the LMRA, and statements in ERISA's civil enforcement provisions' legislative history, which indicate that  502(a)(1)(B) suits should be regarded as ""arising under"" federal law in the same manner as  301 suits.  Respondent's contention that removal was improper because it was not ""obvious"" when he filed suit that his common law action was both preempted and displaced by ERISA is not persuasive, since the touchstone of federal courts' removal jurisdiction is not the ""obviousness"" of the preemption defense, but the intent of Congress.

Syllabus 
Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U. S. 620, held that, under pertinent treaties with the Federal Government, certain Indian Tribes, including respondent Tribe, were granted title to the riverbed underlying portions of the Arkanas River in Oklahoma.  The Government's construction of a navigable channel in the river damaged respondent's riverbed mineral interests.  After unsuccessfully seeking compensation from the Government, respondent filed suit in Federal District Court, contending that the channel project resulted in a taking under the Fifth Amendment of respondent's riverbed interests without just compensation.  Granting summary judgment for respondent, the court rejected, on the basis of Choctaw Nation, the Government's defense that its navigational servitude under the Commerce Clause precluded liability for the alleged taking, and held that, under the relevant treaties, the Government had not reserved its navigational servitude.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, adopting a different analysis.  It found that the Government retained a navigational servitude in the river, but that -- balancing the public and private interests involved -- the servitude was insufficient to protect the Government from liability to compensate respondent.
Held:  No ""balancing"" test, as formulated by the Court of Appeals, is required where, as here, the interference with in-stream interests results from an exercise of the Government's Commerce Clause power to regulate navigational uses of waters.  The proper exercise of the Government's navigational servitude is not an invasion of any private property rights in the stream or the lands underlying it, for the damage sustained does not result from taking property from riparian owners within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the riparian owners' interests are subject.  Contrary to respondent's contention, the decision in Choctaw Nation does not support the conclusion that respondent's title to the riverbed is unique in scope, or that, under the pertinent treaties, the Government abandoned its navigational servitude in the area.  Moreover, the Government's fiduciary obligations in dealing with Indian tribal property do not elevate the Government's actions into a taking.  The tribal interests here simply do not

Syllabus 
Respondent, a physician and psychiatrist, was an employee of a state hospital and had primary responsibility for training physicians in the psychiatric residency program.  Hospital officials became concerned about possible improprieties in his management of the program, particularly with respect to his acquisition of a computer and charges against him concerning sexual harassment of female hospital employees and inappropriate disciplinary action against a resident.  While he was on administrative leave pending investigation of the charges, hospital officials, allegedly in order to inventory and secure state property, searched his office and seized personal items from his desk and file cabinets that were used in administrative proceedings resulting in his discharge.  No formal inventory of the property in the office was ever made, and all the other papers in the office were merely placed in boxes for storage.  Respondent filed an action against petitioner hospital officials in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that the search of his office violated the Fourth Amendment.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted judgment for petitioners, concluding that the search was proper because there was a need to secure state property in the office.  Affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding the case, the Court of Appeals concluded that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office, and that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.  The court held that the record justified a grant of partial summary judgment for respondent on the issue of liability for the search, and it remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of damages.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
764 F.2d 703, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE POWELL, concluded that:
1. Searches and seizures by government employers or supervisors of the private property of their employees are subject to Fourth Amendment restraints.  An expectation of privacy in one's place of work is based upon societal expectations that have deep roots in the history of the Amendment.  However, the operational realities of the workplace may make some public employees' expectations of privacy unreasonable 
Page 480 U. S. 710
 when an intrusion is by a supervisor, rather than a law enforcement official.  Some government offices may be so open to fellow employees or the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable.  Given the great variety of work environments in the public sector, the question whether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  Because the record does not reveal the extent to which hospital officials may have had work-related reasons to enter respondent's office, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the matter to the District Court for its further determination.  However, a majority of this Court agrees with the determination of the Court of Appeals that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.  Regardless of any expectation of privacy in the office itself, the undisputed evidence supports the conclusion that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy at least in his desk and file cabinets.  Pp.  480 U. S. 714-719.
2. In determining the appropriate standard for a search conducted by a public employer in areas in which an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy, what is a reasonable search depends on the context within which the search takes place, and requires balancing the employee's legitimate expectation of privacy against the government's need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace.  Requiring an employer to obtain a warrant whenever the employer wishes to enter an employee's office, desk, or file cabinets for a work-related purpose would seriously disrupt the routine conduct of business and would be unreasonable.  Moreover, requiring a probable cause standard for searches of the type at issue here would impose intolerable burdens on public employers.  Their intrusions on the constitutionally protected privacy interests of government employees for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.  Under this standard, both the inception and the scope of the intrusion must be reasonable.  Pp.  480 U. S. 719-726.
3. In the procedural posture of this case, it cannot be determined whether the search of respondent's office, and the seizure of his personal belongings, satisfied the standard of reasonableness.  Both courts below were in error, because summary judgment was inappropriate.  The parties were in dispute about the actual justification for the search, and the record was inadequate for a determination of the reasonableness of the search and seizure.  On remand, the District Court must determine these matters.  Pp.  480 U. S. 726-729.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the offices of government employees, and a fortiori the drawers and files within those offices, are covered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general matter, and no special circumstances

 were present here that would call for an exception to the ordinary rule.  However, government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules -- searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context -- do not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Because the conflicting and incomplete evidence in the present case could not conceivably support summary judgment that the search did not have such a validating purpose, the decision must be reversed and remanded.

Syllabus 
In 1978, an Affirmative Action Plan (Plan) for hiring and promoting minorities and women was voluntarily adopted by respondent Santa Clara County Transportation Agency (Agency).  The Plan provides, inter alia, that, in making promotions to positions within a traditionally segregated job classification in which women have been significantly underrepresented, the Agency is authorized to consider as one factor the sex of a qualified applicant.  The Plan is intended to achieve a statistically measurable yearly improvement in hiring and promoting minorities and women in job classifications where they are underrepresented, and the long-term goal is to attain a workforce whose composition reflects the proportion of minorities and women in the area labor force.  The Plan sets aside no specific number of positions for minorities or women, but requires that short-range goals be established and annually adjusted to serve as the most realistic guide for actual employment decisions.  When the Agency announced a vacancy for the promotional position of road dispatcher, none of the 238 positions in the pertinent Skilled Craft Worker job classification, which included the dispatcher position, was held by a woman.  The qualified applicants for the position were interviewed and the Agency, pursuant to the Plan, ultimately passed over petitioner, a male employee, and promoted a female, Diane Joyce, both of whom were rated as well qualified for the job.  After receiving a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, which held that the Agency had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court found that Joyce's sex was the determining factor in her selection, and that the Agency's Plan was invalid under the criterion announced in Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U. S. 193, that the Plan be temporary.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Agency appropriately took into account Joyce's sex as one factor in determining that she should be promoted.  The Agency's Plan represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case approach to effecting a gradual improvement in the representation of minorities and women 
Page 480 U. S. 617
 in the Agency's workforce, and is fully consistent with Title VII.  Pp.  480 U. S. 626-640.
(a) Petitioner bears the burden of proving that the Agency's Plan violates Title VII.  Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has been taken into account in an employer's employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision, such as the existence of an affirmative action plan.  The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the plan is invalid and that the employer's justification is pretextual.  Pp.  480 U. S. 626-627.
(b) Assessment of the legality of the Agency's Plan must be guided by the decision in Weber.  An employer seeking to justify the adoption of an affirmative action plan need not point to its own prior discriminatory practices, but need point only to a conspicuous imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.  Voluntary employer action can play a crucial role in furthering Title VII's purpose of eliminating the effects of discrimination in the workplace, and Title VII should not be read to thwart such efforts.  Pp.  480 U. S. 627-630.
(c) The employment decision here was made pursuant to a plan prompted by concerns similar to those of the employer in Weber, supra.  Consideration of the sex of applicants for skilled craft jobs was justified by the existence of a ""manifest imbalance"" that reflected underrepresentation of women in ""traditionally segregated job categories.""  Id. at 197.  Where a job requires special training, the comparison for determining whether an imbalance exists should be between the employer's workforce and those in the area labor force who possess the relevant qualifications.  If a plan failed to take distinctions in qualifications into account in providing guidance for actual employment decisions, it would improperly dictate mere blind hiring by the numbers.  However, the Agency's Plan did not authorize such blind hiring, but expressly directed that numerous factors be taken into account in making employment decisions, including specifically the number of female applicants qualified for particular jobs.  Thus, despite the fact that no precise short-term goal was yet in place for the Skilled Craft Worker job category when Joyce was promoted, the Agency's management had been clearly instructed that they were not to hire solely by reference to statistics.  The fact that only the long-term goal had been established for the job category posed no danger that personnel decisions would be made by reflexive adherence to a numerical standard.  Pp.  480 U. S. 631-637.
(d) The Agency Plan did not unnecessarily trammel male employees' rights or create an absolute bar to their advancement.  The Plan sets aside no positions for women, and expressly states that its goals should 
Page 480 U. S. 618
 not be construed as ""quotas"" that must be met.  Denial of the promotion to petitioner unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on his part, since the Agency Director was authorized to select any of the seven applicants deemed qualified for the job.  Express assurance that a program is only temporary may be necessary if the program actually sets aside positions according to specific numbers.  However, substantial evidence shows that the Agency has sought to take a moderate, gradual approach to eliminating the imbalance in its workforce, one which establishes realistic guidance for employment decisions, and which visits minimal intrusion on the legitimate expectations of other employees.  Given this fact, as well as the Agency's express commitment to ""attain"" a balanced workforce, there is ample assurance that the Agency does not seek to use its Plan to ""maintain"" a permanent racial and sexual balance.  Pp.  480 U. S. 637-640.

However, substantial evidence shows that the Agency has sought to take a moderate, gradual approach to eliminating the imbalance in its workforce, one which establishes realistic guidance for employment decisions, and which visits minimal intrusion on the legitimate expectations of other employees.  Given this fact, as well as the Agency's express commitment to ""attain"" a balanced workforce, there is ample assurance that the Agency does not seek to use its Plan to ""maintain"" a permanent racial and sexual balance.  Pp.  480 U. S. 637-640.

No. 85-920
Argued December 1, 1986
Decided March 25, 1987
480 U.S. 678

Syllabus 
To assist airline employees dislocated as a result of the deregulation of commercial air carriers pursuant to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Act), Congress enacted an Employee Protection Program (EPP) as  43 of the Act.  The EPP imposes on covered airlines the ""duty to hire"" dislocated protected employees, who have a ""first right of hire"" in their occupational specialties with any covered airline that is hiring additional employees.  Section 43 authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations for the administration of the EPP, but  43(f)(3) contains a legislative veto provision stating that any final regulation shall become effective after 60 legislative days following its submission to Congress, unless, during that period, either House of Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it.  Petitioners, airlines subject to the Act's duty-to-hire provisions, filed suit in Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for them, holding  43(f)(3)'s legislative veto provision unconstitutional under INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, and striking down the entire EPP on the ground that the veto provision was nonseverable.  On appeal from the finding of nonseverability, the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 43(f)(3)'s legislative veto provision is severable from the remainder of the EPP program.  Pp.  480 U. S. 684-697.
(a) The standard for determining the severability of an unconstitutional provision in a federal statute is that, unless it is evident that Congress would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.  The relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether the statute will function in a manner consistent with Congress' intent.  In considering this question in the context of a legislative veto, it must be recognized that the absence of the veto necessarily alters the balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches of the Federal Government.  Thus, it is not only appropriate to evaluate the importance of the veto in the original legislative bargain, but also to consider the nature of the delegated authority that Congress made subject to a veto.  Pp.  480 U. S. 684-687. 
Page 480 U. S. 679

(b) Severability of the legislative veto provision here is supported by the Act's language and structure.  Congress' intent that the EPP's first-hire provisions should survive in the absence of the legislative veto provision is suggested strongly by the detailed affirmative duty the statute places directly on air carriers.  The first-hire provisions scarcely need the adoption of regulations by the Secretary, and thus leave little of substance to be subject to a veto.  The ancillary nature of the Secretary's obligations to implement the first-hire provisions is further evidence that Congress delegated only limited substantive discretion to the Secretary.  Pp.  480 U. S. 678-691.
(c) The legislative history of the EPP supports the conclusion that Congress would have enacted the duty-to-hire provisions even without a legislative veto provision by revealing that Congress regarded labor protection as an important feature of the Act, while it paid scant attention to the legislative veto provision.  The emphasis during deliberations on the Act was placed overwhelmingly on the substantive provisions of the statute.  Pp.  480 U. S. 691-696.

No. 85-1239
Argued January 12, 1987
Decided March 24, 1987
480 U.S. 531

Syllabus 
Section 810(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) provides, inter alia, that, before allowing the use, occupancy, or disposition of public lands that would significantly restrict Alaskan Natives' use of those lands for subsistence, the head of the federal agency having primary jurisdiction over the lands must give notice, conduct a hearing, and determine that the restriction of subsistence uses is necessary and that reasonable steps will be taken to minimize adverse impacts.  Petitioner Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) granted oil and gas leases to petitioner oil companies off the Alaska coast under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).  Claiming that the Secretary had failed to comply with  810(a), respondents, two Alaska Native villages and a Native organization, sought injunctions to, inter alia, prohibit exploratory drilling under the leases.  The District Court held that ANILCA applies to the OCS.  It denied respondents' motions for preliminary injunctions, ruling that, although respondents had established a strong likelihood of success on the merits, injunctive relief was inappropriate because the balance of irreparable harm did not favor them, and the public interest favored continued oil exploration, which would not cause the type of harm -- a restriction in subsistence uses or resources -- that ANILCA was designed to prevent.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the holding that ANILCA applies to the OCS, but reversed the District Court's denial of a preliminary injunction.  The court held, inter alia, that irreparable damage is presumed when an agency fails to evaluate thoroughly the environmental impact of a proposed action, and that injunctive relief is the appropriate remedy for a violation of an environmental statute, absent rare or unusual circumstances.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' direction of a preliminary injunction conflicted with Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, and was in 
Page 480 U. S. 532
 error.  Section 810(a)'s purpose is to protect subsistence resources from unnecessary destruction, not to prohibit all federal land uses that would adversely affect such resources, and there is no clear indication in ANILCA that Congress intended to limit district courts' traditional equitable discretion by requiring them to issue injunctions in all cases.  The Court of Appeals erroneously focused on  810's procedure, rather than on its underlying substantive policy of preservation of subsistence resources.  The District Court's decision does not undermine that policy, since it was based on findings that exploration activities would not significantly restrict subsistence uses, and that the Secretary can control the offshore leasing process even after exploration is completed, which findings the Court of Appeals did not dispute.  Instead, that court stated and relied on a presumption of irreparable harm which is contrary to traditional equitable principles, has no basis in ANILCA, and is unnecessary to fully protect the environment.  Furthermore, the balance of harms favors the District Court's ruling, since the oil company petitioners had committed approximately $70 million to exploration which would have been lost had the preliminary injunction been issued.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the public interest favored injunctive relief because the interests served by ANILCA supersede all others is not supported by the statutory language, which merely declares that preservation of subsistence resources is a public interest that should be reconciled with competing interests where possible.  Pp.  480 U. S. 541-546.
2. Section 810(a) does not apply to the OCS.  Pp.  480 U. S. 546-555.
(a) By ANILCA's plain language,  810(a) applies only to federal lands within the State of Alaska's boundaries, since the Act defines ""public lands"" to mean federal lands situated ""in Alaska,"" which phrase has a precise geographic/political meaning that can be delineated with exactitude to include coastal waters to a point three miles from the coastline, where the OCS commences.  Pp.  480 U. S. 546-548.
(b) Nothing in the language or structure of ANILCA compels this Court to deviate from the plain meaning of ""Alaska.""  Title VIII's subsistence protection provisions constitute just 1 of ANILCA's 15 Titles, none of the rest of which has any express or implied applicability to the OCS, and all but 2 of which utilize the same definition of ""public lands"" as Title VIII.  Moreover,  1001(a) of the Act contains the lone express reference to the OCS which is intended to establish that section's inapplicability to the OCS.  Furthermore,  810(a) itself suggests that it does not apply to the OCS when it refers to ""the Federal agency having primary jurisdiction,"" since no federal agency has ""primary jurisdiction"" over the OCS.  Pp.  480 U. S. 548-552. 
Page 480 U. S. 533

(c) The similarity between ANILCA's language and that of its two statutory predecessors, the Alaska Statehood Act and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, also refutes the contention that Congress intended ""Alaska"" to include the OCS.  Those statutes allowed the new State of Alaska and Native Alaskans to select public lands ""in Alaska"" as their own.  It is inconceivable that Congress could have intended that either the State or the Natives could select so vital a national resource as the OCS.  P.  480 U. S. 555.
(d) ANILCA's legislative history indicates that OCSLA, rather than ANILCA, governs offshore oil development.  Pp.  480 U. S. 552-554.
(e) The statutory construction rule that doubtful expressions must be resolved in favor of Indians does not apply here, since there is no ambiguity in the Act that requires interpretation.  P.  480 U. S. 555.

No. 85-1140
Argued December 1, 1986
Decided March 24, 1987
480 U.S. 557

Syllabus 
Under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), railroad workers can sue their employers for personal injuries suffered at the hands of the employers or fellow employees.  The Railway Labor Act (RLA) provides for the submission of minor labor disputes in the railroad industry to binding arbitration.  Respondent, a carman employed by petitioner, filed an FELA suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner had condoned his harassment by fellow employees, causing him to suffer an emotional breakdown.  The District Court granted petitioner summary judgment, holding that the RLA precluded an FELA remedy.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's claims were not arbitrable under the RLA, and that an FELA action was therefore not precluded.  Additionally, although the question had been neither raised by the parties nor addressed by the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that purely emotional injury is compensable under the FELA.
Held:
1. The fact that an injury was caused by conduct that may have been subject to arbitration under the RLA does not deprive a railroad employee of his right to bring an FELA action for damages.  The FELA not only provides substantive protection against conduct that is independent of the employer's obligations under its collective bargaining agreement, but also affords injured workers a remedy suited to their needs, unlike the limited relief of backpay and reinstatement that is available through RLA arbitration.  Although the RLA minor disputes remedy is exclusive ""in at least some circumstances,"" it is not exclusive in situations that the FELA was enacted to address.  Pp.  480 U. S. 564-566.
2. Petitioner's argument that, even if many workplace injuries are actionable under the FELA, the RLA requires that a narrow ""emotional injury"" exception be carved out of the FELA because of the close relationship of such injuries to minor disputes that must be brought under the RLA is not persuasive.  There is no basis for assuming that allowing FELA emotional injury actions will wreak havoc with the RLA's general arbitration scheme, and absent an intolerable conflict between the two 
Page 480 U. S. 558
 statutes, this Court is unwilling to read the RLA as repealing any part of the FELA.  Pp.  480 U. S. 566-567.
3. The record is insufficient at this preliminary stage to allow this Court, or the Court of Appeals, to express an opinion on respondent's ultimate chance of recovery under the FELA on his emotional injury claim.  The question whether purely emotional injury is compensable under the FELA is not necessarily an abstract point of law or a pure question of statutory construction susceptible to an all-inclusive ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.  It might require exacting scrutiny of each case's facts in light of developing legal principles.  Pp.  480 U. S. 567-571.

No. 86-1200
Argued December 2, 1986
Decided March 24, 1987
480 U.S. 572

Syllabus 
The Mining Act of 1872 authorizes a private citizen to enter federal lands to explore for mineral deposits, to perfect a mining claim, and to secure a patent to the land by complying with the requirements of the Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Appellee Granite Rock Co. holds unpatented mining claims on federally owned lands in a national forest located in California.  In accordance with federal regulations, Granite Rock obtained approval from the Forest Service in 1981 of its 6-year plan for mining limestone on the lands, and began to mine shortly thereafter.  In 1983, the California Coastal Commission (Commission), acting pursuant to the California Coastal Act (CCA), instructed Granite Rock to apply for a coastal development permit for any mining undertaken after the date of the Commission's letter.  Under the CCA, the Commission is the State's coastal zone management program for purposes of the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), which provides for financial assistance to States for the development of coastal zone management programs and which defines a State's coastal zone so as to exclude
""lands the use of which is by law subject solely to the discretion of or which is held in trust by the Federal Government, its officers or agents.""
Granite Rock filed suit in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the Commission's permit requirement was preempted by Forest Service Regulations, by the Mining Act of 1872, and by the CZMA.  The court denied Granite Rock's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Commission's permit requirement, which enforced state environmental standards, was preempted by the Mining Act of 1872 and Forest Service regulations.
Held:
1. The case is not moot, even though Granite Rock's 6-year plan of operations expired during the course of the litigation.  Because the Commission asserts that Granite Rock needed a Commission permit for work undertaken after the date of the Commission's letter, the Commission may require reclamation efforts to prevent river pollution resulting from the mining that has already occurred.  Granite Rock disputes the Commission's authority to require such reclamation.  Also, it is likely that 
Page 480 U. S. 573
 Granite Rock will submit new plans of operation in the future, and dispute would continue as to enforcement of the conditions of a Commission permit.  This Court does not have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1264(2), because the Court of Appeals invalidated only the Commission's exercise of authority under the CGA, not any portion of the state statute itself, as is required under 1264(2).  However, treating the jurisdictional statement as a petition for certiorari, the petition is granted.  Pp.  480 U. S. 577-579.
2. Neither Forest Service regulations, nor federal land use statutes, nor the CZMA preempts the Commission's imposition of a permit requirement on operation of an unpatented mining claim in a national forest.  Pp.  480 U. S. 579-594.
(a) The Property Clause of the Constitution -- which gives Congress plenary power to legislate the use of federal lands -- does not itself automatically conflict with all state regulation of federal lands.  The question in this case is governed by the usual preemption analysis, whereby state law is preempted if Congress has evidenced an intent to occupy entirely a given field or, where Congress has not entirely displaced state regulation, if state law actually conflict with federal law.
(b) The Forest Service regulations, governing the use of unpatented mining claims on federal forest lands authorized by the Mining Act of 1872 (which expressed no legislative intent on the then rarely contemplated subject of environmental regulation), do not justify a facial challenge to all conditions that might be imposed by the Commission's permit requirement.  It is appropriate to expect an administrative regulation to declare any intention to preempt state law with some specificity.  The Forest Service regulations here not only are devoid of any expression of intent to preempt state law, but rather appear to assume that those submitting plans of operation will comply with state environmental protection laws.  Pp.  480 U. S. 581-584.
(c) There is no merit to the contention that federal land management statutes -- the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the National Forest Management Act -- demonstrate a legislative intent to limit States to a purely advisory role in federal land management decisions, and that the Commission permit requirement is therefore preempted as an impermissible state land use regulation.  Even if it is assumed (without deciding the issue) that the combination of those federal Acts preempts the extension of state land use plans to unpatented mining claims in national forest lands, the Commission asserts that it will use permit conditions to impose environmental regulation, not land use planning.  Congress has indicated its understanding of land use planning and environmental regulation as distinct activities, and thus it is anomalous to maintain that Congress intended any state environmental regulation 
Page 480 U. S. 574
 of unpatented mining claims in national forests to be per se preempted as an impermissible exercise of state land use planning.  In the present posture of this litigation, the Commission's identification of a possible set of permit conditions not preempted by federal law is sufficient to rebuff Granite Rock's facial challenge to the permit requirement.  Pp.  480 U. S. 584-589.
(d) The CZMA, by excluding federal lands from its definition of the coastal zone, does not demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt any possible Commission permit requirement as applied to the mining of Granite Rock's unpatented claim.  The CZMA's language and legislative history expressly disclaim an intent to automatically preempt all state regulation of activities on federal lands.  Congress' statements indicate that it intended the CZMA not to be an independent cause of preemption except in cases of actual conflict between state and federal law.  Pp.  480 U. S. 589-593.

Decided March 23, 1987
480 U.S. 522

Syllabus 
While released on a personal recognizance bond following her arrest for selling cocaine, petitioner was arrested again for selling heroin.  She pleaded guilty to both charges.  Although recognizing that 18 U.S.C.  3147 (1982 ed., Supp. III) required that petitioner, as a person who committed a felony while on release pending judicial proceedings, had to be sentenced to at least a 2-year term of imprisonment in addition to the sentences for the two drug offenses, the sentencing judge, relying on 18 U.S.C.  3651, suspended execution of the  3147 sentence and instead imposed a 2-year probation term as more appropriate under the circumstances.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  3147 ""supersede[d]""  3651, leaving federal judges without authority to suspend execution of sentences imposed under  3147.
Held:  Section 3147 does not divest sentencing judges of their  3651 authority.  Nothing in the language of the two provisions suggests the existence of an ""irreconcilable conflict"" from which an intent to work an implicit partial repeal of  3651 may be inferred; to the contrary, the provisions fit together quite sensibly.  Moreover, the totality of the legislative history of the Act of which  3147 is a part demonstrates with unusual clarity that no repeal was intended.  The Court of Appeals impermissibly relied on its understanding of the broad purposes of that Act, since  3147 is sufficiently clear in its context, and not at odds with the legislative history.
Certiorari granted; 794 F.2d 24, reversed.

Argued November 5, 1986

480 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
An Illinois statute, as it existed in 1981, required licensed motor vehicle and vehicular parts sellers to permit state officials to inspect certain required records.  In 1981, pursuant to the statute, a police detective entered respondents' automobile wrecking yard and asked to see records of vehicle purchases.  He was told that the records could not be located, but was given a list of approximately five purchases.  After receiving permission to look at the cars in the yard, he ascertained that three were stolen and that a fourth had had its identification number removed.  He then seized the cars, and respondents were arrested and charged with various crimes.  The state trial court granted respondents' motion to suppress the evidence seized from the yard, agreeing with a federal court ruling, issued the day after the search, that the state statute violated the Fourth Amendment because it permitted officers unbridled discretion in their warrantless searches.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that the seized evidence was admissible because the detective had acted in good faith reliance on the statute in making the search.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained by police who acted in objectively reasonable reliance upon a statute authorizing warrantless administrative searches, but which is subsequently found to violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  480 U. S. 349-355.
(a) Application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances would have little deterrent effect on future police misconduct, which is the basic purpose of the rule.  Officers conducting such searches are simply fulfilling their responsibility to enforce the statute as written.  If a statute is not clearly unconstitutional, officers cannot be expected to question the judgment of the legislature that passed the law.  Pp.  480 U. S. 349-350.
(b) Application of the exclusionary rule cannot be justified on the basis of deterring legislative misconduct.  Police, not legislators, are the focus of the rule.  Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that legislatures are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment.  There is also no indication that the exclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a statute subsequently declared unconstitutional would have a significant deterrent effect on the enactment of similar laws.  Legislators 
Page 480 U. S. 341
 enact statutes for broad programmatic purposes, not for the purpose of procuring evidence in particular cases.  The greatest deterrent to unconstitutional enactments is the courts' power to invalidate such statutes.  Even if the exclusionary rule provided some incremental deterrent, its benefit would be outweighed by the substantial social costs exacted by the rule.  Pp.  480 U. S. 350-353.
(c) The contention that the application of the exclusionary rule is required because large numbers of people are affected by a warrantless administrative search statute is not persuasive.  Although the number of individuals affected may be considered in weighing the costs and benefits of applying the rule, the fact that many are affected will not require the rule's application if such application will not have a meaningful deterrent effect.  P.  480 U. S. 353.
(d) The contention that the exception to the exclusionary rule recognized here will discourage criminal defendants from presenting meritorious Fourth Amendment claims is also not persuasive.  Defendants will always be able to argue in a suppression motion that the officer's reliance on the warrantless search statute was not objectively reasonable, and therefore was not in good faith.  Furthermore, persons covered by a statute may bring an action seeking a declaration of the statute's unconstitutionality and an injunction barring its implementation.  Pp.  480 U. S. 353-354.
(e) Under the exception to the exclusionary rule recognized here, a statute cannot support objectively reasonable reliance if, in passing it, the legislature wholly abandoned its responsibility to enact constitutional laws, or if the statutory provisions are such that a reasonable law enforcement officer should have known that the statute was unconstitutional.  P.  480 U. S. 355.
2. The detective's reliance on the Illinois statute was objectively reasonable.  Even assuming that the statute was unconstitutional because it vested state officials with too much discretion, this constitutional defect would not have been obvious to a police officer acting in good faith.

Respondent nonprofit organization, whose members live near a hazardous waste dumpsite, moved to intervene in a suit brought by the United States and the State of California against petitioners, who owned or operated the dumpsite, or who allegedly dumped waste there.  The suit sought injunctive relief that would require petitioners to abate the release of harmful substances from the site, to take remedial steps to correct the unsafe conditions, and to reimburse the costs of bringing about the cleanup.  The Federal District Court denied respondent's request to intervene as a matter of right, but granted its alternative application to become a permissive intervenor, subject to the conditions that it could not (1) assert any claim for relief not already requested by one of the original parties; (2) intervene in the cleanup costs claim; or (3) file motions or conduct its own discovery unless it first conferred with all the original parties and obtained the permission of one of them.  Respondent filed an immediate appeal, protesting both the denial of intervention as of right and the restrictions imposed on permissive intervention.  The Court of Appeals allowed the appeal, holding that the denial of intervention was a final appealable order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1291, despite the grant of permissive intervention.
Held:  A district court order granting permissive intervention but denying intervention as of right is not immediately appealable.  Such an order is not ""final"" in the traditional sense, since it does not end the litigation.  Furthermore, it does not fall within one of the narrow categories the Court has deemed final for review purposes.  Pp.  480 U. S. 374-380.
(a) The District Court order is not covered by the ""collateral order"" exception to  1291, because respondent's party status as a permissive intervenor will allow it to obtain effective review of its claims on appeal from the final judgment.  Although, after a long and complex trial, it might be difficult for respondent to show that the harm from the intervention order is sufficiently great to overturn the final judgment, this has little bearing on whether respondent has the right to an interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine.  The complained-of difficulty is the same one faced by any party subject to an adverse pretrial order.  Respondent has presented no compelling evidence why the 
Page 480 U. S. 371
 intervention order here should be treated differently than these other orders.
(b) The limitations placed on respondent's right to participate cannot be construed as a complete denial of intervention sufficient to render the District Court order immediately reviewable.  Respondent is, in fact, a participant in the case. and has alternative means for challenging the order.  It is significant that none of the limitations on permissive intervention interfere with respondent's ability to raise its claims on post-judgment appeal.  Pp.  480 U. S. 377-378.
(c) The District Court order does not come within 28 U.S.C.  1292(a)(1), which authorizes interlocutory appeals from orders ""refusing . . . injunctions.""  Even assuming the order had the effect of denying injunctions sought by respondent, such a denial is appealable under  1292(a)(1) only if the order will have a serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence, and can be effectively challenged only by an immediate appeal.  Respondent's right, during post-trial review, to challenge the limits on its participation renders  1292(a)(1) inapplicable.  Pp.  480 U. S. 378-379.
(d) Section 1291's finality rule protects a variety of interests that contribute to the efficiency of the legal system.  The trial judge's ability to conduct efficient and orderly trials would be frustrated, rather than furthered, by piecemeal review.  Pp.  480 U. S. 380.

|480 u.s. 386|"Town of Newton v. Rumery
No. 85-1449
Argued December 8, 1986
Decided March 9, 1987
480 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
After learning that a friend, David Champy, had been indicted by a New Hampshire county grand jury for aggravated felonious sexual assault, respondent sought more information from a mutual acquaintance, who coincidentally was the victim of the assault and was expected to be the principal witness against Champy.  The victim called the town of Newton's Chief of Police and told him that respondent was trying to force her to drop the charges against Champy.  Ultimately, respondent was arrested and accused of the state law felony of tampering with a witness.  Respondent's attorney and the prosecutor negotiated an agreement whereby the prosecutor would dismiss the charges against him if he would agree to release any claims he might have against the town, its officials, or the victim for any harm caused by his arrest.  Three days later, he signed the ""release-dismissal agreement,"" and the criminal charges against him were dropped.  Ten months later, he filed this action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in Federal District Court, alleging that the town and its officers had violated his constitutional rights by arresting him, defaming him, and imprisoning him falsely.  The suit was dismissed on the basis of the assertion by the defendants (petitioners here) of the release-dismissal agreement as an affirmative defense.  The court rejected respondent's argument that the agreement was unenforceable because it violated public policy, and concluded that a release of claims under  1983 was valid if, as here, it resulted from a decision that was voluntary, deliberate, and informed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, adopting a per se rule invalidating release-dismissal agreements.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
778 F.2d 66, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, IV, and V, concluding that:
1. The question whether the policies underlying  1983 may in some circumstances render a waiver of the right to sue thereunder unenforceable is one of federal law, to be resolved by reference to traditional common law principles.  The relevant principle is that a promise is unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement.  P.  480 U. S. 392. 
Page 480 U. S. 387

2. Although in some cases release-dismissal agreements may infringe important interests of the criminal defendant and of society as a whole, the mere possibility of harm to such interests does not call for a per se rule invalidating all such agreements.  The risk, publicity, and expense of a criminal trial may intimidate a defendant, even if he believes his defense is meritorious.  But this possibility does not justify invalidating all release-dismissal agreements.  In many cases, a defendant's choice to enter into a release-dismissal agreement will reflect a highly rational judgment that the certain benefits of escaping criminal prosecution exceed the speculative benefits of prevailing in a civil action.  Respondent's voluntary decision to enter into the agreement here exemplifies such a judgment.  Respondent, a sophisticated businessman, was not in jail, and was represented by an experienced criminal lawyer, who drafted the agreement.  Respondent considered the agreement for three days before signing it.  Because respondent voluntarily waived his right to sue under  1983, the public interest opposing involuntary waiver of constitutional rights is no reason to hold the agreement here invalid.  Pp.  480 U. S. 392-394.
3. The District Court's decision to enforce the agreement was correct.  Not only did respondent voluntarily enter into the agreement, but also the prosecutor had a legitimate reason to make this agreement that was directly related to his prosecutorial responsibilities and was independent of his discretion as to bringing criminal charges.  A significant consideration in the prosecutor's decision was the fact that it spared the victim of the alleged sexual offense from the public scrutiny and embarrassment she would have endured if she had been required to testify in either the civil trial or the criminal trial concerning respondent.  Pp.  480 U. S. 397-398.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part III-B that, in some cases, there may be a substantial basis for the Court of Appeals' concern that release-dismissal agreements offend public policy because they may tempt prosecutors to trump up charges in reaction to a defendant's civil rights claim, suppress evidence of police misconduct, and leave deprivations of constitutional rights unremedied.  However, respondent had no public duty to institute a  1983 action merely to further the public's interest in revealing police misconduct.  Congress confined the decision to bring such actions to the injured individual, not to the public at large.  Release-dismissal agreements may tempt prosecutors to bring frivolous charges or to dismiss meritorious charges in order to protect the interests of other officials.  But a per se rule of invalidity fails to credit other relevant public interests, and improperly assumes prosecutorial misconduct.  Many  1983 suits are marginal, and some are frivolous, but the burden of defending such suits is substantial, requiring officials' time and 
Page 480 U. S. 388
 attention, to the detriment of their public duties.  A per se rule of invalidity also improperly assumes that prosecutors will seize the opportunity for wrongdoing.  Against the background of general judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion in bringing criminal charges, the mere opportunity to act improperly does not compel an assumption that all -- or even a significant number of -- release-dismissal agreements stem from prosecutors' abandoning the independence of judgment required by their public trust.  Rather, tradition and experience justify the belief that the great majority of prosecutors will be faithful to their duty.  Pp.  480 U. S. 394-397.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, agreeing that release-dismissal agreements are not void as against public policy in all cases, that a case-by-case approach appropriately balances the important interests on both sides of the question of the enforceability of such agreements, and that, on the facts here, respondent's covenant not to sue was enforceable, emphasized that it is the burden of those relying upon such covenants to establish that the agreement is neither involuntary nor the product of an abuse of the criminal process.  The dangers of release-dismissal agreements -- particularly the potential threats to the integrity of the criminal process and to the vindication of federal civil rights -- do not preclude enforcement of such agreements in all cases.  The defendants in a  1983 suit may establish that a particular release executed in exchange for the dismissal of criminal charges was voluntarily made, not the product of prosecutorial overreaching, and was in the public interest.  But they must prove that this is so; the courts should not presume it.  Pp.  480 U. S. 399-403.
POWELL, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, IV, and V, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III-B, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

No. 85-782
Argued October 7, 1986

Syllabus 
Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) requires that the Attorney General withhold deportation of an alien who demonstrates that his ""life or freedom would be threatened"" thereby on account of specified factors.  The above-quoted phrase requires a showing that ""it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution"" in the country to which he would be returned.  In contrast,  208(a) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to a ""refugee,"" who, under  101(a)(42)(A) of the Act, is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or ""a well founded fear"" thereof on account of particular factors.  At respondent illegal alien's deportation hearing, the Immigration Judge applied the  243(h) ""more likely than not"" proof standard to her  208(a) asylum claim, holding that she had not established ""a clear probability of persecution,"" and therefore was not entitled to relief.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that  208(a)'s ""well founded fear"" standard is more generous than the  243(h) standard in that it only requires asylum applicants to show either past persecution or ""good reason"" to fear future persecution.  Accordingly, the asylum claim was remanded so that BIA could evaluate it under the proper legal standard.
Held:  The  243(h) ""clear probability"" standard of proof does not govern asylum applications under  208(a).  Pp.  480 U. S. 427-449.
(a) The plain meaning of the statutory language indicates a congressional intent that the proof standards under  208(a) and 243(h) should differ.  Section 243(h)'s ""would be threatened"" standard has no subjective component, but, in fact, requires objective evidence that it is more likely than not that the alien will be subject to persecution upon deportation.  In contrast,  208(a)'s reference to ""fear"" makes the asylum eligibility determination turn to some extent on the alien's subjective mental state, and the fact that the fear must be ""well founded"" does not transform the standard into a ""more likely than not"" one.  Moreover, the different emphasis of the two standards is highlighted by the fact that, although Congress simultaneously drafted  208(a)'s new standard and amended  243(h), it left  243(h)'s old standard intact.  Pp.  480 U. S. 430-432. 
Page 480 U. S. 422

(b) The legislative history demonstrates the congressional intent that different standards apply under  208(a) and 243(h).  Pp.  480 U. S. 432-443.
(c) The argument of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that it is anomalous for  208(a) to have a less stringent eligibility standard than  243(h), since  208(a) affords greater benefits than  243(h), fails, because it does not account for the fact that an alien who satisfies the  208(a) standard must still face a discretionary asylum decision by the Attorney General, while an alien satisfying  243(h)'s stricter standard is automatically entitled to withholding of deportation.  Pp.  480 U. S. 443-445.
(d) The INS's argument that substantial deference should be accorded BIA's position that the ""well founded fear"" and ""clear probability"" standards are equivalent is unpersuasive, since the narrow legal question of identicality is a pure question of statutory construction within the traditional purview of the courts, and is not a question of case-by-case interpretation of the type traditionally left to administrative agencies.

(c) The argument of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that it is anomalous for  208(a) to have a less stringent eligibility standard than  243(h), since  208(a) affords greater benefits than  243(h), fails, because it does not account for the fact that an alien who satisfies the  208(a) standard must still face a discretionary asylum decision by the Attorney General, while an alien satisfying  243(h)'s stricter standard is automatically entitled to withholding of deportation.  Pp.  480 U. S. 443-445.
(d) The INS's argument that substantial deference should be accorded BIA's position that the ""well founded fear"" and ""clear probability"" standards are equivalent is unpersuasive, since the narrow legal question of identicality is a pure question of statutory construction within the traditional purview of the courts, and is not a question of case-by-case interpretation of the type traditionally left to administrative agencies.

No. 85-1092
Argued November 10, 1986
Decided March 9, 1987
480 U.S. 470

Syllabus 
Section 4 of Pennsylvania's Bituminous Mine Subsidence and Land Conservation Act (Act) prohibits coal mining that causes subsidence damage to preexisting public buildings, dwellings, and cemeteries.  Implementing regulations issued by Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Resources (DER) require 50% of the coal beneath  4-protected structures to be kept in place to provide surface support, and extend  4's protection to watercourses.  Section 6 of the Act authorizes the DER to revoke a mining permit if the removal of coal causes damage to a  4-protected structure or area and the operator has not within six months repaired the damage, satisfied any claim arising therefrom, or deposited the sum that repairs will reasonably cost as security.  Petitioners, who own or control substantial coal reserves under Act-protected property, filed suit in Federal District Court seeking to enjoin the DER from enforcing the Act and regulations.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that Pennsylvania recognizes a separate ""support estate"" in addition to the surface and mineral estates in land; that approximately 90% of the coal petitioners will mine was severed from surface estates between 1890 and 1920; that petitioners typically acquired waivers of any damages claims that might result from coal removal; that  4, as implemented by the 50% rule, and  6 violate the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause; and that  6 violates Article I's Contracts Clause.  Because petitioners had not yet alleged or proved any specific injury caused by the enforcement of  4 and 6 or the regulations, the only question before the District Court was whether the mere enactment of  4 and 6 and the regulations constituted a taking.  The District Court granted DER's motion for summary judgment on this facial challenge.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, does not control; that the Act does not effect a taking; and that the impairment of private contracts effectuated by the Act was justified by the public interests protected by the Act. 
Page 480 U. S. 471

Held:
1. Petitioners have not satisfied their burden of showing that  4 and 6 and the regulations' 50% rule constitute a taking of private property without compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pennsylvania Coal does not control this case, because the two factors there considered relevant -- the Commonwealth's interest in enacting the law and the extent of the alleged taking -- here support the Act's constitutionality.  Pp.  480 U. S. 481-502.
(a) Unlike the statute considered in Pennsylvania Coal, the Act is intended to serve genuine, substantial, and legitimate public interests in health, the environment, and the fiscal integrity of the area by minimizing damage to surface areas.  None of the indicia of a statute enacted solely for the benefit of private parties identified in Pennsylvania Coal are present here.  Petitioners' argument that  6's remedies are unnecessary to satisfy the Act's public purposes because of the Commonwealth's insurance program that reimburses repair costs is not persuasive, since the public purpose is served by deterring mine operators from causing damage in the first place by making them assume financial responsibility.  Thus, the Commonwealth has merely exercised its police power to prevent activities that are tantamount to public nuisances.  The character of this governmental action leans heavily against finding a taking.  Pp.  480 U. S. 485-493.
(b) The record in this case does not support a finding similar to the one in Pennsylvania Coal that the Act makes it impossible for petitioners to profitably engage in their business, or that there has been undue interference with their investment-backed expectations.  Because this case involves only a facial constitutional challenge, such a finding is necessary to establish a taking.  However, petitioners have never claimed that their mining operations, or even specific mines, have been unprofitable since the Act was passed, nor is there evidence that mining in any specific location affected by the 50% rule has been unprofitable.  In fact, the only relevant evidence is testimony indicating that  4 requires petitioners to leave 27 million tons (less than 2%) of their coal in place.  Petitioners' argument that the Commonwealth has effectively appropriated this coal, since it has no other useful purpose if not mined, fails, because the 27 million tons do not constitute a separate segment of property for taking law purposes.  The record indicates that only 75% of petitioners' underground coal can be profitably mined in any event, and there is no showing that their reasonable ""investment-backed expectations"" have been materially affected by the  4-imposed duty.  Petitioners' argument that the Act constitutes a taking because it entirely destroys the value of their unique support estate also fails.  As a practical matter, the support estate has value only insofar as it is used to exploit another 
Page 480 U. S. 472
 estate.  Thus, the support estate is not a separate segment of property for takings law purposes, since it constitutes just one part of the mine operators' bundle of property rights.  Because petitioners retain the right to mine virtually all the coal in their mineral estates, the burden the Act places on the support estate does not constitute a taking.  Moreover, since there is no evidence as to what percentage of petitioners' support estates, either in the aggregate or with respect to any individual estate, has been affected by the Act, their Takings Clause facial challenge fails.  Pp.  480 U. S. 493-502.
2. Section 6 does not impair petitioners' contractual agreements in violation of Article I,  10, of the Constitution by denying petitioners their right to hold surface owners to their contractual waivers of liability for surface damage.  The Contracts Clause has not been read literally to obliterate valid exercises of the States' police power to protect the public health and welfare.  Here, the Commonwealth has a significant and legitimate public interest in preventing subsidence damage to the  4-protected buildings, cemeteries, and watercourses, and has determined that the imposition of liability on coal companies is necessary to protect that interest.  This determination is entitled to deference, because the Commonwealth is not a party to the contracts in question.  Thus, the impairment of petitioners' right to enforce the generations-old damages waivers is amply justified by the public purposes served by the Act.  Pp.  480 U. S. 502-506.
771 F.2d 707, affirmed.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death by a jury that heard the trial judge indicate that, on the basis of newspaper accounts he had read, he believed petitioner was involved in the crime. Because the judge's statement deprived petitioner of a fair trial, I would grant certiorari in this case. 
 During voir dire, the trial judge stated to the jury: 
 Defense counsel interrupted to object to this comment on petitioner's involvement in the crime. He subsequently made a motion for a mistrial, in which the prosecutor joined. The trial court denied the motion, but delivered a cautionary instruction admonishing the jury to base its verdict only on the evidence introduced at trial. The judge also told the jury, ""[Y]ou must not take any impression from anything I have done or said as to what your decision should be."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 33-34. 
 The Ohio Supreme Court attempted to excuse the remark. The court insisted that ""[t]he judge's comment did not concern [petitioner's] guilt or innocence, but, rather, noted the fact that the news media had reported [ petitioner's] involvement with the crime."" 26 Ohio St.3d, at 96, 497 N.E. 2d 55. This is a ludicrous reading of the statement. How the jury could reasonably have interpreted and applied the comment determines whether it should be considered prejudicial. See, e.g., Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 516-519, 2455-2456 (1978). In this case, the jury could reasonably take the comment at face value, namely, as a statement that, based on what he had read in the newspapers, the judge believed petitioner was a participant in the crime. Before the jury had even heard any the evidence, the judge had effectively become a witness against petitioner. See United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 393, 54 S. Ct. 223, 224 (1933). 
 Moreover, even under the Ohio Supreme Court's dubious interpretation, the judge's comment deprived petitioner of a fair trial. The only legitimate judicial references to pretrial publicity would have been inquiries about exposure to pretrial publicity or warnings [480 U.S. 923 , 925]

No. 85-1277
Argued December 3, 1986
Decided March 3, 1987
480 U.S. 273

Syllabus 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.  794 (Act), provides, inter alia, that no ""otherwise qualified handicapped individual,"" as defined in 29 U.S.C.  706(7), shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in any program receiving federal financial assistance.  Section 706(7)(B) defines ""handicapped individual"" to mean any person who
""(i) has a physical . . . impairment which substantially limits one or more of [his] major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such an impairment.""
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations define ""physical impairment"" to mean, inter alia, any physiological disorder affecting the respiratory system, and define ""major life activities"" to include working.  Respondent was hospitalized for tuberculosis in 1957.  The disease went into remission for the next 20 years, during which time respondent began teaching elementary school in Florida.  In 1977, March, 1978, and November, 1978, respondent had relapses, after the latter two of which she was suspended with pay for the rest of the school year.  At the end of the 1978-1979 school year, petitioners discharged her after a hearing because of the continued recurrence of tuberculosis.  After she was denied relief in state administrative proceedings, she brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging a violation of  504.  The District Court held that she was not a ""handicapped person"" under the Act, but that, even assuming she were, she was not ""qualified"" to teach elementary school.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that persons with contagious diseases are within  504's coverage, and remanded for further findings as to whether respondent was ""otherwise qualified"" for her job.
Held:
1. A person afflicted with the contagious disease of tuberculosis may be a ""handicapped individual"" within the meaning of  504.  Pp.  480 U. S. 280-286.
(a) Respondent is a ""handicapped individual"" as defined in  706 (7)(B) and the HHS regulations.  Her hospitalization in 1957 for a disease that affected her respiratory system and that substantially limited ""one or more of [her] major life activities"" establishes that she has a ""record of . . . impairment.""  Pp.  480 U. S. 280-281. 
Page 480 U. S. 274

(b) The fact that a person with a record of impairment is also contagious does not remove that person from  504's coverage.  To allow an employer to justify discrimination by distinguishing between a disease's contagious effects on others and its physical effects on a patient would be unfair, would be contrary to  706(7)(B)(iii) and the legislative history, which demonstrate Congress' concern about an impairment's effect on others, and would be inconsistent with  504's basic purpose to ensure that handicapped individuals are not denied jobs because of the prejudice or ignorance of others.  The Act replaces such fearful, reflexive reactions with actions based on reasoned and medically sound judgments as to whether contagious handicapped persons are ""otherwise qualified"" to do the job.  Pp.  480 U. S. 281-286.
2. In most cases, in order to determine whether a person handicapped by contagious disease is ""otherwise qualified"" under  504, the district court must conduct an individualized inquiry and make appropriate findings of fact, based on reasonable medical judgments given the state of medical knowledge, about (a) the nature of the risk (e.g., how the disease is transmitted), (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potential harm to third parties), and (d) the probabilities the disease will be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.  In making these findings, courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health officials.  Courts must then determine, in light of these findings, whether any ""reasonable accommodation"" can be made by the employer under the established standards for that inquiry.  Pp.  480 U. S. 287-288.
3. Because the District Court did not make appropriate findings, it is impossible for this Court to determine whether respondent is ""otherwise qualified"" for the job of elementary school teacher, and the case is remanded for additional findings of fact.  Pp.  480 U. S. 288-289.

No. 85-998
Argued January 20, 1987
Decided March 3, 1987
480 U.S. 294

Syllabus 
In 1980, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, having discovered that one Carpenter had bought large quantities of chemicals and equipment used to make controlled substances, placed tracking ""beepers"" in some of the equipment and one of the chemical containers, which, when transported in Carpenter's truck, led the agents to respondent's ranch.  Aerial photographs of the ranch showed the truck backed up to a barn behind the ranch house.  The ranch was completely encircled by a perimeter fence, and contained several interior barbed wire fences, including one around the house approximately 50 yards from the barn, and a wooden fence enclosing the front of the barn, which had an open overhang and locked, waist-high gates.  Without a warrant, officers crossed the perimeter fence, several of the barbed wire fences, and the wooden fence in front of the barn.  They were led there by the smell of chemicals, and, while there, could hear a motor running inside.  They did not enter the barn but stopped at the locked gate and shined a flashlight inside, observing what they took to be a drug laboratory.  They then left the ranch, but entered it twice the next day to confirm the laboratory's presence.  They obtained a search warrant and executed it, arresting respondent and seizing chemicals and equipment, as well as bags of amphetamines they discovered in the house.  After the District Court denied respondent's motion to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, respondent and Carpenter were convicted of conspiracy to manufacture controlled substances and related offenses.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the barn was within the residence's curtilage, and therefore within the Fourth Amendment's protective ambit.
Held:
1. The area near the barn is not within the curtilage of the house for Fourth Amendment purposes.  Extent-of-curtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to the following four factors, at least to the extent that they bear upon whether the area claimed to be curtilage is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home's ""umbrella"" of protection:  (1) the proximity of the area to the home; (2) whether the area is within an enclosure surrounding the home; (3) the nature and uses to which the area is put; and (4) the steps taken 
Page 480 U. S. 295
 by the resident to protect the area from observation by passersby.  Applying the first factor to the instant case, the barn's substantial distance from the fence surrounding the house (50 yards) and from the house itself (60 yards) supports no inference that it should be treated as an adjunct of the house.  Second, the barn did not lie within the fence surrounding the house, which plainly demarks the area that is part and parcel of the house, but stands out as a distinct and separate portion of the ranch.  Third, it is especially significant that the officers possessed objective data indicating that the barn was not being used as part of respondent's home, in that the aerial photographs showed that Carpenter's truck was backed up to the barn, apparently to unload its contents, which included the chemical container, and the officers detected strong chemical odors coming from, and heard a motor running in, the barn.  Fourth, respondent did little to protect the barn area from observation by those standing outside, the ranch's fences being of the type used to corral livestock, not to ensure privacy.  Pp.  480 U. S. 300-303.
2. Respondent's contention that, because the barn is essential to his business, he possessed an expectation of privacy in it and its contents independent from his home's curtilage, is without merit.  Even assuming that the barn could not be entered lawfully without a warrant, respondent's argument ignores the fact that, prior to obtaining the warrant, the officers never entered the barn, but conducted their observations from the surrounding open fields after crossing over respondent's ranch-style fences.  The Court's prior decisions have established that the Government's intrusion upon open fields is not an unreasonable search; that the erection of fences on an open field -- at least of the type involved here -- does not create a constitutionally protected privacy interest; that warrantless naked-eye observation of an area protected by the Fourth Amendment is not unconstitutional; and that shining a flashlight into a protected area, without probable cause to search the area, is permissible.  Pp.  480 U. S. 303-305.

No. 86-1027
Argued December 8, 1986
Decided March 3, 1987
480 U.S. 321

Syllabus 
A bullet fired through the floor of respondent's apartment injured a man on the floor below.  Police entered the apartment to search for the shooter, for other victims, and for weapons, and there seized three weapons and discovered a stocking-cap mask.  While there, one of the policemen noticed two sets of expensive stereo components and, suspecting that they were stolen, read and recorded their serial numbers -- moving some of them, including a turntable, to do so -- and phoned in the numbers to headquarters.  Upon learning that the turntable had been taken in an armed robbery, he seized it immediately.  Respondent was subsequently indicted for the robbery, but the state trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence that had been seized, and the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed.  Relying upon a statement in Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, that a warrantless search must be ""strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation,"" the Court of Appeals held that the policeman's obtaining the serial numbers violated the Fourth Amendment because it was unrelated to the shooting, the exigent circumstance that justified the initial entry and search.  Both state courts rejected the contention that the policeman's actions were justified under the ""plain view"" doctrine.
Held:
1. The policeman's actions come within the purview of the Fourth Amendment.  The mere recording of the serial numbers did not constitute a ""seizure,"" since it did not meaningfully interfere with respondent's possessory interest in either the numbers or the stereo equipment.  However, the moving of the equipment was a ""search"" separate and apart from the search that was the lawful objective of entering the apartment.  The fact that the search uncovered nothing of great personal value to respondent is irrelevant.  Pp.  480 U. S. 324-325.
2. The ""plain view"" doctrine does not render the search ""reasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  480 U. S. 325-329.
(a) The policeman's action directed to the stereo equipment was not ipso facto unreasonable simply because it was unrelated to the justification for entering the apartment.  That lack of relationship always exists when the ""plain view"" doctrine applies.  In saying that a warrantless search must be ""strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation,"" Mincey was simply addressing the scope of the primary 
Page 480 U. S. 322
 search itself, and was not overruling the ""plain view"" doctrine by implication.  Pp.  480 U. S. 325-326.
(b) However, the search was invalid because, as the State concedes, the policeman had only a ""reasonable suspicion"" -- i.e., less than probable cause to believe -- that the stereo equipment was stolen.  Probable cause is required to invoke the ""plain view"" doctrine as it applies to seizures.  It would be illogical to hold that an object is seizable on lesser grounds, during an unrelated search and seizure, than would have been needed to obtain a warrant for it if it had been known to be on the premises.  Probable cause to believe the equipment was stolen was also necessary to support the search here, whether legal authority to move the equipment could be found only as the inevitable concomitant of the authority to seize it or also as a consequence of some independent power to search objects in plain view.  Pp.  480 U. S. 326-328.
3. The policeman's action cannot be upheld on the ground that it was not a ""full-blown search,"" but was only a ""cursory inspection"" that could be justified by reasonable suspicion instead of probable cause.  A truly cursory inspection -- one that involves merely looking at what is already exposed to view, without disturbing it -- is not a ""search"" for Fourth Amendment purposes, and therefore does not even require reasonable suspicion.  This Court is unwilling to create a subcategory of ""cursory"" searches under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  480 U. S. 328-329.

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA,
FIFTH DISTRICT
After 2 1/2 years, appellant informed her employer that she was joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church and that, for religious reasons, she would no longer be able to work at the employer's jewelry store on her Sabbath.  When she refused to work scheduled shifts on Friday evenings and Saturdays, she was discharged.  She then filed a claim for unemployment compensation, which was denied by a claims examiner for ""misconduct connected with [her] work"" under the applicable Florida statute, and the Unemployment Appeals Commission (Appeals Commission) affirmed.  The Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed the Appeals Commission's order.
Held:  Florida's refusal to award unemployment compensation benefits to appellant violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398; Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707.
(a) When a State denies receipt of a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, that denial must be subjected to strict scrutiny, and can be justified only by proof of a compelling state interest.  The Appeals Commission did not seriously contend that its infringement could withstand strict scrutiny, and there is no merit to its contention that justification for the infringement should be determined under the less rigorous standard of demonstrating that the challenged requirement for governmental benefits was a reasonable means of promoting a legitimate public interest.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
In 1972, upon finding that, for almost four decades, the Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department) had systematically excluded blacks from employment as state troopers in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court issued an order imposing a hiring quota and requiring the Department to refrain from engaging in discrimination in its employment practices, including promotions.  By 1979, no blacks had attained the upper ranks of the Department.  The court therefore approved a partial consent decree in which the Department agreed to develop within one year a procedure for promotion to corporal that would have no adverse impact on blacks and would comply with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Guidelines), and thereafter to develop similar procedures for the other upper ranks (1979 Decree).  As of 1981, however, more than a year after the 1979 Decree's deadline, no black troopers had been promoted.  The court approved a second consent decree in which the parties agreed that the Department's proposed corporal promotion test would be administered to applicants, that the results would be reviewed to determine any adverse impact on blacks under the Guidelines, that the determination of a procedure would be submitted to the court if the parties were unable to agree thereon, and that no promotions would occur until the parties agreed or the court ruled upon the promotion method to be used (1981 Decree).  Of the 60 blacks to whom the test was administered, only 5 (8.3%) were listed in the top half of the promotional register, and the highest ranked black was number 80.  The Department then declared that it had an immediate need for between 8 and 10 new corporals, and stated its intention to elevate between 16 and 20 individuals before constructing a new list.  The United States objected to any use of the list in making promotions.  In 1983, the District Court held that the test had an adverse impact on blacks, and ordered the Department to submit a plan to promote at least 15 qualified candidates to corporal in a manner that would not have an adverse racial impact.  The Department proposed to promote 4 blacks among the 15 new corporals, but the court rejected that proposal and ordered that ""for a period of time,"" at least 50% of those promoted to corporal must be black, if qualified black candidates were available, and imposed a 50% promotional requirement in the other upper ranks, but only 
Page 480 U. S. 150
 if there were qualified black candidates, if a particular rank were less than 25% black, and if the Department had not developed and implemented a promotion plan without adverse impact for the relevant rank.

No. 85-999
Argued November 12, 1986
Decided February 25, 1987
480 U.S. 149

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
In 1972, upon finding that, for almost four decades, the Alabama Department of Public Safety (Department) had systematically excluded blacks from employment as state troopers in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court issued an order imposing a hiring quota and requiring the Department to refrain from engaging in discrimination in its employment practices, including promotions.  By 1979, no blacks had attained the upper ranks of the Department.  The court therefore approved a partial consent decree in which the Department agreed to develop within one year a procedure for promotion to corporal that would have no adverse impact on blacks and would comply with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Guidelines), and thereafter to develop similar procedures for the other upper ranks (1979 Decree).  As of 1981, however, more than a year after the 1979 Decree's deadline, no black troopers had been promoted.  The court approved a second consent decree in which the parties agreed that the Department's proposed corporal promotion test would be administered to applicants, that the results would be reviewed to determine any adverse impact on blacks under the Guidelines, that the determination of a procedure would be submitted to the court if the parties were unable to agree thereon, and that no promotions would occur until the parties agreed or the court ruled upon the promotion method to be used (1981 Decree).  Of the 60 blacks to whom the test was administered, only 5 (8.3%) were listed in the top half of the promotional register, and the highest ranked black was number 80.  The Department then declared that it had an immediate need for between 8 and 10 new corporals, and stated its intention to elevate between 16 and 20 individuals before constructing a new list.  The United States objected to any use of the list in making promotions.  In 1983, the District Court held that the test had an adverse impact on blacks, and ordered the Department to submit a plan to promote at least 15 qualified candidates to corporal in a manner that would not have an adverse racial impact.  The Department proposed to promote 4 blacks among the 15 new corporals, but the court rejected that proposal and ordered that ""for a period of time,"" at least 50% of those promoted to corporal must be black, if qualified black candidates were available, and imposed a 50% promotional requirement in the other upper ranks, but only 
Page 480 U. S. 150
 if there were qualified black candidates, if a particular rank were less than 25% black, and if the Department had not developed and implemented a promotion plan without adverse impact for the relevant rank.  The Department was also ordered to submit a realistic schedule for the development of promotional procedures for all ranks above the entry level.  Subsequently, the Department promoted eight blacks and eight whites under the court's order, and submitted its proposed corporal and sergeant promotional procedures, at which times the court suspended the 50% requirement for those ranks.  The United States appealed the court's order on the ground that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the order.

No. 85-1708
Argued December 9, 1986
Decided February 25, 1987
480 U.S. 202

Syllabus 
Appellee Indian Tribes (the Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians) occupy reservations in Riverside County, Cal.  Each Band, pursuant to its federally approved ordinance, conducts on its reservation bingo games that are open to the public.  The Cabazon Band also operates a card club for playing draw poker and other card games.  The gambling games are open to the public, and are played predominantly by non-Indians coming onto the reservations.  California sought to apply to the Tribes its statute governing the operation of bingo games.  Riverside County also sought to apply its ordinance regulating bingo, as well as its ordinance prohibiting the playing of draw poker and other card games.  The Tribes instituted an action for declaratory relief in Federal District Court, which entered summary judgment for the Tribes, holding that neither the State nor the county had any authority to enforce its gambling laws within the reservations.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although state laws may be applied to tribal Indians on their reservations if Congress has expressly consented, Congress has not done so here either by Pub. L. 280 or by the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA).  Pp.  480 U. S. 207-214.
(a) In Pub.L. 280, the primary concern of which was combating lawlessness on reservations, California was granted broad criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians within all Indian country within the State but more limited, nonregulatory civil jurisdiction.  When a State seeks to enforce a law within an Indian reservation under the authority of Pub.L. 280, it must be determined whether the state law is criminal in nature, and thus fully applicable to the reservation, or civil in nature and applicable only as it may be relevant to private civil litigation in state court.  There is a fair basis for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that California's statutes which permits bingo games to be conducted only by certain types of organizations under certain restrictions, is not a ""criminal/prohibitory"" statute falling within Pub.L. 280's grant of criminal jurisdiction, but instead is a ""civil/regulatory"" statute not authorized by Pub.L. 280 to be enforced on Indian reservations.  That an otherwise regulatory law is enforceable (as here) by 
Page 480 U. S. 203
 criminal as well as civil means does not necessarily convert it into a criminal law within Pub.L. 280's meaning.
(b) Enforcement of OCCA, which makes certain violations of state and local gambling laws violations of federal criminal law, is an exercise of federal, rather than state, authority.  There is nothing in OCCA indicating that the States are to have any part in enforcing the federal laws or are authorized to make arrests on Indian reservations that, in the absence of OCCA, they could not effect. California may not make arrests on reservations and thus, through OCCA, enforce its gambling laws against Indian tribes.  Pp.  480 U. S. 207-212.
2. Even though not expressly authorized by Congress, state and local laws may be applied to on-reservation activities of tribes and tribal members under certain circumstances.  The decision in this case turns on whether state authority is preempted by the operation of federal law.  State jurisdiction is preempted if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law, unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority.  The federal interests in Indian self-government, including the goal of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency and economic development, are important, and federal agencies, acting under federal laws, have sought to implement them by promoting and overseeing tribal bingo and gambling enterprises.  Such policies and actions are of particular relevance in this case, since the tribal games provide the sole source of revenues for the operation of the tribal governments, and are the major sources of employment for tribal members.  To the extent that the State seeks to prevent all bingo games on tribal lands while permitting regulated off-reservation games, the asserted state interest in preventing the infiltration of the tribal games by organized crime is irrelevant, and the state and county laws are preempted.  Even to the extent that the State and county seek to regulate short of prohibition, the laws are preempted, since the asserted state interest is not sufficient to escape the preemptive force of the federal and tribal interests apparent in this case.  Pp.  480 U. S. 214-222.

No. 85-6461
Argued December 2, 1986
Decided February 25, 1987
480 U.S. 228

Syllabus 
Under the Ohio Revised Code (Code), the burden of proving the elements of a criminal offense is upon the prosecution, but, for an affirmative defense, the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is placed on the accused.  Self-defense is an affirmative defense under Ohio law, and therefore must be proved by the defendant.  Petitioner was charged by Ohio with aggravated murder, which is defined as ""purposely, and with prior calculation and design, causing the death of another.""  She pleaded self-defense, and testified that she had shot and killed her husband when he came at her following an argument during which he had struck her.  As to the crime itself, the jury was instructed (1) that, to convict, it must find, in light of all the evidence, that each of the elements of aggravated murder was proved by the State beyond reasonable doubt, and that the burden of proof with respect to those elements did not shift; and (2) that, to find guilt, it must be convinced that none of the evidence, whether offered by the State or by petitioner in connection with her self-defense plea, raised a reasonable doubt that she had killed her husband, that she had the specific purpose and intent to cause his death, or that she had done so with prior calculation and design.  However, as to self-defense, the jury was instructed that it could acquit if it found by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner had proved (1) that she had not precipitated the confrontation with her husband; (2) that she honestly believed she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that her only means of escape was to use force; and (3) that she had satisfied any duty to retreat or avoid danger.  The jury found her guilty, and both the Ohio Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's Due Process Clause challenge, which was based on the charge's placing on her the self-defense burden of proof.  In reaching its decision, the State Supreme Court relied on Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197.
Held:
1. Neither Ohio law nor the above instructions violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by shifting to petitioner the State's burden of proving the elements of the crime.  The instructions, when read as a whole, do not improperly suggest that self-defense evidence could not be considered in determining whether there was reasonable doubt about the sufficiency of the State's proof of the crime's elements.  
Page 480 U. S. 229
 Furthermore, simply because evidence offered to support self-defense might negate a purposeful killing by prior calculation and design does not mean that elements of the crime and self-defense impermissibly overlap, since evidence creating a reasonable doubt about any fact necessary for a finding of guilt could easily fall far short of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, but, on the other hand, a killing will be excused if self-defense is satisfactorily established even if there is no reasonable doubt in the jury's mind that the defendant is guilty.  Pp.  480 U. S. 233-234.
2. It is not a violation of the Due Process Clause for Ohio to place the burden of proving self-defense on a defendant charged with committing aggravated murder.  There is no merit to petitioner's argument that it is necessary under Ohio law for the State to disprove self-defense, since both unlawfulness and criminal intent are elements of serious offenses, while self-defense renders lawful that which would otherwise be a crime, and negates a showing of criminal intent.  The Court will follow Ohio courts that have rejected this argument, holding that unlawfulness in such cases is the conduct satisfying the elements of aggravated murder, and that the necessary mental state for this crime is the specific purpose to take life pursuant to prior calculation and design.  Furthermore, the mere fact that all but two States have abandoned the common law rule that affirmative defenses, including self-defense, must be proved by the defendant does not render that rule unconstitutional.  The Court will follow Patterson and other of its decisions which allowed States to fashion their own affirmative defense burden of proof rules.  Pp.  480 U. S. 235-236

480 U.S. 245

Syllabus 
The Pole Attachments Act (Act) empowers the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the absence of parallel state regulation, to determine ""just and reasonable"" rates that utility companies may charge cable television systems for using utility poles as the physical medium for stringing television cable (47 U.S.C.  224(b)(1)).  The Act, in effect, also provides a range of reasonableness within which the FCC may set rates when it indicates that a minimum reasonable rate is equivalent to the marginal cost of providing pole attachments, while the maximum reasonable rate is determined by computing the fully allocated cost of the construction and operation of each pole to which cable is attached (47 U.S.C.  224(d)(1)).  Upon the complaints of three cable operators alleging that the yearly per-pole attachment rentals charged them by appellee Florida Power Corporation -- $7.15, $6.24, and $5.50, respectively -- were unreasonable, the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau issued orders reforming each of the pole attachment agreements to provide for yearly rents of $1.79 per pole.  These orders were upheld by the FCC, which rejected appellee's constitutional arguments under the Takings and Due Process Clauses.  However, on review, the Court of Appeals held that the Act violated the Fifth Amendment.  The court first concluded that the Act authorized a permanent physical occupation of property, constituting a per se taking for which compensation must be paid under Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419.  The court then struck down the Act under the Fifth Amendment on the ground that its authorization to the FCC to make initial rate determinations under prescribed standards usurped an exclusively judicial function.
Held:
1. The Act does not authorize a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  480 U. S. 250-254.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in applying Loretto's narrow per se rule, since the element of required acquiescence is at the heart of the concept of occupation under Loretto, whereas nothing in the Act, as interpreted 
Page 480 U. S. 246
 by the FCC, requires utility companies to give cable companies space on utility poles or prohibits utility companies from refusing to enter into attachment agreements.  Since the Act clearly contemplates voluntary commercial leases, rather than forced governmental licensing, it merely regulates the economic relations of utility company landlords and cable company tenants, which regulation is not a per se taking under Loretto.  Pp.  480 U. S. 250-253.
(b) The FCC order did not effect a taking under traditional Fifth Amendment standards, which permit governmental regulation of rates chargeable on the use of private property devoted to public purposes so long as the rates set are not confiscatory.  Here, the rate imposed was calculated according to the Act's maximum rate formula, which is not confiscatory since it provides for the recovery of fully allocated costs, including the actual cost of capital.

Certiorari was granted in this case to resolve the question whether, consistently with the decision in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, a municipality can be held liable under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for inadequate training of its employees.  In addressing that issue, this Court anticipated that, under its Rule 21. 1(a), it would be able to reach the ""fairly included"" related question whether more than negligence in training is required in order to establish such liability.  However, in the District Court, petitioner city did not object to the jury instruction stating that gross negligence would suffice, and in fact proposed its own instruction to the same effect.  Nor did it argue for a higher standard than gross negligence in the Court of Appeals.
Held:  The writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.  Although petitioner argues here that a heightened negligence standard does not suffice under Monell's requirement of a municipal policy, this Court ordinarily will not decide questions not raised or litigated in the lower courts, especially where the party seeking to argue the issue has failed to object to a jury instruction, as required by Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  This Court's inability to reach the negligence issue makes this case an inappropriate vehicle for resolving the inadequate training question, because of the close interrelationship between the two matters, and the other questions presented are not of sufficient importance to warrant review independently.  Although there is no jurisdictional bar to this Court's reaching the negligence issue, whether or not the Court of Appeals did so, there would be considerable prudential objection to reversing a judgment because of instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed itself requested.

480 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Certiorari was granted in this case to resolve the question whether, consistently with the decision in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, a municipality can be held liable under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for inadequate training of its employees.  In addressing that issue, this Court anticipated that, under its Rule 21. 1(a), it would be able to reach the ""fairly included"" related question whether more than negligence in training is required in order to establish such liability.  However, in the District Court, petitioner city did not object to the jury instruction stating that gross negligence would suffice, and in fact proposed its own instruction to the same effect.  Nor did it argue for a higher standard than gross negligence in the Court of Appeals.

480 U.S. 9

Syllabus 
Respondent employee (hereafter respondent) of a ranch located on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and owned by Indians, brought suit in Blackfeet Tribal Court seeking compensation from the ranch for personal injuries respondent suffered when the cattle truck he was driving ""jackknifed,"" and seeking compensatory and punitive damages from petitioner, the ranch's insurer, for its alleged bad-faith refusal to settle the personal injury claim.  Upon petitioner's motion to dismiss, the Tribal Court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction, ruling that the Tribe could regulate the conduct of non-Indians engaged in commercial relations with Indians on the reservation.  Without seeking review by the Tribal Court of Appeals, petitioner brought an action in Federal District Court, alleging diversity of citizenship as the basis for federal jurisdiction, and seeking a declaration that petitioner had no duty to defend the ranch because respondent's injuries fell outside the applicable insurance policies' coverage.  The District Court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the Federal Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the Tribal Court system should be permitted to initially determine its own jurisdiction, which determination could be reviewed later in federal court.
Held:
1. A federal district court may not exercise diversity jurisdiction over a dispute before an appropriate Indian tribal court system has first had an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction.  Pp.  480 U. S. 14-20.
(a) The rule announced in National Farmers Union Ins.. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845, requiring exhaustion of tribal remedies, applies here even though National Farmers Union was a federal question case, rather than a diversity case.  Regardless of the basis for jurisdiction, federal policy supporting tribal self-government requires federal courts, as a matter of comity, to stay their hands in order to give tribal courts a full opportunity to first determine their own jurisdiction.  Pp.  480 U. S. 15-16.
(b) At a minimum, the requirement of exhaustion of tribal remedies means that tribal appellate courts must have the opportunity to review lower tribal court determinations.  Here, since petitioner did not obtain appellate review of the Tribal Court's initial determination that it had 
Page 480 U. S. 10
 jurisdiction, the National Farmers Union rule has not been satisfied, and federal courts should not intervene.  Pp.  480 U. S. 16-17.
(c) Nothing in the diversity statute (28 U.S.C. 1332) or its legislative history suggests a congressional intent to override the federal policy of deference to tribal courts, and, in the absence of any indication of such an intent, civil jurisdiction over the activities of non-Indians on reservation lands presumptively lies in tribal courts.  Pp.  480 U. S. 17-18.
(d) Petitioner's contention that local bias and incompetence on the part of tribal courts justify the exercise of federal jurisdiction is without merit, since incompetence is not among National Farmers Union's exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, and would be contrary to the congressional policy promoting tribal courts' development, and since the Indian Civil Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. 1302, protects non-Indians against unfair treatment in tribal courts.  Pp.  480 U. S. 18-19.
2. Although a final determination of jurisdiction by the Blackfeet Tribal Courts will be subject to review in federal court, relitigation of any Tribal Court resolution of respondent's bad-faith claim will be precluded by the proper deference owed the tribal court system, unless a federal court determines that the Tribal Court, in fact, lacked jurisdiction.  P.  480 U. S. 19.
3. The Federal Court of Appeals erred in affirming the District Court's dismissal of petitioner's suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and, on remand, the District Court should consider whether that suit should be stayed pending further tribal court proceedings or dismissed under National Farmers Union's prudential rule.

480 U.S. 23

Syllabus 
For most of 1978, respondent devoted 60 to 80 hours per week to parimutuel wagering on dog races with a view to earning a living from such activity, had no other employment, and gambled solely for his own account.  His efforts generated gross winnings of $70,000 on bets of $72,032, for a net gambling loss for the year of $2,032.  Although he reported this loss on his 1978 tax return, he did not utilize it in computing his adjusted gross income or claim it as a deduction.  Upon audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1964 (Code) as it existed in 1978, respondent was subject to a minimum tax because part of the gambling loss deduction to which he was entitled was an ""ite[m] of tax preference.""  Under the Code, such items could be lessened by certain deductions that were ""attributable to a trade or business carried on by the taxpayer.""  In redetermining respondent's tax deficiency, the Tax Court held that he was in the ""trade or business"" of gambling, so that no part of his gambling losses was an item of tax preference subjecting him to a minimum tax for 1978.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A full-time gambler who makes wagers solely for his own account is engaged in a ""trade or business"" within the meaning of Code 162(a) and 62(1).  Pp.  480 U. S. 27-36.

No. 85-1347
Argued Dec. 3, 1986
Decided Feb. 24, 1987
480 U.S. 39

Syllabus 
Respondent was charged with various sexual offenses against his minor daughter.  The matter was referred to the Children and Youth Services (CYS), a protective service agency established by Pennsylvania to investigate cases of suspected child mistreatment and neglect.  During pretrial discovery, respondent served CYS with a subpoena, seeking access to the records related to the immediate charges, as well as certain earlier records compiled when CYS investigated a separate report that respondent's children were being abused.  CYS refused to comply with the subpoena, claiming that the records were privileged under a Pennsylvania statute which provides that all CYS records must be kept confidential, subject to specified exceptions.  One of the exceptions is that CYS may disclose reports to a ""court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a court order.""  At an in-chambers hearing in the trial court, respondent argued that he was entitled to the information because the CYS file might contain the names of favorable witnesses, as well as other unspecified exculpatory evidence.  Although the trial judge did not examine the entire CYS file, he refused to order disclosure.  At the trial, which resulted in respondent's conviction by a jury, the main witness against him was his daughter, who was cross-examined at length by defense counsel.  On appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held that the failure to disclose the daughter's statements contained in the CYS file violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  The court vacated the conviction and remanded for further proceedings to determine whether a new trial should be granted.  On the State's appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that, by denying access to the CYS file, the trial court order had violated both the Confrontation and the Compulsory Process Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, and that the conviction must be vacated and the case remanded to determine if a new trial was necessary.  The court concluded that defense counsel was entitled to review the entire file for any useful evidence.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.
509 Pa. 357, 502 A. 2d 148, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II, III-B, III-C, and IV, concluding that: 
Page 480 U. S. 40

1. This Court does not lack jurisdiction on the ground that the decision below is not a ""final judgment or decree,"" as required by 28 U.S.C. 1257(3).  Although this Court has no jurisdiction to review an interlocutory judgment, jurisdiction is proper where a federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had whatever the ultimate outcome of the case.  Here, the Sixth Amendment issue will not survive for this Court to review, regardless of the outcome of the proceedings on remand.  The Sixth Amendment issue has been finally decided by the highest court of Pennsylvania, and unless this Court reviews that decision, the harm that the State seeks to avoid -- the disclosure of the confidential file -- will occur regardless of the result on remand.  Pp.  480 U. S. 47-50.
2. Criminal defendants have the right under the Compulsory Process Clause to the government's assistance in compelling the attendance of favorable witnesses at trial and the right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.  However, this Court has never held that the Clause guarantees the right to discover the identity of witnesses, or to require the government to produce exculpatory evidence.  Instead, claims such as respondent's traditionally have been evaluated under the broader protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Compulsory process provides no greater protections in this area than those afforded by due process, and thus respondent's claims more properly are considered by reference to due process.  Pp.  480 U. S. 55-56.
3. Under due process principles, the government has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.  Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Although the public interest in protecting sensitive information such as that in CYS records is strong, this interest does not necessarily prevent disclosure in all circumstances.  Because the Pennsylvania Legislature contemplated some use of CYS records in judicial proceedings, there is no reason to believe that relevant information would not be disclosed when a court of competent jurisdiction determined that the information was ""material"" to the accused's defense.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court thus properly ordered a remand for further proceedings.  Respondent is entitled to have the CYS file reviewed by the trial court to determine whether it contains information that probably would have changed the outcome of his trial.  If it does, he must be given a new trial.  If the CYS file contains no such information, or if the nondisclosure is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court will be free to reinstate the prior conviction.  Pp.  480 U. S. 57-58. 
Page 480 U. S. 41

4. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court erred in holding that defense counsel must be allowed to examine the confidential information.  A defendant's right to discover exculpatory evidence does not include the unsupervised authority to search the State's files and make the determination as to the materiality of the information.  Both respondent's and the State's interests in ensuring a fair trial can be protected fully by requiring that the CYS files be submitted only to the trial court for in camera review.  To allow full disclosure to defense counsel in this type of case would sacrifice unnecessarily the State's compelling interest in protecting its child abuse information.  Pp.  480 U. S. 59-61.
JUSTICE POWELL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Part III-A that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court erred in holding that the failure to disclose the CYS file violated the Confrontation Clause.  There is no merit to respondent's claim that, by denying him access to the information necessary to prepare his defense, the trial court interfered with his right of cross-examination guaranteed by the Clause.  Respondent argued that he could not effectively question his daughter because, without the CYS material, he did not know which types of questions would best expose the weaknesses in her testimony.  However, the Confrontation Clause is not a constitutionally compelled rule of pretrial discovery.  The right of confrontation is a trial right, guaranteeing an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way and to whatever extent the defense might wish.  Pp.  480 U. S. 51-54.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the Confrontation Clause may be relevant to limitations placed on a defendant's pretrial discovery.  There may well be a confrontation violation if, as here, a defendant is denied pretrial access to information that would make possible effective cross-examination of a crucial prosecution witness.  A State cannot avoid Confrontation Clause problems simply by deciding to hinder the defendant's right to effective cross-examination, on the basis of a desire to protect the confidentiality interests of a particular class of individuals at the pretrial, rather than at the trial, stage.  However, the procedure the Court has set out for the lower court to follow on remand is adequate to address any confrontation problem.  Pp.  480 U. S. 61-66.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded that the Confrontation Clause may be relevant to limitations placed on a defendant's pretrial discovery.  There may well be a confrontation violation if, as here, a defendant is denied pretrial access to information that would make possible effective cross-examination of a crucial prosecution witness.  A State cannot avoid Confrontation Clause problems simply by deciding to hinder the defendant's right to effective cross-examination, on the basis of a desire to protect the confidentiality interests of a particular class of individuals at the pretrial, rather than at the trial, stage.  However, the procedure the Court has set out for the lower court to follow on remand is adequate to address any confrontation problem.  Pp.  480 U. S. 61-66.

480 U.S. 79

Syllabus 
Baltimore police officers obtained and executed a warrant to search the person of one McWebb and ""the premises known as 2036 Park Avenue third floor apartment"" for controlled substances and related paraphernalia.  The police reasonably believed that there was only one apartment on the described premises, but in fact the third floor was divided into two apartment, one occupied by McWebb and one by respondent.  Before the officers became aware that they were in respondent's apartment, they discovered the contraband that provided the basis for respondent's conviction for violating Maryland's Controlled Substances Act.  The trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress the evidence, and the Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed.  The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.
Held:
1. On the basis of the information that the officers disclosed, or had a duty to discover and to disclose, to the issuing Magistrate, the warrant, insofar as it authorized a search that turned out to be ambiguous in scope, was valid when it issued.  The validity of the warrant must be judged in light of the information available to the officers at the time they obtained the warrant.  The discovery of facts demonstrating that a valid warrant was unnecessarily broad does not retroactively invalidate the warrant.  Pp.  480 U. S. 84-86.
2. The execution of the warrant did not violate respondent's rights under the Fourth Amendment.  The validity of the search of his apartment pursuant to the warrant depends on whether the officers' failure to realize the overbreadth of the warrant was objectively understandable and reasonable, and it unquestionably was.  The objective facts available to the officers at the time suggested no distinction between McWebb's apartment and the third-floor premises.  Whether the premises described in the warrant are interpreted as the entire third floor or as McWebb's apartment, the officers' conduct was consistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the place intended to be searched within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

480 U.S. 102

Syllabus 
Petitioner manufactures tire valve assemblies in Japan and sells them to several tire manufacturers, including Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Co. (Cheng Shin).  The sales to Cheng Shin, which amounted to at least 100,000 assemblies annually from 1978 to 1982, took place in Taiwan, to which the assemblies were shipped from Japan.  Cheng Shin incorporates the assemblies into its finished tires, which it sells throughout the world, including the United States, where 20 percent of its sales take place in California.  Affidavits indicated that petitioner was aware that tires incorporating its assemblies would end up in California, but, on the other hand, that it never contemplated that its sales to Cheng Shin in Taiwan would subject it to lawsuits in California.  Nevertheless, in 1979, a product liability suit was brought in California Superior Court arising from a motorcycle accident allegedly caused by defects in a tire manufactured by Cheng Shin, which in turn filed a cross-complaint seeking indemnification from petitioner.  Although the main suit was eventually settled and dismissed, the Superior Court denied petitioner's motion to quash the summons issued against it.  The State Court of Appeal then ordered that the summons be quashed, but the State Supreme Court reversed, finding that petitioner's intentional act of placing its assemblies into the stream of commerce by delivering them to Cheng Shin in Taiwan, coupled with its awareness that some of them would eventually reach California, were sufficient to support state court jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
39 Cal.3d 35, 702 P.2d 543, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I and II-B, concluding that the state court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over petitioner would be unreasonable and unfair, in violation of the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  480 U. S. 113-116.
(a) The burden imposed on petitioner by the exercise of state court jurisdiction would be severe, since petitioner would be required not only to traverse the distance between Japan and California, but also to submit 
Page 480 U. S. 103
 its dispute with Cheng Shin to a foreign judicial system.  Such unique burdens should have significant weight in assessing the reasonableness of extending personal jurisdiction over national borders.  Pp.  480 U. S. 113-114.
(b) The interests of Cheng Shin and the forum State in the exercise of jurisdiction over petitioner would be slight, and would be insufficient to justify the heavy burdens placed on petitioner.  The only surviving question is whether a Japanese corporation should indemnify a Taiwanese corporation on the bases of a sale made in Taiwan and a shipment of goods from Japan to Taiwan.  The facts do not demonstrate that it would be more convenient for Cheng Shin to litigate its claim in California, rather than in Taiwan or Japan, while California's interests are diminished by Cheng Shin's lack of a California residence and by the fact that the dispute is primarily about indemnity, rather than the safety of consumers.  While the possibility of being sued in California might create an additional deterrent to petitioner's manufacture of unsafe assemblies, the same effect would result from pressures placed on petitioner by Cheng Shin, whose California sales would subject it to state tort law.  Pp.  480 U. S. 114-115.
(c) The procedural and substantive policies of other nations whose interests are affected by the forum State's assertion of jurisdiction over an alien defendant must be taken into account, and great care must be exercised when considering personal jurisdiction in the international context.  Although other nations' interests will differ from case to case, those interests, as well as the Federal Government's interest in its foreign relations policies, will always be best served by a careful inquiry into the reasonableness of the particular assertion of jurisdiction, and an unwillingness to find an alien defendant's serious burdens outweighed where, as here, the interests of the plaintiff and the forum State are minimal.  P.  480 U. S. 115.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE POWELL, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Parts II-A and III that, even assuming, arguendo, that petitioner was aware that some of the assemblies it sold to Cheng Shin would be incorporated into tires sold in California, the facts do not establish minimum contacts sufficient to render the State's exercise of personal jurisdiction consistent with fair play and substantial justice, as required by the Due Process Clause.  Since petitioner does not do business, have an office, agents, employees, or property, or advertise or solicit business in California, and since it did not create, control, or employ the distribution system that brought its assemblies to, or design them in anticipation of sales in, California, it did not engage in any action to purposely avail itself of the California market.  The ""substantial connection"" between a defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must derive from an action purposely directed toward the forum State, and the mere placement of a product 
Page 480 U. S. 104
 into the stream of commerce is not such an act, even if done with an awareness that the stream will sweep the product into the forum State absent additional conduct indicating an intent to serve the forum state market.  Pp.  480 U. S. 108-113, 116.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, agreed with the Court's conclusion in Part II-B that the exercise of jurisdiction over petitioner would not comport with ""fair play and substantial justice,"" but disagreed with Part II-A's interpretation of the stream-of-commerce theory, and with the conclusion that petitioner did not purposely avail itself of the California market.  As long as a defendant is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, jurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce is consistent with the Due Process Clause, and no showing of additional conduct is required.  Here, even though petitioner did not design or control the distribution system that carried its assemblies into California, its regular and extensive sales to a manufacturer it knew was making regular sales of the final product in California were sufficient to establish minimum contacts with California.  Pp.  480 U. S. 116-121.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, agreed that the California Supreme Court's judgment should be reversed for the reasons stated in Part II-B of the Court's opinion, but did not join Part II-A, for the reasons that (1) the Court's holding that the State's exercise of jurisdiction over petitioner would be ""unreasonable and unfair"" alone requires reversal, and renders any examination of minimum contacts unnecessary; and (2) even assuming that the ""purposeful availment"" test should be formulated here, Part II-A misapplies it to the facts of this case, since, in its dealings with Cheng Shin, petitioner has arguably engaged in a higher quantum of conduct than the mere placement of a product into the stream of commerce.  Pp.  480 U. S. 121-122.
O'CONNOR, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Part I, the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II-B, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts II-A and III, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and POWELL and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

Syllabus 
A provision of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C.App.  1513(d)(1), prohibits the imposition of discriminatory state or local property taxes on air carriers.  However,  1513(d)(3) provides that the prohibition does not apply to any ""in lieu tax which is wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes.""  The South Dakota Airline Flight Property Tax, enacted in 1961, is imposed on air carriers on the basis of the value of their aircraft, and provides for allocation of the taxes to the airports used by the carriers, and for use of the taxes exclusively by the airports for airport purposes.  This tax, which is centrally assessed, was an exception from the general state scheme of local property tax assessment at the county level.  In 1978, the State exempted from ad valorem taxation all personal property that was locally, rather than centrally, assessed.  Appellant airline companies paid their flight property taxes in 1983 under protest, unsuccessfully sought refunds from appropriate county and state authorities, and ultimately sought relief on appeals to a South Dakota Circuit Court on the ground that, because airline flight property was subject to taxation, while most other personal property was exempt, the state tax violated 1513(d)(1).  The court consolidated the actions and held that the state tax was permitted under  1513(d)(3).  Although disagreeing with that holding, the South Dakota Supreme Court affirmed on an alternative ground based on its interpretation of other provisions of  1513(d).
Held:  The South Dakota tax is an ""in lieu tax which is wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes"" under  1513(d)(3), and thus does not violate the antidiscrimination provisions of  1513(d).  The question whether a state tax is an ""in lieu tax"" under  1513(d)(3) is one of federal law, and the purpose and effect of the state tax must be examined in light of the policy embodied in the federal law.  Section 1513(d)(3)'s requirement that the state tax be ""wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes"" reflects the federal policy of preventing state and local governments from excessively taxing nonvoting, nonresident businesses in order to subsidize general welfare services for state residents.  The phrase ""in lieu tax"" restricts  1513(d)(3)'s protection to property taxes applied to the exclusion of any other tax on the property -- that is, to 
Page 480 U. S. 124
 taxes applied in lieu of any other possible property tax -- and reinforces the policy reflected in the ""wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes"" phrase.  The South Dakota Airline Flight Property Tax establishes a method of taxing a particular type of property to the exclusion of any other tax on that property.  It therefore stands in lieu of the generally applicable ad valorem property tax that had been assessed on most other commercial and industrial property in the State at the time the airline flight property tax was established.  It is not necessary that, in order to be exempted under  1513(d)(3), the state tax must take the place of another tax that historically had been applied to the airline property.  Pp.  480 U. S. 129-134.

No. 85-899
Argued December 9, 1986
Decided January 27, 1987
479 U.S. 523

Syllabus 
Respondent, while in custody on suspicion of sexual assault, was three times advised by the police of his Miranda rights.  On each occasion, after signing and dating an acknowledgment that he had been given those rights, respondent indicated to the police that he would not make a written statement, but that he was willing to talk about the incident that led to his arrest.  On the second and third such occasions, he added that he would not make a written statement outside the presence of counsel, and then orally admitted his involvement in the sexual assault.  One of the police officers reduced to writing his recollection of respondent's last such statement, and the confession was introduced into evidence at respondent's trial.  The trial court refused to suppress the confession, finding that respondent had fully understood the Miranda warnings and had voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  Respondent's conviction of sexual assault, inter alia, was reversed by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which held that his expressed desire for counsel before making a written statement constituted an invocation of his right to counsel for all purposes, that he had not waived that right by initiating further discussion with the police, and that, therefore, the incriminating statement was improperly admitted into evidence under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477.
Held:  The Constitution did not require suppression of respondent's incriminating statement.  Pp.  479 U. S. 527-530.

			"|"Connecticut v. Barrett
No. 85-899
Argued December 9, 1986
Decided January 27, 1987
479 U.S. 523

Syllabus 
Respondent, while in custody on suspicion of sexual assault, was three times advised by the police of his Miranda rights.  On each occasion, after signing and dating an acknowledgment that he had been given those rights, respondent indicated to the police that he would not make a written statement, but that he was willing to talk about the incident that led to his arrest.  On the second and third such occasions, he added that he would not make a written statement outside the presence of counsel, and then orally admitted his involvement in the sexual assault.  One of the police officers reduced to writing his recollection of respondent's last such statement, and the confession was introduced into evidence at respondent's trial.  The trial court refused to suppress the confession, finding that respondent had fully understood the Miranda warnings and had voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  Respondent's conviction of sexual assault, inter alia, was reversed by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which held that his expressed desire for counsel before making a written statement constituted an invocation of his right to counsel for all purposes, that he had not waived that right by initiating further discussion with the police, and that, therefore, the incriminating statement was improperly admitted into evidence under Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477.
Held:  The Constitution did not require suppression of respondent's incriminating statement.  Pp.  479 U. S. 527-530.
(a) Respondent's statements to the police made clear his willingness to talk about the sexual assault, and, there being no evidence that he was ""threatened, tricked, or cajoled"" into speaking to the police, the trial court properly found that his decision to do so constituted a voluntary waiver of his right to counsel.

Argued December 2, 1986
Decided January 27, 1987
479 U.S. 538

Syllabus 
A jury found respondent guilty of forcible rape and first-degree murder at his California state court trial.  At the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury to consider and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but cautioned that the jury ""must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.""  On automatic appeal, the California Supreme Court reversed respondent's death sentence, holding that the quoted instruction violated federal constitutional law by denying respondent the right to have ""sympathy factors"" raised by the evidence considered by the jury when determining the appropriate penalty.
Held:  The instruction in question does not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when given during the penalty phase of a capital murder trial.  Pp.  479 U. S. 541-543.
(a) The instruction does not violate either of the Eighth Amendment's prerequisites to a valid death sentence that sentencers not be given unbridled discretion and that defendants be allowed to introduce any relevant mitigating evidence.  P.  479 U. S. 541.
(b) The California Supreme Court improperly focused solely on the word ""sympathy"" in the instruction.  A reasonable juror would be unlikely to single out the word ""sympathy"" from the other nouns accompanying it, and would most likely interpret the admonition to avoid basing a decision on ""mere sympathy"" as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy that was not rooted in the aggravating and mitigating evidence introduced during the penalty phase.  Pp.  479 U. S. 541-543.
(c) By limiting the jury's sentencing considerations to record evidence, the instruction serves the useful purpose of cautioning the jury against reliance on extraneous emotional factors, and thereby fosters the Eighth Amendment's need for reliability in death sentence determinations and ensures the availability of meaningful judicial review.

Syllabus 
In February, 1979, respondent and a companion shot and killed one Walker during a hunting trip in Colorado.  Thereafter, based on information received from an informant as to respondent's involvement in the interstate transportation of stolen firearms, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) set up an undercover purchase of firearms from respondent, and on March 30, 1979, arrested him.  After being advised of his Miranda rights, respondent signed a statement that he understood and waived his rights and was willing to answer questions.  The agents then questioned him about the firearms transactions that led to his arrest and also asked him whether he had ever shot anyone, to which he answered that he had ""shot another guy once.""  But when asked whether he had shot a man named Walker, he said ""no.""  On May 26, 1979, Colorado law enforcement officers gave respondent Miranda warnings, and he again signed a statement that he understood his rights and was willing to waive them.  He then confessed to the Colorado murder and signed a statement to that effect.  Upon being charged in a Colorado state court with first-degree murder, respondent moved to suppress both the March 30 and May 26 statements on the ground that his waiver of Miranda rights was invalid.  The trial court held that the ATF agents' failure to inform respondent before the March 30 interview that they would question him about the Colorado murder did not affect the waiver, and that therefore the March 30 statement should not be suppressed.  But, while ruling that the March 30 statement was inadmissible on other grounds, the court held that the May 26 statement was made freely, voluntarily, and intelligently, and should not be suppressed, and hence admitted it in evidence, and respondent was convicted.  The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent's waiver of his Miranda rights before the March 30 statement was invalid because he was not informed that he would be questioned about the Colorado murder, and that the State had failed to prove the May 26 statement was not the product of the prior illegal statement.  The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, holding that respondent's confession to the murder should have been suppressed because it was the illegal ""fruit"" of the March 30 statement. 
Page 479 U. S. 565

Held:  A suspect's awareness of all the crimes about which he may be questioned is not relevant to determining the validity of his decision to waive the Fifth Amendment privilege; accordingly, the ATF agents' failure to inform respondent of the subject matter of the interrogation could not affect his decision to waive that privilege in a constitutionally significant manner.  Pp.  479 U. S. 571-577.
(a) A confession cannot be ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" if the tree itself is not poisonous.  Pp.  479 U. S. 571-572.
(b) Respondent's March 30 decision to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege was voluntary absent evidence that his will was overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired because of coercive police conduct.  His waiver was also knowingly and intelligently made, that is, he understood that he had the right to remain silent and that anything he said could be used as evidence against him.  The Constitution does not require that a suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege.  Here, there was no allegation that respondent failed to understand that privilege or that he misunderstood the consequences of speaking freely.   479 U. S.  573-575.
(c) Mere silence by law enforcement officials as to the subject matter of an interrogation is not ""trickery"" sufficient to invalidate a suspect's waiver of Miranda  rights.  Once Miranda warnings are given, it is difficult to see how official silence could cause a suspect to misunderstand the nature of his constitutional privilege to refuse to answer any questions that might incriminate him.  The additional information in question in this case could affect only the wisdom of a Miranda waiver, not its voluntary and knowing nature.  Pp.  479 U. S. 575-577.

Decided January 21, 1987
479 U.S. 462

Syllabus 
Appellant, an Alabama city that has a long history of racial discrimination and that until recently had an all-white population, is covered by  6 of the Voting Rights Act of 1966 (Act), and accordingly must seek preclearance before instituting any change in a standard, practice, or procedure affecting voting.  Appellant sought approval by the Attorney General for the annexation of two parcels of land, one vacant (hereinafter called the Western Addition) and the other (Glasgow Addition) added at the request of its inhabitants, an extended white family who wished their children to attend appellant's then all-white school system.  The Attorney General objected to the annexations, finding with respect to the Western Addition that appellant's refusal to annex an adjacent black neighborhood (Highlands) was indicative of an intent to annex only white areas.  Pursuant to  5 of the Act, appellant then filed this declaratory action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which denied relief, finding that the Western Addition's location and appellant's plans for relatively expensive housing there indicated that it was likely to be developed for use by white persons only.  The court further found that appellant failed to carry its burden of proving that the annexations at issue did not have the purpose of abridging or denying the right to vote on account of race.
Held:
1. Fundamental principles of the Act, governing this case, are that an annexation of inhabited land constitutes a change in voting practice or procedure subject to preclearance under  5, and even the annexation of vacant land on which residential development is anticipated must be precleared before those moving into the area may vote in the annexing jurisdiction.  Moreover, Congress intended that a voting practice not be precleared unless both discriminatory purpose and effect are absent, and the burden of proving absence of discriminatory purpose and effect is on the covered jurisdiction.  Pp.  479 U. S. 467-469.
2. There is no merit to appellant's contention that the District Court erred in concluding that appellant had not carried its burden of showing that the annexations were untainted by a racially discriminatory purpose.  In arriving at its decision, the District Court relied on a variety of evidence, principally its finding that the refusal to annex the Highlands 
Page 479 U. S. 463
 while annexing other areas was racially motivated, rather than, as appellant asserted, based upon economic considerations.  The court's findings, both as to the purpose of not annexing the Highlands and with respect to the weight of the evidence regarding the purpose of the two annexations at issue, are findings of fact that must be accepted unless clearly erroneous, and appellant has not established that they are clearly erroneous.  Appellant's argument that, even if its decision not to annex the Highlands was racially motivated, such decision was not a change respecting voting, and hence was not subject to  5, is correct, but not dispositive.  The failure to annex black areas while simultaneously annexing nonblack areas is highly significant in demonstrating that appellant's annexations were purposefully designed to perpetuate it as an enlarged enclave of white voters.  Moreover, the contention that, since appellant had no black voters at the time of the annexations, they could not have caused an impermissible effect on black voting, and thus it cannot be concluded that appellant had a discriminatory purpose, is based on the incorrect assumption that an impermissible purpose under  5 can relate only to present circumstances.  Section 5 looks not only to the present effects of changes, but to their future effects as well, and, likewise, an impermissible purpose under  5 may relate to anticipated as well as present circumstances.

No. 86-1233
Argued November 4, 1986
Decided January 21, 1987
479 U.S. 481

Syllabus 
The Clean Water Act (Act) prohibits the discharge of effluents into navigable waters unless the point source has obtained a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Act also allows the State in which the point source is located (the ""source State"") to impose more stringent discharge limitations than the federal ones, and even to administer its own permit program if certain requirements are met.  In contrast, ""affected"" States that are subject to pollution originating in source States have only the right to notice and to comment before the issuance of a federal or source State permit.  The Act also contains a ""saving clause"" consisting of  510, which provides that
""nothing in this chapter shall . . . be construed as impairing . . . any right . . . of the States with respect to the waters (including boundary waters) of such States,""
and  505(e), which states that
""[n]othing in this section shall restrict any right which any person . . . may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief. . . .""
Petitioner operates a paper mill on the New York side of Lake Champlain and, in the course of its business, discharged effluents into the lake through a diffusion pipe that ended shortly before the New York-Vermont border that divided the lake.  Respondents, property owners on the Vermont shore, filed a class action against petitioner in Vermont state court under the Vermont common law of nuisance.  The action was later removed to Federal District Court.  Petitioner moved for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Act preempted respondents' state-1aw suit, but the District Court denied the motion, holding that the Act's saving clause preserves actions to redress interstate water pollution under the law of the State in which the injury occurred.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Act preempts the common law of an affected State to the extent that that law seeks to impose liability on a point source in another State.  Pp.  479 U. S. 487-497.

			"|"International Paper Co. v. Ouellette
No. 86-1233
Argued November 4, 1986
Decided January 21, 1987
479 U.S. 481

Syllabus 
The Clean Water Act (Act) prohibits the discharge of effluents into navigable waters unless the point source has obtained a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Act also allows the State in which the point source is located (the ""source State"") to impose more stringent discharge limitations than the federal ones, and even to administer its own permit program if certain requirements are met.  In contrast, ""affected"" States that are subject to pollution originating in source States have only the right to notice and to comment before the issuance of a federal or source State permit.  The Act also contains a ""saving clause"" consisting of  510, which provides that
""nothing in this chapter shall . . . be construed as impairing . . . any right . . . of the States with respect to the waters (including boundary waters) of such States,""
and  505(e), which states that
""[n]othing in this section shall restrict any right which any person . . . may have under any statute or common law to seek enforcement of any effluent standard or limitation or to seek any other relief. . . .""
Petitioner operates a paper mill on the New York side of Lake Champlain and, in the course of its business, discharged effluents into the lake through a diffusion pipe that ended shortly before the New York-Vermont border that divided the lake.  Respondents, property owners on the Vermont shore, filed a class action against petitioner in Vermont state court under the Vermont common law of nuisance.  The action was later removed to Federal District Court.  Petitioner moved for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the Act preempted respondents' state-1aw suit, but the District Court denied the motion, holding that the Act's saving clause preserves actions to redress interstate water pollution under the law of the State in which the injury occurred.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The Act preempts the common law of an affected State to the extent that that law seeks to impose liability on a point source in another State.  Pp.  479 U. S. 487-497.
(a) Since the Act applies to all point sources and virtually all bodies of water, sets forth detailed procedures for obtaining a permit, and provides an elaborate set of remedies for its violation, it is sufficiently comprehensive

No. 85-129
Argued December 9, 1986
Decided January 21, 1987
479 U.S. 511

Syllabus 
Petitioner, who had been on pregnancy leave from her employment pursuant to the employer's policy that she would be rehired only if a position was available when she was ready to return to work, was told when she notified the employer that she wanted to return to work that there were no positions open.  She then filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the Missouri Division of Employment Security, which denied the claim pursuant to a Missouri statute that disqualifies a claimant who ""has left his work voluntarily without good cause attributable to his work or to his employer.""  After the denial was upheld on administrative appeal, petitioner sought review in a Missouri Circuit Court, which held that the Missouri statute was inconsistent with the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C.  3304(a)(12).  The federal statute provides that no State, such as Missouri, participating in the federal-state unemployment compensation program shall deny any compensation ""solely on the basis of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy.""  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed.
Held:  The Missouri statute is consistent with the federal statute.  The plain import of  3304(a)(12)'s language is that Congress intended only to prohibit States from singling out pregnancy for unfavorable treatment, and not to mandate preferential treatment.  This is confirmed by both the legislative history and the Labor Department's interpretation of the statute.  The focus of the statutory language is on the State's treatment of pregnancy, not the claimant's reason for leaving her job.  To apply the Missouri statute, under which all persons who leave work for reasons not causally connected to the work or the employer are disqualified from receiving benefits, it is not necessary to know that petitioner left because of pregnancy.  All that is relevant is that she stopped work for a reason having no causal connection to her work or her employer.  Under the State's unemployment compensation scheme, pregnancy was not the ""sole basis"" for the decision under a natural reading of  3304(a)(12)'s language.  Pp.  479 U. S. 514-522.

Syllabus 
Section 3505 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1964 (Code) provides that persons such as lenders, who are not employers but who directly or indirectly pay employees' wages, will be personally liable for all or a portion of ""a sum equal to"" any Social Security and income taxes that are not withheld from the wages and paid to the Government as required by Subtitle C of the Code.  Code  6303(a) requires the Government, within 60 days of making an assessment of unpaid taxes, to notify ""each person liable for the unpaid tax"" of the amount of the assessment, and to make a demand for payment.  Without first giving a  6303(a) notice, the Government brought suit against petitioner in Federal District Court seeking a determination that it was liable under  3505 for amounts reflecting unpaid taxes required to be withheld from wages paid to employees of a third-party employer.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, holding that a  6303(a) notice was required.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 6303(a) does not require the Government to provide notice and a demand for payment to a lender before bringing a civil suit to collect sums for which the lender is liable under  3505.  Pp.  479 U. S. 446-449.
(a) Section 6303(a)'s description of an assessment notice recipient as a person ""liable for the unpaid tax"" does not clearly include a  3505 third-party lender, who is liable for all or part of ""a sum equal to"" the unpaid taxes.  Pp.  479 U. S. 446.
(b) Compliance with  6303(a)'s requirements that the notice ""stat[e] the amount"" assessed and ""deman[d] payment thereof "" would frequently have little meaning to lenders in  3505 cases, since the amount stated and demanded (1) could include the employer's share of unpaid Social Security taxes, for which the lender is not liable; (2) could equal the lender's liability only if the lender provided payroll financing throughout the period covered by the assessment; and (3) would rarely be accurate for a lender liable only under  3505(b), which limits exposure to 25% of the funds loaned to the employer.  Pp.  479 U. S. 446-447.
(c) It would not be fundamentally unfair to require the Government to provide  6303(a) notice to delinquent employers but not to lenders in  3505 cases, since employers, who are subject to summary collection procedures soon after unpaid employment taxes are assessed, have a far 
Page 479 U. S. 443
 greater need for such a notice than third-party lenders, upon whom liability can be imposed only after a civil suit.  Pp.  479 U. S. 447-448.
(d) A third-party lender would not be unfairly prejudiced by lack of a  6303(a) notice even if, as contended by petitioner, a timely assessment under  6501(a) would trigger an additional 6-year limitation period under  6502(a)(1) for a collection suit against the lender, since, as  3505's legislative history suggests, Congress envisioned a system in which third-party lenders would take their potential  3505 liability into consideration by including the amount of potential withholding liability in their loans and taking adequate security, and since, even without a  6303(a) notice, a prudent lender may be alerted to its  3505 liability at the time it engages in ""net payroll financing,"" e.g., providing funds to the employer for wages, but not for withholding taxes.

Syllabus 
Since the 1930's, railroads, motor carriers, and freight forwarders have offered both trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) and container-on-flatcar (COFC) services, forms of mixed train and truck transportation whereby loaded truck trailers or containers to be placed on truck trailers are transported on railroad flatcars and then hauled by trucks on the highways.  A provision of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, 49 U.S.C. 10505(f), authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to exempt from state regulation ""transportation that is provided by a rail carrier as a part of a continuous intermodal movement.""  In 1981, the ICC adopted a regulation exempting from state regulation, and covering both the motor and rail portions of, ""Plan II TOFC/COFC service,"" which involves door-to-door service by a railroad that moves its own trailers or containers on flatcars.  In 1982, petitioner railroad companies petitioned the Texas Railroad Commission to apply the ICC's exemption to Texas intrastate TOFC/COFC traffic.  The State Commission granted a partial exemption covering the rail portion, but not the truck portion, of intrastate Plan II service.  The railroad companies then petitioned for review of that decision by the ICC, which held that the State Commission's assertion of regulatory jurisdiction over the truck portion of Plan II service was inconsistent with the ICC's 1981 regulation.  On review of the ICC's order, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the truck portion of the intrastate movements at issue was not ""transportation . . . provided by a rail carrier"" within the meaning of  10505(f), but rather was ""transportation provided by a motor carrier"" within the meaning of 49 U.S.C.  10521(b)(1), which reserves such intrastate transportation for state regulation.
Held:  The grant of authority to the ICC under 10505(f) encompasses the motor freight portion of a Plan II shipment entirely within the State.  Since all of the elements of the Plan II service at issue are provided on equipment owned and operated by a rail carrier over which the ICC has jurisdiction, the plain language of  10505(f) unambiguously supports 
Page 479 U. S. 451
 the ICC's position.  Although  10521(b)(1) can be read to support a contrary result, the correct, and more natural, reading of the statute is that all of the Plan II service provided by interstate rail carriers on equipment that they own is ""transportation provided by a rail carrier"" subject to the ICC's  10505(f) jurisdiction.  A contrary result would be inconsistent with the ICC's historical treatment of Plan II service as ""provided by a railroad,"" and would make  10521(b)(1) authorize state regulation of TOFC/COFC services in areas where it has already been rejected.  Moreover, the ICC's special statutory authority to determine the proper interrelationship of different modes of transportation supports its interpretation of the Staggers Rail Act.  In its statement of rail transportation policy, Congress has unambiguously expressed its interest in allowing free competition, to the maximum extent possible, to govern the financial health of the railroad industry.

Syllabus 
Congress passed a bill conditioning the continuance of military aid to El Salvador upon the President's semiannual certification of that nation's progress in protecting human rights.  The President neither signed the bill nor returned it to the House of Representatives where it had originated, claiming that, since Congress had in the meantime adjourned, the bill had been subjected to a ""pocket veto.""  Respondent Members of the House then filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court, challenging the purported ""pocket veto.""  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the bill had become law despite the President's effort to ""pocket veto"" it, but the bill expired by its own terms a few weeks later.
Held:  The case is moot.  Article III requires that there be a live case or controversy at the time a federal court decides the case; it is not enough that there may have been a live case or controversy when the case was decided by the court whose judgment this Court is reviewing.  Here, any issues as to whether the bill in question became law were mooted when it expired by its own terms, regardless of whether it had been previously enacted into law or not.  Any controversy over petitioner Acting Archivist's failure to publish the bill in the Statutes at Large as a duly enacted law or any dispute as to accounting obligations relating to the expenditure of funds under the bill is not sufficient to keep the case from being moot.

Syllabus 
Congress passed a bill conditioning the continuance of military aid to El Salvador upon the President's semiannual certification of that nation's progress in protecting human rights.  The President neither signed the bill nor returned it to the House of Representatives where it had originated, claiming that, since Congress had in the meantime adjourned, the bill had been subjected to a ""pocket veto.""  Respondent Members of the House then filed suit against petitioners in Federal District Court, challenging the purported ""pocket veto.""  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the bill had become law despite the President's effort to ""pocket veto"" it, but the bill expired by its own terms a few weeks later.
Held:  The case is moot.  Article III requires that there be a live case or controversy at the time a federal court decides the case; it is not enough that there may have been a live case or controversy when the case was decided by the court whose judgment this Court is reviewing.  Here, any issues as to whether the bill in question became law were mooted when it expired by its own terms, regardless of whether it had been previously enacted into law or not.  Any controversy over petitioner Acting Archivist's failure to publish the bill in the Statutes at Large as a duly enacted law or any dispute as to accounting obligations relating to the expenditure of funds under the bill is not sufficient to keep the case from being moot.  Pp.  479 U. S. 363-364.

479 U.S. 367

Syllabus 
A Boulder, Colorado, police officer arrested respondent for driving his van while under the influence of alcohol.  After respondent was taken into custody and before a tow truck arrived to take the van to an impoundment lot, another officer, acting in accordance with local police procedures, inventoried the van's contents, opening a closed backpack in which he found various containers holding controlled substances, cocaine paraphernalia, and a large amount of cash.  Prior to his trial on charges including drug offenses, the state trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the evidence found during the inventory search.  Although the court determined that the search did not violate respondent's rights under the Fourth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, it held that the search violated the Colorado Constitution.  The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, but premised its ruling on the Federal Constitution.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the State from proving the criminal charges with the evidence discovered during the inventory search of respondent's van.  This case is controlled by the principles governing inventory searches of automobiles and of an arrestee's personal effects, as set forth in South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, and Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, rather than those governing searches of closed trunks and suitcases conducted solely for the purpose of investigating criminal conduct.  United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, and Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753, distinguished.  The policies behind the warrant requirement, and the related concept of probable cause, are not implicated in an inventory search, which serves the strong governmental interests in protecting an owner's property while it is in police custody, insuring against claims of lost, stolen, or vandalized property, and guarding the police from danger.  There was no showing here that the police, who were following standardized caretaking procedures, acted in bad faith or for the sole purpose of investigation.  Police, before inventorying a container, are not required to weigh the strength of the individual's privacy interest in the container against the possibility that the container might serve as a repository for dangerous or valuable items.  There is no merit to the contention that the search of respondent's van was unconstitutional because departmental regulations gave the police discretion to choose between impounding the van and parking 
Page 479 U. S. 368
 and locking it in a public parking place.  The exercise of police discretion is not prohibited so long as that discretion is exercised -- as was done here -- according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.  Pp.  479 U. S. 371-376.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Security Pacific National Bank (Security Pacific) applied to the Comptroller of the Currency for permission to establish an affiliate named Discount Brokerage, and to offer discount brokerage services not only at its branch offices but also at other locations inside and outside of its home State.  A pertinent branching provision of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C.  81, originally enacted in 1927 as part of the McFadden Act, limits ""the general business"" of a national bank to its headquarters and any ""branches"" permitted by 12 U.S.C.  36.  Section 36(c) provides that a national bank is permitted to branch only in its home State, and only to the extent that a bank of the same State is permitted to branch under state law, and the term ""branch"" is defined in  36(f)
""to include any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office or any branch place of business . . . at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.""
The Comptroller approved Security Pacific's application, concluding that the nonchartered offices at which Discount Brokerage would offer its services would not constitute branches under the McFadden Act because none of the statutory branching functions set forth in  36(f) would be performed there, and that treating offices conducting brokerage activities as branches under  36(f) would be inconsistent with the longstanding practice of banks in operating nonbranch offices dealing in United States Government or municipal securities.  Respondent, a trade association representing securities brokers, underwriters, and investment bankers, brought suit in Federal District Court, contending that bank discount brokerage offices are branches within the meaning of  36(f), and thus are subject to the geographical restrictions imposed by  36(c).  The court, relying on Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150, rejected the Comptroller's contention that respondent lacked standing to maintain the action, and ruled for respondent on the merits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 479 U. S. 389

Held:
1. Respondent has standing to maintain this lawsuit.  Under the ""standing"" standard set forth in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, supra, at 153, the complainant must be injured in fact, and the interest sought to be protected by the complainant must be arguably within the ""zone of interests"" to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.  The essential inquiry in determining standing is whether Congress intended for a particular class of plaintiffs to be relied upon to challenge an agency's disregard of the law.  Cf. Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S. 340,  467 U. S. 347.  The ""zone of interest"" test provides standing in this case, since the interest respondent asserts has a plausible relationship to the policies underlying  36 and 81 with regard to Congress' concern to keep national banks from gaining a monopoly control over credit and money through unlimited branching.  Pp.  479 U. S. 394-403.
2. The Comptroller, whose construction of the statutory provisions is entitled to great weight, did not exceed his authority in approving Security Pacific's application.  There is no merit to respondent's contention that the Comptroller's interpretation of the National Bank Act contradicts the plain language of the statute.  The phrase ""[t]he general business of each national banking association"" in  81 need not be read to encompass all the business in which a bank engages, but, as interpreted by the Comptroller, can plausibly be read as covering only those activities that are part of the bank's core banking functions.  The Act's history, including that predating the branching provisions of the McFadden Act, supports the Comptroller's interpretation.  The history of the McFadden Act itself does not establish that Congress intended the locational restriction of  81 and 36 to reach all activities in which national banks are specifically authorized to engage.  The Comptroller reasonably interprets  36(f) as requiring ""competitive equality"" between state and national banks only in core banking functions, and the operation of a discount brokerage service is not such a function.  Pp.  479 U. S. 403-409.

479 U.S. 418

Syllabus 
The Brooke Amendment to the Housing Act of 1937 imposed a ceiling on rents charged to low-income persons living in public housing projects, and, as later amended, provides that a low-income family ""shall pay as rent"" a specified percentage of its income.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has consistently considered ""rent"" to include a reasonable amount for the use of utilities.  Petitioners, tenants living in low-income housing projects owned by respondent, brought suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that respondent overbilled them for their utilities and thereby violated the rent ceiling imposed by the Brooke Amendment and implementing regulations.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent, holding that a private cause of action was unavailable to enforce the Brooke Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, while the Brooke Amendment confers rights on tenants, these rights are enforceable only by HUD.
Held:
1. Nothing in the Housing Act or the Brooke Amendment evidences that Congress intended to preclude petitioners'  1983 claim against respondent.  Not only are the Brooke Amendment and its legislative history devoid of any express indication that exclusive enforcement authority was vested in HUD, but also both congressional and agency actions have indicated that enforcement authority is not centralized, and that private actions were anticipated.  Neither are the remedial mechanisms provided by the statute sufficiently comprehensive and effective to raise a clear inference that Congress intended to foreclose a  1983 cause of action for the enforcement of tenants' rights secured by federal law.  Pp.  479 U. S. 423-429.
2. There is no merit to respondent's argument that the provision for a ""reasonable"" allowance for utilities is too vague and amorphous to confer on tenants an enforceable ""right"" within the meaning of  1983, and that the matter of utility allowances must be left to the public housing authorities, subject to HUD's supervision.  The benefits Congress intended to confer on tenants are sufficiently specific and definite to qualify

No. 85-494

479 U.S. 272

Syllabus 
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act, in  12945(b)(2), requires employers to provide leave and reinstatement to employees disabled by pregnancy.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), specifies that sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.  A woman employed as a receptionist by petitioner California Federal Savings & Loan Association (Cal Fed) took a pregnancy disability leave in 1982, but, when she notified Cal Fed that she was able to return to work, she was informed that her job had been filled and that there were no similar positions available.  She then filed a complaint with respondent Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which charged Cal Fed with violating  12945(b)(2).  Before a hearing was held on the complaint, Cal Fed, joined by the other petitioners, brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that  12945(b)(2) is inconsistent with and preempted by Title VII, and an injunction against its enforcement.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
758 F.2d 390, affirmed.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-B, III-C, and IV, concluding that  12945(b)(2) is not preempted by Title VII, as amended by the PDA, because it is not inconsistent with the purposes of Title VII, nor does it require the doing of an act that is unlawful under Title VII.  Pp.  479 U. S. 284-292.
(a) Title VII's purpose is
""to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of . . . employees over other employees.""
Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424,  401 U. S. 429-430.  Rather than limiting Title VII principles and objectives, the PDA extends them to cover pregnancy.  Section 12945(b)(2) also promotes equal employment opportunity.  By requiring employers to reinstate women after a reasonable 
Page 479 U. S. 273
 pregnancy disability leave, it ensures that they will not lose their jobs on account of pregnancy.  Pp.  479 U. S. 284-290.
(b) Section 12945(b)(2) does not prevent employers from complying with both the federal law (as construed by petitioners to reject California's ""special treatment"" approach to pregnancy discrimination and to forbid .an employer to treat pregnant employees any differently than other disabled employees) and the state law.  This is not a case where compliance with both the federal and state laws is a physical impossibility.  Section 12945(b)(2) does not compel employers to treat pregnant employees better than other disabled employees; it merely establishes benefits that employers must, at a minimum, provide to pregnant workers.  Pp.  479 U. S. 290-292.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Part III-A that both  708 and 1104 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 severely limit Title VII's preemptive effect by leaving state fair employment laws where they were before Title VII was enacted.  Pp.  479 U. S. 280-284.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that, for purposes of holding that  12945(b)(2) is not preempted by Title VII, it is not necessary to reach the question whether  1104 applies to Title VII or whether  708 is the only provision governing Title VII's preemptive scope.  Pp.  479 U. S. 292-293, n. 1.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the only provision whose effect on preemption need be considered is  708 of Title VII, which prohibits preemption unless a state law requires or permits the doing of an act outlawed by the PDA.  Because  12945(b)(2) does not require or permit the doing of an act outlawed under any interpretation of the PDA, it is not preempted.  Accordingly it is unnecessary to decide how the PDA should be interpreted.  Pp.  479 U. S. 295-296.

Before a hearing was held on the complaint, Cal Fed, joined by the other petitioners, brought an action in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that  12945(b)(2) is inconsistent with and preempted by Title VII, and an injunction against its enforcement.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
758 F.2d 390, affirmed.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-B, III-C, and IV, concluding that  12945(b)(2) is not preempted by Title VII, as amended by the PDA, because it is not inconsistent with the purposes of Title VII, nor does it require the doing of an act that is unlawful under Title VII.  Pp.  479 U. S. 284-292.
(a) Title VII's purpose is
""to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of . . . employees over other employees.""
Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424,  401 U. S. 429-430.  Rather than limiting Title VII principles and objectives, the PDA extends them to cover pregnancy.  Section 12945(b)(2) also promotes equal employment opportunity.  By requiring employers to reinstate women after a reasonable 
Page 479 U. S. 273
 pregnancy disability leave, it ensures that they will not lose their jobs on account of pregnancy.  Pp.  479 U. S. 284-290.
(b) Section 12945(b)(2) does not prevent employers from complying with both the federal law (as construed by petitioners to reject California's ""special treatment"" approach to pregnancy discrimination and to forbid .an employer to treat pregnant employees any differently than other disabled employees) and the state law.  This is not a case where compliance with both the federal and state laws is a physical impossibility.  Section 12945(b)(2) does not compel employers to treat pregnant employees better than other disabled employees; it merely establishes benefits that employers must, at a minimum, provide to pregnant workers.  Pp.  479 U. S. 290-292.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Part III-A that both  708 and 1104 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 severely limit Title VII's preemptive effect by leaving state fair employment laws where they were before Title VII was enacted.  Pp.  479 U. S. 280-284.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that, for purposes of holding that  12945(b)(2) is not preempted by Title VII, it is not necessary to reach the question whether  1104 applies to Title VII or whether  708 is the only provision governing Title VII's preemptive scope.  Pp.  479 U. S. 292-293, n. 1.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the only provision whose effect on preemption need be considered is  708 of Title VII, which prohibits preemption unless a state law requires or permits the doing of an act outlawed by the PDA.  Because  12945(b)(2) does not require or permit the doing of an act outlawed under any interpretation of the PDA, it is not preempted.  Accordingly it is unnecessary to decide how the PDA should be interpreted.  Pp.  479 U. S. 295-296.
MARSHALL, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-B, III-C, and IV, in which BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III-A, in which BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.  STEVENS, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, post, p.  479 U. S. 292.  SCALIA, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, post, p.  479 U. S. 295.  WHITE, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and POWELL, J., joined, post, p.  479 U. S. 297.

No. 85-937
Argued November 10, 1986
Decided January 13, 1987
479 U.S. 305

Syllabus 
The President declared floods that occurred in 1972 in West Virginia to be ""major disasters,"" qualifying the affected areas for federal relief under the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (DRA) (later repealed).  Section 226(a) of the DRA provided that any mobile home or temporary housing for displaced persons was to be placed on a site provided by the State ""without charge to the United States.""  In the aftermath of the disasters here, the Army Corps of Engineers, at the State's request, prepared sites for mobile homes and, in late 1972 and early 1973, billed the State for such services.  The State acknowledged the bills, but failed to make any payment.  After delaying at the State's request, the United States brought suit against the State in 1978, seeking to recover site preparation costs plus prejudgment interest.  The District Court held that the State was contractually obligated to the Corps for site preparation services, but denied the United States' motion for an order of prejudgment interest on the debt.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holding that the State was contractually obligated on the debt, but reversed the determination that the State was not liable for prejudgment interest.
Held:  West Virginia is liable for prejudgment interest on the debt arising from the contractual obligation to reimburse the United States for services rendered by the Corps.  The rule governing the interest to be recovered as damages for delayed payment of a contractual obligation to the United States is not controlled by state law.  While there are instances in which state law may be adopted as the federal rule of decision, this case presents no compelling reason for doing so.  A single nationwide rule is preferable, and the incorporation of state law would not give due regard to the federal interest in maintaining the apportionment of responsibility Congress devised in the DRA.  Before applying to a State the usual federal rule that private parties owing debts to the Federal Government must pay prejudgment interest where the underlying claim is a contractual obligation to pay money, Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, 313 U. S. 289, a federal court should consider the interests of the two governments involved.  Board of Comm'rs of Jackson County v. United States, 308 U. S. 343,  308 U. S. 350.  Here, federal policy plainly calls for an award of interest.  The DRA's purpose was not to relieve States of the entire burden of disaster relief, but to apportion that responsibility 
Page 479 U. S. 306
 between the State and Federal Governments.  Section 226(a) reflects the statute's allocative intent that the Federal Government not bear the cost of site preparation for temporary housing, and prejudgment interest is an element of complete compensation to the Federal Government.  The State asserts no interest that would justify releasing it of its obligation to compensate the Federal Government fully.  Because States have no sovereign immunity as against the Federal Government, any state rule exempting the sovereign from the payment of prejudgment interest not only does not apply of its own force to the State's obligations to the Federal Government, but also does not represent a policy that the Federal Government is obliged to further.  Pp.  479 U. S. 308-313.

479 U.S. 314

Syllabus 
In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, the Court ruled that a state criminal defendant could establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment, based on the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to strike members of the defendant's race from the jury venire, and that, once the defendant had made the prima facie showing, the burden shifted to the prosecution to come forward with a neutral explanation for those challenges.  These cases concern the question whether that ruling applies to cases pending on direct review or not yet final when Batson was decided.  In No. 85-5221, petitioner's robbery conviction in a Kentucky state court was affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court, which rejected petitioner's claim that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike prospective black jurors deprived petitioner, a black person, of guaranteed equal protection.  Similarly, in No. 85-5731, petitioner's conviction in Federal District Court on narcotics charges was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which rejected petitioner's claim that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors, combined with his call to the jury clerk, violated the right of petitioner, a black person, to an impartial jury.  The petitions for certiorari in both cases were filed in this Court before Batson was decided.
Held:  A new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, such as the ruling in Batson, applies retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a ""clear break"" with the past.  Pp.  479 U. S. 320-328.
(a) Failure to apply a newly declared constitutional rule to criminal cases pending on direct review violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.  After this Court has announced a new rule in the case selected for review, the integrity of judicial review requires the Court to apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review.  In addition, selective application of a new rule violates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same.  Pp.  479 U. S. 320-326.
(b) An exception to the general principle that a new rule governing criminal procedure should be retroactive to cases pending on direct review, 
Page 479 U. S. 315
 based solely on the fact that the new rule is a ""clear break"" with the past, is inappropriate.  The principle that this Court does not disregard current law when it adjudicates a case pending before it on direct review applies regardless of the specific characteristics of the new rule announced by the Court.  Further, the use of a ""clear break"" exception creates the same problem of not treating similarly situated defendants the same.  The fact that the new rule may constitute a clear break with the past has no bearing on the ""actual inequity that results"" when only one of many similarly situated defendants receives the benefit of the new rule.  Pp.  479 U. S. 326-328.

No. 84-2022
Argued November 3, 1986
Decided January 13, 1987
479 U.S. 335

Syllabus 
Under  101-bb of New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and implementing regulations of the State Liquor Authority (SLA), liquor retailers must charge at least 112 percent of the wholesaler's ""posted"" bottle price in effect at the time the retailer sells or offers to sell the item.  Wholesalers must file monthly ""posted"" bottle prices and case prices for an item with the SLA, and may reduce the posted case price for an item without reducing its bottle price.  Since retailers generally purchase liquor by the case, wholesalers thus can compel retailers to charge more than 112 percent of the actual wholesale cost to the retailer.  As a result of appellant retailer's selling certain bottles of liquor for less than 112 percent of the posted bottle price, its license was suspended for 10 days and it forfeited a bond.  Appellant sought relief from the penalties on the ground that  101-bb violated  1 of the Sherman Act.  A New York Supreme Court denied relief, but the Appellate Division reversed.  The New York Court of Appeals upheld the validity of  101-bb and reinstated the penalties.  It held that  101-bb was not immune under the state action exemption from the antitrust laws set forth in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341.  The Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the statute was a proper exercise of powers reserved to the State by the Twenty-first Amendment.
Held:
1. Section 101-bb is inconsistent with  1 of the Sherman Act.  Resale price maintenance has long been regarded as a per se antitrust violation.  The New York statute, which applies to all liquor wholesalers and retailers, allows ""vertical control"" by wholesalers of retail prices.  Such industry-wide resale price-fixing is virtually certain to reduce both interbrand and intrabrand competition, because it prevents wholesalers from allowing or requiring retail price competition.  Cf. California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97.  Pp.  479 U. S. 341-343.
2. New York's pricing system is not valid under the state action exemption from the antitrust laws.  The State's system does meet the first requirement of the two-part test for determining immunity under Parker v. Brown, supra, that the challenged restraint be ""one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.""  However, 
Page 479 U. S. 336
 New York's liquor pricing system does not meet the second requirement that the State's policy be ""actively supervised"" by the State itself.  New York simply authorizes price setting and enforces the prices established by private parties.  The State has displaced competition among liquor retailers without substituting an adequate system of regulation.  Cf. California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., supra.  Pp.  479 U. S. 343-345.
3. New York's pricing system is not valid under the Twenty-first Amendment.  Although  2 of the Amendment qualifies the federal commerce power, the Amendment does not operate to ""repeal"" the Commerce Clause wherever state regulation of intoxicating liquors is concerned.  The question in each case is whether the interests implicated by a state regulation are so closely related to the powers preserved by the Twenty-first Amendment that the regulation may prevail, notwithstanding that its requirements directly conflict with express federal policies.  Pp.  479 U. S. 346-352.
(a) The State's asserted interest in protecting small retailers does not suffice to afford immunity from the Sherman Act. Although the New York Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the purpose of the 12 percent minimum markup was to protect those retailers, the court made no findings that the purpose of the ""bottle price"" definition of cost was to protect small retailers, and cited no legislative or other findings that either the markup or the ""bottle price"" definition of cost has been effective in preserving the retailers.  The State's resale price maintenance system directly conflicts with the ""familiar and substantial"" federal interest in enforcing the antitrust laws.  Pp.  479 U. S. 348-351.
(b) It is not necessary to consider whether New York's pricing system can be upheld as an exercise of the State's power to promote temperance.  The Court of Appeals did not find that the statute was intended to promote temperance, or that it does so.  This Court accords great weight to the views of the State's highest court on state law matters, and customarily accepts the factual findings of state courts in the absence of exceptional circumstances.  No such exceptional circumstances appear in this case.  Pp.  479 U. S. 351-352.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 12, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
Page 479 U.S. 1043 , 1044
 
 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are two political subdivisions in the State of Florida that have filed a single petition for certiorari, under this Court's Rule 19.4, seeking review of two separate judgments of the Supreme Court of Florida. Both cases present the same federal constitutional question; I set forth the facts in Martin County v. Makemson only. 
 Respondent Robert Makemson was appointed under Florida law to represent a defendant charged with first-degree murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery. Respondent's representation of the defendant spanned a 9- month period, and upon completion of the task respondent petitioned the trial court, pursuant to Fla.Stat. 925.036 (1985),* for attorney's fees in the amount of $9,500. Section 925.036(2)(d) establishes a limit of $3, 500 on compensation to appointed attorneys who represent capital defendants at trial. Notwithstanding this provision, the state trial court awarded respondent the $9,500 he requested, declaring that "" 'in setting rigid maximum fees without regard to the circumstances in each case[, 925.036] is arbitrary and capricious and violates the due process clause of the United States and Florida Constitutions.'

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 12, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 
Page 479 U.S. 1043 , 1044
 
 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioners are two political subdivisions in the State of Florida that have filed a single petition for certiorari, under this Court's Rule 19.4, seeking review of two separate judgments of the Supreme Court of Florida. Both cases present the same federal constitutional question; I set forth the facts in Martin County v. Makemson only. 
 Respondent Robert Makemson was appointed under Florida law to represent a defendant charged with first-degree murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery. Respondent's representation of the defendant spanned a 9- month period, and upon completion of the task respondent petitioned the trial court, pursuant to Fla.Stat. 925.036 (1985),* for attorney's fees in the amount of $9,500. Section 925.036(2)(d) establishes a limit of $3, 500 on compensation to appointed attorneys who represent capital defendants at trial. Notwithstanding this provision, the state trial court awarded respondent the $9,500 he requested, declaring that "" 'in setting rigid maximum fees without regard to the circumstances in each case[, 925.036] is arbitrary and capricious and violates the due process clause of the United States and Florida Constitutions.'

 Willie WATSON, Jr.v. Hilton BUTLER, Warden.No. A-78 (87-5161) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 July 23, 1987
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death, presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins in Parts II and III, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2971, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), we would grant the stay application and the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 II [ Watson v. Butler 483 U.S. 1037 (1987) ][1037-Continued.] 
 Even if we did not hold these views, we would nonetheless grant the stay application in order to hold the case for Lowenfield v. Phelps, No. 86-6867. At issue in Lowenfield is the constitutionality of a death- sentencing procedure where the aggravating factor found by the jury duplicates the jury's findings in the guilt phase and thus fails to narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. 
 In this case, Watson was found guilty of first-degree murder because he killed while ""engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated escape, aggravated arson, aggravated rape, aggravated burglary, armed robbery, or simple robbery."" La.Rev.Stat. Ann. 14.30(A)(1) (West 1986). Louisiana law requires that the sentencing jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one statutory aggravating factor exists before a death sentence may be imposed. La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 905.3 (West Supp.1987). Article 905.4 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure (West 1984 and Supp.1987) provides that ""[t]he following shall be considered aggravating circumstances,"" and lists 10 circumstances, which are labelled as subsections (a) through (j). The jury in Watson's case found that Watson had committed the acts described in subsection (a): he ""was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration 
Page 483 U.S. 1037 , 1038
 of aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated burglary, aggravated arson, aggravated escape, armed robbery, or simple robbery."" 1 Specifically, the jury determined that Watson committed armed robbery and aggravated rape. 
 If the commission of armed robbery and aggravated rape constitutes only a single aggravating circumstance, then Watson presents exactly the same claim as Lowenfield. [Footnote 2] In the majority of cases that have required a tally of aggravating circumstances, the Louisiana Supreme Court has considered the presence of more than one felony under Article 905.4(a) to count as only a single aggravating factor. See, e.g., State v. Carmouche, 508 So.2d 792 (1987); State v. Bates, 495 So.2d 1262 (1986); State v. Andrews, 452 So.2d 687 (1984); State v. Jordan, 420 So.2d 420 (1982); State v. Myles, 389 So.2d 12 (1979). In some other cases, including this one, State v. Watson, 449 So.2d 1321 (1984), the Louisiana Supreme Court appears to have viewed each felony as a separate aggravating factor. That court, however, has not had the opportunity to address this issue explicitly. In our view, until the Louisiana Supreme Court gives the statute a definitive interpretation, this Court should grant the application for stay, in order to hold for Lowenfield. 
 III  
 Four Members of this Court consider the above view sufficiently compelling to have voted to hold this case until Lowenfield is decided. Three votes suffice to hold a case, but it takes five votes to stay an execution. The Court today thus permits Mr. Watson's legal claim to stay alive while condemning Watson himself to die under a sentencing scheme that within a matter of months the Court may conclude is unconstitutional. Half the Members of this Court believe that Watson's claim might be indistinguishable from [483 U.S. 1037 , 1039]

 Beauford WHITEv. Richard L. DUGGER, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections.No. 87-5362 (A-172) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 August 27, 1987
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to Justice SCALIA and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 The State of Florida will execute Beauford White tomorrow morning without so much as a determination by its own courts that his death sentence is currently legal. I adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2971 (1976) (dissenting opinion). But even were I not of that view, [ White v. Dugger 483 U.S. 1045 (1987) ][1045-Continued.] 
I would dissent from this Court's tacit approval of a death sentence whose factual predicate the executing State has not reviewed for consistency with intervening Supreme Court precedent. I would vote to stay White's execution, grant his petition for writ of certiorari, and reverse the judgments below denying habeas relief. 
 I  
 As summarized by the Florida Supreme Court, the relevant facts of this case are as follows: White and two companions entered a home under a subterfuge to rob its occupants. All three were armed and wore masks covering their faces from the nose down. After blindfolding and binding the sole occupant, the three robbers ransacked the house in search of valuables. Within an hour, seven acquaintances of the occupant appeared at the house. The three robbers bound the newcomers. At some point, the mask of one of White's companions fell off, exposing his face to the victims. Consequently, the three discussed the need to kill the victims. White voiced his opposition, but to no avail; his companions overrode him . White's two companions separated the victims into two rooms and systematically shot all eight in the back of the head, killing six. White remained in the house throughout, but did not participate in the shootings . The three co-felons then returned to White's motel room to divide their loot. A fourth participant, a wheelman who never entered the home, testified that he and White were both 
Page 483 U.S. 1045 , 1046
 duped into what he later discovered was a planned contract murder of one or two of the victims. He also testified that White was visibly shaken afterwards and refused to help dispose of the weapons. 
 A Florida jury convicted White of six counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and four counts of robbery, and unanimously recommended a life sentence. The trial judge, disregarding the jury's unanimous recommendation, imposed a death sentence . After this Court's decision in Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 102 S. Ct. 3368 (1982), the Florida courts entertained a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether White's conduct exhibited the requisite intent to sustain a death sentence under that intervening case. The Florida Supreme Court reversed a lower court finding that Enmund was not satisfied. The court held that White had the requisite intent (within the meaning of Enmund) because, ""whatever [White] might have originally intended or contemplated about lethal force being used in the robbery, it can hardly be said that he did not realize that lethal force was going to be used in carrying out the robbery."" State v. White, 470 So.2d 1377, 1380 (Fla.1985). 
 Since then, White has twice sought post-conviction relief from the Florida courts. He has argued, among other things, that he is entitled to a new determination as to whether his conduct was sufficiently culpable to satisfy the new culpability standard that this Court articulated in Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137 (1987). On each occasion, the state courts barred his application as untimely. White then filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, 828 F.2d 10 (1987). This evening, less than 11 hours before his death, White filed the instant petition for a writ of certiorari and application for a stay of execution. 
 II  
 While the Florida Supreme Court purported to have found White's conduct sufficiently culpable to satisfy the Enmund test, it has to date never reconsidered that determination in light of this Court's rereading of Enmund in Tison. After briefly summarizing how Tison modified the Enmund inquiry, I will explain why, in my view, the modified analysis demands that we vacate White's death sentence, just as we did in Tison, until such time as the Florida courts have established the factual predicate that a majority of this [483 U.S. 1045 , 1047]
