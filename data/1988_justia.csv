08-724||"SMITH, WARDEN v. SPISAK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 08724.Argued October 13, 2009Decided January 12, 2010
After the Ohio courts sentenced respondent Spisak to death and denied his claims on direct appeal and collateral review, he filed a federal habeas petition claiming that, at his trials penalty phase, (1) the instructions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to be mitigating, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and (2) his counsels inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assistance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both arguments and ordered relief.  
Held:
1.Because the state courts upholding of the mitigation jury instructions and forms was not contrary to, or  an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from reaching a contrary decision.  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the instructions and forms contravened Mills, in which this Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue violated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist, 486 U. S., at 380381, 384.  Even assuming that Mills sets forth the pertinent clearly established Federal law for reviewing the state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here differ significantly from those in Mills: They made clear that, to recommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.  Nor did they say anything about howor even whetherthe jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.  They focused only on the overall question of balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury to consider all relevant evidence.  Thus, the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or what they implied, the constitutional error in the Mills instructions.  Pp.29.


2.Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisaks ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not contrary to, or  an unreasonable application of the law clearly established in Strickland.  2254(d)(1).  To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, inter alia, that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  Strickland, supra, at 694.  Even assuming that the closing argument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court finds no reasonable probability that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference.  Any different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context: Spisaks defense at the trials guilt phase consisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.  Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate Spisaks mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shootings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further murders if given the opportunity.  In light of this background and for the following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for the deficient closing.  First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds the governments extensive and graphic evidence regarding the killings, Spisaks boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats to commit further violent acts.  Second, although counsel did not summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it, and the defense experts more detailed testimony regarding Spisaks mental illness was also fresh in the jurors minds.  Third, Spisak does not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the mental defect factor that the defense experts described.  Finally, in light of counsels several appeals to the jurors sense of humanity, it is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing circumstances.  The Court need not reach Spisaks claim that 2254(d)(1) does not apply to his claim, because it would reach the same conclusion even on de novo review.  Pp.916.
512 F.3d 852, reversed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined, and in which Stevens, J., joined as to Part III.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

|488 u.s. 1301|"Baltimore Department of Social Services v. Bouknight
No. A-494
Decided December 21, 1988
488 U.S. 1301

Syllabus 
An application to stay the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland -- that Jacqueline Bouknight's confinement for civil contempt violated her privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution -- is granted pending the timely filing and subsequent disposition of a petition for certiorari.  At the request of the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS), the circuit court for the city determined that Bouknight's son, Maurice, who had received several suspicious injuries, was a ""child in need of assistance"" under Maryland law.  Bouknight received supervised custody of Maurice, but failed to cooperate with DSS and refused to produce him or tell DSS where he was.  Subsequently, she was arrested and ordered to disclose the child's whereabouts.  After giving a false answer, she was jailed until she purged herself of contempt by either producing Maurice or revealing his location.  The Court of Appeals found that the terms of the confinement violated Bouknight's privilege against self-incrimination, since the risk that producing Maurice would necessarily admit a measure of continuing control over the child that might be relevant in a subsequent criminal prosecution could not be outweighed by any governmental interest in finding Maurice.  DSS meets the requirements for the issuance of a stay.  The lower court's decision is based on the United States Constitution, and the burden on Bouknight's liberty must be weighed against the very real jeopardy to a child's safety and wellbeing, and perhaps even his life.  If Bouknight is permitted to go free, DSS may not have the means to obtain information about or to locate the child.  Also, it is likely that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari, and DSS has a fair prospect of persuading a majority of the Court that the state court decision was erroneous.

|488 u.s. 153|"Beech Aircraft Corporation v. Rainey
No. 87-981
Argued October 4, 1988
Decided December 12, 1988*
488 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
Respondents' spouses, a Navy flight instructor and her student, were killed when, during training exercises, their Navy aircraft banked sharply to avoid another plane, lost altitude, and crashed.  At the trial of respondents' product liability suit against petitioners, the companies which manufactured and serviced the plane in question, the only seriously disputed issue was whether the crash was caused by pilot error or equipment malfunction.  Having previously determined that a Navy investigative report of the incident (the JAG Report or Report) was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, the District Court admitted, over respondents' objections, most of the Report's ""opinions,"" including a statement suggesting that pilot error was the most probable cause of the accident.  Moreover, after respondent Rainey, who was himself a Navy flight instructor, admitted on direct examination as an adverse witness that he had made certain statements arguably supporting a pilot error theory in a detailed letter in which he took issue with some of the JAG Report's findings, his counsel attempted to ask him on cross-examination whether the letter did not also say that the most probable primary cause of the mishap was a loss of power due to equipment malfunction.  However, before Rainey could answer, the court sustained a defense objection on the ground that the question asked for Rainey's opinion, and cut off further questioning along this line.  After the jury returned a verdict for petitioners, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.  The court held itself bound by Smith v. Ithaca Corp., 612 F.2d 215 (CA5), such that Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C) -- which excepts from the hearsay rule ""public records and reports"" setting forth ""factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness"" -- did not encompass the JAG Report's evaluative conclusions or opinions.  The court also held that Federal Rule of Evidence 106 forbade the trial court to prohibit cross-examination about additional portions of Rainey's letter which would 
Page 488 U. S. 154
 have put in context the admissions elicited from him on direct examination.  On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals did not disturb the panel's judgment.
Held:
1. Statements in the form of opinions or conclusions are not by that fact excluded from the scope of Rule 803(8)(C).  The Rule's language does not call for the distinction between ""fact"" and ""opinion"" drawn by Smith, supra, and other proponents of a narrow interpretation of the Rule's ""factual findings"" phrase, since ""finding of fact"" is commonly defined to include conclusions by way of reasonable inference from the evidence, and since, in specifying the kinds of reports that are admissible, the Rule does not create a distinction between ""fact"" and ""opinion.""  Nor is any such distinction required by the intent of the Rule's framers, as expressed in the Advisory Committee's Notes on the Rule.  This conclusion is strengthened by the analytical difficulty of drawing such a distinction.  Rather than requiring that some inevitably arbitrary line be drawn between the various shades of fact/opinion that invariably will be present in investigatory reports, the Rule instructs courts -- as its plain language states -- to admit ""reports . . . setting forth . . . factual findings.""  Appropriate limitations and safeguards lie in the fact that the Rule's requirement that reports contain factual findings bars the admission of statements not based on factual investigation, and in the Rule's trustworthiness requirement.  Thus, as long as a conclusion satisfies the latter requirements, it should be admissible along with other portions of the Report.  Here, since the District Court determined that certain of the JAG Report's conclusions were trustworthy, it rightly admitted them into evidence.  Pp.  488 U. S. 161-170.
2. On the facts of this case, the District Court abused its discretion in restricting the scope of cross-examination of respondent Rainey by his counsel in regard to his letter.  Pp.  488 U. S. 170-175.
(a) While the letter did make the statements to which Rainey admitted on direct examination which tended to support a pilot error theory, the letter's thrust was to challenge that theory as inconsistent with the evidence and the likely actions of the two pilots, and to expound at length on Rainey's theory of equipment malfunction and demonstrate how the various pieces of evidence supported that theory.  Since it is plausible that the jury would have concluded from Rainey's testimony that he did not believe in his equipment malfunction theory when he wrote the letter, but developed it only later for litigation purposes, the jury was given a distorted and prejudicial impression of the letter, which Rainey's counsel was unable to counteract due to the District Court's refusal to allow him to present additional information on cross-examination.  The common law ""rule of completeness,"" which has been 
Page 488 U. S. 155
 partially codified in Rule 106 -- whereby, when a party has introduced part of a writing, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously -- was designed to prevent exactly this type of prejudice.  However, although the concerns underlying Rule 106 are clearly relevant to this case, it is unnecessary to determine whether the Rule applies, since, where misunderstanding or distortion can be averted only through presentation of an additional portion of a document, the material required for completeness is necessarily relevant and admissible.  The question posed by Rainey's counsel on cross-examination was not asked for the purpose of eliciting Rainey's opinion as to the cause of the accident, but rather inquired whether he had made a certain statement in his letter, a question he was eminently qualified to answer.  Defense counsel's objection to that question as calling for an opinion could not avail in view of the obvious purpose for which the statement was offered.  Pp.  488 U. S. 170-173.
(b) Petitioners' contention that Rainey waived the right to pursue the cross-examination testimony issue on appeal because he did not properly raise it in the trial court is not persuasive.  The nature of Rainey's proposed testimony was abundantly apparent from the very question put by his counsel, such that the offer-of-proof requirement of Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a)(2) was satisfied.  Moreover, Rainey's counsel substantially satisfied the requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 46 that he put the court on notice as to his objection to the exclusion and the grounds therefor, when, in the colloquy following the defense objection to his question, and before he was cut off, he began to articulate his completeness argument.  Pp.  488 U. S. 174-175.

|488 u.s. 179|"National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Tarkanian
No. 87-1061
Argued October 5, 1988
Decided December 12, 1988
488 U.S. 179

Syllabus 
Petitioner National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), an unincorporated association consisting of approximately 960 public and private universities and colleges, adopts rules governing member institutions' recruiting, admissions, academic eligibility, and financial aid standards for student athletes.  The NCAA's Committee on Infractions conducts investigations, makes factual determinations, and is expressly authorized to impose penalties upon members that have violated the rules, but is not authorized to sanction a member institution's employees directly.  After a lengthy investigation of allegedly improper recruiting practices by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), a state university, the Committee found 38 violations, including 10 by respondent Tarkanian, UNLV's basketball coach.  The Committee imposed a number of sanctions upon UNLV, and requested it to show cause why additional penalties should not be imposed if it failed to suspend Tarkanian from its athletic program during a probation period.  Facing demotion and a drastic cut in pay, Tarkanian brought suit in Nevada state court, alleging that he had been deprived of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Ultimately, Tarkanian obtained injunctive relief and an award of attorney's fees against both UNLV and the NCAA.  Concluding that the NCAA's conduct constituted state action for jurisdictional and constitutional purposes, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed in relevant part.
Held:  The NCAA's participation in the events that led to Tarkanian's suspension did not constitute ""state action"" prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, and was not performed ""under color of "" state law within the meaning of  1983.  The NCAA cannot be deemed to be a state actor on the theory that it misused power it possessed by virtue of state law, since UNLV's decision to suspend Tarkanian, while in compliance with the NCAA's rules and recommendations, did not turn the NCAA's conduct into action under color of Nevada law.  Although it must be assumed that UNLV, as an NCAA member and a participant in the promulgation of the Association's rules, had some minor impact on the NCAA's policy determinations, the source of the rules adopted by the NCAA is not Nevada, but the collective membership, the vast majority of which was located in other States.  Moreover, UNLV's decision to 
Page 488 U. S. 180
 adopt the NCAA's rules did not transform them into state rules, and the NCAA into a state actor, since UNLV retained plenary power to withdraw from the NCAA and to establish its own standards.  The NCAA's investigation, enforcement proceedings, and consequent recommendations did not constitute state action on the theory that they resulted from a delegation of power by UNLV, because:  UNLV delegated no power to the NCAA to take specific action against any University employee; UNLV and the NCAA acted as adversaries throughout the proceedings; the NCAA enjoyed no governmental powers to facilitate its investigation; and the NCAA did not -- indeed, could not -- directly discipline Tarkanian, but could only threaten additional sanctions against UNLV if the University chose not to suspend its coach.  Furthermore, even assuming the truth of Tarkanian's argument that the power of the NCAA is so great that UNLV had no practical alternative but to comply with the Association's demands, it does not follow that the NCAA was therefore acting under color of state law.

Petitioner National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), an unincorporated association consisting of approximately 960 public and private universities and colleges, adopts rules governing member institutions' recruiting, admissions, academic eligibility, and financial aid standards for student athletes.  The NCAA's Committee on Infractions conducts investigations, makes factual determinations, and is expressly authorized to impose penalties upon members that have violated the rules, but is not authorized to sanction a member institution's employees directly.  After a lengthy investigation of allegedly improper recruiting practices by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), a state university, the Committee found 38 violations, including 10 by respondent Tarkanian, UNLV's basketball coach.  The Committee imposed a number of sanctions upon UNLV, and requested it to show cause why additional penalties should not be imposed if it failed to suspend Tarkanian from its athletic program during a probation period.  Facing demotion and a drastic cut in pay, Tarkanian brought suit in Nevada state court, alleging that he had been deprived of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Ultimately, Tarkanian obtained injunctive relief and an award of attorney's fees against both UNLV and the NCAA.  Concluding that the NCAA's conduct constituted state action for jurisdictional and constitutional purposes, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed in relevant part.
Held:  The NCAA's participation in the events that led to Tarkanian's suspension did not constitute ""state action"" prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, and was not performed ""under color of "" state law within the meaning of  1983.  The NCAA cannot be deemed to be a state actor on the theory that it misused power it possessed by virtue of state law, since UNLV's decision to suspend Tarkanian, while in compliance with the NCAA's rules and recommendations, did not turn the NCAA's conduct into action under color of Nevada law.  Although it must be assumed that UNLV, as an NCAA member and a participant in the promulgation of the Association's rules, had some minor impact on the NCAA's policy determinations, the source of the rules adopted by the NCAA is not Nevada, but the collective membership, the vast majority of which was located in other States.  Moreover, UNLV's decision to 
Page 488 U. S. 180
 adopt the NCAA's rules did not transform them into state rules, and the NCAA into a state actor, since UNLV retained plenary power to withdraw from the NCAA and to establish its own standards.  The NCAA's investigation, enforcement proceedings, and consequent recommendations did not constitute state action on the theory that they resulted from a delegation of power by UNLV, because:  UNLV delegated no power to the NCAA to take specific action against any University employee; UNLV and the NCAA acted as adversaries throughout the proceedings; the NCAA enjoyed no governmental powers to facilitate its investigation; and the NCAA did not -- indeed, could not -- directly discipline Tarkanian, but could only threaten additional sanctions against UNLV if the University chose not to suspend its coach.  Furthermore, even assuming the truth of Tarkanian's argument that the power of the NCAA is so great that UNLV had no practical alternative but to comply with the Association's demands, it does not follow that the NCAA was therefore acting under color of state law.

Syllabus 
Under the Medicare program, the Government reimburses health care providers for expenses incurred in providing medical services to Medicare beneficiaries.  The Medicare Act, in 42 U.S.C.  1395x(v)(1)(A), authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to promulgate cost reimbursement regulations, and also provides that
""[s]uch regulations shall . . . (ii) provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.""
In 1981, the Secretary issued a cost-limit schedule that changed the method for calculating the ""wage index,"" a factor used to reflect the salary levels for hospital employees in different parts of the country.  Under the prior rule, the wage index for a given geographic area was calculated by using the average salary levels for all hospitals in the area, but the 1981 rule excluded from that computation wages paid by Federal Government hospitals.  After the Federal District Court invalidated the 1981 rule in a suit brought by various hospitals in the District of Columbia, and the Secretary settled the hospitals' cost reimbursement reports by applying the pre-1981 wage-index method, the Secretary in 1984 reissued the 1981 rule and proceeded to recoup the sums previously paid to the hospitals, including respondents, as a result of the District Court's ruling.  After exhausting administrative remedies, respondents brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the retroactive schedule was invalid under, inter alia, the Medicare Act.  The court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. An administrative agency's power to promulgate regulations is limited to the authority delegated by Congress.  As a general matter, statutory grants of rulemaking authority will not be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power is conveyed by express terms.  Pp.  488 U. S. 208-209.
2. The 1984 reinstatement of the 1981 cost-limit rule is invalid.  Pp.  488 U. S. 209-216. 
Page 488 U. S. 205

(a) Section 1395x(v)(1)(A) does not authorize retroactive promulgation of cost-limit rules.  The structure and language of the statute require the conclusion that clause (ii) applies not to rulemaking, but only to case-by-case adjustments to reimbursement payments, where the regulations prescribing computation methods do not reach the correct result in individual cases.  This interpretation of clause (ii) is consistent with the Secretary's past implementation of that provision.  Pp.  488 U. S. 209-213.
(b) The Medicare Act's general grant of authority to the Secretary to promulgate cost-limit rules contains no express authorization for retroactive rulemaking.  This absence of express authorization weighs heavily against the Secretary's position.  Moreover, the legislative history of the cost-limit provision indicates that Congress intended to forbid retroactive cost-limit rules, and the Secretary's past administrative practice is consistent with this interpretation of the statute.

No. 88-5223
Decided December 12, 1988
488 U.S. 227

Syllabus 
Petitioner and one Harris, who are black, were charged with the kidnaping, rape, and forcible sodomy of Starla Matthews, a white woman.  In his defense, petitioner asserted that he and Matthews had engaged in consensual sex, an account corroborated by several witnesses.  Matthews' story was corroborated only by the testimony of one Russell.  Petitioner claimed that, at the time of the incident, Matthews and Russell had been engaged in an extramarital affair, and that she had lied to Russell to protect that relationship.  In order to show that Matthews had a motive to lie, petitioner wanted to introduce evidence that Matthews and Russell were living together at the time of the trial.  However, the trial court granted the prosecutor's motion to keep such evidence from the jury, and sustained the prosecutor's objection when the defense attempted to cross-examine Matthews about the matter after she had testified that she was living with her mother.  The jury acquitted Harris of all charges and found petitioner guilty only of forcible sodomy.  On appeal, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that the court's failure to allow him to impeach Matthews' testimony deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.  The Court of Appeals of Kentucky upheld the conviction.  While acknowledging the relevance of the testimony, it found that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the possibility of prejudice against Matthews that might result from revealing her interracial relationship to the jury.
Held:  Petitioner was denied his right to confront the witnesses against him, and, considering the relevant factors enumerated in Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, that error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Matthews' testimony was crucial to the prosecution's case.  Her account was directly contradicted by petitioner, and was corroborated only by the testimony of Russell, whose impartiality may have been impugned by evidence of his relationship with Matthews.  In addition, as the jury's verdicts show, the State's case was far from overwhelming.
Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.

488 U.S. 93

Syllabus 
After respondent, a cryptographic material control technician at the National Security Agency (NSA), disclosed to NSA officials that he had engaged in homosexual relationships with foreign nationals, his employment was terminated pursuant to NSA personnel regulations setting forth procedures for removal ""for cause,"" which were promulgated under provisions of the National Security Agency Act of 1959 (1959 NSA Act) empowering the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, to appoint NSA employees.  Claiming that the 1959 NSA Act does not authorize removals, and that he could only be discharged under 5 U.S.C.  7532 -- which provides that, ""[n]otwithstanding other statutes,"" the head of an agency ""may"" suspend and then remove employees ""in the interests of national security,"" so long as they have been given, inter alia, a preremoval hearing by the agency head or his designee -- respondent requested a hearing before the Secretary.  That request was denied on the ground that respondent had been removed under the NSA regulations, which do not include the right to such a hearing, and not pursuant to the Secretary's  7532 summary authority.  Granting summary judgment for petitioners, the Secretary and the NSA Director, in respondent's suit challenging his removal, the District Court held that, although NSA could have elected to proceed under either  7532 or 50 U.S.C.  833 -- which is part of the NSA Personnel Security Procedures Act, and which provides that the Secretary ""may"" remove an NSA employee upon determining that the termination procedures set forth in other statutes ""cannot be invoked consistently with national security"" -- NSA could also proceed under the authority provided by the 1959 NSA Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed as to the optional application of  7532 and vacated the remainder of the District Court's decision, holding that removals for national security reasons must occur under either  7532 or  833, and that, because NSA disclaimed reliance on  833, resort to  7532 rather than NSA's for-cause removal regulations was mandatory.
Held:  Neither  833 nor  7532 barred NSA from invoking its for-cause removal mechanism adopted by regulation pursuant to the 1959 NSA Act..  Pp.  488 U. S. 99-104.
(a) Although the 1959 NSA Act expressly confers only appointment power upon the Secretary, and does not refer to termination, nevertheless, 
Page 488 U. S. 94
 as a matter of statutory construction, the power of removal from office is incident to the power of appointment, absent a specific provision to the contrary.  Keim v. United States, 177 U. S. 290.  There has been no showing that Congress expressly or impliedly indicated a contrary purpose in the 1959 NSA Act or its subsequent amendments.  P.  488 U. S. 99.
(b) That  833 and 7532 are not the exclusive means to remove NSA employees for national security reasons, but instead contemplate alternative recourse to NSA's ordinary removal mechanisms pursuant to the 1959 NSA Act, is established by the express language of those sections.  Thus, since  833 provides that the Secretary ""may"" terminate an employee if other statutory removal procedures cannot be invoked consistently with national security, it follows that recourse may, even must, be had to those other removal procedures where those procedures do not jeopardize national security.  Similarly,  7532 also is not mandatory since, in providing that an agency head ""may"" suspend or remove an employee ""[n]otwithstanding other statutes,"" that section, in effect, declares that, even though other statutes might not permit it, the Secretary may authorize removals pursuant to  7532 procedures, rather than those governing terminations under other laws.  This discretionary aspect of  7532 is manifest in the section's legislative history.  Congress could not have intended that  7532 would be the exclusive procedure in this and like cases, since no national security termination would then be permissible without an initial suspension and adherence to the standard of Cole v. Young, 351 U. S. 536,  351 U. S. 546, whereby a showing of ""immediate threat of harm to the national security'"" is required in order for  7532 to be invoked.  Indeed, when Congress later passed the NSA Personnel Security Procedures Act, it must have intended that  7532 not impose such restrictions on the various affected agencies, since the stringency of the  7532 standard would conflict with the more lenient provisions of that Act authorizing the revocation of a security clearance and consequent dismissal.  The Court of Appeals' view that its construction of  7532 is necessary to provide employees sought to be removed on national security grounds with procedures equivalent to those provided by that section assumes that NSA's ordinary clearance revocation and for cause dismissal procedures are less protective than those guaranteed by  7532, which assumption is not borne out by the record in this case.  More significantly, the Court of Appeals' view that Congress enacted  7532 to extend new protections to such employees runs counter to explicit congressional statements that the legislation was proposed to increase agency heads' authority to suspend and terminate employees on national security grounds.

Syllabus 
The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 (BLBRA), in 30 U.S.C.  902(f)(2), provided that, pending the issuance of permanent regulations by the Secretary of Labor, cases filed or pending, as well as certain claims required to be reopened or readjudicated, were to be assessed under ""[c]riteria . . . not . . . more restrictive than the criteria applicable to a claim filed on June 30, 1973.""  As of that date, under interim regulations established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), a miner could establish presumptive entitlement to benefits if he submitted X-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis, and showed either 10 years of mining service or that his impairment arose out of coal mine employment.  In response to the BLBRA, the Secretary of Labor promulgated an interim regulation that accorded a presumptive claim of entitlement only to miners who had 10 years of experience and could satisfy one of several ""medical requirements,"" including X-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis identical to that required by the interim HEW regulation.  In No. 87-1095, since neither claimant had worked 10 years in the mines, neither qualified for the presumptive entitlement under the interim Labor regulation, and their claims were adjudicated under more stringent permanent regulations originally promulgated by the Secretary of HEW.  Their claims were administratively denied, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the unavailability of the interim Labor presumption to short-term miners violated  902(f)(2).  In Nos. 87-821 and 87-827, the Court of Appeals, having similarly found the interim Labor regulation invalid under  902(f)(2), reversed the District Court's refusal to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of Labor to readjudicate a class of claims previously considered under the interim Labor regulation, notwithstanding that the Secretary's decision in those cases had become final. 
Page 488 U. S. 106

Held:
1. The interim Labor regulation violates  902(f)(2).  Pp.  488 U. S. 113-120.
(a) The Labor criteria are more restrictive than the interim HEW criteria, in that the latter permitted a miner to obtain a presumption of entitlement by establishing pneumoconiosis and either 10 years' coal mining experience or proof that the pneumoconiosis was caused by mining employment, whereas, under the interim Labor regulation, 10 years' experience is the exclusive element of the second factor.  By making the criteria for proving causation ""more restrictive"" for miners who seek a presumptive entitlement and can establish pneumoconiosis, the interim Labor regulation necessarily applies ""more restrictive"" total disability criteria than those in the interim HEW regulation.  Pp.  488 U. S. 113-115.
(b) Even if the ""criteria"" in  902(f)(2) consist solely of ""medical criteria,"" as the Secretary asserts, the interim Labor regulation violates the statute.  Under the interim Labor regulation, unlike the interim HEW regulation, claimants who submit X-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis and can prove causation, but have worked fewer than 10 years in a coal mine, must in addition submit affirmative proof of total disability, which would principally involve submission of underlying medical proof of disability.  Pp.  488 U. S. 115-117.
2. The Court of Appeals in No. 87-1095 properly remanded the case to the Benefits Review Board for further proceedings.  But the Court of Appeals' order in Nos. 87-821 and 87-827 was not proper, since mandamus does not lie to compel the readjudication of claims decided under erroneous standards where the cases had already become final by reason of the claimants' failure to pursue administrative remedies or to appeal directly to the courts within the prescribed time.  Pp.  488 U. S. 121-123.

			"|"Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben
No. 87-821
Argued October 3, 1988
Decided December 6, 1988*
488 U.S. 105

Syllabus 
The Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 (BLBRA), in 30 U.S.C.  902(f)(2), provided that, pending the issuance of permanent regulations by the Secretary of Labor, cases filed or pending, as well as certain claims required to be reopened or readjudicated, were to be assessed under ""[c]riteria . . . not . . . more restrictive than the criteria applicable to a claim filed on June 30, 1973.""  As of that date, under interim regulations established by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), a miner could establish presumptive entitlement to benefits if he submitted X-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis, and showed either 10 years of mining service or that his impairment arose out of coal mine employment.  In response to the BLBRA, the Secretary of Labor promulgated an interim regulation that accorded a presumptive claim of entitlement only to miners who had 10 years of experience and could satisfy one of several ""medical requirements,"" including X-ray, biopsy, or autopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis identical to that required by the interim HEW regulation.  In No. 87-1095, since neither claimant had worked 10 years in the mines, neither qualified for the presumptive entitlement under the interim Labor regulation, and their claims were adjudicated under more stringent permanent regulations originally promulgated by the Secretary of HEW.  Their claims were administratively denied, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the unavailability of the interim Labor presumption to short-term miners violated  902(f)(2).  In Nos. 87-821 and 87-827, the Court of Appeals, having similarly found the interim Labor regulation invalid under  902(f)(2), reversed the District Court's refusal to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Secretary of Labor to readjudicate a class of claims previously considered under the interim Labor regulation, notwithstanding that the Secretary's decision in those cases had become final.

No. 86-1904
Argued October 11, 1988
Decided November 29, 1988
488 U.S. 51

Syllabus 
The victim, a 10-year-old boy, was molested and sodomized by a middle-aged man for 1 1/2 hours.  After the assault, the boy was taken to a hospital, where a physician used a swab from a ""sexual assault kit"" to collect semen samples from the boy's rectum.  The police also collected the boy's clothing, which they failed to refrigerate.  A police criminologist later performed some tests on the rectal swab and the boy's clothing, but he was unable to obtain information about the identity of the boy's assailant.  At trial, expert witnesses testified that respondent might have been completely exonerated by timely performance of tests on properly preserved semen samples.  Respondent was convicted of child molestation, sexual assault, and kidnaping in an Arizona state court.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that the State had breached a constitutional duty to preserve the semen samples from the victim's body and clothing.
Held:  The Due Process Clause did not require the State to preserve the semen samples even though the samples might have been useful to respondent.  Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.  Here, the police's failure to refrigerate the victim's clothing and to perform tests on the semen samples can at worst be described as negligent.  None of this information was concealed from respondent at trial, and the evidence -- such as it was -- was made available to respondent's expert, who declined to perform any tests on the samples.  The Arizona Court of Appeals noted in its opinion -- and this Court agrees -- that there was no suggestion of bad faith on the part of the police.  Moreover, the Due Process Clause was not violated because the State failed to perform a newer test on the semen samples.  The police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests.  Pp.  488 U. S. 55-59.

No. 87-6116
Argued October 12, 1988
Decided November 29, 1988
488 U.S. 75

Syllabus 
After the indigent petitioner and two codefendants were found guilty of several serious crimes in an Ohio state court, the new counsel appointed to represent petitioner on appeal filed with the Ohio Court of Appeals a document captioned ""Certification of Meritless Appeal and Motion,"" which recited that the attorney had carefully reviewed the record, that he had found no errors requiring reversal, and that he would not file a meritless appeal, and which requested leave to withdraw.  The court entered an order that granted the latter motion and that specified that the court would thereafter independently review the record thoroughly to determine whether any reversible error existed.  The court later denied petitioner's request for the appointment of a new attorney.  Subsequently, upon making its own examination of the record without the assistance of counsel for petitioner, the court noted that counsel's certification of meritlessness was ""highly questionable,"" since petitioner had ""several arguable claims,"" and, in fact, reversed one of petitioner's convictions for plain error, but concluded that petitioner ""suffered no prejudice"" as a result of ""counsel's failure to give a more conscientious examination of the record"" because the court had thoroughly examined the record and received the benefit of arguments advanced by the codefendants' counsel.  The court therefore affirmed petitioner's convictions on the remaining counts, and the State Supreme Court dismissed his appeal.
Held:
1. Petitioner was deprived of constitutionally adequate representation on appeal by the Ohio Court of Appeals' failure to follow the procedures set forth in Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738, for allowing appointed counsel for an indigent criminal defendant to withdraw from a first appeal as of right on the basis that the appeal is frivolous.  Under those procedures, counsel must first conduct a ""conscientious examination"" of the case and support a request to withdraw with a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal, and the court must then conduct a full examination of all the proceedings and permit withdrawal if its separate inquiry reveals no nonfrivolous issue, but must appoint new counsel to argue the appeal if such an issue exists.  The state court erred in two respects in not denying counsel's motion to withdraw.  First, the motion was not supported with an ""Anders brief,"" so 
Page 488 U. S. 76
 that the court was left without an adequate basis for determining that counsel had performed his duty of carefully searching the record for arguable error, and was deprived of assistance in the court's own review of the record.  Second, the court should not have acted on the motion before it made its own examination of the record to determine whether counsel's evaluation of the case was sound.  Most significantly, the court erred by failing to appoint new counsel to represent petitioner after determining that the record supported ""several arguable claims.""  Such a determination creates a constitutional imperative that counsel be appointed, since the need for forceful and vigorous advocacy to ensure that rights are not forgone and that substantial legal and factual arguments are not passed over is of paramount importance in our adversary system of justice, whether at the trial or the appellate stage.  Pp.  488 U. S. 79-85.
2. In cases such as this, it is inappropriate to apply either the lack of prejudice standard of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, or the harmless error analysis of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18.  Such application would render the protections afforded by Anders meaningless, since the appellant would suffer no prejudice or harm from the denial of counsel, and would thus have no basis for complaint, whether the court, on reviewing the bare appellate record, concluded either that the conviction should not be reversed or that there was a basis for reversal.  The Court of Appeals' consideration of the appellate briefs filed on behalf of petitioner's codefendants does not alter this conclusion, since a criminal appellant is entitled to a single-minded advocacy for which the mere possibility of a coincidence of interest with a represented codefendant is an inadequate proxy.  More significantly, the question whether the briefs filed by the codefendants, along with the court's own review of the record, adequately focused the court's attention on petitioner's arguable claims is itself an issue that should have been resolved in an adversary proceeding.  Furthermore, it is important that the denial of counsel in this case left petitioner completely without representation during the appellate court's actual decisional process, since such a total denial is legally presumed to result in prejudice, and can never be considered harmless error, whether at the trial or the appellate stage.

No. 87-1277
Argued October 3, 1988
Decided November 14, 1988
488 U.S. 33

Syllabus 
Arkansas' habitual criminal statute provides that a defendant who is convicted of a class B felony may be sentenced to an enhanced term of imprisonment if the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt, at a separate sentencing hearing, that he has at least four prior felony convictions.  At respondent's sentencing hearing following his guilty plea to a class B felony, the State introduced certified copies of four prior felony convictions, one of which, unbeknownst to the prosecutor, had been pardoned by the Governor.  The case was submitted to the jury, which found that the State had met its burden of proving four prior felony convictions and imposed an enhanced sentence.  Several years later, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, contending that the enhanced sentence was invalid because one of the convictions used to support it had been pardoned.  The District Court determined that the conviction in question had in fact been pardoned, and set aside the enhanced sentence.  The District Court then held, in reliance on Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1 (1978), that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited the State from attempting to resentence respondent as a habitual offender on the basis of another prior conviction not offered or admitted at the initial sentencing hearing.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that the pardoned conviction was inadmissible under state law, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbade retrial because the remaining evidence adduced at trial was legally insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict of enhancement.
Held:  When a reviewing court determines that a defendant's conviction must be set aside because certain evidence was erroneously admitted against him, and further finds that, once that evidence is discounted, there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not forbid his retrial so long as the sum of the evidence offered by the State and admitted by the trial court -- whether erroneously or not -- would have been sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict.  The general rule is that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the retrial of a defendant who succeeds in getting his conviction set aside for such ""trial errors"" as the incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence.  The Burks exception to that rule is based on the view that a reversal for 
Page 488 U. S. 34
 evidentiary insufficiency is the functional equivalent of a trial court's granting a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.  Because a trial court, in passing on such a motion, considers all of the evidence it has admitted, it must be this same quantum of evidence which is considered in deciding whether retrial is permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Permitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of oppression at which the Double Jeopardy Clause is aimed, but simply affords the defendant an opportunity to obtain a fair adjudication of his guilt free from error.

The general rule is that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the retrial of a defendant who succeeds in getting his conviction set aside for such ""trial errors"" as the incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence.  The Burks exception to that rule is based on the view that a reversal for 
Page 488 U. S. 34
 evidentiary insufficiency is the functional equivalent of a trial court's granting a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.  Because a trial court, in passing on such a motion, considers all of the evidence it has admitted, it must be this same quantum of evidence which is considered in deciding whether retrial is permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Permitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of oppression at which the Double Jeopardy Clause is aimed, but simply affords the defendant an opportunity to obtain a fair adjudication of his guilt free from error.  Pp.  488 U. S. 38-42.

|488 u.s. 19|"Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa Department of Revenue
No. 87-984
Argued October 4, 1988
Decided November 8, 1988
488 U.S. 19

Syllabus 
Between tax years 1977 and 1980, a portion of Shell Oil Company's gross revenues was derived from the sale of oil and natural gas extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  Shell sold all of its OCS gas directly at the OCS wellhead platform, but piped most of its OCS crude oil inland, where it was either sold to third parties or refined, which typically involved commingling it with non-OCS oil.  Shell's principal business in Iowa during the years at issue was the sale of oil and chemical products which were manufactured and refined elsewhere and included commingled OCS oil.  In computing its Iowa corporate income taxes for those years, Shell adjusted the apportionment formula the State uses to calculate in-state taxable income -- under which that portion of overall net income that is ""reasonably attributable to the trade or business within the state"" is taxed -- to exclude a figure which Shell claimed reflected income earned from the OCS.  The Iowa formula had previously been upheld against Due Process and Commerce Clause challenges in Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267.  The Iowa Department of Revenue rejected Shell's modification of the formula and found the tax payments deficient, which decision was affirmed by a county district court and by the Iowa Supreme Court.  Both courts rejected Shell's contention that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) preempts Iowa's apportionment formula, and therefore prevents the State from taxing income earned from the sale of OCS oil and gas.
Held:  The OCSLA does not prevent Iowa from including income earned from the sale of OCS oil and gas in its apportionment formula.  In adopting for the OCS the civil and criminal laws of ""each adjacent state,"" the OCSLA does provide that ""[s]tate taxation laws shall not apply"" and further specifies that such adoption ""shall never be interpreted as a basis for [a State's] claiming any interest in [the OCS] or the revenues therefrom.""  However, the above-quoted provisions, when read in the context of the entire section in which they appear, and the background and legislative history of the OCSLA, establish that Congress was exclusively concerned with preventing adjacent States from asserting, on the basis of territorial claims, jurisdiction to assess on the OCS those direct taxes commonly imposed by States adjacent to offshore production sites, and did not intend to prohibit a State from taxing income from OCS-derived oil and gas, provided that it does so pursuant to a constitutionally 
Page 488 U. S. 20
 permissible apportionment scheme such as Iowa's.  The inclusion of OCS-derived income in the unitary tax base of such a formula does not amount to extraterritorial taxation prohibited by the OCSLA.  Shell's argument that, even if the OCSLA allows a State to include in its preapportioned tax base the sales of OCS crude oil which occur off the OCS, the taxing State may not include in that base the value of the natural gas sales made at the OCS wellhead is rejected, since, on its face, the OCSLA makes no such distinction, and, in general, it is irrelevant for the makeup of the apportionment formula's unitary tax base that third-party sales occur outside of the State.  Pp.  488 U. S. 24-31.

for the Advancement of Colored People
No. 87-1961
Decided November 7, 1988
488 U.S. 15

Syllabus 
The town of Huntington, N.Y. has a zoning classification permitting, inter alia, private construction of multifamily housing projects, but only in the town's urban renewal area, where 52% of the residents are minorities.  A private developer, after acquiring an option to purchase a site in a 98% white section of town zoned for single family residences, requested the town board to amend the code to permit multifamily rental construction by private developers townwide.  The board rejected this request.  Appellees filed a complaint in the District Court against appellants alleging, among other things, that appellants had violated Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 by refusing to amend the zoning code and by refusing to rezone the proposed building site.  Appellants conceded that the facial challenge to the code should be evaluated under a disparate impact standard.  The District Court rejected appellees' claims.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed as to both claims, holding, with regard to the town's failure to amend the zoning code, that appellees had established a prima facie case of discriminatory impact, which appellants had failed to rebut.  It ordered the town to strike the zoning limitation from the code, and to rezone the project site.
Held:
1. This Court expressly declines to review the judgment below insofar as it relates to the refusal to rezone the project site, because that portion of the case does not implicate this Court's mandatory jurisdiction.
2. Since appellants conceded the applicability of the disparate impact test, this Court does not decide whether that test is the appropriate one.  Assuming that test applies, the Court is satisfied on this record that appellees have shown that the zoning restriction has a disparate impact, and that the justification proffered by appellants to rebut the prima facie case is inadequate.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 7, 1988
 On applications for stay. 
 The applications for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court are denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, and with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins as to Part II, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the stay of execution. 
 II  
 Even were I not of the foregoing view, I would vote to grant Mr. Daugherty's applications for a stay of execution and hold his case pending our decision in Adams v. Dugger, No. 87-121, cert. granted, 485 U.S. 933 (1988). I reach this conclusion not only because of the similarity of the claims raised by Adams and Daugherty, but also because I do not see a basis for distinguishing Daugherty's case from others that we already have agreed to hold for Adams. 
 In September of this year, we granted a stay of execution in Preston v. Florida, 487 U.S. 1265, on the assumption that we would hold Preston's case pending decision in Adams. In Preston, the prosecutor and trial judge had made statements empha- 
Page 488 U.S. 936 , 937
 sizing that the jury's sentence was merely advisory and that the judge remained responsible for the sentence ultimately imposed. Since we granted the stay without knowing the precise nature of those remarks ( neither party quoted them to us), we do not know whether the statements made at Daughterty's sentencing hearing were any different from those made at Preston's. Given this uncertainty, we are hardly in a position to deny Daugherty's application for a stay on the ground that Preston's Caldwell claim, Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), was more substantial than Daugherty's. 
 In this case, the prosecutor told that jury that its verdict was "" advisory,"" that the trial judge had the ""final say"" as to the sentence, and that the judge ""is the last person who will consider what the penalty is going to be"" and thus serves as a ""buffer"" to make sure that mistakes do not occur. Application 17. Several cases that we have held for Adams present facts strikingly similar to these. In Ford v. Dugger, No. 88-5582, for example, the judge told the jury several times that its sentence was "" advisory"" and ""not binding on the court."" Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5582, p. 11. In Spisak v. Ohio, No. 88-5169, the judge stated that the jury's recommendation was ""just that, a recommendation,"" and that ""the final decision is placed by law upon the court."" Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5169, p. 15. The jury in Grossman v. Florida, No. 88-5136, learned from the prosecutor that the ""judge is the one"" who makes the sentencing decision and ""ultimately passes sentence,"" that the jury's ""recommendation to him is that only, a recommendation,"" and that ""the judge will do that"" (that is, impose the sentence of death), Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-5136, p. 10; in response, the judge told the jury: ""As you have been told, the final decision as to what punishment shall be imposed is the responsibility of the judge."" Id., at 11. Finally, in Harich v. Dugger, No. 88-5216, the judge told the jury that its verdict was merely a ""recommendation to the Court,"" that the court ""pronounces whatever sentence it sees fit,"" that "" the penalty is for the court to decide,"" and that the ""final decision as to . . . punishment . . . rests solely upon the judge."" Brief in Opposition in No. 88-5216, p. 3. I am unable to conclude that the jury in Daugherty's case received a message significantly different from that received by the juries in Ford, Spisak, Grossman, and Harich. 
 The difference between those four cases and this one is that a warrant has been issued for Mr. Daugherty's execution whereas [488 U.S. 936 , 938]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 November 7, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting. 
 In Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 49 L. Ed.2d 683 (1976), we held that an order restraining the news media from reporting or 
Page 488 U.S. 946 , 947
 commenting on public judicial proceedings was a prior restraint on speech and that the State had not in that case overcome the high barriers to the use of a prior restraint. Id., at 570. The restraining order in this case is directed against the participants in the trial, not against the media, but it is likewise challenged by various news agencies as an unconstitutional prior restraint. 
 This case arises out of the trial of several criminal defendants, including Representative Mario Biaggi and former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, on federal racketeering charges based on their involvement with Wedtech, a South Bronx military contractor. On April 23, 1987, at the request of the defendants, the District Court entered an order restraining the prosecutors, defendants, and defense counsel from making extrajudicial statements to the press. The Government initially concurred in the order but eventually joined with petitioners, the news agencies, in seeking to have the order vacated. On July 10, 1987, the District Court modified its order to allow the parties to state, without elaboration, matters of public record and to explain, without characterization, the substance of any motion or step in the proceedings. Otherwise, however, the court continued the order in force. 
 Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which affirmed the July 10 order. After finding that petitioners had standing to complain, the court stated that ""there is a fundamental difference between a gag order challenged by the individual gagged and one challenged by a third party; an order objected to by the former is properly characterized as a prior restraint, one opposed solely by the latter is not."" In re Application of Dow Jones & Co., 842 F.2d 603, 609 (1988). Because only the news agencies opposed the restraining order, the court concluded that a prior restraint had not been imposed. The court then held that the restraining order was justified because there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" that pretrial publicity would otherwise have prejudiced the defendants' rights to a fair trial. Id., at 610. 
 By so holding, the Second Circuit joined the Ninth Circuit, which had previously refused to treat as a prior restraint a restraining order directed against the parties and challenged only by the media.

|488 u.s. 9|"Pennsylvania v. Bruder
No. 88-161
Decided October 31, 1988
488 U.S. 9

Syllabus 
After his vehicle was stopped by a police officer, respondent Bruder took field sobriety tests and, in answer to questions, stated that he had been drinking.  He failed the tests, and was then arrested and given Miranda warnings.  At his trial, his statements and conduct before arrest were admitted into evidence, and he was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed the conviction on the ground that the statements that Bruder uttered during the roadside questioning were elicited through custodial interrogation, and should have been suppressed for lack of Miranda warnings.
Held:  Bruder was not entitled to a recitation of his constitutional rights prior to arrest, and his roadside responses to questioning were admissible.  The rule of Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 -- that ordinary traffic stops do not involve custody for the purposes of Miranda -- governs this case.  Although unquestionably a seizure, this stop had the same noncoercive aspects as the Berkemer detention:  a single police officer asking Bruder a modest number of questions and requesting him to perform simple tests in a location visible to passing motorists.
Certiorari granted; 365 Pa.Super. 106, 528 A.2d 1385, reversed.

			"|"Pennsylvania v. Bruder
No. 88-161
Decided October 31, 1988
488 U.S. 9

Syllabus 
After his vehicle was stopped by a police officer, respondent Bruder took field sobriety tests and, in answer to questions, stated that he had been drinking.  He failed the tests, and was then arrested and given Miranda warnings.  At his trial, his statements and conduct before arrest were admitted into evidence, and he was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed the conviction on the ground that the statements that Bruder uttered during the roadside questioning were elicited through custodial interrogation, and should have been suppressed for lack of Miranda warnings.
Held:  Bruder was not entitled to a recitation of his constitutional rights prior to arrest, and his roadside responses to questioning were admissible.  The rule of Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 -- that ordinary traffic stops do not involve custody for the purposes of Miranda -- governs this case.  Although unquestionably a seizure, this stop had the same noncoercive aspects as the Berkemer detention:  a single police officer asking Bruder a modest number of questions and requesting him to perform simple tests in a location visible to passing motorists.
Certiorari granted; 365 Pa.Super. 106, 528 A.2d 1385, reversed."|

Nos. 991-993
Argued October 12, 1888

Syllabus 
The courts will not interfere by mandamus with the executive officers of the government in the exercise of their ordinary official duties, even where those duties require an interpretation of the law, no appellate power being given them for that purpose.
When an executive officer of the government refuses to act at all in a case in which the law requires him to act, or when, by special statute or otherwise, a mere ministerial duty is imposed upon him -- that is, a service which he is bound to perform without further question -- if he refuses, mandamus lies to compel him to his duty.
The Commissioner of Pensions, by receiving the application of a pensioner for an increase of his pension under the Act of June 16, 1880, 21 Stat. 281, c. 236, and by considering it and the evidence in support of it and by deciding adversely to the petitioner, performs the executive act which the law requires him to perform in such case, and the courts have no appellate power over him in this respect and no right to review his decision.
A decision of the Commissioner of Pensions adverse to the application of a pensioner for an increase of pension under a statute granting an increase in certain cases, being overruled by the Secretary of the Interior on the ground that the applicant comes under the meaning of the law granting the increase, and the Commissioner refusing to carry out the decision of

|488 u.s. 1|"Rhodes v. Stewart
No. 88-139
Decided October 17, 1988
488 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
While in the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, respondent Stewart and one Reese filed a suit in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by prison officials.  After entering a judgment for the plaintiffs, the court entered an award of attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988.  On appeal, petitioners argued that, because Reese had died and Stewart had been released, neither plaintiff had been in the State's custody on the day that the District Court had entered its underlying judgment.  Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals upheld the fees award, concluding that the claim's mootness when the judgment was issued did not undermine Stewart's status as a prevailing party, since he had won a declaratory judgment.  It distinguished this Court's holding in Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 -- that a plaintiff must receive some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to have prevailed within the meaning of  1988 -- on the ground that the plaintiff in Hewitt, unlike Stewart, had not won such a judgment.
Held:  Stewart was not a prevailing party under the rule set forth in Hewitt v. Helms, supra, and therefore was not entitled to an award of fees pursuant to  1988.  Nothing in Hewitt suggested that the entry of a declaratory judgment in a party's favor automatically renders that party prevailing.  A declaratory judgment, like any other judgment, constitutes relief only if it affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff.  There was no such result in this case, since the lawsuit was 
Page 488 U. S. 2
 not brought as a class action, and since Stewart could not benefit from any changes in prison policies caused by his lawsuit.  Certiorari granted; 845 F.2d 327, reversed.

 Douglas Vincent METHENYv. M.C. HAMBY, Warden, et al. No. 87-6703. 
 Supreme Court of the United States October 17, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case and one other in which the Court denies certiorari today- Bryant v. United States, 488 U.S. 916 present the question whether violations of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) are cognizable in federal habeas corpus proceedings. 
 I  
 The IAD question is one that has divided the Courts of Appeals. Most of the Circuits have held that violations of the IAD, without more, do not make out a claim for relief under either 2254 or 2255.1 In this case, the Sixth Circuit found that petitioner could not obtain habeas relief for an IAD violation in a proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C. 2254; [ Metheny v. Hamby 488 U.S. 913 (1988) ][913-Continued.] 
in the other case disposed of today, Bryant, supra, the Fourth Circuit reached a similar conclusion with respect to a 2255 action. This majority position among the Courts of Appeals, however, has been rejected by at least two Circuits, with a third also somewhat in disagreement. [Footnote 2] This issue has been presented to the Court for its consideration on several occasions in the past; the Court has, unfortunately, refused to resolve this persistent conflict among the lower federal courts. See, e.g ., Haskins v. Virginia, 484 U.S. 1037 (1988 ) (WHITE, J., dissenting); Kerr v. Finkbeiner, 474 U.S. 929 (1985) (WHITE, J., dissenting). 
 Once again, I dissent from this Court's denial of review on this question. There is nothing to commend having habeas corpus 
Page 488 U.S. 913 , 914
 available in some Circuits and not in others. I would grant certiorari in this case to resolve the split of authority among the Courts of Appeals. 
 II  
 These two IAD cases, however, are not the only two presenting conflicts among the courts over the interpretation of federal statutes (or constitutional provisions), on which the Court has denied review already this Term. In 14 other cases this Term, the Court has declined to review judgments which created or exacerbated existing splits in authority among the state and/or federal courts. See, e.g., Texas v. Modgling, 488 U.S. 898; Boyle v. Illinois, 488 U.S. 898; Lauritzen v. McLaughlin, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 243; Cleveland Newspaper Guild v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 488 U.S. 899; Hartenstine v. Superior Court, 488 U.S. 899; Young v. Langley, 488 U.S. 898; Kahn v. Avnet, Inc., 488 U.S. 898; Feaster v. United States, 488 U.S. 898; Gruenholz v. United States, 488 U.S. 898; Union Pacific R. Co. v. Moritz, 488 U.S. 899; Kreisher v. Mobile Oil Corp., 488 U.S. 899; Robinson v. Connecticut, 488 U.S. 899; Stamler v. Zamboni, 488 U.S. 899; and Torres- Arboledo v. Florida, 488 U.S. 901. I noted my dissent from the denial of review in all of these cases. Most of them present questions of the proper interpretation of federal statutes, and a few involve questions of constitutional interpretation. These questions concern issues that have divided the Courts of Appeals (or, in some instances, the state courts), and require our attention when it is so apparent that some persons are being protected or being sanctioned by the federal law and others are not. I also note that the Court granted certiorari (or noted probable jurisdiction) so far this Term in at least 12 cases which, like these, raise questions of federal statutory interpretation that had divided the lower courts. See, e.g., Lorance v. AT & T Technologies, Inc., 488 U.S. 887; Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 488 U.S. 815; California v. ARC America Corp., 488 U.S. 814d 29; Federal Savings & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ticktin, 488 U.S. 815, 109 S. Ct. 52; Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 488 U.S. 815; Neitzke v. Williams, 488 U.S. 816d 32; Finley v.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 11, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition in order to resolve the question whether a state court, when recognizing a new federal constitutional rule governing criminal procedure, is bound by the retroactivity principles fashioned by this Court, and if so, whether the principle of retroactivity announced in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987), applies to a state-court decision recognizing such a rule, notwithstanding the state court's pre-Griffith determination that, under the retroactivity decisions of this Court then in force, the new rule would be given prospective application only. 
Page 488 U.S. 902 , 903
 II 
 In March 1984, the petitioner was tried in state court for murder. During voir dire, the petitioner proposed that the trial court ask the venirepersons whether they ""believe[d] in the presumption of innocence as it applies to a person charged with a crime."" The trial court refused. The petitioner was subsequently convicted and, after a death penalty hearing, sentenced to death. In his direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, the petitioner argued that the trial court's refusal to ask the proposed question violated People v. Zehr, 103 Ill.2d 472, 83 Ill.Dec. 128, 469 N.E.2d 1062 (1984), which was issued approximately six months after the petitioner's trial concluded. Zehr held that a criminal defendant is deprived of his right to ""a fair and impartial jury"" by a trial court's refusal to question prospective jurors on their view on the presumption of innocence. Id., at 477, 83 Ill.Dec., at 130, 469 N.E.2d, at 1064. 
 The Illinois Supreme Court rejected the petitioner's claim, noting that in People v. Britz, 112 Ill.2d 314, 97 Ill.Dec. 768, 493 N.E.2d 575 ( 1986), it had held that Zehr would not be applied retroactively because it "" 'represented a change in Illinois law.' "" 116 Ill.2d 323, 338, 107 Ill. Dec. 647, 652, 507 N.E.2d 800, 805 (1987) (quoting Britz, supra, 112 Ill. 2d, at 319, 97 Ill.Dec., at 770, 493 N.E.2d, at 577). Justice Simon dissented, finding that Britz could not be squared with this Court's subsequent decision in Griffith. In Griffith, the Court held that decisions announcing new constitutional rules governing criminal procedure are ""to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final."" 479 U.S., at 328. In so doing, the Court explicitly abandoned the ""clear break"" exception, under which a new constitutional rule would not be applied retroactively if it represented a substantial departure from past precedent or accepted practice. Ibid. 
 As noted above, the Illinois Supreme Court's Britz decision is based on this now-discredited ""clear break"" exception, but the state court nonetheless insisted on applying it in the petitioner's case for reasons not made clear until People v. Harris, 123 Ill.2d 113, 112 Ill.Dec. 76, 526 N.E.2d 335 (1988), cert. den. sub nom. Wilson v. Illinois, 488 U.S. 902.

 Rehearing Denied Nov. 28, 1988. 
 See 109 U.S. 517. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 
Page 488 U.S. 873 , 874
 But even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the petition and vacate the death sentence. Imposing the death penalty on petitioner is squarely inconsistent with this Court's decision in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), where we held constitutionally unacceptable precisely the sorts of jury arguments employed by the Georgia prosecutor here. 
 Petitioner was convicted of murder, rape, armed robbery, and burglary, and was sentenced to death for the murder. In his opening statement at the sentencing phase, the prosecutor told the jury it had reached the phase of the proceedings where "" 'you make the decision as to the punishment.' "" Pet. for Cert. 5. But then he continued: 
 "" 'But how did we get to right here? You got here because the district attorney, that's me, as the agent of the State[,] made the decision to seek the death penalty in this case. Not any of you all but by law the only person who can do that. So you didn't bring us here. No one else did. That was my decision and that's why you can choose not to impose the death penalty if you want to, for any reason or no reason whatsoever. But that decision seeking the death penalty was already made. So don't feel like it is yours and have it weigh too heavily on you because that was my decision.' "" Id., at 5-6 ( emphasis added). 
 In his closing remarks, the prosecutor again informed the jury that "" ' [y]ou are simply one more step in the procedure.' "" He concluded by asserting that by comparison with the victim's suffering, the jury's decision was easy: "" 'To infer or to interfere with justice by saying that your verdict of a proper punishment for William Anthony Lipham is only a life sentence is a joke. A very sad joke.' "" Id., at 8. 
 Allowing petitioner's death sentence to stand cannot possibly be squared with Caldwell. In that case, we overturned the death sentence in a case in which the prosecutor had noted to the jury that "" 'the decision you render is automatically reviewable by the Supreme Court.' "" We stated there that ""it is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhere."" 472 U.S., at 328-329, 105 S.Ct. at 2639. The rationale for that holding was that jurors charged with deciding whether capital punish- [488 U.S. 873 , 875]

 Supreme Court of the United States October 3, 1988 Rehearing Denied Nov. 28, 1988. See 488 U.S. 976. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I also continue to believe that the death penalty's cruel and unusual nature is made all the more arbitrary and freakish when it is imposed by a judge in the face of a jury determination that the appropriate penalty is life imprisonment. See Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 467, 3166d 340 (1984) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Therefore, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate petitioner's death sentence for the reasons I expressed in Jones v. Alabama, 470 U.S. 1062, 1063, 1780 (1985) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting). 

 In this case, after a full hearing, the jury determined that life imprisonment, not death, was the punishment which petitioner deserved. Nevertheless, following Alabama law which allows him wide discretion in death sentences, the trial judge overrode the jury's determination and sentenced petitioner to death. I continue to believe that ""[i]t approaches the most literal sense of the word 'arbitrary' to put one to death in the face of a contrary jury determination where it is accepted that the jury had indeed responsibly carried out its task.""

 Anthony James MANNv. OKLAHOMA. No. 87-7101. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 3, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting: 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not take this view, [ Mann v. Oklahoma 488 U.S. 877 (1988) ][877-Continued.] 
I would grant the petition in order to resolve the question whether inflammatory and prejudicial photographs of the victim's body introduced during the guilt phase of a capital trial, and subsequently reincorporated during the sentencing phase, violate the accused's constitutional right to a reliable sentencing determination. The Court granted certiorari on a very similar question last Term in Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988), but did not decide it because the Court found that the petitioner in that case, who was 15 years old at the time of the offense, could not be subjected to the death penalty under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See id., at 838, n. 48, 108 S.Ct. at 2700, n. 48 (plurality opinion). 
 The petitioner here, an adult, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death for his role in the same murder which gave rise to Thompson, supra. During the guilt phase of the petitioner's trial, the prosecution introduced two color photographs of the victim's body that were taken after the body had been retrieved from a river one month after the murder. These photographs were reincorporated by the prosecution during the sentencing phase of the trial. On direct appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals found that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs due to their ""gruesome"" and ""inordinately grisley [sic]"" nature. 749 P.2d 1151, 1156 (1988). The court concluded, however, that the error was harmless because ""the case against appellant was sufficient"" without the photographs and thus the court could ""not find this evidence affected the jury's verdict."" Ibid. 
 Significantly, the court never considered whether the introduction of the photographic evidence violated the petitioner's ""constitutional rights by virtue of its being considered at the penalty phase"" of his trial. Thompson, supra, 487 U.S., at 838, n. 48, 108 S.Ct. at 2700, n. 48. The state court's analysis is therefore fatally flawed in that it did not accord 
Page 488 U.S. 877 , 878
 any weight whatsoever to ""the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments."" California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992, 998, 3452 (1983). As to the specific claim, moreover, the petitioner argues convincingly that the photographic evidence created an impermissible risk that his death sentence was based on considerations that are ""totally irrelevant to the sentencing process,"" Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 885, 2747 (1983), because it focused the jury's attention on the postmortem decomposition of the victim's body rather than on ""the character of the [defendant] and the circumstances of the crime."" Id., at 879, 103 S.Ct. at 2743. Indeed, photographic evidence of this sort seems no less inflammatory or prejudicial than the victim impact statements deemed inadmissible in Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987). 
 The introduction in capital trials of ghastly photographs of the victim presents substantial and recurring issues of constitutional dimension, see, e.g., Tucker v. Kemp, 480 U.S. 911, 94 L. Ed.2d 529 (1987) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), that warrant plenary review by the Court. I dissent.

 Petitioner was convicted for the murder-kidnaping of the son of a prominent local banking family. Pretrial publicity was extensive. All members of the jury had read or heard of the murder-kidnaping.

I do not doubt that their representations that they could set aside their opinions and listen to the evidence were sincere.

 The applications for stay of Henry G. Spallone, Nicholas Longo, Edward Fagan, and Peter Chema presented to Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court are granted pending the timely filing and disposition by this Court of petitions for writs of certiorari. 
 The application for stay of the City of Yonkers presented to Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 
 On 856 F.2d 444. The Court of Appeals stayed issuance of its mandate until September 2, to permit application for a stay of the contempt sanctions pending filing and consideration of petitions for writs of certiorari. The city of Yonkers and the four councilmembers have sought such a stay. Today the Court denies a stay as to the city but grants it as to the four councilmembers. I believe that the Court should deny the stay as to the councilmembers as well.

 I  
 In 1980, the United States filed suit against the city of Yonkers, claiming it had intentionally perpetuated and aggravated residential racial segregation in violation of the Constitution and Title 
Page 487 U.S. 1251 , 1252
 VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 81, 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, and had intentionally segregated its schools in violation of the Constitution. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was accorded plaintiff-intervenor status. In 1985, the District Court held the city liable for intentional housing and school segregation, United States v. Yonkers Board of Education, 624 F.Supp. 1276 ( SDNY1985), finding, inter alia, that the city had deliberately concentrated virtually all of its public and subsidized housing in southwest Yonkers in order to maintain residential segregation. The District Court issued a Housing Remedy Order which directed the city to establish a fair housing policy, to construct 200 units of public housing, and to plan additional units of subsidized housing. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed both the liability and remedy rulings, United States v. Yonkers Board of Education, 837 F.2d 1181 (1987), and the Court denied the city's petition for a writ of certiorari. 486 U.S. 1055 (1988). 
 On November 15, 1986, the city informed the District Court that it would not comply with the Housing Remedy Order. The United States and the NAACP moved for an adjudication of civil contempt and the imposition of coercive sanctions, but the District Court instead sought voluntary compliance with its earlier order. After negotiations, the city council- the city's sole governing authority-agreed to appoint an outside housing adviser to identify sites for the 200 units of public housing and to draft a long-term plan for subsidized housing. Over a year passed. On January 28, 1988, the parties entered into a consent decree, approved by the District Court, which set a new timetable for the construction of the 200 public housing units. The city pledged that it would not seek further review of the Housing Remedy Order or any subsequently entered decree relating to these 200 units. In addition, the city agreed that the construction of 800 units of subsidized housing was an appropriate remedy and pledged to make good-faith efforts to build the additional 600 units within the next three years. Section 17 of the consent decree obligated the city ""to adopt . . . legislation"" necessary to meet the goal of 800 units, including tax abatements, zoning changes, and, within 90 days, a package of incentives for local development. Section 18 provided for further negotiations and the submission of a draft of a second consent decree setting forth long-range plans for subsidized hous- [487 U.S. 1251 , 1253]

 On applications for stay. [ Spallone v. U.S. 487 U.S. 1251 (1988) ][1251-Continued.] 
 The applications for stay of Henry G. Spallone, Nicholas Longo, Edward Fagan, and Peter Chema presented to Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court are granted pending the timely filing and disposition by this Court of petitions for writs of certiorari. 
 The application for stay of the City of Yonkers presented to Justice MARSHALL and by him referred to the Court is denied. 
 On 856 F.2d 444. The Court of Appeals stayed issuance of its mandate until September 2, to permit application for a stay of the contempt sanctions pending filing and consideration of petitions for writs of certiorari. The city of Yonkers and the four councilmembers have sought such a stay. Today the Court denies a stay as to the city but grants it as to the four councilmembers. I believe that the Court should deny the stay as to the councilmembers as well. 
 Justice MARSHALL, joined by Justice BRENNAN, concurring in the denial of stay in No. A-175, and dissenting from the grant of stay in Nos. A-172, A-173, and A-174. 
 I  
 In 1980, the United States filed suit against the city of Yonkers, claiming it had intentionally perpetuated and aggravated residential racial segregation in violation of the Constitution and Title 
Page 487 U.S. 1251 , 1252
 VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 81, 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619, and had intentionally segregated its schools in violation of the Constitution. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was accorded plaintiff-intervenor status. In 1985, the District Court held the city liable for intentional housing and school segregation, United States v. Yonkers Board of Education, 624 F.Supp. 1276 ( SDNY1985), finding, inter alia, that the city had deliberately concentrated virtually all of its public and subsidized housing in southwest Yonkers in order to maintain residential segregation. The District Court issued a Housing Remedy Order which directed the city to establish a fair housing policy, to construct 200 units of public housing, and to plan additional units of subsidized housing. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed both the liability and remedy rulings, United States v. Yonkers Board of Education, 837 F.2d 1181 (1987), and the Court denied the city's petition for a writ of certiorari. 486 U.S. 1055 (1988). 
 On November 15, 1986, the city informed the District Court that it would not comply with the Housing Remedy Order. The United States and the NAACP moved for an adjudication of civil contempt and the imposition of coercive sanctions, but the District Court instead sought voluntary compliance with its earlier order. After negotiations, the city council- the city's sole governing authority-agreed to appoint an outside housing adviser to identify sites for the 200 units of public housing and to draft a long-term plan for subsidized housing. Over a year passed. On January 28, 1988, the parties entered into a consent decree, approved by the District Court, which set a new timetable for the construction of the 200 public housing units. The city pledged that it would not seek further review of the Housing Remedy Order or any subsequently entered decree relating to these 200 units. In addition, the city agreed that the construction of 800 units of subsidized housing was an appropriate remedy and pledged to make good-faith efforts to build the additional 600 units within the next three years. Section 17 of the consent decree obligated the city ""to adopt . . . legislation"" necessary to meet the goal of 800 units, including tax abatements, zoning changes, and, within 90 days, a package of incentives for local development. Section 18 provided for further negotiations and the submission of a draft of a second consent decree setting forth long-range plans for subsidized hous- [487 U.S. 1251 , 1253]

 June 30, 1988
 Rehearing Denied Sept. 15, 1988. 
 See 487 U.S. 1263. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973-2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case, because the sentence was secured in flagrant violation of our decision in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985). 
 In Caldwell we vacated a sentence of death because the prosecutor "" sought to minimize the jury's sense of the importance of its role"" by stressing to the jury that its verdict would be subject to appellate review. Id., at 325. The prosecutor told the jury during the sentencing phase that ""your decision is not the final de- 
Page 487 U.S. 1241 , 1242
 cision. . . . Your job is reviewable."" Ibid. We held that ""it is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhere."" Id., at 328-329-2640. 
 Petitioner's sentence of death cannot be squared with our decision in Caldwell. The prosecutor in this case made the following argument to the jury at the penalty phase of petitioner's trial: 
 ""The opinion, which you will come to a conclusion when you go back and deliberate-Let me say this, it will be only an advisory opinion. The law provides for you to present this to the Court for their consideration. The ultimate decisions [sic] rests with Judge Reynolds. He will be the one to take whatever ruling that you send out and decide whether it will be life without parole or death by electrocution in the electric chair."" Pet. for Cert. 3. 
 This argument, perhaps even more baldly than the statements in Caldwell, sought to minimize the jury's sense of its awesome responsibility to determine whether petitioner would live or die by encouraging the jury to view its verdict as merely ""advisory."" This shifting of the jury's sense of responsibility to another decisionmaker, as we explained at length in Caldwell, undermines the reliability of the jury's decision and conditions the jury to return the death penalty. See 372 U.S., at 330-333-2647. 
 That the prosecutor in this case told the jury that the trial judge would make the ultimate decision, whereas the prosecutor in Caldwell identified the appellate court as the ultimate decisionmaker, is a distinction without a difference. Caldwell makes plain that a death penalty cannot stand where the jury is led to believe that the defendant's life rests in some other hands. The constitutional infirmity here is thus no different from that in Caldwell, and the sentence of death no less intolerable. I therefore would grant the petition and reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama to the extent it sustains the imposition of the death penalty.

No. 87-253
Argued March 30, 1988
Decided June 29, 1988*
487 U.S. 589

Syllabus 
A group of federal taxpayers, clergymen, and the American Jewish Congress (hereinafter appellees) filed this action in Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and challenging the constitutionality, under the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, of the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA or Act), which authorizes federal grants to public or nonprofit private organizations or agencies for services and research in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy.  The Act provides, inter alia, that a grantee must furnish certain types of services, including various types of counseling and education relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations; that the complexity of the problem requires the involvement of religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector, as well as governmental agencies; and that grantees may not use funds for certain purposes, including family planning services and the promotion of abortion.  Federal funding under the Act has gone to a wide variety of recipients, including organizations with institutional ties to religious denominations.  Granting summary judgment for appellees, the court declared that the Act, both on its face and as applied, violated the Establishment Clause insofar as it provided for the involvement of religious organizations in the federally funded programs.
Held:
1. The Act, on its face, does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  487 U. S. 600-618.
(a) With regard to the first factor of the applicable three-part test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, the AFLA has a valid secular purpose.  The face of the Act shows that it was motivated primarily, if not entirely, by the legitimate purpose of eliminating or reducing social and economic problems caused by teenage sexuality, pregnancy, 
Page 487 U. S. 590
 and parenthood.  Although the Act, in amending its predecessor, increased the role of religious organizations in programs sponsored by the Act, the challenged provisions were also motivated by other, entirely legitimate secular concerns, such as attempting to enlist the aid of other groups in the private sector to increase broad-based community involvement.  Pp.  487 U. S. 602-604.
(b) As to the second Lemon factor, the Act does not have the primary effect of advancing religion.  It authorizes grants to institutions that are capable of providing certain services to adolescents, and requires that potential grantees describe how they will involve other organizations, including religious organizations, in the funded programs.  However, there is no requirement that grantees be affiliated with any religious denomination, and the services to be provided under the Act are not religious in character.  The Act's approach toward dealing with adolescent sexuality and pregnancy is not inherently religious, although it may coincide with the approach taken by certain religions.  The provisions expressly mentioning the role of religious organizations reflect, at most, Congress' considered judgment that religious organizations can help solve the problems to which the Act is addressed.  When, as Congress found, prevention of adolescent sexual activity and pregnancy depends primarily upon developing close family ties, it seems sensible for Congress to recognize that religious organizations can influence family life.  To the extent that this congressional recognition has any effect of advancing religion, the effect is, at most, ""incidental and remote.""  Moreover, to the extent that religious institutions, along with other types of organizations, are allowed to participate as recipients of federal funds, nothing on the Act's face suggests that it is anything but neutral with respect to the grantee's status as a sectarian or purely secular institution.  The possibility that AFLA grants may go to religious institutions that can be considered ""pervasively sectarian"" is not sufficient to conclude that no grants whatsoever can be given to religious organizations.  Nor does the Act necessarily have the effect of advancing religion because religiously affiliated AFLA grantees will be providing educational and counseling services to adolescents; because it authorizes ""teaching"" by religious grantees on matters that are fundamental elements of religious doctrine; because of any ""crucial symbolic link"" between government and religion; or because the statute lacks an express provision preventing the use of federal funds for religious purposes.  Pp.  487 U. S. 604-615.
(c) With regard to the third Lemon factor, the Act does not create an excessive entanglement of church and state.  The monitoring of AFLA grants is necessary to ensure that public money is to be spent in the way that Congress intended, and in a way that comports with the Establishment Clause.  However, there is no reason to assume that the religious 
Page 487 U. S. 591
 organizations which may receive AFLA grants are ""pervasively sectarian"" in the same sense as parochial schools have been held to be in cases finding excessive ""entanglement.""  There is accordingly no reason to fear that the less intensive monitoring involved here will cause the Government to intrude unduly in the day-to-day operations of the religiously affiliated grantees.  Pp.  487 U. S. 615-618.
2. The case is remanded for further consideration of whether the statute, as applied, violates the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  487 U. S. 618-624.
(a) Appellees have standing to raise the claim that the AFLA is unconstitutional as applied.  Federal taxpayers have standing to raise Establishment Clause claims against exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending power of Article I,  8, of the Constitution.  Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83.  There is no merit to appellants' contention that a challenge to the AFLA ""as applied"" is really a challenge to executive action.  The claim that AFLA funds are being used improperly by individual grantees is not any less a challenge to congressional taxing and spending power simply because the funding authorized by Congress has flowed through and been administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464; and Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208, distinguished.  Pp.  418 U. S. 618-620.
(b) On the merits of the ""as applied"" challenge, the District Court did not follow the proper approach in assessing appellees' claim that the Secretary is making grants under the Act that violate the Establishment Clause.  Although the record contains evidence of specific incidents of impermissible behavior by grantees, the case must be remanded for consideration of the evidence insofar as it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently being administered.  If the Court concludes on the evidence presented that grants are being made by the Secretary in violation of the Establishment Clause, an appropriate remedy would be to require the Secretary to withdraw the approval of such grants.  Pp.  487 U. S. 620-622.
657 F.Supp. 1547, reversed and remanded.

No. 87-1279
Argued April 26, 1988
Decided June 29, 1988
487 U.S. 654

Syllabus 
This case presents the question of the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Act).  It arose when the House Judiciary Committee began an investigation into the Justice Department's role in a controversy between the House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to the Agency's limited production of certain documents that had been subpoenaed during an earlier House Investigation.  The Judiciary Committee's Report suggested that an official of the Attorney General's Office (appellee Olson) had given false testimony during the earlier EPA investigation, and that two other officials of that Office (appellees Schmults and Dinkins) had obstructed the EPA investigation by wrongfully withholding certain documents.  A copy of the Report was forwarded to the Attorney General with a request, pursuant to the Act, that he seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the allegations against appellees.  Ultimately, pursuant to the Act's provisions, the Special Division (a special court created by the Act) appointed appellant as independent counsel with respect to Olson only, and gave her jurisdiction to investigate whether Olson's testimony, or any other matter related thereto, violated federal law, and to prosecute any violations.  When a dispute arose between independent counsel and the Attorney General, who refused to furnish as ""related matters"" the Judiciary Committee's allegations against Schmults and Dinkins, the Special Division ruled that its grant of jurisdiction to counsel was broad enough to permit inquiry into whether Olson had conspired with others, including Schmults and Dinkins, to obstruct the EPA investigation.  Appellant then caused a grand jury to issue subpoenas on appellees, who moved in Federal District Court to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the Act's independent counsel provisions were unconstitutional and that appellant accordingly had no authority to proceed.  The court upheld the Act's constitutionality, denied the motions, and later ordered that appellees be held in contempt for continuing to refuse to comply with the subpoenas.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Act violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. II,  2, cl. 2; the limitations 
Page 487 U. S. 655
 of Article III; and the principle of separation of powers by interfering with the President's authority under Article II.
Held:
1. There is no merit to appellant's contention -- based on Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, which limited the issues that may be raised by a person who has been held in contempt for failure to comply with a grand jury subpoena -- that the constitutional issues addressed by the Court of Appeals cannot be raised on this appeal from the District Court's contempt judgment.  The Court of Appeals ruled that, because appellant had failed to object to the District Court's consideration of the merits of appellees' constitutional claims, she had waived her opportunity to contend on appeal that Blair barred review of those claims.  Appellant's contention is not ""jurisdictional"" in the sense that it cannot be waived by failure to raise it at the proper time and place.  Nor is it the sort of claim which would defeat jurisdiction in the District Court by showing that an Article III ""Case or Controversy"" is lacking.  Pp.  487 U. S. 669-670.
2. It does not violate the Appointments Clause for Congress to vest the appointment of independent counsel in the Special Division.  Pp.  487 U. S. 670-677.
(a) Appellant is an ""inferior"" officer for purposes of the Clause, which -- after providing for the appointment of certain federal officials (""principal"" officers) by the President with the Senate's advice and consent -- states that ""the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.""  Although appellant may not be ""subordinate"" to the Attorney General (and the President) insofar as, under the Act, she possesses a degree of independent discretion to exercise the powers delegated to her, the fact that the Act authorizes her removal by the Attorney General indicates that she is to some degree ""inferior"" in rank and authority.  Moreover, appellant is empowered by the Act to perform only certain, limited duties, restricted primarily to investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution for certain federal crimes.  In addition, appellant's office is limited in jurisdiction to that which has been granted by the Special Division pursuant to a request by the Attorney General.  Also, appellant's office is ""temporary"" in the sense that an independent counsel is appointed essentially to accomplish a single task, and when that task is over, the office is terminated, either by counsel herself or by action of the Special Division.  Pp.  487 U. S. 670-673.
(b) There is no merit to appellees' argument that, even if appellant is an ""inferior"" officer, the Clause does not empower Congress to place the power to appoint such an officer outside the Executive Branch -- that 
Page 487 U. S. 656
 is, to make ""interbranch appointments.""  The Clause's language as to ""inferior"" officers admits of no limitation on interbranch appointments, but instead seems clearly to give Congress significant discretion to determine whether it is ""proper"" to vest the appointment of, for example, executive officials in the ""courts of Law.""  The Clause's history provides no support for appellees' position.  Moreover, Congress was concerned when it created the office of independent counsel with the conflicts of interest that could arise in situations when the Executive Branch is called upon to investigate its own high-ranking officers, and the most logical place to put the appointing authority was in the Judicial Branch.  In light of the Act's provision making the judges of the Special Division ineligible to participate in any matters relating to an independent counsel they have appointed, appointment of independent counsel by that court does not run afoul of the constitutional limitation on ""incongruous"" interbranch appointments.  Pp.  487 U. S. 673-677.
3. The powers vested in the Special Division do not violate Article III, under which executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature may not be imposed on judges holding office under Article III.  Pp.  487 U. S. 677-685.
(a) There can be no Article III objection to the Special Division's exercise of the power, under the Act, to appoint independent counsel, since the power itself derives from the Appointments Clause, a source of authority for judicial action that is independent of Article III.  Moreover, the Division's Appointments Clause powers encompass the power to define the independent counsel's jurisdiction.  When, as here, Congress creates a temporary ""office,"" the nature and duties of which will by necessity vary with the factual circumstances giving rise to the need for an appointment in the first place, it may vest the power to define the office's scope in the court as an incident to the appointment of the officer pursuant to the Appointments Clause.  However, the jurisdiction that the court decides upon must be demonstrably related to the factual circumstances that gave rise to the Attorney General's request for the appointment of independent counsel in the particular case.  Pp.  487 U. S. 678-679.
(b) Article III does not absolutely prevent Congress from vesting certain miscellaneous powers in the Special Division under the Act.  One purpose of the broad prohibition upon the courts' exercise of executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature is to maintain the separation between the Judiciary and the other branches of the Federal Government by ensuring that judges do not encroach upon executive or legislative authority or undertake tasks that are more properly accomplished by those branches.  Here, the Division's miscellaneous powers -- such as the passive powers to ""receive"" (but not to act on or specifically approve) various reports from independent counsel or the Attorney General -- do not encroach upon the Executive Branch's authority.  The Act 
Page 487 U. S. 657
 simply does not give the Division power to ""supervise"" the independent counsel in the exercise of counsel's investigative or prosecutorial authority.  And, the functions that the Division is empowered to perform are not inherently ""Executive,"" but are directly analogous to functions that federal judges perform in other contexts.  Pp.  487 U. S. 680-681.
(c) The Special Division's power to terminate an independent counsel's office when counsel's task is completed -- although ""administrative"" to the extent that it requires the Division to monitor the progress of counsel's proceedings and to decide whether counsel's job is ""completed"" -- is not such a significant judicial encroachment upon executive power or upon independent counsel's prosecutorial discretion as to require that the Act be invalidated as inconsistent with Article III.  The Act's termination provisions do not give the Division anything approaching the power to remove the counsel while an investigation or court proceeding is still underway -- this power is vested solely in the Attorney General.  Pp.  487 U. S. 682-683.
(d) Nor does the Special Division's exercise of the various powers specifically granted to it pose any threat to the impartial and independent federal adjudication of claims within the judicial power of the United States.  The Act gives the Division itself no power to review any of the independent counsel's actions or any of the Attorney General's actions with regard to the counsel.  Accordingly, there is no risk of partisan or biased adjudication of claims regarding the independent counsel by that court.  Moreover, the Act prevents the Division's members from participating in
""any judicial proceeding concerning a matter which involves such independent counsel while such independent counsel is serving in that office or which involves the exercise of such independent counsel's official duties, regardless of whether such independent counsel is still serving in that office.""
Pp.  487 U. S. 683-685.
4. The Act does not violate separation of powers principles by impermissibly interfering with the functions of the Executive Branch.  Pp.  487 U. S. 685-696.
(a) The Act's provision restricting the Attorney General's power to remove the independent counsel to only those instances in which he can show ""good cause,"" taken by itself, does not impermissibly interfere with the President's exercise of his constitutionally appointed functions.  Here, Congress has not attempted to gain a role in the removal of executive officials other than its established powers of impeachment and conviction.  The Act instead puts the removal power squarely in the hands of the Executive Branch.  Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714; and Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, distinguished.  The determination of whether the Constitution allows Congress to impose a ""good cause""-type restriction on the President's power to remove an official does not turn on whether or not that official is classified as ""purely executive.""  The 
Page 487 U. S. 658
 analysis contained in this Court's removal cases is designed not to define rigid categories of those officials who may or may not be removed at will by the President, but to ensure that Congress does not interfere with the President's exercise of the ""executive power"" and his constitutionally appointed duty to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"" under Article II.  Cf. Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349.  Here, the Act's imposition of a ""good cause"" standard for removal by itself does not unduly trammel on executive authority.  The congressional determination to limit the Attorney General's removal power was essential, in Congress' view, to establish the necessary independence of the office of independent counsel.  Pp.  487 U. S. 685-693.
(b) The Act, taken as a whole, does not violate the principle of separation of powers by unduly interfering with the Executive Branch's role.  This case does not involve an attempt by Congress to increase its own powers at the expense of the Executive Branch.  The Act does empower certain Members of Congress to request the Attorney General to apply for the appointment of an independent counsel, but the Attorney General has no duty to comply with the request, although he must respond within a certain time limit.  Other than that, Congress' role under the Act is limited to receiving reports or other information and to oversight of the independent counsel's activities, functions that have been recognized generally as being incidental to the legislative function of Congress.  Similarly, the Act does not work any judicial usurpation of properly executive functions.  Nor does the Act impermissibly undermine the powers of the Executive Branch, or disrupt the proper balance between the coordinate branches by preventing the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.  Even though counsel is to some degree ""independent"" and free from Executive Branch supervision to a greater extent than other federal prosecutors, the Act gives the Executive Branch sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure that the President is able to perform his constitutionally assigned duties.  Pp.  487 U. S. 693-696.

			"|"Morrison v. Olson
No. 87-1279
Argued April 26, 1988
Decided June 29, 1988
487 U.S. 654

Syllabus 
This case presents the question of the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (Act).  It arose when the House Judiciary Committee began an investigation into the Justice Department's role in a controversy between the House and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to the Agency's limited production of certain documents that had been subpoenaed during an earlier House Investigation.  The Judiciary Committee's Report suggested that an official of the Attorney General's Office (appellee Olson) had given false testimony during the earlier EPA investigation, and that two other officials of that Office (appellees Schmults and Dinkins) had obstructed the EPA investigation by wrongfully withholding certain documents.  A copy of the Report was forwarded to the Attorney General with a request, pursuant to the Act, that he seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the allegations against appellees.  Ultimately, pursuant to the Act's provisions, the Special Division (a special court created by the Act) appointed appellant as independent counsel with respect to Olson only, and gave her jurisdiction to investigate whether Olson's testimony, or any other matter related thereto, violated federal law, and to prosecute any violations.  When a dispute arose between independent counsel and the Attorney General, who refused to furnish as ""related matters"" the Judiciary Committee's allegations against Schmults and Dinkins, the Special Division ruled that its grant of jurisdiction to counsel was broad enough to permit inquiry into whether Olson had conspired with others, including Schmults and Dinkins, to obstruct the EPA investigation.  Appellant then caused a grand jury to issue subpoenas on appellees, who moved in Federal District Court to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the Act's independent counsel provisions were unconstitutional and that appellant accordingly had no authority to proceed.  The court upheld the Act's constitutionality, denied the motions, and later ordered that appellees be held in contempt for continuing to refuse to comply with the subpoenas.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Act violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. II,  2, cl. 2; the limitations 
Page 487 U. S. 655
 of Article III; and the principle of separation of powers by interfering with the President's authority under Article II.
Held:
1. There is no merit to appellant's contention -- based on Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, which limited the issues that may be raised by a person who has been held in contempt for failure to comply with a grand jury subpoena -- that the constitutional issues addressed by the Court of Appeals cannot be raised on this appeal from the District Court's contempt judgment.  The Court of Appeals ruled that, because appellant had failed to object to the District Court's consideration of the merits of appellees' constitutional claims, she had waived her opportunity to contend on appeal that Blair barred review of those claims.  Appellant's contention is not ""jurisdictional"" in the sense that it cannot be waived by failure to raise it at the proper time and place.  Nor is it the sort of claim which would defeat jurisdiction in the District Court by showing that an Article III ""Case or Controversy"" is lacking.  Pp.  487 U. S. 669-670.
2. It does not violate the Appointments Clause for Congress to vest the appointment of independent counsel in the Special Division.  Pp.  487 U. S. 670-677.
(a) Appellant is an ""inferior"" officer for purposes of the Clause, which -- after providing for the appointment of certain federal officials (""principal"" officers) by the President with the Senate's advice and consent -- states that ""the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.""  Although appellant may not be ""subordinate"" to the Attorney General (and the President) insofar as, under the Act, she possesses a degree of independent discretion to exercise the powers delegated to her, the fact that the Act authorizes her removal by the Attorney General indicates that she is to some degree ""inferior"" in rank and authority.  Moreover, appellant is empowered by the Act to perform only certain, limited duties, restricted primarily to investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution for certain federal crimes.  In addition, appellant's office is limited in jurisdiction to that which has been granted by the Special Division pursuant to a request by the Attorney General.  Also, appellant's office is ""temporary"" in the sense that an independent counsel is appointed essentially to accomplish a single task, and when that task is over, the office is terminated, either by counsel herself or by action of the Special Division.  Pp.  487 U. S. 670-673.
(b) There is no merit to appellees' argument that, even if appellant is an ""inferior"" officer, the Clause does not empower Congress to place the power to appoint such an officer outside the Executive Branch -- that 
Page 487 U. S. 656
 is, to make ""interbranch appointments.""  The Clause's language as to ""inferior"" officers admits of no limitation on interbranch appointments, but instead seems clearly to give Congress significant discretion to determine whether it is ""proper"" to vest the appointment of, for example, executive officials in the ""courts of Law.""  The Clause's history provides no support for appellees' position.  Moreover, Congress was concerned when it created the office of independent counsel with the conflicts of interest that could arise in situations when the Executive Branch is called upon to investigate its own high-ranking officers, and the most logical place to put the appointing authority was in the Judicial Branch.  In light of the Act's provision making the judges of the Special Division ineligible to participate in any matters relating to an independent counsel they have appointed, appointment of independent counsel by that court does not run afoul of the constitutional limitation on ""incongruous"" interbranch appointments.  Pp.  487 U. S. 673-677.
3. The powers vested in the Special Division do not violate Article III, under which executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature may not be imposed on judges holding office under Article III.  Pp.  487 U. S. 677-685.
(a) There can be no Article III objection to the Special Division's exercise of the power, under the Act, to appoint independent counsel, since the power itself derives from the Appointments Clause, a source of authority for judicial action that is independent of Article III.  Moreover, the Division's Appointments Clause powers encompass the power to define the independent counsel's jurisdiction.  When, as here, Congress creates a temporary ""office,"" the nature and duties of which will by necessity vary with the factual circumstances giving rise to the need for an appointment in the first place, it may vest the power to define the office's scope in the court as an incident to the appointment of the officer pursuant to the Appointments Clause.  However, the jurisdiction that the court decides upon must be demonstrably related to the factual circumstances that gave rise to the Attorney General's request for the appointment of independent counsel in the particular case.  Pp.  487 U. S. 678-679.
(b) Article III does not absolutely prevent Congress from vesting certain miscellaneous powers in the Special Division under the Act.  One purpose of the broad prohibition upon the courts' exercise of executive or administrative duties of a nonjudicial nature is to maintain the separation between the Judiciary and the other branches of the Federal Government by ensuring that judges do not encroach upon executive or legislative authority or undertake tasks that are more properly accomplished by those branches.  Here, the Division's miscellaneous powers -- such as the passive powers to ""receive"" (but not to act on or specifically approve) various reports from independent counsel or the Attorney General -- do not encroach upon the Executive Branch's authority.  The Act

And, the functions that the Division is empowered to perform are not inherently ""Executive,"" but are directly analogous to functions that federal judges perform in other contexts.  Pp.  487 U. S. 680-681.
(c) The Special Division's power to terminate an independent counsel's office when counsel's task is completed -- although ""administrative"" to the extent that it requires the Division to monitor the progress of counsel's proceedings and to decide whether counsel's job is ""completed"" -- is not such a significant judicial encroachment upon executive power or upon independent counsel's prosecutorial discretion as to require that the Act be invalidated as inconsistent with Article III.  The Act's termination provisions do not give the Division anything approaching the power to remove the counsel while an investigation or court proceeding is still underway -- this power is vested solely in the Attorney General.  Pp.  487 U. S. 682-683.

Syllabus 
Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) permits an employer and a union to enter into an agreement requiring all employees in the bargaining unit to pay union dues as a condition of continued employment, whether or not the employees become union members.  Petitioner Communications Workers of America (CWA) entered into a collective bargaining agreement that contains a union-security clause under which all represented employees who do not become union members must pay the union ""agency fees"" in amounts equal to the dues paid by union members.  Respondents, bargaining unit employees who chose not to become union members, filed this suit in Federal District Court, challenging CWA's use of their agency fees for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment (hereinafter ""collective bargaining"" activities).  They alleged that expenditure of their fees on activities such as organizing the employees of other employers, lobbying for labor legislation, and participating in social, charitable, and political events violated CWA's duty of fair representation,  8(a)(3), and the First Amendment.  The court concluded that CWA's collection and disbursement of agency fees for purposes other than collective bargaining activities violated the associational and free speech rights of objecting nonmembers, and granted injunctive relief and an order for reimbursement of excess fees.  The Court of Appeals, preferring to rest its judgment on a ground other than the Constitution, ultimately concluded, inter alia, that the collection of nonmembers' fees for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining violated CWA's duty of fair representation.
Held:
1. The courts below properly exercised jurisdiction over respondents' claims that exactions of agency fees beyond those necessary to finance collective bargaining activities violated the judicially created duty of fair representation and respondents' First Amendment rights.  Although the National Labor Relations Board (Board) had primary jurisdiction over respondents'  8(a)(3) claim, cf. San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, the courts below were not precluded from deciding the merits of that claim insofar as such a decision was necessary 
Page 487 U. S. 736
 to the disposition of respondents' duty of fair representation challenge.  Federal courts may resolve unfair labor practice questions that emerge as collateral issues in suits brought under independent federal remedies.  Respondents did not attempt to circumvent the Board's primary jurisdiction by casting their statutory claim as a violation of CWA's duty of fair representation.  Instead, the necessity of deciding the scope of  8(a)(3) arose because CWA and its copetitioner local unions sought to defend themselves on the ground that the statute authorizes the type of union security agreement in issue.  Pp.  487 U. S. 742-744.
2. Section 8(a)(3) does not permit a union, over the objections of dues-paying nonmember employees, to expend funds collected from them on activities unrelated to collective bargaining activities.  Pp.  487 U. S. 744-762.
(a) The decision in Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740 -- holding that  2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act (RLA) does not permit a union, over the objections of nonmembers, to expend agency fees on political causes -- is controlling, for  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh are in all material respects identical.  Their nearly identical language reflects the fact that, in both, Congress authorized compulsory unionism only to the extent necessary to ensure that those who enjoy union-negotiated benefits contribute to their cost.  Indeed, Congress, in 1951, expressly modeled  2, Eleventh on  8(a)(3), which it had added to the NLRA by the Taft-Hartley Act only four years earlier, and emphasized that it was extending to railroad labor the same rights and privileges of the union shop that were contained in the Taft-Hartley Act.  Pp.  487 U. S. 744-747.
(b) Section 8(a)(3) was intended to correct abuses of compulsory unionism that had developed under ""closed shop"" agreements and, at the same time, to require, through union-security clauses, that nonmember employees pay their share of the cost of benefits secured by the union through collective bargaining.  These same concerns prompted Congress' later amendment of the RLA.  Given the parallel purpose, structure, and language of  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh, both provisions must be interpreted in the same manner.  Only the most compelling evidence would support a contrary conclusion, and petitioners have not proffered such evidence here.  Pp.  487 U. S. 747-754.
(c) Petitioners claim that the union security provisions of the RLA and NLRA should be read differently in light of the different history of unionism in the regulated industries -- that is, the tradition of voluntary unionism in the railway industry prior to the 1951 amendment of the RLA and the history of compulsory unionism in NLRA-regulated industries prior to 1947.  Petitioners contend that, because agreements requiring the payment of uniform dues were not among the specific abuses Congress sought to remedy in the Taft-Hartley Act,  8(a)(3) cannot plausibly be read to prohibit the collection of fees in excess of those 
Page 487 U. S. 737
 necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining.  This argument is unpersuasive, because the legislative history of  8(a)(3) shows that Congress was concerned with numerous and systemic abuses of the closed shop, and therefore resolved to ban the closed shop altogether; to the extent it permitted union security agreements at all, Congress was guided -- as it was in its later amendment of the RLA -- by the principle that those enjoying the benefits of union representation should contribute their fair share to the expense of securing those benefits.  Moreover, it is clear that Congress understood its actions in 1947 and 1951 to have placed the respective regulated industries on an equal footing insofar as compulsory unionism was concerned.  Pp.  487 U. S. 754-756.
(d) The fact that, in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress expressly considered proposals regulating union finances, but ultimately placed only a few limitations on the collection and use of dues and fees, and otherwise left unions free to arrange their financial affairs as they saw fit, is not sufficient to compel a broader construction of  8(a)(3) than that accorded  2, Eleventh in Street.  The legislative history of  8(a)(3) shows that Congress was concerned with the dues and rights of union members, not the agency fees and rights of nonmembers.  The absence, in such legislative history, of congressional concern for the rights of nonmembers is consistent with the view that Congress understood  8(a)(3) to afford nonmembers adequate protection by authorizing the collection of only those fees necessary to finance collective bargaining activities.  Nor is there any merit to the contention that, because unions had previously used members' dues for a variety of purposes in addition to collective bargaining agreements, Congress' silence in 1947 as to the uses to which unions could put nonmembers' fees should be understood as an acquiescence in such union practices.  Pp. 756-761.
(e) Street cannot be distinguished on the theory that the construction of  2, Eleventh was merely expedient to avoid the constitutional question -- as to the use of fees for political causes that nonmembers find objectionable -- that otherwise would have been raised because the RLA (unlike the NLRA) preempts state laws banning union security agreements, and thus nonmember fees were compelled by ""governmental action.""  Even assuming that the exercise of rights permitted, though not compelled, by  8(a)(3) does not involve state action, and that the NLRA and RLA therefore differ in such respect, nevertheless the absence of any constitutional concerns in this case would not warrant reading the nearly identical language of  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh differently.  Pp.  487 U. S. 761-762.

2. Section 8(a)(3) does not permit a union, over the objections of dues-paying nonmember employees, to expend funds collected from them on activities unrelated to collective bargaining activities.  Pp.  487 U. S. 744-762.
(a) The decision in Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740 -- holding that  2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act (RLA) does not permit a union, over the objections of nonmembers, to expend agency fees on political causes -- is controlling, for  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh are in all material respects identical.  Their nearly identical language reflects the fact that, in both, Congress authorized compulsory unionism only to the extent necessary to ensure that those who enjoy union-negotiated benefits contribute to their cost.  Indeed, Congress, in 1951, expressly modeled  2, Eleventh on  8(a)(3), which it had added to the NLRA by the Taft-Hartley Act only four years earlier, and emphasized that it was extending to railroad labor the same rights and privileges of the union shop that were contained in the Taft-Hartley Act.  Pp.  487 U. S. 744-747.
(b) Section 8(a)(3) was intended to correct abuses of compulsory unionism that had developed under ""closed shop"" agreements and, at the same time, to require, through union-security clauses, that nonmember employees pay their share of the cost of benefits secured by the union through collective bargaining.  These same concerns prompted Congress' later amendment of the RLA.  Given the parallel purpose, structure, and language of  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh, both provisions must be interpreted in the same manner.  Only the most compelling evidence would support a contrary conclusion, and petitioners have not proffered such evidence here.  Pp.  487 U. S. 747-754.
(c) Petitioners claim that the union security provisions of the RLA and NLRA should be read differently in light of the different history of unionism in the regulated industries -- that is, the tradition of voluntary unionism in the railway industry prior to the 1951 amendment of the RLA and the history of compulsory unionism in NLRA-regulated industries prior to 1947.  Petitioners contend that, because agreements requiring the payment of uniform dues were not among the specific abuses Congress sought to remedy in the Taft-Hartley Act,  8(a)(3) cannot plausibly be read to prohibit the collection of fees in excess of those 
Page 487 U. S. 737
 necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining.  This argument is unpersuasive, because the legislative history of  8(a)(3) shows that Congress was concerned with numerous and systemic abuses of the closed shop, and therefore resolved to ban the closed shop altogether; to the extent it permitted union security agreements at all, Congress was guided -- as it was in its later amendment of the RLA -- by the principle that those enjoying the benefits of union representation should contribute their fair share to the expense of securing those benefits.  Moreover, it is clear that Congress understood its actions in 1947 and 1951 to have placed the respective regulated industries on an equal footing insofar as compulsory unionism was concerned.  Pp.  487 U. S. 754-756.
(d) The fact that, in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress expressly considered proposals regulating union finances, but ultimately placed only a few limitations on the collection and use of dues and fees, and otherwise left unions free to arrange their financial affairs as they saw fit, is not sufficient to compel a broader construction of  8(a)(3) than that accorded  2, Eleventh in Street.  The legislative history of  8(a)(3) shows that Congress was concerned with the dues and rights of union members, not the agency fees and rights of nonmembers.  The absence, in such legislative history, of congressional concern for the rights of nonmembers is consistent with the view that Congress understood  8(a)(3) to afford nonmembers adequate protection by authorizing the collection of only those fees necessary to finance collective bargaining activities.  Nor is there any merit to the contention that, because unions had previously used members' dues for a variety of purposes in addition to collective bargaining agreements, Congress' silence in 1947 as to the uses to which unions could put nonmembers' fees should be understood as an acquiescence in such union practices.  Pp. 756-761.
(e) Street cannot be distinguished on the theory that the construction of  2, Eleventh was merely expedient to avoid the constitutional question -- as to the use of fees for political causes that nonmembers find objectionable -- that otherwise would have been raised because the RLA (unlike the NLRA) preempts state laws banning union security agreements, and thus nonmember fees were compelled by ""governmental action.""  Even assuming that the exercise of rights permitted, though not compelled, by  8(a)(3) does not involve state action, and that the NLRA and RLA therefore differ in such respect, nevertheless the absence of any constitutional concerns in this case would not warrant reading the nearly identical language of  8(a)(3) and  2, Eleventh differently.  Pp.  487 U. S. 761-762.

Syllabus 
The North Carolina Charitable Solicitations Act defines the prima facie ""reasonable fee"" that a professional fundraiser may charge according to a three-tiered schedule.  A fee up to 20% of receipts collected is deemed reasonable.  A fee between 20% and 35% is deemed unreasonable upon a showing that the solicitation at issue did not involve the
""dissemination of information, discussion, or advocacy relating to public issues as directed by the [charitable organization] which is to benefit from the solicitation.""
A fee exceeding 35% is presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser may rebut the presumption by showing that the fee was necessary either because the solicitation involved the dissemination of information or advocacy on public issues directed by the charity, or because otherwise the charity's ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished.  The Act also provides that a professional fundraiser must disclose to potential donors the average percentage of gross receipts actually turned over to charities by the fundraiser for all charitable solicitations conducted in the State within the previous 12 months.  Finally, the Act provides that professional fundraisers may not solicit without an approved license, whereas volunteer fundraisers may solicit immediately upon submitting a license application.  Appellees, a coalition of professional fundraisers, charitable organizations, and potential donors, brought suit against appellant government officials charged with the enforcement of the Act (hereinafter collectively referred to as North Carolina or the State), seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court ruled that the challenged provisions on their face unconstitutionally infringed upon freedom of speech, and enjoined their enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. North Carolina's three-tiered definition of ""reasonable fees"" unconstitutionally infringes upon freedom of speech.  The solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech, and using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser's fee is not narrowly tailored to the State's 
Page 487 U. S. 782
 interest in preventing fraud.  Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620; Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947.  North Carolina cannot meaningfully distinguish its statute from those previously held invalid on the ground that it has a motivating interest, not present in the prior cases, to ensure that the maximum amount of funds reach the charity, or to guarantee that the fee charged charities is not unreasonable.  This provision is not merely an economic regulation, with no First Amendment implication, to be tested only for rationality; instead, the regulation must be considered as one burdening speech.  The State's asserted justification that charities' speech must be regulated for their own benefit is unsound.  The First Amendment mandates the presumption that speakers, not the government, know best both what they want to say and how to say it.  Also unavailing is the State's contention that the Act's flexibility more narrowly tailors it to the State's asserted interests than the laws invalidated in the prior cases.  The State's asserted additional interests are both constitutionally invalid and insufficiently related to a percentage-based test.  And while a State's interest in protecting charities and the public from fraud is a sufficiently substantial interest to justify a narrowly tailored regulation, the North Carolina statute, even with its flexibility, is not sufficiently tailored to such interest.  Pp.  487 U. S. 787-795.
2. North Carolina's requirement that professional fundraisers disclose to potential donors, before an appeal for funds, the percentage of charitable contributions collected during the previous 12 months that were actually turned over to charity is unconstitutional.  This provision of the Act is a content-based regulation because mandating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the speech's content.  Even assuming that the mandated speech, in the abstract, is merely ""commercial,"" it does not retain its commercial character when it is inextricably intertwined with the otherwise fully protected speech involved in charitable solicitations, and thus the mandated speech is subject to the test for fully protected expression, not the more deferential commercial speech principles.  Nor is a deferential test to be applied on the theory that the First Amendment interest in compelled speech is different than the interest in compelled silence.  The difference is without constitutional significance, for the First Amendment guarantees ""freedom of speech,"" a term necessarily comprising the decision of both what to say and what not to say.  Moreover, for First Amendment purposes, a distinction cannot be drawn between compelled statements of opinion and, as here, compelled statements of ""fact,"" since either form of compulsion burdens protected speech.  Thus, North Carolina's content-based regulation is subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny.  The State's interest in informing donors how the money they contribute is spent to 
Page 487 U. S. 783
 dispel the alleged misperception that the money they give to professional fundraisers goes in greater-than-actual proportion to benefit charity, is not sufficiently weighty, and the means chosen to accomplish it are unduly burdensome, and not narrowly tailored.  Pp.  487 U. S. 795-801.
3. North Carolina's licensing requirement for professional fundraisers is unconstitutional.  A speaker's rights are not lost merely because compensation is received, and the State's asserted power to license professional fundraisers carries with it (unless properly constrained) the power directly and substantially to affect the speech they utter.  Consequently, the statute is subject to First Amendment scrutiny.  Generally, speakers need not obtain a license to speak.  Even assuming that the State's interest in regulating those who solicit money justifies requiring fundraisers to obtain a license before soliciting, such a regulation must provide that the licensor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court.  That requirement is not met here, for the North Carolina Act permits a delay without limit.  Nor can the State assert that its history of issuing licenses quickly constitutes a practice effectively constraining the licensor's discretion, since such history relates to a time (prior to amendment of the Act) when professional fundraisers were permitted to solicit as soon as their applications were filed.  Pp.  487 U. S. 801-804.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, when he was 15 years old, actively participated in a brutal murder.  Because petitioner was a ""child"" as a matter of Oklahoma law, the District Attorney filed a statutory petition seeking to have him tried as an adult, which the trial court granted.  He was then convicted and sentenced to death, and the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded.
724 P.2d 780, vacated and remanded.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the ""cruel and unusual punishment"" prohibition of the Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the execution of a person who was under 16 years of age at the time of his or her offense.  Pp.  487 U. S. 821-838.
(a) In determining whether the categorical Eighth Amendment prohibition applies, this Court must be guided by the ""evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,"" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86,  356 U. S. 101, and, in so doing, must review relevant legislative enactments and jury determinations and consider the reasons why a civilized society may accept or reject the death penalty for a person less than 16 years old at the time of the crime.  Pp.  487 U. S. 821-823.
(b) Relevant state statutes -- particularly those of the 18 States that have expressly considered the question of a minimum age for imposition of the death penalty, and have uniformly required that the defendant have attained at least the age of 16 at the time of the capital offense -- support the conclusion that it would offend civilized standards of decency to execute a person who was less than 16 years old at the time of his or her offense.  That conclusion is also consistent with the views expressed by respected professional organizations, by other nations that share the Anglo-American heritage, and by the leading members of the Western European Community.  Pp.  487 U. S. 823-831.
(c) The behavior of juries -- as evidenced by statistics demonstrating that, although between 18 and 20 persons under the age of 16 were executed during the first half of the 20th century, no such execution has taken place since 1948, despite the fact that thousands of murder cases 
Page 487 U. S. 816
 were tried during that period, and that only 5 of the 1,393 persons sentenced to death for willful homicide during the years 1982 through 1986 were less than 16 at the time of the offense -- leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty on a 15-year-old offender is now generally abhorrent to the conscience of the community.  Pp.  487 U. S. 831-833.
(d) The juvenile's reduced culpability, and the fact that the application of the death penalty to this class of offenders does not measurably contribute to the essential purposes underlying the penalty, also support the conclusion that the imposition of the penalty on persons under the age of 16 constitutes unconstitutional punishment.  This Court has already endorsed the proposition that less culpability should attach to a crime committed by a juvenile than to a comparable crime committed by an adult, since inexperience, less education, and less intelligence make the teenager less able to evaluate the consequences of his or her conduct, while at the same time he or she is much more apt to be motivated by mere emotion or peer pressure than is an adult.  Cf. Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104.  Given this lesser culpability, as well as the teenager's capacity for growth and society's fiduciary obligations to its children, the retributive purpose underlying the death penalty is simply inapplicable to the execution of a 15-year-old offender.  Moreover, the deterrence rationale for the penalty is equally unacceptable with respect to such offenders, since statistics demonstrate that the vast majority of persons arrested for willful homicide are over 16 at the time of the offense, since the likelihood that the teenage offender has made the kind of cold-blooded, cost-benefit analysis that attaches any weight to the possibility of execution is virtually nonexistent, and since it is fanciful to believe that a 15-year-old would be deterred by the knowledge that a small number of persons his age have been executed during the 20th century.  Pp.  487 U. S. 833-838.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that:
1. Although a national consensus forbidding the execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16 very likely does exist, this conclusion should not unnecessarily be adopted as a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than is before the Court.  The fact that the 18 legislatures that have expressly considered the question have set the minimum age for capital punishment at 16 or above, coupled with the fact that 14 other States have rejected capital punishment completely, suggests the existence of a consensus.  However, the Federal Government and 19 States have authorized capital punishment without setting any minimum age, and have also provided for some 15-year-olds to be prosecuted as adults.  These laws appear to render 15-year-olds death eligible, and thus pose a real obstacle to finding a consensus. 
Page 487 U. S. 817
  Moreover, although the execution and sentencing statistics before the Court support the inference of a consensus, they are not dispositive, because they do not indicate how many juries have been asked to impose the death penalty on juvenile offenders or how many times prosecutors have exercised their discretion to refrain from seeking the penalty.  Furthermore, granting the premise that adolescents are generally less blameworthy than adults who commit similar crimes, it does not necessarily follow that all 15-year-olds are incapable of the moral culpability that would justify the imposition of capital punishment.  Nor is there evidence that 15-year-olds as a class are inherently incapable of being deterred from major crimes by the prospect of the death penalty.  Thus, there is the danger that any inference of a societal consensus drawn from the evidence in this case might be mistaken.  Rather than rely on its inevitably subjective judgment about the best age at which to draw a line forbidding capital punishment, this Court should if possible await the express judgments of additional legislatures.  Pp.  487 U. S. 849-855.
2. Petitioner's sentence must be set aside on the ground that -- whereas the Eighth Amendment requires special care and deliberation in decisions that may lead to the imposition of the death penalty -- there is considerable risk that, in enacting a statute authorizing capital punishment for murder without setting any minimum age, and in separately providing that juvenile defendants may be treated as adults in some circumstances, the Oklahoma Legislature either did not realize that its actions would effectively render 15-year-olds death-eligible, or did not give the question the serious consideration that would have been reflected in the explicit choice of a particular minimum age.  Because the available evidence suggests a national consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment for crimes committed before the age of 16, petitioner and others whose crimes were committed before that age may not be executed pursuant to a capital punishment statute that specifies no minimum age.  Pp.  487 U. S. 856-859.
STEVENS, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., joined.  O'CONNOR, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, post, p.  487 U. S. 848.  SCALIA, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, J., joined, post, p.  487 U. S. 859.

Pp.  487 U. S. 833-838.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that:
1. Although a national consensus forbidding the execution of any person for a crime committed before the age of 16 very likely does exist, this conclusion should not unnecessarily be adopted as a matter of constitutional law without better evidence than is before the Court.  The fact that the 18 legislatures that have expressly considered the question have set the minimum age for capital punishment at 16 or above, coupled with the fact that 14 other States have rejected capital punishment completely, suggests the existence of a consensus.  However, the Federal Government and 19 States have authorized capital punishment without setting any minimum age, and have also provided for some 15-year-olds to be prosecuted as adults.  These laws appear to render 15-year-olds death eligible, and thus pose a real obstacle to finding a consensus. 
Page 487 U. S. 817
  Moreover, although the execution and sentencing statistics before the Court support the inference of a consensus, they are not dispositive, because they do not indicate how many juries have been asked to impose the death penalty on juvenile offenders or how many times prosecutors have exercised their discretion to refrain from seeking the penalty.  Furthermore, granting the premise that adolescents are generally less blameworthy than adults who commit similar crimes, it does not necessarily follow that all 15-year-olds are incapable of the moral culpability that would justify the imposition of capital punishment.  Nor is there evidence that 15-year-olds as a class are inherently incapable of being deterred from major crimes by the prospect of the death penalty.  Thus, there is the danger that any inference of a societal consensus drawn from the evidence in this case might be mistaken.  Rather than rely on its inevitably subjective judgment about the best age at which to draw a line forbidding capital punishment, this Court should if possible await the express judgments of additional legislatures.  Pp.  487 U. S. 849-855.
2. Petitioner's sentence must be set aside on the ground that -- whereas the Eighth Amendment requires special care and deliberation in decisions that may lead to the imposition of the death penalty -- there is considerable risk that, in enacting a statute authorizing capital punishment for murder without setting any minimum age, and in separately providing that juvenile defendants may be treated as adults in some circumstances, the Oklahoma Legislature either did not realize that its actions would effectively render 15-year-olds death-eligible, or did not give the question the serious consideration that would have been reflected in the explicit choice of a particular minimum age.  Because the available evidence suggests a national consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment for crimes committed before the age of 16, petitioner and others whose crimes were committed before that age may not be executed pursuant to a capital punishment statute that specifies no minimum age.  Pp.  487 U. S. 856-859.

Syllabus 
The federal contribution (referred to as a ""reimbursement"") to a State's Medicaid program takes the form of advances based on the State's estimate of its future expenditures for covered services.  Overpayments may be withheld from future advances, or, if a disallowance dispute develops, may be retained by the State at its option pending resolution of the dispute.  After Massachusetts was reimbursed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its expenditures for particular services during two time periods, HHS subsequently disallowed the reimbursements on the ground that the services in question were not covered by the Medicaid statute or HHS regulations.  The Departmental Grant Appeals Board (Board) affirmed.  Unlike orders in the related compliance proceedings, which are expressly made reviewable by the regional courts of appeals, disallowance orders are not explicitly made judicially reviewable by the Medicaid statute.  Nevertheless, the State filed two suits, each with respect to one of the disallowance decisions, in the Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and specifically asking the court to ""set aside"" the Board's orders.  In one case, the court issued a declaratory judgment agreeing with respondent on the merits, and ""reversed"" the disallowance decision.  In the second case, the court issued an order based on its earlier decision.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the Secretary of HHS that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order him to pay money to the State, and therefore reversed the ""money judgment"" against him.  The court also held, however, that the District Court had jurisdiction to review the Board's disallowance decisions and to grant declaratory and injunctive relief having prospective effect, and affirmed the declaratory judgment on the merits.  In this Court, the Secretary contends that the United States Claims Court had jurisdiction over the State's claim, since  702 and 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act preclude district court review. 
Page 487 U. S. 880

Held:
1. The federal district courts, rather than the Claims Court, have jurisdiction to review a final HHS order refusing to reimburse a State for a category of expenditures under its Medicaid program.  Pp.  487 U. S. 891-912.
(a) Although  702 denies the district courts review jurisdiction in actions against federal agencies seeking ""money damages,"" the plain meaning of that language does not foreclose review of the Secretary's disallowance decisions in cases such as the present.  First, insofar as the State's complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, it was not an action for money damages.  Second, and most importantly, even the monetary aspects of the relief sought by the State are not ""money damages"" as that term is used in  702.  The ordinary meaning of the term is compensatory relief for an injury suffered.  Here, the State's suit is in the nature of an equitable action for specific relief seeking reimbursement to which the State was allegedly already entitled, rather than money in compensation for losses suffered as a result of the disallowance.  Cf. Maryland Dept. of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, 246 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 763 F.2d 1441.  Thus, the statutory text is unambiguous, and, given the well-settled presumption that Congress understands the state of existing law when it legislates, the Secretary's suggestion that the words ""monetary relief"" must be substituted for the words ""money damages"" could be accepted only for the most compelling reasons.  In fact, however, the legislative history demonstrates conclusively that  702's exception for an action seeking ""money damages"" should not be broadened beyond the meaning of its plain language.  Pp.  487 U. S. 891-901.
(b) Section 704 -- which provides for district court review of final agency actions ""for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court"" -- does not bar relief, since the doubtful and limited relief available in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act is not an adequate substitute for district court review.  Section 704 was intended to avoid duplication when there are special statutory review procedures relating to specific agencies, whereas the Tucker Act relates broadly to monetary relief against the United States.  The Tucker Act remedy available in the Claims Court is deficient for several reasons.  That court has no power to grant equitable relief.  Such relief may be appropriate in the disallowance context, and it cannot be assumed categorically that a naked money judgment against the United States will always be an adequate substitute for prospective relief.  Furthermore, the Claims Court would be unable to entertain any action in a case in which the State retained a disallowed amount pending Board review until the Government recouped the disallowed amount from a future payment, and might be unable to enter a money judgment against the Government, since reimbursements 
Page 487 U. S. 881
 are actually advances against expenses not yet incurred.  In addition, disallowance controversies typically involve state governmental activities that a district court would be in a much better position to understand and evaluate than would a single, specialized tribunal headquartered in Washington.  It is anomalous to assume that Congress would channel the review of compliance decisions to the regional courts of appeals, but intend that the same kinds of controversies in the disallowance context should be resolved by the Claims Court or the Federal Circuit.  Pp.  487 U. S. 901-908.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in not affirming the judgments of the District Court in their entirety, for the reasons set forth above.  Moreover, neither of the District Court's orders was a ""money judgment,"" as the Court of Appeals held, since the first order (followed in the second) simply ""reversed"" the Board's decision, and did not order that any amount be paid or purport to be based on a finding that any amount was owed.  The District Court had the power to grant the complete relief that it did under 5 U.S.C.  706.  Pp.  487 U. S. 909-912.

No. 86-2000

487 U.S. 931

Syllabus 
After two mentally retarded men were found laboring on respondents' farm in poor health, in squalid conditions, and in relative isolation from the rest of society, respondents were charged with violating 18 U.S.C.  241 by conspiring to prevent the men from exercising their Thirteenth Amendment right to be free from involuntary servitude, and with violating 18 U.S.C.  1584 by knowingly holding the men in involuntary servitude.  At respondents' trial in Federal District Court, the Government's evidence indicated, inter alia, that the two men worked on the farm seven days a week, often 17 hours a day, at first for $15 per week and eventually for no pay, and that, in addition to actual or threatened physical abuse and a threat to reinstitutionalize one of the men if he did not do as he was told, respondents had used various forms of psychological coercion to keep the men on the farm.  The court instructed the jury that, under both statutes, involuntary servitude may include situations involving any
""means of compulsion . . . sufficient in kind and degree to subject a person having the same general station in life as the alleged victims to believe they had no reasonable means of escape and no choice except to remain in the service of the employer.""
The jury found respondents guilty, and the court imposed sentences.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the trial court's definition of involuntary servitude was too broad, in that it included general psychological coercion.  The court held that involuntary servitude exists only when the master subjects the servant to (1) threatened or actual physical force, (2) threatened or actual state-imposed legal coercion, or (3) fraud or deceit where the servant is a minor or an immigrant or is mentally incompetent.
Held:  For purposes of criminal prosecution under  241 or  1584, the term ""involuntary servitude"" necessarily means a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.  This definition encompasses cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing him or her in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 939-953.
(a) The Government cannot prove a  241 conspiracy to violate rights secured by the Thirteenth Amendment without proving that the conspiracy 
Page 487 U. S. 932
 involved the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion.  The fact that the Amendment excludes from its prohibition involuntary servitude imposed ""as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted"" indicates that the Amendment's drafters thought that involuntary servitude generally includes situations in which the victim is compelled to work by law.  Moreover, the facts that the phrase ""involuntary servitude"" was intended ""to cover those forms of compulsory labor akin to African slavery,"" Butler v. Perry, 240 U. S. 328,  240 U. S. 332, and that the Amendment extends beyond state action, cf. U.S.Const., Amdt. 14,  1, imply an intent to prohibit compulsion through physical coercion.  These assessments are confirmed by this Court's decisions construing the Amendment, see, e.g., Clyatt v. United States, 197 U. S. 207, which have never interpreted the guarantee of freedom from involuntary servitude to specifically prohibit compulsion of labor by other means, such as psychological coercion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 941-944.
(b) The language and legislative history of  1584 and its statutory progenitors indicate that its reach should be limited to cases involving the compulsion of services by the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion.  That is the understanding of the Thirteenth Amendment's ""involuntary servitude"" phrase that prevailed at the time of  1584's enactment and, since Congress clearly borrowed that phrase in enacting  1584, the phrase should have the same meaning in both places absent any contrary indications.  Section 1584's history undercuts the contention that Congress had a broader concept of involuntary servitude in mind when it enacted the statute, and does not support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that immigrants, children, and mental incompetents are entitled to any special protection.  Pp.  487 U. S. 944-948.
(c) The Government's broad construction of ""involuntary servitude"" -- which would prohibit the compulsion of services by any type of speech or intentional conduct that, from the victim's point of view, either leaves the victim with no tolerable alternative but to serve the defendant or deprives the victim of the power of choice -- could not have been intended by Congress.  That interpretation would appear to criminalize a broad range of day-to-day activity; would delegate to prosecutors and juries the inherently legislative task of determining what type of coercive activities are so morally reprehensible that they should be punished as crimes; would subject individuals to the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory prosecution and conviction; and would make the type of coercion prohibited depend entirely on the victim's state of mind, thereby depriving ordinary people of fair notice of what is required of them.  These defects are not cured by the Government's ambiguous specific intent requirement.  JUSTICE BRENNAN's position -- that  1584 prohibits any means of coercion that actually succeeds in reducing the victim to a condition 
Page 487 U. S. 933
 of servitude resembling that in which antebellum slaves were held -- although theoretically narrower than the Government's interpretation, suffers from the same flaws.  JUSTICE STEVENS' conclusion that Congress intended to delegate to the judiciary the task of defining ""involuntary servitude"" on a case-by-case basis is unsupported, and could lead to the arbitrary and unfair imposition of criminal punishment.  The purposes underlying the rule of lenity for interpreting ambiguous statutory provisions are served by construing  241 and  1584 to prohibit only compulsion of services through physical or legal coercion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 949-952.
(d) The latter construction does not imply that evidence of other means of coercion, or of extremely poor working conditions, or of the victim's special vulnerabilities, is irrelevant.  The victim's vulnerabilities are relevant in determining whether the physical or legal coercion or threats thereof could plausibly have compelled the victim to serve.  Moreover, a trial court could properly find that evidence of other means of coercion or of poor working conditions is relevant to corroborate disputed evidence regarding the use or threats of physical or legal coercion, the defendant's intent in using such means, or the causal effect of such conduct.  Pp.  487 U. S. 952-953.
(e) Since the District Court's jury instructions encompassed means of coercion other than actual or threatened physical or legal coercion, the instructions may have caused respondents to be convicted for conduct that does not violate  241 or  1584.  The convictions must therefore be reversed.  Because the record contains sufficient evidence of physical or legal coercion to permit a conviction, however, a judgment of acquittal is unwarranted, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  P.  487 U. S. 953.

Syllabus 
Petitioner employee, who is black, was rejected in favor of white applicants for four promotions to supervisory positions in respondent bank, which had not developed precise and formal selection criteria for the positions, but instead relied on the subjective judgment of white supervisors who were acquainted with the candidates and with the nature of the jobs.  After exhausting her administrative remedies, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that respondent's promotion policies had unlawfully discriminated against blacks generally and her personally in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  As to petitioner's individual claim, the court held that she had not met her burden of proof under the discriminatory treatment evidentiary standard and, for this and other reasons, dismissed the action. The Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part, rejecting petitioner's contention that the District Court erred in failing to apply ""disparate impact"" analysis to her promotion claims.  The court held that, under its precedent, a Title VII challenge to a discretionary or subjective promotion system can only be analyzed under the disparate treatment model.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
798 F.2d 791, vacated and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and III, concluding that disparate impact analysis may be applied to a subjective or discretionary promotion system.  Pp.  487 U. S. 985-991,  487 U. S. 999-1000.
(a) Each of this Court's decisions applying disparate impact analysis -- under which facially neutral employment practices, adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive, may in operation be functionally equivalent to illegal intentional discrimination -- involved standardized tests or criteria, such as written aptitude tests or high school diploma requirements, see, e.g., Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, and the Court has consistently used disparate treatment theory, in which proof of intent to discriminate is required, to review hiring or promotion decisions that were based on the exercise of personal judgment or the application of subjective criteria, see, e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792.  Until today, the Court has never addressed the 
Page 487 U. S. 978
 question whether disparate impact analysis may be applied to subjective employment criteria.  Pp.  487 U. S. 985-989.
(b) The reasons supporting the use of disparate impact analysis apply to subjective employment practices.  That analysis might effectively be abolished if it were confined to objective, standardized selection practices, since an employer could insulate itself from liability under Griggs and its progeny simply by combining such practices with a subjective component, such as a brief interview, in a system that refrained from making the objective tests absolutely determinative, and could thereby remain free to give those tests almost as much weight as it chose without risking a disparate impact challenge.  Moreover, disparate impact analysis is, in principle, no less applicable to subjective employment criteria than to objective or standardized tests, since, in either case, a facially neutral practice, adopted without discriminatory intent, may have effects that are indistinguishable from intentionally discriminatory practices.  Simply because no inference of discriminatory intent can be drawn from the customary and reasonable practice in some businesses of leaving promotion decisions to the unchecked discretion of the lower level supervisors most familiar with the jobs and candidates, it does not follow that these supervisors always act without discriminatory intent.  Even if it is assumed that discrimination by individual supervisors can be adequately policed through disparate treatment analysis, that analysis would not solve the problem created by subconscious stereotypes and prejudices that lead to conduct prohibited by Title VII.  Pp.  487 U. S. 989-991.
(c) Since neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals has evaluated the statistical evidence to determine whether petitioner made out a prima facie case of discrimination under disparate impact theory, the case must be remanded.  Pp.  487 U. S. 999-1000.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Parts II-C and II-D that:
1. The extension of disparate impact analysis to subjective employment practices could increase the risk that, in order to avoid liability, employers will adopt surreptitious numerical goals and quotas in the belief that, since disparate impact analysis inevitably focuses on statistical evidence, which cannot practically be rebutted by the kind of counterevidence typically used to defend objective criteria, the threat of ruinous litigation requires steps to ensure that no plaintiff can establish a prima facie case under disparate impact theory.  That result would be contrary to Congress' clearly expressed intent in 42 U.S.C.  2000(e)-2(j) that no employer shall be required to grant preferential treatment to any protected individual or group because of a numerical imbalance in its workforce.  Pp.  487 U. S. 991-993.
2. However, the application of disparate impact theory to subjective employment criteria should not have any chilling effect on legitimate 
Page 487 U. S. 979
 business practices, since the high standards of proof applicable in such cases operate to constrain the theory within its proper bounds and provide adequate safeguards against the danger that quotas or preferential treatment will be adopted by employers.  Pp.  487 U. S. 993-999.
(a) In establishing a prima facie case when subjective selection criteria are at issue, the plaintiff may have difficulty satisfying the initial burden of identifying the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparity, especially where the employer has combined the subjective criteria with more rigid standardized rules or tests.  Moreover, the plaintiff's statistical evidence must be sufficiently substantial to prove that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of job or promotion applicants because of their membership in a protected group, and the defendant is free to attack the probative weight of that evidence, to point out fallacies or deficiencies in the plaintiff's data or statistical techniques, and to adduce countervailing evidence of its own.  Pp.  487 U. S. 994-997.
(b) The nature of the ""business necessity"" or ""job-relatedness"" defense -- under which the defendant has a burden of producing evidence after the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case -- also constrains the application of the disparate impact theory.  Employers are not required, even when defending standardized or objective tests, to introduce formal ""validation studies"" showing that particular criteria predict actual on-the-job performance.  In the context of subjective or discretionary decisions, the employer will often find it easier than in the case of standardized tests to produce evidence of a ""manifest relationship to the employment in question.""  Many jobs, for example those involving managerial responsibilities, require personal qualities that are not amenable to standardized testing, but are nevertheless job-related.  In evaluating claims that discretionary practices are insufficiently related to legitimate business purposes, courts are generally less competent than employers to restructure business practices, and therefore should not attempt to do so.  Pp.  487 U. S. 997-999.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL, agreeing that disparate impact analysis may be applied to claims of discrimination caused by subjective or discretionary selection processes, concluded that:
1. In the disparate-impact context, a plaintiff who successfully establishes a prima facie case shifts the burden of proof, not production, to the defendant to establish that the employment practice in question is a business necessity.  See, e.g., Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,  422 U. S. 425; Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U. S. 321,  433 U. S. 329; and Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424,  401 U. S. 432.  The plurality's assertion to the contrary mimics the allocation of burdens this Court has established in the very different context of individual disparate treatment claims.  Unlike a 
Page 487 U. S. 980
 disparate treatment claim of intentional discrimination, which a prima facie case establishes only by inference, the disparate impact caused by an employment practice is directly established by the numerical disparity shown by the prima facie case, and the employer can avoid liability only if it can prove that the discriminatory effect is justified.  To be justified as a business necessity, a practice must directly relate to a prospective employee's ability to perform the job effectively; i.e., it must be necessary to fulfill legitimate business requirements.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1000-1006.
2. The plurality's suggestion that the employer will often find it easier to produce evidence of job-relatedness for a subjective factor than for standardized tests may prove misleading, since the employer still has the obligation to persuade the court of job-relatedness through the introduction of relevant evidence.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1006-1011.
(a) The fact that the formal validation techniques endorsed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures cannot always be used to prove the job-relatedness of subjective selection processes does not free an employer from its burden of proof.  The link between such processes and job performance may, depending on the type and size of the business and the nature of the particular job, be established by a variety of methods, including the results of studies, expert testimony, and prior successful experience.  Although common sense plays a part in the assessment, a reviewing court may not rely on its own, or an employer's, sense of what is ""normal"" as a substitute for a neutral assessment of the evidence.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1006-1008.
(b) The employer's burden of justifying an employment practice that produces a disparate impact is not lessened simply because the practice relies upon subjective assessments.  Establishing a general rule allowing an employer to escape liability simply by articulating vague, inoffensive-sounding subjective criteria would disserve Title VII's goal of eradicating employment discrimination by encouraging employers to abandon attempts to construct neutral selection mechanisms in favor of broad generalities.  While subjective criteria will sometimes pose difficult problems for courts charged with assessing job-relatedness, requiring the development of a greater factual record, and, perhaps, the exercise of a greater degree of judgment, that does not dictate that subjective selection processes generally are to be accepted at face value.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1008-1011.
JUSTICE STEVENS, agreeing that the racially adverse impact of an employer's practice of simply committing employment decisions to the unchecked discretion of a white supervisory corps is subject to the test of Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, concluded that, since cases 
Page 487 U. S. 981
 involving such practices will include too many variables to be adequately considered in a general context, further discussion of evidentiary standards should be postponed until after the District Court has made appropriate findings concerning petitioner's prima facie evidence of disparate impact and respondent's explanation for its subjective practice.  P.  487 U. S. 1011.
O'CONNOR, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and III, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts II-C and II-D in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

Syllabus 
Appellant was charged with sexually assaulting two 13-year-old girls.  At appellant's jury trial, the court granted the State's motion, pursuant to a 1985 state statute intended to protect child victims of sexual abuse, to place a screen between appellant and the girls during their testimony, which blocked him from their sight but allowed him to see them dimly and to hear them.  The court rejected appellant's argument that this procedure violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right ""to be confronted with the witnesses against him.""  Appellant was convicted of two counts of lascivious acts with a child, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. The Confrontation Clause, by its words, provides a criminal defendant the right to ""confront"" face-to-face the witnesses giving evidence against him at trial.  That core guarantee serves the general perception that confrontation is essential to fairness, and helps to ensure the integrity of the factfinding process by making it more difficult for witnesses to lie.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1015-1020.
2. Appellant's right to face-to-face confrontation was violated, since the screen at issue enabled the complaining witnesses to avoid viewing appellant as they gave their testimony.  There is no merit to the State's assertion that its statute creates a presumption of trauma to victims of sexual abuse that outweighs appellant's right to confrontation.  Even if an exception to this core right can be made, it would have to be based on something more than the type of generalized finding asserted here, unless it were ""firmly . . . rooted in our jurisprudence.""  Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U. S. 171,  483 U. S. 183.  An exception created by a 1985 statute can hardly be viewed as ""firmly rooted,"" and there have been no individualized findings that these particular witnesses needed special protection.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1020-1021.
3. Since the State Supreme Court did not address the question whether the Confrontation Clause error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,  386 U. S. 24, the case must be remanded.  Pp.  487 U. S. 1021-1022.

Syllabus 
Brookfield, Wisconsin, enacted an ordinance making it ""unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual,"" and declaring that the primary purpose of the ban is to ""protec[t] and preserv[e] the home"" through assurance ""that members of the community enjoy in their homes . . . a feeling of wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy.""  Appellees, who wish to picket a particular home in Brookfield, filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against appellants, the town and several of its officials, alleging that the ordinance violated the First Amendment.  The Federal District Court granted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored enough to restrict protected speech in a public forum.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed.

Syllabus 
Brookfield, Wisconsin, enacted an ordinance making it ""unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual,"" and declaring that the primary purpose of the ban is to ""protec[t] and preserv[e] the home"" through assurance ""that members of the community enjoy in their homes . . . a feeling of wellbeing, tranquility, and privacy.""  Appellees, who wish to picket a particular home in Brookfield, filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against appellants, the town and several of its officials, alleging that the ordinance violated the First Amendment.  The Federal District Court granted appellees' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the ordinance was not narrowly tailored enough to restrict protected speech in a public forum.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed.

Syllabus 
David A. Boyle, a United States Marine helicopter copilot, drowned when his helicopter crashed off the Virginia coast.  Petitioner, the personal representative of the heirs and estate of Boyle, brought this diversity action in Federal District Court against the Sikorsky Division of respondent corporation (Sikorsky), alleging, inter alia, under Virginia tort law, that Sikorsky had defectively designed the helicopter's copilot emergency escape-hatch system.  The jury returned a general verdict for petitioner, and the court denied Sikorsky's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions that judgment be entered for Sikorsky.  It found that, as a matter of federal law, Sikorsky could not be held liable for the allegedly defective design because Sikorsky satisfied the requirements of the ""military contractor defense.""
Held:
1. There is no merit to petitioner's contention that, in the absence of federal legislation specifically immunizing Government contractors, federal law cannot shield contractors from liability for design defects in military equipment.  In a few areas involving ""uniquely federal interests,"" state law is preempted and replaced, where necessary, by federal law of a content prescribed (absent explicit statutory directive) by the courts.  The procurement of equipment by the United States is an area of uniquely federal interest.  A dispute such as the present one, even though between private parties, implicates the interests of the United States in this area.  Once it is determined that an area of uniquely federal interest is implicated, state law will be displaced only where a ""significant conflict"" exists between an identifiable federal policy or interest and the operation of state law, or the application of state law would frustrate specific objectives of federal legislation.  Here, the state-imposed duty of care that is the asserted basis of the contractor's liability is precisely contrary to the duty imposed by the Government contract.  But even in this situation, it would be unreasonable to say that there is always a ""significant conflict"" between state law and a federal policy or interest.  In search of a limiting principle to identify when a significant 
Page 487 U. S. 501
 conflict is present, the Court of Appeals relied on the rationale of Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135.  This produces results that are in some respects too broad and in some respects too narrow.  However, the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act does demonstrate the potential for, and suggest the outlines of, ""significant conflict"" between federal interest and state law in this area.  State law is displaced where judgment against the contractor would threaten a discretionary function of the Government.  In sum, state law which imposes liability for design defects in military equipment is displaced where (a) the United States approved reasonably precise specifications; (b) the equipment conformed to those specifications; and (c) the supplier warned the United States about dangers in the use of the equipment known to the supplier but not to the United States.  Pp.  487 U. S. 504-513.
2. Also without merit is petitioner's contention that, since the Government contractor defense formulated by the Court of Appeals differed from the instructions given by the District Court to the jury, the Seventh Amendment guarantee of jury trial requires a remand for trial on the new theory.  If the evidence presented in the first trial would not suffice, as a matter of law, to support a jury verdict under the properly formulated defense, judgment could properly be entered for respondent at once, without a new trial.  It is unclear from the Court of Appeals' opinion, however, whether it was in fact deciding that no reasonable jury could, under the properly formulated defense, have found for the petitioner on the facts presented, or rather was assessing on its own whether the defense had been established.  The latter would be error, since whether the facts established the conditions for the defense is a question for the jury.  The case is remanded for clarification of this point.  Pp.  487 U.

No. 86-995
Argued December 8, 1987
Decided June 27, 1988*
487 U.S. 533

Syllabus 
While surveiling petitioner Murray and others suspected of illegal drug activities, federal agents observed both petitioners driving vehicles into, and later out of, a warehouse, and, upon petitioners' exit, saw that the warehouse contained a tractor-trailer rig bearing a long container.  Petitioners later turned over their vehicles to other drivers, who were in turn followed and ultimately arrested, and the vehicles were lawfully seized and found to contain marijuana.  After receiving this information, several agents forced their way into the warehouse and observed in plain view numerous burlap-wrapped bales.  The agents left without disturbing the bales and did not return until they had obtained a warrant to search the warehouse.  In applying for the warrant, they did not mention the prior entry or include any recitations of their observations made during that entry.  Upon issuance of the warrant, they reentered the warehouse and seized 270 bales of marijuana and other evidence of crime.  The District Court denied petitioners' pretrial motion to suppress the evidence, rejecting their arguments that the warrant was invalid because the agents did not inform the Magistrate about their prior warrantless entry, and that the warrant was tainted by that entry.  Petitioners were subsequently convicted of conspiracy to possess and distribute illegal drugs.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, assuming for purposes of its decision on the suppression question that the first entry into the warehouse was unlawful.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment does not require the suppression of evidence initially discovered during police officers' illegal entry of private premises if that evidence is also discovered during a later search pursuant to a valid warrant that is wholly independent of the initial illegal entry.  Pp.  487 U. S. 536-544.
(a) The ""independent source"" doctrine permits the introduction of evidence initially discovered during, or as a consequence of, an unlawful search, but later obtained independently from lawful activities untainted by the initial illegality.  Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385.  There is no merit to petitioners' contention that allowing the 
Page 487 U. S. 534
 doctrine to apply to evidence initially discovered during an illegal search, rather than limiting it to evidence first obtained during a later lawful search, will encourage police routinely to enter premises without a warrant.  Pp.  487 U. S. 536-541.
(b) Although the federal agents' knowledge that marijuana was in the warehouse was assuredly acquired at the time of the unlawful entry, it was also acquired at the time of entry pursuant to the warrant, and if that later acquisition was not the result of the earlier entry, the independent source doctrine allows the admission of testimony as to that knowledge.  This same analysis applies to the tangible evidence, the bales of marijuana.  United States v. Silvestri, 787 F.2d 736 (CA1), is unpersuasive insofar as it distinguishes between tainted intangible and tangible evidence.  The ultimate question is whether the search pursuant to warrant was in fact a genuinely independent source of the information and tangible evidence at issue.  This would not have been the case if the agents' decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during the initial entry or if information obtained during that entry was presented to the Magistrate and affected his decision to issue the warrant.  Because the District Court did not explicitly find that the agents would have sought a warrant if they had not earlier entered the warehouse, the cases are remanded for a determination whether the warrant-authorized search of the warehouse was an independent source in the sense herein described.

No. 86-1512
Argued December 1, 1987
Decided June 27, 1988
487 U.S. 552

Syllabus 
One of petitioner's predecessors as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development decided not to implement an ""operating subsidy"" program authorized by federal statute, which was intended to provide payments to owners of Government-subsidized apartment buildings to offset rising utility expenses and property taxes.  Various plaintiffs, including respondent members of a nationwide class of Government-subsidized housing tenants, successfully challenged the decision in lawsuits in nine Federal District Courts.  After two of the decisions were affirmed by Courts of Appeals, a newly appointed Secretary settled with most of the plaintiffs, including respondents.  While the District Court was administering the settlement, Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which authorizes an award of reasonable attorney's fees against the Government ""unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.""  Under the EAJA, the amount of fees awarded must
""be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that . . . fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.""
The court awarded fees to respondents under the EAJA, concluding that the decision not to implement the operating subsidy program had not been ""substantially justified,"" and basing the amount of the award, which exceeded $1 million, on ""special factors"" justifying hourly rates in excess of the $75 cap.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in concluding that the Secretary's position was not substantially justified, and that the special factors relied on by the District Court justified exceeding the $75 cap.
Held:
1. In reviewing the District Court's determination that the Secretary's position was not ""substantially justified,"" the Court of Appeals correctly applied an abuse-of-discretion standard, rather than a de novo standard of review.  Neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition requires this choice of standards.  However, deferential, abuse-of-discretion review is suggested by the EAJA's language, which 
Page 487 U. S. 553
 requires a fees award ""unless the court finds that"" (rather than simply ""unless"") the United States' position was substantially justified, and by the statute's structure, which expressly provides an abuse-of-discretion standard for review of agency fee determinations.  As a matter of sound judicial administration, the district courts are in a better position than the courts of appeals to decide the substantial justification question.  Moreover, that question is multifarious, novel, and little susceptible of useful generalization at this time, and is therefore likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-discretion standard will permit to develop.  Pp.  487 U. S. 557-563.
2. The statutory phrase ""substantially justified"" means justified in substance, or in the main -- that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.  This interpretation of the phrase accords with related uses of the term ""substantial,"" and is equivalent to the ""reasonable basis both in law and fact"" formulation adopted by the vast majority of Courts of Appeals.  Respondents' reliance on a House Committee Report pertaining to the 1985 reenactment of the EAJA for the proposition that ""substantial justification"" means ""more than mere reasonableness"" is misplaced, since the 1985 Report is not an authoritative interpretation of what the 1980 statute meant or of language drafted by the 1985 Committee, which merely accepted the existing statutory phrase.  Pp.  487 U. S. 563-568.
3. The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Government's position was not ""substantially justified.""  Although ""objective indicia"" can be relevant to establishing ""substantial justification,"" they are inconclusive in this case.  The Government's willingness to settle the litigation and the stage in the proceedings at which the merits were decided are not reliable objective indicia here.  Neither are views expressed by other courts on the merits, which provide some support on both sides.  The Government's arguments on the merits of the underlying issue do not command the conclusion that its position was substantially justified.  Pp.  487 U. S. 568-571.
4. The District Court abused its discretion in fixing the amount of respondents' attorney's fees, since none of the reasons relied on by the court to increase the reimbursement rate above the statutory maximum was a ""special factor"" within the EAJA's meaning.  Since the ""special factor"" formulation suggests that Congress thought that $75 an hour is generally sufficient regardless of the prevailing market rate, the ""limited availability"" factor must refer to attorneys ""qualified for the proceedings"" in some specialized sense, such as patent lawyers for patent proceedings, rather than just in their general legal competence.  Similarly, in order to preserve the $75 cap's effectiveness, other ""special factors"" 
Page 487 U. S. 554
 must be such as are not of broad and general application.  Thus, most of the factors relied on by the court -- the ""novelty and difficulty of issues,"" ""the undesirability of the case,"" ""the work and ability of counsel,"" ""the results obtained,"" and ""the contingent nature of the fee"" -- do not qualify, since they are applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation, and are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are.

			"|"Pierce v. Underwood
No. 86-1512
Argued December 1, 1987
Decided June 27, 1988
487 U.S. 552

Syllabus 
One of petitioner's predecessors as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development decided not to implement an ""operating subsidy"" program authorized by federal statute, which was intended to provide payments to owners of Government-subsidized apartment buildings to offset rising utility expenses and property taxes.  Various plaintiffs, including respondent members of a nationwide class of Government-subsidized housing tenants, successfully challenged the decision in lawsuits in nine Federal District Courts.  After two of the decisions were affirmed by Courts of Appeals, a newly appointed Secretary settled with most of the plaintiffs, including respondents.  While the District Court was administering the settlement, Congress passed the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which authorizes an award of reasonable attorney's fees against the Government ""unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.""  Under the EAJA, the amount of fees awarded must
""be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that . . . fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.""
The court awarded fees to respondents under the EAJA, concluding that the decision not to implement the operating subsidy program had not been ""substantially justified,"" and basing the amount of the award, which exceeded $1 million, on ""special factors"" justifying hourly rates in excess of the $75 cap.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had not abused its discretion in concluding that the Secretary's position was not substantially justified, and that the special factors relied on by the District Court justified exceeding the $75 cap.
Held:
1. In reviewing the District Court's determination that the Secretary's position was not ""substantially justified,"" the Court of Appeals correctly applied an abuse-of-discretion standard, rather than a de novo standard of review.  Neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition requires this choice of standards.  However, deferential, abuse-of-discretion review is suggested by the EAJA's language, which 
Page 487 U. S. 553
 requires a fees award ""unless the court finds that"" (rather than simply ""unless"") the United States' position was substantially justified, and by the statute's structure, which expressly provides an abuse-of-discretion standard for review of agency fee determinations.  As a matter of sound judicial administration, the district courts are in a better position than the courts of appeals to decide the substantial justification question.  Moreover, that question is multifarious, novel, and little susceptible of useful generalization at this time, and is therefore likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-discretion standard will permit to develop.  Pp.  487 U. S. 557-563.
2. The statutory phrase ""substantially justified"" means justified in substance, or in the main -- that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.  This interpretation of the phrase accords with related uses of the term ""substantial,"" and is equivalent to the ""reasonable basis both in law and fact"" formulation adopted by the vast majority of Courts of Appeals.  Respondents' reliance on a House Committee Report pertaining to the 1985 reenactment of the EAJA for the proposition that ""substantial justification"" means ""more than mere reasonableness"" is misplaced, since the 1985 Report is not an authoritative interpretation of what the 1980 statute meant or of language drafted by the 1985 Committee, which merely accepted the existing statutory phrase.  Pp.  487 U. S. 563-568.
3. The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Government's position was not ""substantially justified.""  Although ""objective indicia"" can be relevant to establishing ""substantial justification,"" they are inconclusive in this case.  The Government's willingness to settle the litigation and the stage in the proceedings at which the merits were decided are not reliable objective indicia here.  Neither are views expressed by other courts on the merits, which provide some support on both sides.  The Government's arguments on the merits of the underlying issue do not command the conclusion that its position was substantially justified.  Pp.  487 U. S. 568-571.
4. The District Court abused its discretion in fixing the amount of respondents' attorney's fees, since none of the reasons relied on by the court to increase the reimbursement rate above the statutory maximum was a ""special factor"" within the EAJA's meaning.  Since the ""special factor"" formulation suggests that Congress thought that $75 an hour is generally sufficient regardless of the prevailing market rate, the ""limited availability"" factor must refer to attorneys ""qualified for the proceedings"" in some specialized sense, such as patent lawyers for patent proceedings, rather than just in their general legal competence.  Similarly, in order to preserve the $75 cap's effectiveness, other ""special factors"" 
Page 487 U. S. 554
 must be such as are not of broad and general application.  Thus, most of the factors relied on by the court -- the ""novelty and difficulty of issues,"" ""the undesirability of the case,"" ""the work and ability of counsel,"" ""the results obtained,"" and ""the contingent nature of the fee"" -- do not qualify, since they are applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation, and are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are.

 Edward SPANGLER v. UNITED STATES.No. 87-1643 Supreme Court of the United States June 27, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioner was charged with several counts of extortion. At trial, he testified in his own behalf and presented several witnesses who testified in support of his character and reputation. He requested that the jury be instructed that evidence of good reputation, even standing alone, may be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant is guilty of the charges. Instead, the jury was instructed to consider such character evidence along with all the other evidence presented in the case to determine whether the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the particular crimes charged. The jury convicted petitioner, and the Third Circuit affirmed, holding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by refusing to give the requested instruction. 838 F.2d 85 (1988). 
 The decision below adds to the considerable disagreement that has arisen in the Courts of Appeals about whether and when it is proper for the judge to give the ""standing alone"" instruction to the jury. Some courts have held that such an instruction is never necessary and often, if not always, is improper because it actually misleads the jury. See, e.g., United States v. Burke, 781 F.2d 1234, 1238-1242 (CA7 1985); United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1146-1149 (CA1 1981); Black v. United States, 309 F.2d 331, 343-344 (CA8 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 934, 83 S. Ct. 880 (1963). Other courts have disagreed with this view, stating that at least in certain kinds of cases, [ Spangler v. U.S. 487 U.S. 1224 (1988) ][1224-Continued.] 
if not always, a defendant is entitled to have the jury be instructed that reputation evidence in and of itself can create a reasonable doubt as to guilt. See, e.g., United States v. Lewis, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 482 F.2d 632, 637 (1973); United States v. Cramer, 447 F.2d 210, 219 (CA2 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1024 (1972). In addition, many of the pattern jury instructions that have been used by District Courts around the country have included some kind of ""standing alone"" instruction. See, e.g., Burke, supra, at 1238; United States v. Callahan, 588 F.2d 1078, 1086, n. 1 (CA5 1979). This confusion can be traced directly to statements made by this Court in Edgington v. United States, 164 U.S. 361, 366, 73 (1896), and in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 476, 218 (1948).

 Rex H. REED v. Rosemary M. COLLYER etc. No. 87-1757 Supreme Court of the United States June 27, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice SCALIA, dissenting. 
 This is a suit against the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that in dismissing unfair labor practice charges filed by petitioner she violated petitioner's due process and equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment. The District Court, in an unpublished opinion, dismissed the suit on the ground that the General Counsel's decision to dismiss was not subject to judicial review. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, also in an unpublished opinion, affirmed. Judgt. order reported at 837 F.2d 1091 ( 1988). 
 While this petition for certiorari was pending, this Court decided Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), applying for the first time the principle that Congress' intent to preclude judicial review of ""constitutional claims"" must be expressed with greater clarity than its intent to preclude judicial review of other claims. Id., at 603-604, 108 S.Ct., at ___. The statute that Webster found insufficiently clear for that purpose pertained to the Central Intelligence Agency, and provided that ""[n]otwithstanding . . . the provisions of any other law, the Director of Central Intelligence may, in his discretion, terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the Agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States."" 50 U.S.C. 403(c). The statute at issue in the present case pertains to the NLRB, and provides that the General Counsel ""shall have final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section 160 of this title, and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board. . . ."" 29 U.S.C. 153(d). The present case, involving constitutional claims, [ Reed v. Collyer 487 U.S. 1225 (1988) ][1225-Continued.] 
is unquestionably a prime candidate for application of the new principle we adopted in Webster. While the area of administrative activity to which the suit pertains (enforcement discretion) is one in which agencies have traditionally been accorded broad insulation from judicial review, see Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), so was the area of managing the Nation's intelligence services at issue in Webster. And the text of the statute in Webster was much more suggestive of total unreviewability. 
 Petitioner has filed a supplemental brief persuasively arguing that Webster supports his position. Our denial of his petition is a puzzling departure from our standard practice of remanding (without opinion) pending cases whose outcome could well be affected by a decision we have promulgated after the judgment below. See R. Stern, E. Gressman, & S. Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice 5.12, p. 279 (6th ed. 1986). If we adhere to the rationale of Webster, we should certainly grant this petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the Sixth Circuit, and remand this case for reconsideration in light of Webster. It was my view that the rationale of Webster was wrong, because it did not square with the outcome of perfectly commonplace and perfectly correct decisions such as that of the Sixth Circuit here. See 486 U.S., at 606, 108 S.Ct., at ___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I would grant certiorari in this case in order to begin the necessary process of limiting Webster to its facts.

No. 87-5428
Argued April 27, 1988
Decided June 24, 1988
487 U.S. 266

Syllabus 
While incarcerated in a Tennessee prison, petitioner drafted a pro se notice of appeal from the Federal District Court's judgment dismissing his pro se habeas corpus petition, and, 27 days after the judgment, deposited the notice with the prison authorities for mailing to the District Court.  The date of deposit was recorded in the prison's outgoing mail log.  Because petitioner lacked the necessary funds, prison authorities refused his requests to certify the notice for proof that it had been deposited for mailing on the day in question, and to send the notice air mail.  Although the record contains no evidence of when the prison authorities actually mailed the notice or when the District Court actually received it, the court stamped the notice ""filed"" 31 days after the habeas judgment -- that is, one day after the expiration of the 30-day filing period for taking an appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1).  For this reason, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as jurisdictionally out of time.
Held:  Under Rule 4(a)(1), pro se prisoners' notices of appeal are ""filed"" at the moment of delivery to prison authorities for forwarding to the district court.  Cf. Fallen v. United States, 378 U. S. 139 (Stewart, J., concurring).  Unskilled in law, unaided by counsel, and unable to leave the prison, a pro se prisoner's control over the processing of his notice necessarily ceases as soon as he hands it over to the only public officials to whom he has access -- the prison authorities -- and the only information he will likely have is the date he delivered the notice to those authorities and the date ultimately stamped upon it.  The 30-day deadline for filing notices of appeal set forth in 28 U.S.C.  2107, which applies to civil actions including habeas proceedings, does not preclude relief for petitioner, since that statute does not define when a notice has been ""filed"" nor in any way suggests that, in the unique circumstances of a pro se prisoner, it would be inappropriate to conclude that such filing occurs at the moment of delivery to prison officials.  Such conclusion is not negated by the fact that Rules 3(a) and 4(a)(1) specify that the notice should be ""filed with the clerk of the District Court,"" since the relevant question is one of timing, not destination, and neither Rule sets forth criteria for determining the moment at which the filing has occurred.  The general rule that receipt by the court clerk constitutes filing, although appropriate 
Page 487 U. S. 267
 for most civil appeals, should not apply in the pro se prisoner context.  Nothing in either Rule 3(a) or Rule 4(a)(1) compels the conclusion that receipt by the clerk must be the moment of filing in all cases, and, in fact, a number of federal courts have recognized exceptions to the general principle.  Moreover, the rationale for the general rule is that the appellant has no control over delays after the court clerk's receipt of the notice -- a rationale that suggests that the moment of filing here should be the moment when the pro se prisoner necessarily loses control over his notice:  the moment of delivery to prison authorities for forwarding.  The bright-line rule recognizing receipt by prison authorities as the moment of filing will also decrease disputes and uncertainty as to when a filing actually occurred, since such authorities keep detailed logs for recording the date and time at which they receive papers for mailing, and can readily dispute a prisoner's contrary assertions.  Relying on the date of receipt, by contrast, would raise difficult questions as to whether the prison authorities, the Postal Service, or the court clerk is to blame for any delay.  Pp.  487 U.

487 U.S. 285

Syllabus 
After being informed by police that he had been indicted for murder, petitioner, who was in police custody, twice indicated his willingness to discuss the crime during interviews initiated by the authorities.  On both occasions, petitioner was read a form waiving his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, initialed each of the five specific warnings on the form, and signed the form.  He then gave inculpatory statements to the authorities.  The Illinois trial court denied his motions to suppress his statements on constitutional grounds, and the statements were used against him at trial.  The State Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, rejecting his contention that the warnings he received, while adequate to protect his Fifth Amendment rights as guaranteed by Miranda, did not adequately inform him of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Held:  The postindictment questioning that produced petitioner's incriminating statements did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Pp.  487 U. S. 290-300.
(a) Petitioner cannot avail himself of the argument that, because his Sixth Amendment right to counsel arose with his indictment, the police were thereafter barred from initiating questioning, since he at no time sought to have counsel present.  The essence of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, and its progeny, on which petitioner relies, is the preservation of the integrity of an accused's choice to communicate with police only through counsel.  Had petitioner indicated he wanted counsel's assistance, the questioning would have stopped, and further questioning would have been forbidden unless he himself initiated the meeting.  Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625.  However, once an accused ""knowingly and intelligently"" elects to proceed without counsel, the uncounseled statements he then makes need not be excluded at trial.  Pp.  487 U. S. 290-291.
(b) Petitioner's contention that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he did not ""knowingly and intelligently"" waive his right to have counsel present during his postindictment questioning is without merit.  The constitutional minimum for determining whether a waiver was ""knowing and intelligent"" is that the accused be made sufficiently aware of his right to have counsel present and of the possible consequences of a decision to forgo the aid of counsel.  Here, by admonishing petitioner with the Miranda warnings, respondent met this burden, and petitioner's waiver was valid.  First, by telling him that he had the 
Page 487 U. S. 286
 rights to consult an attorney, to have a lawyer present while he was questioned, and even to have a lawyer appointed if he could not afford one, the authorities conveyed to him the sum and substance of his Sixth Amendment rights.  Second, by informing him that any statement he made could be used against him, the authorities made him aware of the ultimate adverse consequence of his decision to waive his Sixth Amendment rights, and of what a lawyer could ""do for him"" during postindictment questioning:  namely, advise him to refrain from making any such statements.  Petitioner's inability here to articulate with precision what additional information should have been provided before he would have been competent to waive his right to counsel supports the conclusion that the information that was provided satisfies the constitutional minimum.  Pp.  487 U. S. 292-297.
(c) This Court has never adopted petitioner's suggestion that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is ""superior"" to or ""more difficult"" to waive than its Fifth Amendment counterpart.  Rather, in Sixth Amendment cases, the court has defined the scope of the right to counsel by a pragmatic assessment of the usefulness of counsel to the accused at the particular stage of the proceedings in question, and the dangers to the accused of proceeding without counsel at that stage.  An accused's waiver is ""knowing and intelligent"" if he is made aware of these basic facts.  Miranda warnings are sufficient for this purpose in the postindictment questioning context, because, at that stage, the role of counsel is relatively simple and limited, and the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation are less substantial and more obvious to an accused than they are at trial.

Syllabus 
After being informed by police that he had been indicted for murder, petitioner, who was in police custody, twice indicated his willingness to discuss the crime during interviews initiated by the authorities.  On both occasions, petitioner was read a form waiving his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, initialed each of the five specific warnings on the form, and signed the form.  He then gave inculpatory statements to the authorities.  The Illinois trial court denied his motions to suppress his statements on constitutional grounds, and the statements were used against him at trial.  The State Supreme Court affirmed his conviction, rejecting his contention that the warnings he received, while adequate to protect his Fifth Amendment rights as guaranteed by Miranda, did not adequately inform him of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

Syllabus 
Petitioner is one of 16 plaintiffs whose complaint seeking intervention in an employment discrimination action against respondent was dismissed by the District Court.  On remand following the Court of Appeals' reversal of the dismissal, the District Court granted summary judgment against petitioner on the ground that he had not been named in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals, albeit inadvertently.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that exclusion from the notice of appeal constituted a jurisdictional bar.
Held:  Failure to file a notice of appeal in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)'s requirement that the notice ""specify the party or parties taking the appeal"" presents a jurisdictional bar to the appeal.  The Rule's caveat that an appeal ""shall not be dismissed for [the notice's] informality of form or title"" does not aid petitioner, since his exclusion from the notice constitutes a failure to appeal, rather than excusable informality.  Nor can petitioner find relief in Rule 2's grant of broad equitable discretion to the courts of appeals, ""for good cause shown,"" to ""suspend the requirements . . . of any [Rule],"" since Rule 26(b) contains an exception forbidding ""enlarg[ing]"" Rule 4's mandatory time limits for filing a notice, which would be vitiated if courts could exercise jurisdiction over parties not named in the notice.  This reading is supported by the Advisory Committee's Note following Rule 3, and does not contravene Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, since, although, under that decision, a court may construe the Rules liberally and ignore ""mere technicalities"" in determining compliance, it may not waive the jurisdictional requirements of Rules 3 and 4, even for ""good cause shown.""  Here, petitioner never filed the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal, was not named by implication in the notice that was filed, and did not seek leave to amend the notice within the time limit set by Rule 4.  The use of ""et al."" in the notice was insufficient to notify respondent and the court that petitioner was an appellant, or to allow them to determine with certitude whether he should be bound by an adverse judgment or held liable for costs or sanctions.

Syllabus 
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 requires that an indictment be dismissed if the defendant is not brought to trial within a 70-day period, and requires the court, in determining whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, to
""consider, among others, each of the following factors:  the seriousness of the offense, the facts and circumstances . . . which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of [the Act and] of justice.""
18 U.S.C.  3162(a)(2).  After respondent failed to appear for his trial on federal narcotics charges, which was scheduled to commence in the Federal District Court in Seattle one day prior to the expiration of the 70-day period, 15 days not otherwise excludable under the Act elapsed between his subsequent arrest in California and the issuance by a federal grand jury in Seattle of a superseding indictment.  Respondent's return to Seattle for trial during this period was delayed for various reasons, including slow processing by the Government.  The District Court granted respondent's  3162(a)(2) motion to dismiss with prejudice, finding that, although respondent was charged with serious offenses, the Government's ""lackadaisical behavior"" was inexcusable, and that the administration of the Act and of justice required a stern response.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that, in light of the case's ""peculiar circumstances,"" the lower court had not abused its discretion in dismissing with prejudice in order to send a strong message to the Government that the Act must be observed.
Held:
1. The Act establishes a framework which guides district court determinations of whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, and appellate court review of such determinations.  Pp.  487 U. S. 332-337.
(a) Section 3162(a)(2)'s language establishes that, in determining whether to dismiss with or without prejudice, courts must consider at least the three factors specified in the section.  The Act's legislative history indicates that prejudice to the defendant should also be considered before reprosecution is barred, and that the decision to dismiss with or without prejudice is left to the district court's guided discretion, with neither remedy having priority.  Pp.  487 U. S. 332-335.
(b) Section 3162(a)(2) requires the district court to consider carefully the specified factors as applied to the particular case and to articulate 
Page 487 U. S. 327
 clearly their effect in rendering its decision.  On appeal, the reviewing court must undertake a more substantive scrutiny than would be the case absent legislatively identified standards, in order to ascertain whether the district court has properly applied the law to the facts or whether it has ignored or slighted a factor that Congress has deemed pertinent to the choice of remedy.  When the statutory factors have been properly considered, and supporting factual findings are not clearly in error, the district court's judgment of how opposing considerations balance should not be lightly disturbed.  Pp.  487 U. S. 335-337.
2. Analysis of the record within the above framework establishes that the District Court abused its discretion in deciding to bar reprosecution, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.  The District Court did not explain how it factored in the seriousness of the offenses with which respondent was charged.  Rather, the court relied heavily on its unexplained characterization of the Government conduct as ""lackadaisical,"" while failing to consider other relevant facts and circumstances leading to dismissal.  Seemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay in bringing respondent to trial and the consequential lack of prejudice to respondent, as well as respondent's own illicit contribution to the delay in failing to appear for trial.  The court's desire to send a strong message to the Government that unexcused delays will not be tolerated is, by definition, implicated in almost every case under the Act, and, standing alone, does not suffice to justify barring reprosecution in light of all the other circumstances.

Syllabus 
Appellant (MP&L), a subsidiary of Middle South Utilities (MSU), engages in wholesale sales of electricity, which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and in retail sales, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC).  MSU formed a new subsidiary, Middle South Energy, Inc. (MSE), to undertake the construction of a nuclear powerplant, Grand Gulf, in Mississippi.  Although appellant was to operate the plant, Grand Gulf was planned and designed to meet the need of the entire MSU system for a diversified and expanded fuel base.  The MPSC approved the application of MP&L and MSE to build Grand Gulf.  As Grand Gulf neared completion, MSU filed for FERC's approval agreements allocating Grand Gulf's capacity among its four operating subsidiaries and setting forth, inter alia, wholesale rates for the sale of Grand Gulf's capacity and energy.  Following extensive hearings in which parties representing consumer interests and various state regulatory agencies, including the MPSC, participated, FERC entered an order allocating Grand Gulf costs among the members of the MSU system in proportion to their relative demand for energy generated by the system as a whole.  The order required appellant to purchase 33% of the plant's output at rates determined by FERC to be just and reasonable.  On review, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed.  After public hearings, the MPSC granted appellant an increase in its retail rates to enable it to recover the costs of purchasing its FERC-mandated allocation of Grand Gulf power.  The Mississippi Attorney General and certain other parties representing Mississippi consumers appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, charging that, under state law, the MPSC had exceeded its authority by adopting retail rates to pay Grand Gulf expenses without first determining that the expenses were prudently incurred.  The court agreed and remanded the case, concluding that requiring the MPSC to review the prudence of management decisions incurring costs associated with Grand Gulf would not violate the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The court rejected appellant's argument that a state prudence review was foreclosed by the decision in Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 
Page 487 U. S. 355
 476 U. S. 953, which barred a State from setting retail rates that did not take into account FERC's allocation of power between two related utility companies.
Held:  The FERC proceedings preempted a prudence inquiry by the MPSC.  The decision in Nantahala rests on a foundation that is broad enough to support the order entered by FERC here, and to require the MPSC to treat appellant's FERC-mandated payments for Grand Gulf costs as reasonably incurred operating expenses for the purpose of setting appellant's retail rates.  Nantahala relied on the fundamental preemption principles, applicable here, that FERC has exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates; that FERC's exclusive jurisdiction applies not only to rates, but also to power allocations that affect wholesale rates; and that States may not bar regulated utilities from passing through to retail consumers FERC-mandated wholesale rates.  The Supremacy Clause compels the MPSC to permit appellant to recover as a reasonable operating expense costs incurred as a result of paying a FERC-determined wholesale rate for a FERC-mandated allocation of power.  The Mississippi Supreme Court erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of FERC jurisdiction turned on whether a particular matter (here, the ""prudence"" question) was actually determined in the FERC proceedings.  The reasonableness of rates and agreements regulated by FERC may not be collaterally attacked in state or federal courts.  Here, the question of prudence was not discussed in the proceedings before FERC or on review by the Court of Appeals, because no party raised the issue, not because it was a matter beyond the scope of FERC's jurisdiction.  Moreover, FERC did, in fact, consider and reject some aspects of the prudence review that the Mississippi Supreme Court directed the MPSC to conduct.  Pp.  487 U. S. 369-377;

 476 U. S. 953, which barred a State from setting retail rates that did not take into account FERC's allocation of power between two related utility companies.
Held:  The FERC proceedings preempted a prudence inquiry by the MPSC.  The decision in Nantahala rests on a foundation that is broad enough to support the order entered by FERC here, and to require the MPSC to treat appellant's FERC-mandated payments for Grand Gulf costs as reasonably incurred operating expenses for the purpose of setting appellant's retail rates.  Nantahala relied on the fundamental preemption principles, applicable here, that FERC has exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates; that FERC's exclusive jurisdiction applies not only to rates, but also to power allocations that affect wholesale rates; and that States may not bar regulated utilities from passing through to retail consumers FERC-mandated wholesale rates.  The Supremacy Clause compels the MPSC to permit appellant to recover as a reasonable operating expense costs incurred as a result of paying a FERC-determined wholesale rate for a FERC-mandated allocation of power.  The Mississippi Supreme Court erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of FERC jurisdiction turned on whether a particular matter (here, the ""prudence"" question) was actually determined in the FERC proceedings.  The reasonableness of rates and agreements regulated by FERC may not be collaterally attacked in state or federal courts.  Here, the question of prudence was not discussed in the proceedings before FERC or on review by the Court of Appeals, because no party raised the issue, not because it was a matter beyond the scope of FERC's jurisdiction.  Moreover, FERC did, in fact, consider and reject some aspects of the prudence review that the Mississippi Supreme Court directed the MPSC to conduct.  Pp.  487 U. S. 369-377;

No. 87-626
Argued April 26, 1988

487 U.S. 392

Syllabus 
An obviously intoxicated off-duty serviceman (Carr) fired several rifle shots into petitioners' automobile on a public street near the Bethesda Naval Hospital where Carr worked, causing physical injury to one of the petitioners and damage to the car.  Petitioners filed suit against the Government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in Federal District Court, alleging that their injuries were caused by the Government's negligence in allowing Carr to leave the hospital with a loaded rifle in his possession.  The facts, as alleged in the complaint and as supplemented by discovery, were that, after finishing his work shift, Carr consumed a large amount of alcoholic beverages; that naval corpsmen found him in a drunken stupor in a hospital building and attempted to take him to the emergency room; that the corpsmen fled when they saw a rifle in his possession; that the corpsmen neither took further action to subdue Carr nor alerted the appropriate authorities that he was intoxicated and brandishing a weapon; and that he fired the shots into petitioners' car later that evening.  The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that the claim was barred by the FTCA's intentional tort exception, 28 U.S.C.  2680(h), which provides that the Act's provisions subjecting the Government to liability for the negligent or wrongful act or omission of a Government employee while acting within the scope of his employment shall not apply to any claim ""arising out of "" an assault or battery.  The court rejected petitioners' argument that  2680(h) was not applicable because they were relying, not on the fact that Carr was a Government employee when he assaulted them, but rather on the negligence of other Government employees who failed to prevent his use of the rifle.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioners' claim is not barred by  2680(h).  Although the words ""any claims arising out of "" an assault or battery are broad enough to bar all claims based entirely on an assault or battery, in at least some situations, the fact that injury was directly caused by an assault or battery will not preclude liability against the Government for negligently allowing the assault to occur.  Cf. United States v. Muniz, 374 U. S. 150.  Even assuming that, when an intentional tort is a sine qua non of recovery, the action ""arises out of"" that tort, nevertheless the  2680(h) exception does not bar recovery in this case.  The intentional tort exception is inapplicable 
Page 487 U. S. 393
 to torts that fall outside the scope of the FTCA's general waiver of the Government's immunity from liability.  Since the FTCA covers actions for personal injuries caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of any Government employee ""while acting within the scope of his office or employment,"" if nothing more was involved here than Carr's conduct at the time he shot at petitioners, there would be no basis for imposing liability on the Government.  As alleged in this case, however, the negligence of other Government employees who allowed a foreseeable assault and battery to occur may furnish a basis for Government liability that is entirely independent of Carr's employment status.  Assuming that petitioners' version of the facts would support recovery under Maryland law on a negligence theory if the naval hospital had been owned and operated by a private person, the mere fact that Carr happened to be an off-duty federal employee would not provide a basis for protecting the Government from liability that would attach if Carr had been a non-Government employed patient or visitor in the hospital.  The fact that Carr's behavior is characterized as an intentional assault, rather than a negligent act, is also irrelevant.  Pp.  487 U. S. 398-403.

487 U.S. 412

Syllabus 
In 1980, Congress enacted legislation requiring that most disability determinations under Title II of the Social Security Act be reviewed at least once every three years.  Under the ""continuing disability review"" (CDR) program, as originally implemented by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, benefits were usually terminated if the state agency performing the initial evaluation found that a claimant had become ineligible, and were not available during administrative appeals.  Finding that benefits were frequently being improperly terminated by state agencies under CDR, only to be reinstated by a federal administrative law judge (ALJ) on appeal, Congress enacted reform legislation in 1983 and 1984, which, inter alia, provided for the continuation of benefits through the completion of ALJ review.  Respondents, individuals whose Title II benefits were improperly terminated in 1981 and 1982, but were later restored, filed suit in Federal District Court.  They alleged that petitioners, one Arizona and two federal officials who were CDR policymakers, had violated respondents' due process rights by adopting illegal policies that led to the benefits terminations.  Respondents sought money damages from petitioners, in their individual capacities, for emotional distress and for loss of necessities proximately caused by petitioners' conduct.  The court dismissed the case, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, noting that respondents' money damages claims were predicated on the constitutional tort theory of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, and concluding, inter alia, that it could not be determined as a matter of law that respondents could prove no state of facts warranting recovery.
Held:  The improper denial of Social Security disability benefits, allegedly resulting from due process violations by petitioners in their administration of the CDR program, cannot give rise to a cause of action for money damages against petitioners.  Pp.  487 U. S. 420-429.
(a) A money damages remedy against federal officials for constitutional torts will not be devised by the courts where ""special factors counse[l] hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.""  Bivens, supra, at  403 U. S. 396.  Such ""special factors"" include the existence of statutory mechanisms giving meaningful remedies against the United States, even though those remedies do not provide ""complete relief"" to 
Page 487 U. S. 413
 the claimant.  Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367.  Thus, the courts must give appropriate deference to indications that congressional inaction has not been inadvertent, and should not create Bivens remedies when the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers to be adequate remedies for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of the program's administration.  Pp.  487 U. S. 420-423.
(b) Since the elaborate CDR remedial scheme devised by Congress does not include a money damages remedy against officials responsible for unconstitutional conduct that leads to the wrongful denial of benefits, such a remedy is unavailable.  The present case is indistinguishable from Bush, supra.  In both, Congress failed to authorize ""complete relief"" for emotional distress and other hardships, but Congress is presumed to have balanced governmental efficiency and individual rights in an acceptable manner.  Moreover, congressional attention to problems in CDR administration (including the very problems that gave rise to this case) has been frequent and intense, as shown by the enactment of reform legislation on two occasions.  Congress' unwillingness to provide compensation for consequential damages is at least as clear here as it was in Bush. Bush is not limited to its civil service context, since its reasoning -- that Congress is in a better position than courts to decide whether the creation of a new substantive legal liability would serve the public interest -- applies as much, or more, in this case.  Respondents' attempt to distinguish Bush on the ground that the plaintiff there received compensation for the constitutional violation itself, while respondents here have merely received benefits to which they would have been entitled had there been no constitutional violation, is not analytically meaningful, since the harm resulting from the alleged constitutional violation can in neither case be separated from the denial of the statutory right.  The fact that respondents have not been fully compensated for the injury caused by lengthy delays in providing the benefits on which they depended for the necessities of life cannot be remedied by this Court.  Congress is charged with designing welfare benefits programs, and with balancing the need for administrative efficiency against individual rights, and Congress has discharged that responsibility to the extent that it affects this case.

No. 86-7113.
Argued March 30, 1988
Decided June 24, 1988
487 U.S. 450

Syllabus 
Under North Dakota statutes, thinly populated school districts are authorized to ""reorganize"" themselves into larger districts so that education can be provided more efficiently.  Reorganization proposals must include provisions for transporting students to and from their homes.  Appellee Dickinson Public Schools, which is relatively populous, has chosen not to participate in such a reorganization.  In 1973, Dickinson's School Board instituted door-to-door bus service and began charging a fee for such transportation.  In 1979, the State enacted a statute authorizing nonreorganized school districts like Dickinson to charge a fee for schoolbus service, not to exceed the district's estimated cost of providing the service.  Appellants are a Dickinson schoolchild (Sarita Kadrmas) and her mother.  In 1985, when the Kadrmas family refused to agree to the busing fee and began transporting Sarita to school privately, appellants filed a state court action seeking to enjoin appellees from collecting any fee for the bus service.  The action was dismissed on the merits, and the Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed, holding that the 1979 statute does not violate state law or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court rejected appellants' contention that the statute unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of wealth.  It also rejected the contention that the distinction drawn by the statute between reorganized and nonreorganized school districts violates the Equal Protection Clause.
Held:
1. There is no merit to appellees' contention that, because Mrs. Kadrmas signed contracts for schoolbus service, and made partial payments thereon, after the State Supreme Court's decision, and because Sarita has since been ""enjoying the benefits"" of the bus service, appellants are estopped from pursuing this appeal.  The school board's authority to offer the benefit of subsidized bus transportation is not given by the challenged statute, but by other provisions of state law.  The fee that Dickinson is permitted to charge under the 1979 statute is a burden, rather than a benefit, to appellants, and they are not estopped from raising an equal protection challenge to the statute that imposes that burden on them.  Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U. S. 245, distinguished.  Nor is there any merit to appellees' suggestion that an Article III ""case or controversy"" 
Page 487 U. S. 451
 is lacking because execution of the bus service contracts rendered this case ""moot.""  A decision in appellants' favor may relieve them from paying the balance owing under the bus service contracts, and would relieve them of future assessments under the authority of the 1979 statute.  Because Sarita was only nine years old at the time of trial, and because there are younger children in the family, the ongoing and concrete nature of the controversy is readily apparent.  Pp.  487 U. S. 456-457.
2. The 1979 statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  487 U. S. 457-465.
(a) Applying a form of strict or ""heightened"" scrutiny to the North Dakota statute would not be supported by precedent.  Statutes having different effects on the wealthy and the poor are not, on that account alone, subject to strict equal protection scrutiny.  Nor is education a ""fundamental right"" that triggers strict scrutiny when government interferes with an individual's access to it.  The ""heightened scrutiny"" standard of review -- which is less demanding than ""strict scrutiny"" but more demanding that the standard rational relation test -- has generally been applied only in cases that involved discriminatory classifications based on sex or illegitimacy.  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202, where a heightened scrutiny standard was used to invalidate a State's denial to the children of illegal aliens of the free public education that it made available to other residents, has not been extended beyond its unique circumstances, and does not control here.  Moreover, decisions invalidating laws that barred indigent litigants from using the judicial process in circumstances where they had no alternative to that process are inapposite here.  Applying the rational relation test, a State's decision to allow local school boards the option of charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally permissible.  The Constitution does not require that such service be provided at all, and choosing to offer the service does not entail a constitutional obligation to offer it for free.  Encouraging local school districts to provide bus service is a legitimate state purpose, and it is rational for the State to refrain from undermining its objective with a rule requiring that general revenues be used to subsidize an optional service that will benefit a minority of the district's families.  Pp.  487 U. S. 457-462.
(b) The distinction drawn in the 1979 statute between reorganized and nonreorganized school districts does not create an equal protection violation.  Social and economic legislation like the 1979 statute carries with it a presumption of constitutionality that can only be overcome by a clear showing of arbitrariness and irrationality.  The explanation of the statute offered by appellees and the State -- which relates to encouraging school district reorganization and more effective school systems -- is adequate to justify the distinction it draws among districts.  Appellants 
Page 487 U. S. 452
 have failed to carry the heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute is both arbitrary and irrational.  Pp.  487 U. S. 462-465.

Encouraging local school districts to provide bus service is a legitimate state purpose, and it is rational for the State to refrain from undermining its objective with a rule requiring that general revenues be used to subsidize an optional service that will benefit a minority of the district's families.  Pp.  487 U. S. 457-462.
(b) The distinction drawn in the 1979 statute between reorganized and nonreorganized school districts does not create an equal protection violation.  Social and economic legislation like the 1979 statute carries with it a presumption of constitutionality that can only be overcome by a clear showing of arbitrariness and irrationality.  The explanation of the statute offered by appellees and the State -- which relates to encouraging school district reorganization and more effective school systems -- is adequate to justify the distinction it draws among districts.  Appellants

 have failed to carry the heavy burden of demonstrating that the statute is both arbitrary and irrational.  Pp.  487 U. S. 462-465.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged with the capital offense of first-degree murder.  An Oklahoma statute provides both parties in capital trials with nine peremptory challenges to prospective jurors.  After the trial court denied petitioner's motion to remove for cause prospective juror Huling, who had declared that he would vote to impose death automatically if the jury found petitioner guilty, the defense exercised one of its peremptory challenges to remove him.  Although the defense used all nine of its challenges, it did not challenge for cause any of the 12 jurors who actually heard the case.  At the close of jury selection, the trial court overruled the objection of petitioner, who is black, that the composition of the all-white jury denied him a fair and impartial trial by his peers.  The jury found petitioner guilty and sentenced him to death, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Although the trial court erred in failing to remove Huling for cause under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, and Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, such failure did not abridge petitioner's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to an impartial jury, since Huling did not sit on the jury that sentenced petitioner to death, petitioner's peremptory challenge having removed him as effectively as if the trial court had done so.  The broad language in Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648,  481 U. S. 665, that the
""relevant inquiry is whether the composition of the jury panel as a whole could possibly have been affected by the trial court's error""
(internal quotations omitted; emphasis in original), is too sweeping to be applied literally, and should not be extended beyond its context:  the erroneous ""Witherspoon exclusion"" of a qualified juror in a capital case.  Although the failure to remove Huling may have resulted in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided the case, one of the principal concerns animating Gray -- the inability to know whether the prosecution could and would have used a peremptory challenge to remove the erroneous excluded juror -- is absent here, since Huling was in fact removed.  The fact that petitioner had to use a peremptory challenge to cure the court's error does not mean that the Sixth Amendment was violated, since peremptory challenges are not of constitutional dimension, 
Page 487 U. S. 82
 but are merely a means to achieve the end of an impartial jury.  Petitioner has failed to establish that the jury that actually sat was not impartial, since he never challenged any of the jurors for cause, nor suggested their partiality, and since, in this Court, he neither pressed the claim that the absence of blacks deprived the jury of partiality nor suggested that such absence was in any way related to the court's failure to remove Huling.  Pp.  487 U. S. 85-88.
2. The trial court's failure to remove Huling for cause did not abridge petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by arbitrarily depriving him of his full complement of peremptory challenges.  Even assuming that the Constitution renders a State's denial or impairment of the right to exercise such challenges reversible error without a showing of prejudice, cf. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, that ""right"" would be ""denied or impaired"" only if the defendant did not receive that which state law provides, since peremptory challenges are a creature of statute, and not constitutionally required, and, accordingly, it is for the State to determine their number and to define their purpose and the manner of their exercise.  Although Oklahoma provides a capital defendant with nine peremptory challenges, state law has long qualified this grant with the requirement that the defendant must use those challenges to cure erroneous refusals to excuse jurors for cause.  There is nothing arbitrary or irrational about such a requirement, since it subordinates the unfettered discretion to use challenges to the goal of empaneling an impartial jury, and since this Court has sanctioned numerous incursions upon the right to challenge peremptorily.  Thus, petitioner's due process challenge must fail, since he received all that Oklahoma law allowed him.  Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, and Hicks v. Oklahoma, 447 U.

Syllabus 
A federal grand jury issued a subpoena to petitioner as the president of two corporations, requiring him to produce the corporations' records.  The subpoena provided that petitioner could deliver the records to the agent serving the subpoena, and did not require petitioner to testify.  The corporations involved were incorporated by petitioner, who is the sole shareholder of one of them.  Petitioner, his wife, and his mother are the directors of both corporations, and his wife and mother are secretary-treasurer and vice-president of the corporations, respectively, but neither has any authority over the corporations' business affairs.  The District Court denied petitioner's motion to quash the subpoena, holding that the ""collective entity doctrine"" prevented petitioner from asserting that his act of producing the corporations' records was protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The custodian of corporate records may not resist a subpoena for such records on the ground that the act of production will incriminate him in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  This Court's precedents as to the development of the collective entity doctrine do not support petitioner's argument that, even though the contents of subpoenaed business records are not privileged, and even though corporations are not protected by the Fifth Amendment, nevertheless his act of producing the documents has independent testimonial significance, which would incriminate him individually, and that the Fifth Amendment prohibits Government compulsion of that act.  If petitioner had conducted his business as a sole proprietorship, United States v. Doe, 465 U. S. 605, would require that he be provided the opportunity to show that his act of production would entail testimonial self-incrimination as to admissions that the records existed, were in his possession, and were authentic.  However, representatives of a collective entity act as agents, and the official records of the organization that are held by them in a representative, rather than a personal, capacity cannot be the subject of their personal privilege against self-incrimination, even though production of the papers might tend to incriminate them personally.  The plain mandate of the precedents is that the corporate entity doctrine applies regardless of the corporation's size, and regardless of whether the subpoena is addressed 
Page 487 U. S. 100
 to the corporation or, as here, to the individual in his capacity as the records' custodian.  Any claim of Fifth Amendment privilege asserted by the agent would be tantamount to a claim of privilege by the corporation, which possesses no such privilege.  Recognizing a Fifth Amendment privilege on behalf of records custodians of collective entities would have a detrimental impact on the Government's efforts to prosecute ""white-collar crime.""  Such impact cannot be satisfactorily minimized by either granting the custodian statutory immunity as to the act of production or addressing the subpoena to the corporation and allowing it to choose an agent to produce the records who can do so without incriminating himself.  However, since the custodian acts as the corporation's representative, the act of production is deemed one of the corporation, not the individual, and the Government may make no evidentiary use of the ""individual act"" of production against the individual.

Syllabus 
Nine months after being allegedly beaten by Milwaukee police officers who arrested him on a disorderly conduct charge that was later dropped, petitioner filed this state court action against the city and certain of the officers under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the beating and arrest were racially motivated, and violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.  The officers (respondents) moved to dismiss the suit because of petitioner's failure to comply with Wisconsin's notice of claim statute, which provides, inter alia, that before suit may be brought in state court against a state or local governmental entity or officer, the plaintiff, within 120 days of the alleged injury, must notify the defendant of the circumstances and amount of the claim and the plaintiff's intent to hold the named defendant liable; that the defendant then has 120 days to grant or disallow the requested relief; and that the plaintiff must bring suit within six months of receiving notice of disallowance.  The court denied the motion as to petitioner's  1983 claim, and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed, holding that, while Congress may establish the procedural framework under which claims are heard in federal courts, States retain the authority under the Constitution to prescribe procedures that govern actions in their own tribunals, including actions to vindicate congressionally created rights.
Held:  Because the Wisconsin notice of claim statute conflicts in both its purpose and effects with  1983's remedial objectives, and because its enforcement in state court actions will frequently and predictably produce different outcomes in  1983 litigation based solely on whether the claim is asserted in state or federal court, it is preempted pursuant to the Supremacy Clause when the  1983 action is brought in a state court.  Pp.  487 U. S. 138-153.
(a) Unlike the lack of statutes of limitations in the federal civil rights laws -- which has led to borrowing state law limitations periods for personal injury claims -- the absence of any federal notice of claim provision is not a deficiency requiring the importation of such a state law provision into the federal civil rights scheme.  Notice of claim rules are neither universally familiar nor in any sense indispensable prerequisites to litigation, and there is thus no reason to suppose that Congress intended federal courts to apply such rules, which significantly inhibit the ability to 
Page 487 U. S. 132
 bring federal actions.  With regard to federal preemption (as opposed to adoption) of state law, application of the notice requirement burdens the exercise of the federal right by forcing civil rights victims who seek redress in state courts to comply with a requirement that is absent from civil rights litigation in federal courts.  Moreover, enforcement of such statutes in state court  1983 actions will frequently and predictably produce different outcomes in federal civil rights litigation based solely on whether the litigation takes place in state or federal court.  Pp.  487 U. S. 139-141.
(b) Wisconsin's notice of claim statute undermines  1983's unique remedy against state governmental bodies and their officials by conditioning the right of recovery so as to minimize governmental liability.  The state statute also discriminates against the federal right, since the State affords the victim of an intentional tort two years to recognize the compensable nature of his or her injury, while the civil rights victim is given only four months to appreciate that he or she has been deprived of a federal constitutional or statutory right.  Moreover, the notice provision operates, in part, as an exhaustion requirement by forcing claimants to seek satisfaction in the first instance from the governmental defendant.  Congress never intended that those injured by governmental wrongdoers could be required, as a condition of recovery, to submit their claims to the government responsible for their injuries.  Pp.  487 U. S. 141-142.
(c) Wisconsin has chosen, through its legislative scheme governing citizens' rights to sue the State's subdivisions, to expose its subdivisions to large liability and defense costs, and has made the concomitant decision to impose notice conditions that assist the subdivisions in controlling those costs.  The decision to subject state subdivisions to liability for violations of federal rights, however, was a choice that Congress made, and it is a decision that the State has no authority to override.  That state courts will hear the entire  1983 cause of action once a plaintiff complies with the notice statute does not alter the fact that the statute discriminates against the precise type of claim Congress has created.  Pp.  487 U. S. 142-145.
(d) While prompt investigation of claims inures to the benefit of both claimants and local governments, notice statutes are enacted primarily for the benefit of governmental defendants, and are intended to afford such defendants an opportunity to prepare a stronger case.  Sound notions of public administration may support the prompt notice requirement, but those policies necessarily clash with the remedial purposes of the federal civil rights laws.  Pp.  487 U. S. 145-146.
(e) Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S. 496, which held that plaintiffs need not exhaust state administrative remedies before instituting  1983 suits in federal court, is not inapplicable to this state court suit on the theory, asserted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, that 
Page 487 U. S. 133
 States retain the authority to prescribe the rules and procedures governing suits in their courts.  That authority does not extend so far as to permit States to place conditions on the vindication of a federal right.  Congress meant to provide individuals immediate access to the federal courts, and did not contemplate that those who sought to vindicate their federal rights in state courts could be required to seek redress in the first instance from the very state officials whose hostility to those rights precipitated their injuries.  There is no merit to respondents' contention that the exhaustion requirement imposed by the Wisconsin statute is essentially de minimis, because the statutory settlement period entails none of the additional expense or undue delay typically associated with administrative remedies, and does not alter a claimant's right to seek full compensation through suit.  Moreover, to the extent the exhaustion requirement is designed to sift out ""specious claims"" from the stream of complaints that can inundate local governments in the absence of immunity, such a policy is inconsistent with the aims of the federal legislation.  Pp.  487 U. S. 146-150.
(f) Application of Wisconsin's statute to state court  1983 actions cannot be approved as a matter of equitable federalism.  Just as federal courts are constitutionally obligated to apply state law to state claims, the Supremacy Clause imposes on state courts a constitutional duty to proceed in such manner that all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law are protected.  A state law that predictably alters the outcome of  1983 claims depending solely on whether they are brought in state or federal court within the State is obviously inconsistent with the federal interest in intrastate uniformity.  Pp.  487 U. S. 150-153.

Moreover, to the extent the exhaustion requirement is designed to sift out ""specious claims"" from the stream of complaints that can inundate local governments in the absence of immunity, such a policy is inconsistent with the aims of the federal legislation.  Pp.  487 U. S. 146-150.
(f) Application of Wisconsin's statute to state court  1983 actions cannot be approved as a matter of equitable federalism.  Just as federal courts are constitutionally obligated to apply state law to state claims, the Supremacy Clause imposes on state courts a constitutional duty to proceed in such manner that all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law are protected.  A state law that predictably alters the outcome of  1983 claims depending solely on whether they are brought in state or federal court within the State is obviously inconsistent with the federal interest in intrastate uniformity.  Pp.  487 U. S. 150-153.

Syllabus 
At petitioner's Texas capital murder trial, his principal defense was that he had been mistakenly identified, and that -- even if he was the person who stabbed the victim -- her death resulted from incompetent hospital treatment, and not the assault.  After the jury found him guilty, the sole mitigating evidence he presented at the penalty phase was the stipulation that his disciplinary record while incarcerated, both before and after the murder, was without incident.  At the conclusion of the penalty hearing, the trial court, pursuant to state law, submitted two ""Special Issues"" to the jury, asking whether it found from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that the murder was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result, and (2) that there was a probability that petitioner would constitute a continuing threat to society.  The court instructed the jury that, if their answer was ""Yes"" to both questions, petitioner would be sentenced to death.  Earlier, in order to direct the jury's consideration of the Special Issues, petitioner had submitted five ""special requested"" jury instructions, which, in essence, would have told the jury that any evidence they felt mitigated against the death penalty should be taken into account in answering the Special Issues, and could alone be enough to return a negative answer to either one or both of the questions, even if they otherwise believed that ""Yes"" answers were warranted.  The court declined to give the requested instructions, and instead remonstrated the jury to remember and be guided by all instructions previously given, which included the charge that they arrive at their verdict based on all the evidence.  After the jury returned ""Yes"" answers to both Special Issues, the court sentenced petitioner to death, and the state appellate court affirmed.  Petitioner then filed this habeas corpus action, arguing that, absent his special requested instructions, the Special Issues limited the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence in violation of the Eighth Amendment under this Court's decisions.  Rejecting this claim, the District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
823 F.2d 98, affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that the trial court's refusal to give petitioner's 
Page 487 U. S. 165
 requested special instructions did not violate his Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence.  Neither the instructions actually given nor the Texas Special Issues precluded jury consideration of any relevant mitigating circumstances, or otherwise unconstitutionally limited the jury's discretion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 171-183.
(a) There is no merit to petitioner's contention that the sentencing jury was deprived of a sufficient opportunity to consider any ""residual doubt"" it might have harbored about his identity as the murderer, or about the extent to which his actions (as opposed to medical mistreatment) actually caused, or were intended to result in, the victim's death.  This Court has never held that a capital defendant has a constitutional right to an instruction telling the jury to revisit the question of his guilt as a basis for mitigation.  The discussion of the ""residual doubt"" question in Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, stands only for the simple truism that such doubts will inure to the defendant's benefit where the State is willing to allow him to capitalize upon them.  Nor does Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, establish the claimed ""right,"" since lingering doubts over the defendant's guilt do not relate to his ""character"" or ""record,"" or to ""the circumstances of the offense,"" which the sentencer must be given a chance to consider in mitigation.  However, even if the claimed ""right"" existed, the rejection of petitioner's proffered instructions did not impair that right, since the trial court placed no limitation on petitioner's opportunity to press the ""residual doubts"" issue.  Moreover, the medical mistreatment and intentional killing questions are precisely the type of concerns that the jury might have considered in answering the deliberateness question of the first Special Issue, and, thus, petitioner was not deprived of any opportunity to make, and in fact made, a nondeliberateness argument to the jury.  In any case, there was nothing in the proffered special instructions that offered specific direction to the jury concerning their consideration of any of these ""residual doubt"" questions.  Pp.  487 U. S. 172-176.
(b) Since, at the sentencing hearing, petitioner was permitted to emphasize evidence of his good prison disciplinary record with regard to the second Special Issue concerning future dangerousness, the jury was not precluded from giving adequate mitigating weight to that evidence.  Petitioner's contention that the failure to give his requested instructions deprived the evidence of its significance as a reflection of his ""character"" independent of its relevance to the Special Issues is not convincing, since nothing in this Court's cases suggests that ""character,"" as illuminated by a disciplinary record, encompasses anything more than likely future behavior.  Cf. Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1.  Furthermore, nothing in petitioner's presentation or discussion of his record at the hearing suggested that the jury should consider that evidence as probative of anything more than future dangerousness.  Petitioner cannot 
Page 487 U. S. 166
 avail himself of the statement in Eddings, supra, at  455 U. S. 114, that the sentencing jury may not be precluded from considering ""any relevant mitigating evidence,"" since the State is entitled to structure the jury's consideration of mitigating factors.  The claim that the jury should have been instructed that it was entitled to vote against the death penalty ""independent"" of its answers to the Special Issues is foreclosed by Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, which held that the State could constitutionally impose death if the jury answered ""Yes"" to both Special Issues.  Pp.  487 U. S. 177-180.
(c) The Texas capital sentencing system adequately allows for jury consideration of mitigating circumstances, and therefore sufficiently provides for jury discretion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 181-182.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded that the Texas capital sentencing procedure did not unconstitutionally prevent the jury from giving mitigating effect to any evidence relevant to petitioner's character or background or the circumstances of the offense.  Pp.  487 U. S. 183-188.
(a) Although the Texas procedure did confine consideration of the stipulation as to petitioner's prison disciplinary record to the context of the special verdict question regarding future dangerousness, thereby preventing the jury from treating the stipulation as if it were relevant to other character traits, that limitation has no practical or constitutional significance on the facts of this case, because the stipulation had no relevance to any aspect of petitioner's character other than a lack of future dangerousness.  Thus, petitioner was not prejudiced by the limitation, since it did not interfere with his presentation of mitigating evidence or with the jury's ability to give effect to that evidence.  Cf. Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1.  Pp.  487 U. S. 185-187.
(b) Although the capital sentencing procedure may have prevented the jury from giving effect to any ""residual doubts"" it might have had about petitioner's guilt, that limitation did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Rather than being a fact about the defendant's character or background or the circumstances of the particular offense, ""residual doubt"" is merely a lingering uncertainty about facts -- a state of mind that exists somewhere between ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" and ""absolute certainty"" -- and thus is not a mitigating circumstance under this Court's decisions, which have never required such a heightened burden of proof at capital sentencing.  Pp.  487 U. S. 187-188.

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a subpoena, petitioner, the target of a federal grand jury investigation, produced some records as to accounts at foreign banks, but invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when questioned about the existence or location of additional bank records.  After the foreign banks refused to comply with subpoenas to produce any account records because their governments' laws prohibit such disclosure without the customer's consent, the Government filed a motion with the Federal District Court for an order directing petitioner to sign a consent directive, without identifying or acknowledging the existence of any account, authorizing the banks to disclose records of any and all accounts over which he had a right of withdrawal.  The court denied the motion, concluding that compelling petitioner to sign the form was prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed.  On remand, the District Court ordered petitioner to execute the consent directive, and, after he refused, found him in civil contempt.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Because the consent directive here is not testimonial in nature, compelling petitioner to sign it does not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Pp.  487 U. S. 206-218.
(a) In order to be ""testimonial,"" an accused's oral or written communication, or act, must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.  Cf. Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S. 391; United States v. Doe, 465 U. S. 605.  It is consistent with the history of and the policies underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause to hold that the privilege may be asserted only to resist compelled explicit or implicit disclosures of incriminating information.  Pp.  487 U. S. 207-214.
(b) Petitioner's execution of the consent directive here would not have testimonial significance, because neither the form nor its execution communicates any factual assertions, implicit or explicit, or conveys any information to the Government.  The form does not acknowledge that an account in a foreign bank is in existence, or that it is controlled by petitioner.  Nor does the form indicate whether documents or any other information relating to petitioner are present at the foreign bank, assuming that such an account does exist.  Given the consent directive's phraseology, petitioner's execution of the directive has no testimonial 
Page 487 U. S. 202

If the Government obtains bank records after petitioner signs the directive, the only factual statement made by anyone will be the bank's implicit declaration, by its act of production in response to a subpoena, that it believes the accounts to be petitioner's.

Syllabus 
Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, held that unequal pension plan contributions for male and female employees based on actuarial tables reflecting women's greater life spans violated the sex discrimination prohibitions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Arizona Governing Committee for Tax Deferred Annuity & Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, 463 U. S. 1073, extended this nondiscrimination principle to unequal benefits payments.  Florida's Retirement System (Florida System) for state and local government employees has always required equal contributions and equal ""normal"" benefits for similarly situated male and female employees.  Until Norris, the Florida System also offered three retirement benefit options that were calculated in accordance with sex-based actuarial tables yielding lower monthly benefits for male retirees.  Immediately after Norris, Florida adopted unisex actuarial tables equalizing benefits under all of the offered plans for similarly situated male and female employees retiring after Norris' effective date.  Respondents, male employees who had retired before that date as optional plan participants, filed a class action in Federal District Court, alleging that the optional plans violated Title VII.  The court entered summary judgment for respondents, awarding relief to class members who retired after Manhart's, and before Norris', effective date, by retroactively ""topping up"" monthly benefits to the current unisex levels for the period between Manhart and the date of the court's judgment.  Class members were also awarded topped-up future benefits, commencing on the latter date.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Norris, rather than Manhart, establishes the appropriate date for commencing liability for employer-operated pension plans that offered discriminatory payment options, and liability may not be imposed for pre-Norris conduct.  Pp.  487 U. S. 229-238.
(a) Contrary to the Court of Appeals' holding, Manhart did not place Florida on notice that optional pension plans offering sex-based benefits violated Title VII.  Manhart carefully limited its holding to unequal contributions, as distinct from benefits payments, and recognized an open market exception allowing each employee to purchase with the 
Page 487 U. S. 224
 contributions made on his or her behalf the largest benefit commercially available.  In view of the substantial departure from existing practice that Manhart ordered, pension fund administrators could have reasonably concluded that the decision was confined to sex-based contributions, and did not prohibit plans from offering optional sex-based annuities similar to those offered by insurance companies on the open market, as long as the options included a sex-neutral benefit.  Thus, Florida's continuance of the optional plans until Norris -- which expressly prohibited unequal benefits and excluded from the open market exception plans which offered annuities duplicating those available from private companies -- does not justify imposition of a retroactive award.  Pp.  487 U. S. 230-235.
(b) In the pension context, retroactive awards are not necessary to further Title VII's purposes and to ensure compliance with this Court's decisions, since Florida acted immediately after Norris to correct its discriminatory optional plans, and there is no evidence that employers in general have not complied with the requirements of Manhart and Norris.  P.  487 U. S. 235.
(c) The imposition of retroactive liability on the States, local governments, and other employers that offered sex-based pension plans to their employees would be inequitable, particularly since it would impose financial costs that would threaten the security of both the plans and their beneficiaries.  The appropriateness of retroactive relief must be based upon broad principle, and not solely upon the particular circumstances of a case.  Thus, the fact that the Florida System currently possesses a surplus, and can afford the awards against it, cannot control here, since basing an award on a particular pension fund's current financial status would amount to imposing a penalty for prudent management.  Similarly, the fact that Florida's pension administrators might have speculated in internal memoranda and discussions that Manhart prohibited the continuation of sex-based benefits cannot authorize retroactive awards, since the meaning and scope of a decision does not rest on its subjective interpretation by discrete, affected persons and their legal advisers.  Pp.  487 U. S. 235-238.
2. Both awards made by the District Court are impermissible.  The first award, which requires prejudgment benefits adjustments, is retroactive without doubt, and is therefore prohibited by this decision.  The second award, which requires postjudgment adjustments, is also fundamentally retroactive, even though it relates to future payments, since it increases benefits that were meant to be fixed on the basis of contribution levels and actuarial assumptions applicable when the retirement occurred and funding provisions were made, thereby undermining the plan's basic financial calculus and affecting its ability to meet its accrued obligations.  It is not correct to consider benefits payments based on a 
Page 487 U. S. 225
 retirement that has already occurred as a sort of continuing violation, since this would ignore the essential assumptions of an actuarially funded pension plan, and would in every case render employers liable for all past conduct regardless of whether the liability principle was first announced by Manhart, Norris, or this decision.  Pp.  487 U. S. 238-240.

The court entered summary judgment for respondents, awarding relief to class members who retired after Manhart's, and before Norris', effective date, by retroactively ""topping up"" monthly benefits to the current unisex levels for the period between Manhart and the date of the court's judgment.  Class members were also awarded topped-up future benefits, commencing on the latter date.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Norris, rather than Manhart, establishes the appropriate date for commencing liability for employer-operated pension plans that offered discriminatory payment options, and liability may not be imposed for pre-Norris conduct.  Pp.  487 U. S. 229-238.
(a) Contrary to the Court of Appeals' holding, Manhart did not place Florida on notice that optional pension plans offering sex-based benefits violated Title VII.  Manhart carefully limited its holding to unequal contributions, as distinct from benefits payments, and recognized an open market exception allowing each employee to purchase with the 
Page 487 U. S. 224
 contributions made on his or her behalf the largest benefit commercially available.  In view of the substantial departure from existing practice that Manhart ordered, pension fund administrators could have reasonably concluded that the decision was confined to sex-based contributions, and did not prohibit plans from offering optional sex-based annuities similar to those offered by insurance companies on the open market, as long as the options included a sex-neutral benefit.  Thus, Florida's continuance of the optional plans until Norris -- which expressly prohibited unequal benefits and excluded from the open market exception plans which offered annuities duplicating those available from private companies -- does not justify imposition of a retroactive award.  Pp.  487 U. S. 230-235.
(b) In the pension context, retroactive awards are not necessary to further Title VII's purposes and to ensure compliance with this Court's decisions, since Florida acted immediately after Norris to correct its discriminatory optional plans, and there is no evidence that employers in general have not complied with the requirements of Manhart and Norris.  P.  487 U. S. 235.
(c) The imposition of retroactive liability on the States, local governments, and other employers that offered sex-based pension plans to their employees would be inequitable, particularly since it would impose financial costs that would threaten the security of both the plans and their beneficiaries.  The appropriateness of retroactive relief must be based upon broad principle, and not solely upon the particular circumstances of a case.  Thus, the fact that the Florida System currently possesses a surplus, and can afford the awards against it, cannot control here, since basing an award on a particular pension fund's current financial status would amount to imposing a penalty for prudent management.  Similarly, the fact that Florida's pension administrators might have speculated in internal memoranda and discussions that Manhart prohibited the continuation of sex-based benefits cannot authorize retroactive awards, since the meaning and scope of a decision does not rest on its subjective interpretation by discrete, affected persons and their legal advisers.  Pp.  487 U. S. 235-238.
2. Both awards made by the District Court are impermissible.  The first award, which requires prejudgment benefits adjustments, is retroactive without doubt, and is therefore prohibited by this decision.  The second award, which requires postjudgment adjustments, is also fundamentally retroactive, even though it relates to future payments, since it increases benefits that were meant to be fixed on the basis of contribution levels and actuarial assumptions applicable when the retirement occurred and funding provisions were made, thereby undermining the plan's basic financial calculus and affecting its ability to meet its accrued obligations.  It is not correct to consider benefits payments based on a 
Page 487 U. S. 225
 retirement that has already occurred as a sort of continuing violation, since this would ignore the essential assumptions of an actuarially funded pension plan, and would in every case render employers liable for all past conduct regardless of whether the liability principle was first announced by Manhart, Norris, or this decision.  Pp.  487 U. S. 238-240.

Syllabus 
The District Court dismissed an indictment against petitioners and others on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct and irregularities in the grand jury proceedings, finding that dismissal was proper due to violations of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6 and under the ""totality of the circumstances,"" including ""numerous"" violations of Rules 6(d) and (e); violations of 18 U.S.C.  6002 and 6003 and of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Federal Constitution; and the prosecution's knowing presentation of misinformation to the grand jury and mistreatment of witnesses.  In an apparent alternative holding, the District Court also ruled that dismissal, pursuant to its supervisory authority, was necessary in order to deter future conduct of this sort.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that petitioners were not prejudiced by the Government's conduct, and that, absent prejudice, the District Court lacked the authority to invoke its supervisory power to dismiss the indictment.
Held:
1. As a general matter, a district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless such errors prejudiced the defendants.  Pp.  487 U. S. 254-257.
(a) A federal court may not invoke its supervisory power to circumvent the harmless error inquiry prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).  Since Rule 52 was promulgated pursuant to a statute which invested the Court with authority to prescribe rules of pleading, practice, and procedure, and because that statute provided that ""all laws in conflict [with such a rule] shall be of no further force and effect,"" 18 U.S.C.  687 (1946 ed.), Rule 52 is, in every pertinent respect, as binding as any federal statute.  Courts have no more discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate through the exercise of supervisory power than they do to disregard constitutional or statutory provisions through the exercise of such power.  The conclusion that a showing of prejudice is required is supported by United States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, which also involved prosecutorial misconduct before a grand jury, and by United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, which, unlike the present cases, 
Page 487 U. S. 251
 involved constitutional error.  A rule permitting federal courts to deal more sternly with nonconstitutional harmless errors than with constitutional errors that are likewise harmless would be inappropriate.  Pp.  487 U. S. 254-256.
(b) At least in cases involving nonconstitutional error, the standard of prejudice that courts should apply in assessing whether to dismiss an indictment prior to the trial's conclusion is that articulated in United States v. Mechanik, supra, at  475 U. S. 78 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment), whereby dismissal is appropriate only ""if it is established that the violations substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict,"" or if there is ""grave doubt"" that that decision was free from such substantial influence.  The present cases must be distinguished from that class of cases in which indictments are dismissed because the structural protections of the grand jury have been so compromised as to render the proceedings fundamentally unfair, allowing the presumption of prejudice without any particular assessment of prejudicial impact.  See, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254 (racial discrimination in selection of grand jury), and Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187 (exclusion of women from grand jury).  Pp.  487 U. S. 256-257.
2. The record does not support the conclusion that petitioners were prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct before the grand jury.  No constitutional error occurred during the grand jury proceedings, and the instances of alleged nonconstitutional prosecutorial misconduct were insufficient to raise a substantial question, much less a grave doubt, as to whether they had a substantial effect on the jury's decision to indict.  Pp.  487 U. S. 257-263.

No. 86-1836
Argued February 23, 1988
Decided June 20, 1988
487 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
New York City's Human Rights Law forbids discrimination based on race, creed, sex, and other grounds by any ""place of public accommodation, resort or amusement,"" but specifically exempts ""any institution, club or place of accommodation which is in its nature distinctly private.""  However, a 1984 amendment (Local Law 63) provides that any ""institution, club or place of accommodation,"" other than a benevolent order or a religious corporation, ""shall not be considered in its nature distinctly private"" if it
""has more than four hundred members, provides regular meal service and regularly receives payment . . . directly or indirectly from or on behalf of nonmembers for the furtherance of trade or business.""
Immediately after Local Law 63 became effective, appellant association filed a state court suit against the city and some of its officials, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Law is unconstitutional on its face under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The trial court entered a judgment upholding the Law, and the intermediate state appellate court and the Court of Appeals of New York affirmed.
Held:
1. Appellant, a nonprofit association consisting of a consortium of 125 other private New York clubs and associations, has standing to challenge Local Law 63's constitutionality in this Court on behalf of its members, since those members ""would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,"" under Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333,  432 U. S. 343.  Appellees' contention that appellant's member associations 
Page 487 U. S. 2
 must have standing to sue only on behalf of themselves, and not on behalf of their own members, misreads Hunt, which simply requires that members have standing to bring the same suit.  Here, appellant's member associations would have standing to bring this same challenge to Local Law 63 on behalf of their own individual members, since those individuals ""are suffering immediate or threatened injury"" to their associational rights as a result of the Law's enactment.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490,  422 U. S. 511.  Pp.  481 U. S. 8-10.
2. Appellant's facial First Amendment attack cannot prevail.  That attack must fail insofar as it is based on the claim that Local Law 63 is invalid in all of its applications.  As appellant concedes, the Human Rights Law's antidiscrimination provisions may be constitutionally applied to at least some of the large covered clubs under Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, and Board of Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club, 481 U. S. 537.  In finding that clubs comparable in size to, or smaller than, clubs covered by the Human Rights Law were not protected private associations, Roberts and Rotary emphasized the regular participation of strangers at club meetings, a factor that is no more significant to defining a club's nonprivate nature than are Local Law 63's requirements that covered clubs provide ""regular meal service"" and receive regular nonmember payments ""for the furtherance of trade or business.""  Similarly, Local Law 63 cannot be said to infringe upon every club member's right of expressive association, since, in the absence of specific evidence on the characteristics of any covered club, it must be assumed that many of the large clubs would be able to effectively advance their desired viewpoints without confining their membership to persons having, for example, the same sex or religion.  Nor has appellant proved its claim that the Law is overbroad in that it applies to ""distinctively private"" clubs, since there is no evidence of any club, let alone a substantial number of clubs, for whom the Law impairs the ability to associate or to advocate public or private viewpoints.  Thus, it must be assumed that the administrative and judicial opportunities available for individual associations to contest the Law's constitutionality as it may be applied against them are adequate to assure that any overbreadth will be curable through case-by-case analysis of specific facts.  Pp.  481 U. S. 10-15.
3. Appellant's facial equal protection attack on Local Law 63's exemption deeming benevolent orders and religious corporations to be ""distinctly private"" must also fail.  The City Council could have reasonably believed that the exempted organizations are different in kind from appellant's members, in the crucial respect of whether business activity (and therefore business opportunities for minorities and women) is prevalent among them.  Cf. Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U. S. 63.  More 
Page 487 U. S. 3
 over, New York law indicates that benevolent orders and religious corporations are unique, and thus that a rational basis exists for their exemption here.  Appellant has failed to carry its considerable burden of showing that this view is erroneous and that the issue is not truly debatable, since there is no evidence that a detailed examination of the practices, purposes, and structures of the exempted organizations would show them to be identical to the private clubs covered by the Law in the critical respect of whether business activity is prevalent among them.  Pp.  481 U. S. 15-18.

No. 86-1908
Argued February 29, 1988

487 U.S. 22

Syllabus 
Petitioner company, an Alabama corporation, entered into a dealership agreement to market copier products of respondent, a nationwide manufacturer with its principal place of business in New Jersey.  The agreement contained a clause providing that any dispute arising out of the contract could be brought only in a court located in Manhattan, in New York City.  Petitioner company (and the individual stockholder petitioners) filed a diversity action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, alleging, inter alia, that respondent had breached the agreement.  Relying on the contractual forum-selection clause, respondent filed a motion seeking, inter alia, the transfer of the case to the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), which provides:
""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.""
The court denied the motion, holding that Alabama law controlled and that Alabama looks unfavorably upon contractual forum-selection clauses.  On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to transfer the case, holding that venue is a matter of federal procedure and that, under the standards articulated in the admiralty case of The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, the forum-selection clause was in all respects enforceable generally as a matter of federal law.
Held:
1. When a federal law sought to be applied in a diversity action is a congressional statute, the chief question for the district court's determination is whether the statute is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court.  If so, the court then must inquire whether the statute represents a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Constitution.  If Congress intended to reach the issue before the court, and if it enacted its intention into law in a manner that abides with the Constitution, that is the end of the matter; federal courts are bound to apply laws enacted by Congress with respect to matters over which it has legislative power.  Pp.  487 U. S. 25-27. 
Page 487 U. S. 23

2. In this case, federal law, specifically  1404(a), governs the decision whether to give effect to the parties' forum-selection clause and to transfer the case to a court in Manhattan.  Pp.  487 U. S. 28-32.
(a) Although the Court of Appeals properly noted that the Bremen case -- which held that federal courts sitting in admiralty generally should enforce forum-selection clauses absent a showing that to do so would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching -- may prove ""instructive"" in resolving the parties' dispute, the court erred in its articulation of the relevant inquiry as being whether the forum-selection clause in this case was unenforceable under the Bremen standards.  The first question for consideration should have been whether  1404(a) itself controls respondent's request to give effect to the contractual choice of venue and to transfer the case to a Manhattan court.  Pp.  487 U. S. 28-29.
(b) Section 1404(a) is sufficiently broad to control the forum-selection issue.  The statute is intended to place discretion in the district courts to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.  A motion to transfer under  1404(a) calls on the district court to weigh in the balance a number of case-specific factors, and the presence of a forum-selection clause will figure centrally in the calculus.  A forum-selection clause should receive neither dispositive consideration nor no consideration, but rather the consideration for which Congress provided in  1404(a).  Section 1404(a) must be applied, since it represents a valid exercise of Congress' authority under Article III as augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  In this case, the District Court should determine in the first instance the appropriate effect under federal law of the parties' forum-selection clause on respondent's  1404(a) motion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 29-32.

The court denied the motion, holding that Alabama law controlled and that Alabama looks unfavorably upon contractual forum-selection clauses.  On interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to transfer the case, holding that venue is a matter of federal procedure and that, under the standards articulated in the admiralty case of The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, the forum-selection clause was in all respects enforceable generally as a matter of federal law.
Held:
1. When a federal law sought to be applied in a diversity action is a congressional statute, the chief question for the district court's determination is whether the statute is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court.  If so, the court then must inquire whether the statute represents a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Constitution.  If Congress intended to reach the issue before the court, and if it enacted its intention into law in a manner that abides with the Constitution, that is the end of the matter; federal courts are bound to apply laws enacted by Congress with respect to matters over which it has legislative power.  Pp.  487 U. S. 25-27. 
Page 487 U. S. 23

2. In this case, federal law, specifically  1404(a), governs the decision whether to give effect to the parties' forum-selection clause and to transfer the case to a court in Manhattan.  Pp.  487 U. S. 28-32.
(a) Although the Court of Appeals properly noted that the Bremen case -- which held that federal courts sitting in admiralty generally should enforce forum-selection clauses absent a showing that to do so would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching -- may prove ""instructive"" in resolving the parties' dispute, the court erred in its articulation of the relevant inquiry as being whether the forum-selection clause in this case was unenforceable under the Bremen standards.  The first question for consideration should have been whether  1404(a) itself controls respondent's request to give effect to the contractual choice of venue and to transfer the case to a Manhattan court.  Pp.  487 U. S. 28-29.
(b) Section 1404(a) is sufficiently broad to control the forum-selection issue.  The statute is intended to place discretion in the district courts to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.  A motion to transfer under  1404(a) calls on the district court to weigh in the balance a number of case-specific factors, and the presence of a forum-selection clause will figure centrally in the calculus.  A forum-selection clause should receive neither dispositive consideration nor no consideration, but rather the consideration for which Congress provided in  1404(a).  Section 1404(a) must be applied, since it represents a valid exercise of Congress' authority under Article III as augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause.  In this case, the District Court should determine in the first instance the appropriate effect under federal law of the parties' forum-selection clause on respondent's  1404(a) motion.  Pp.  487 U. S. 29-32.

Respondent, a private physician under contract with North Carolina to provide orthopedic services at a state prison hospital on a part-time basis, treated petitioner for a leg injury sustained while petitioner was incarcerated in state prison.  Petitioner was barred by state law from employing or electing to see a physician of his own choosing.  Alleging that he was given inadequate medical treatment, petitioner sued respondent in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for violation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, relying on Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97.  The court entered summary judgment for respondent, holding that, as a ""contract physician,"" respondent was not acting ""under color of state law,"" a jurisdictional prerequisite for a  1983 action.  The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed.
Held:  A physician who is under contract with the State to provide medical services to inmates at a state prison hospital on a part-time basis acts ""under color of state law,"" within the meaning of  1983, when he treats an inmate.  Pp.  487 U. S. 48-57.
(a) If a defendant's alleged infringement of the plaintiff's constitutional rights satisfies the state action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, the defendant's conduct also constitutes action ""under color of state law"" for  1983's purposes, since it is ""fairly attributable to the State.""

Syllabus 
Under Virginia Supreme Court Rule 1A:1, qualified lawyers admitted to practice in another State may be admitted to the Virginia Bar ""on motion,"" that is, without taking Virginia's bar examination.  The Rule requires, inter alia, that the applicant be a permanent resident of Virginia.  Appellee attorney, a Maryland resident who practices and maintains her offices at her corporate employer's place of business in Virginia, applied for admission to the Virginia Bar on motion.  The Virginia Supreme Court denied the application for failure to satisfy the residency requirement, concluding that, contrary to appellee's contention, the decision in Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper, 470 U. S. 274, which held that a residency requirement imposed on lawyers who had passed the State's bar examination violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV,  2, of the Federal Constitution, was not applicable in the context of ""discretionary"" admissions on motion.  Appellee then filed suit against the Virginia Supreme Court and its Clerk in Federal District Court, alleging that Rule 1A:1's residency requirement violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  The court entered summary judgment for appellee, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Virginia's residency requirement for admission to the State's bar without examination violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Pp.  487 U. S. 64-70.
(a) A nonresident's interest in practicing law on terms of substantial equality with those enjoyed by residents is a privilege protected by the Clause.  This Court's precedents do not support appellants' contention that, so long as an applicant has the alternative of gaining admission to a State's bar, without regard to residence, by passing the bar examination, the State has not discriminated against nonresidents ""on a matter of fundamental concern.""  The Clause is implicated whenever a State does not permit qualified nonresidents to practice law within its borders on terms of substantial equality with its own residents.  Cf. Piper, supra.  Appellants' theory that the State could constitutionally require that all bar applicants pass an examination is irrelevant to the question whether the Clause is applicable in the circumstances of this case.  The State has burdened the right to practice law, a privilege protected by the 
Page 487 U. S. 60
 Clause, by discriminating among otherwise equally qualified applicants solely on the basis of citizenship or residency.  Pp.  487 U. S. 65-67.
(b) The State has failed to show that its discrimination against nonresidents bears a close relation to the achievement of substantial state objectives.  Rule 1A:1's residency requirement cannot be justified as assuring, in tandem with the Rule's requirement that the applicant practice full time as a member of the Virginia Bar, that attorneys admitted on motion will have the same commitment to service and familiarity with Virginia law that is possessed by applicants securing admission upon examination.  Lawyers who are admitted in other States and seek admission in Virginia are not less likely to respect the bar and further its interests solely because they are nonresidents.  To the extent that the State is justifiably concerned with ensuring that its attorneys keep abreast of legal developments, it can protect such interest through other equally or more effective means that do not themselves infringe constitutional protections.  Nor can the residency requirement be justified as a necessary aid to the enforcement of Rule 1A:1's full-time practice requirement.  Virginia already requires that attorneys admitted on motion maintain an office in Virginia.  This requirement facilitates compliance with the full-time practice requirement in nearly the identical manner that the residency restriction does, rendering the latter restriction largely redundant.

Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., and others (ARM) filed suit against Government officials and petitioners, the United States Catholic Conference and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, to revoke the Roman Catholic Church's tax-exempt status on the ground that the Church had violated the anti-electioneering provision of 26 U.S.C.  501(c)(3).  After petitioners were dismissed as parties, they refused to comply with ARM's subpoenas seeking extensive documentary evidence, and were held in contempt.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt citations, ruling that a nonparty witness' jurisdictional challenge is limited to a claim that the district court lacks even colorable jurisdiction, a standard not met here.
Held:  A nonparty witness may defend against a civil contempt adjudication by challenging the district court's subject matter jurisdiction, and is not limited to the contention that the court lacked even colorable jurisdiction to hear the suit.  Since a court's subpoena power cannot be more extensive than its jurisdiction, the subpoenas it issues in aid of determining the merits are void if the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying suit.  Moreover, a nonparty witness has an unquestionable right to appeal a contempt adjudication, notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment in the underlying action.  The contention that permitting a nonparty to challenge the court's jurisdiction would invite collusion, allowing parties to avoid restrictions on interlocutory appeals and to test jurisdiction by proxy, is not persuasive.  Ample protections against collusive appeals exist in the courts of appeals' power to decline to treat the witness as a nonparty for purposes of the jurisdictional question, and in the usual provisions for sanctioning frivolous appeals or abuse of court processes.  The rule followed in this case does not apply in criminal contempt proceedings, and does not affect a district court's inherent and legitimate authority to issue binding orders, including discovery orders, to nonparty witnesses, as necessary for the court to determine and rule upon its own jurisdiction, including subject matter jurisdiction.  Here, however, the District Court's order was not issued to aid a jurisdictional inquiry, since the subpoenas were meant to obtain discovery on the merits, and before the contempt order the District

No. 86-1042
Argued November 4, 1987
Decided June 17, 1988
486 U.S. 750

Syllabus 
In federal court proceedings, appellee newspaper publisher challenged, on First Amendment grounds, the facial constitutionality of appellant city's ordinance authorizing the Mayor to grant or deny applications for annual permits to publishers to place their newsracks on public property, and, if the application is denied, requiring the Mayor to ""stat[e] the reasons for such denial.""  If the application is granted, the ordinance provides that the permit is subject, inter alia, to any ""terms and conditions deemed necessary and reasonable by the Mayor.""  The District Court found the ordinance constitutional in its entirety, and entered judgment for the city.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional on the ground, among others, that it gave the Mayor unbounded discretion to grant or deny a permit application and to place unlimited terms and conditions on any permit that issued.
Held:
1. Appellee may bring a facial challenge to the ordinance without first applying for, and being denied, a permit.  Pp.  486 U. S. 755-769.
(a) When a licensing statute vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity, one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without first submitting to the licensing process.  Such a statute constitutes a prior restraint, and may result in censorship, engendering risks to free expression that can be effectively alleviated only through a facial challenge.  The mere existence of the licensor's unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring their own speech, even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.  Standards limiting the licensor's discretion provide guideposts that check the licensor and allow courts quickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is discriminating against disfavored speech.  Without those standards, the difficulties of proof and the case-by-case nature of ""as applied"" challenges render the licensor's action in large measure effectively unreviewable.  Pp.  486 U. S. 755-759.
(b) The press or a speaker may not challenge as censorship every law involving discretion to which it is subject; the law must have a close enough nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression, 
Page 486 U. S. 751
 to pose a real and substantial threat of censorship risks.  The allowance of a facial challenge here is justified by the features that (1) the ordinance requires annual permit applications, thus permitting the licensor to measure the probable content or viewpoint of future expression by speech already uttered, and (2) the ordinance is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression -- the circulation of newspapers -- and creates a licensing agency that might tend to favor censorship over speech.  The Constitution requires that the city establish neutral criteria to insure that the Mayor's licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.  Pp.  486 U. S. 759-762.
(c) There is no merit to the theory that the ordinance is not subject to facial challenge because the particular manner of speech (the use of newsracks) may be prohibited entirely, and thus no ""First Amendment protected activity"" is implicated by the ordinance's imposing less than a total prohibition, even assuming that newsracks may be prohibited entirely.  Presumably in the case of a hypothetical ordinance that completely prohibits a particular manner of expression, the law on its face is both content and viewpoint neutral, and the Court would apply the well settled time, place, and manner test.  In contrast, a law permitting communication in a certain manner for some, but not for others, raises the danger of content and viewpoint censorship, which is at its zenith when the determination of who may speak and who may not is left to an official's unbridled discretion.  Even if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular manner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining a license from an official in that official's boundless discretion.  Use of the ""greater-includes-the-lesser"" reasoning in the latter context is not supported by this Court's First Amendment cases.  Pp.  486 U. S. 762-769.
2. The portions of appellant city's ordinance giving the Mayor discretion to deny a permit application and authority to condition a permit on any terms he deems ""necessary and reasonable"" are unconstitutional.  It cannot be presumed that the Mayor will adhere to standards absent from the ordinance's face, and so will deny a permit application only for reasons related to the health, safety, or welfare of city citizens, and that additional terms and conditions will be imposed only for similar reasons.  The doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion requires that the limits the city claims are implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative construction, or well established practice.  The ordinance's minimal requirement that the Mayor state his reasons for denying a permit does not provide the standards necessary to ensure constitutional decisionmaking, nor does it, of necessity, provide a solid foundation for eventual judicial review.  Even if judicial review 
Page 486 U. S. 752
 under the ordinance's provision were relatively speedy, such review does not substitute for concrete standards to guide the decisionmaker's discretion.  Pp.  486 U. S. 769-772.
3.

			"|"City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ. Co.
No. 86-1042
Argued November 4, 1987
Decided June 17, 1988
486 U.S. 750

Syllabus 
In federal court proceedings, appellee newspaper publisher challenged, on First Amendment grounds, the facial constitutionality of appellant city's ordinance authorizing the Mayor to grant or deny applications for annual permits to publishers to place their newsracks on public property, and, if the application is denied, requiring the Mayor to ""stat[e] the reasons for such denial.""  If the application is granted, the ordinance provides that the permit is subject, inter alia, to any ""terms and conditions deemed necessary and reasonable by the Mayor.""  The District Court found the ordinance constitutional in its entirety, and entered judgment for the city.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the ordinance unconstitutional on the ground, among others, that it gave the Mayor unbounded discretion to grant or deny a permit application and to place unlimited terms and conditions on any permit that issued.
Held:
1. Appellee may bring a facial challenge to the ordinance without first applying for, and being denied, a permit.  Pp.  486 U. S. 755-769.
(a) When a licensing statute vests unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity, one who is subject to the law may challenge it facially without first submitting to the licensing process.  Such a statute constitutes a prior restraint, and may result in censorship, engendering risks to free expression that can be effectively alleviated only through a facial challenge.  The mere existence of the licensor's unfettered discretion, coupled with the power of prior restraint, intimidates parties into censoring their own speech, even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.  Standards limiting the licensor's discretion provide guideposts that check the licensor and allow courts quickly and easily to determine whether the licensor is discriminating against disfavored speech.  Without those standards, the difficulties of proof and the case-by-case nature of ""as applied"" challenges render the licensor's action in large measure effectively unreviewable.  Pp.  486 U. S. 755-759.
(b) The press or a speaker may not challenge as censorship every law involving discretion to which it is subject; the law must have a close enough nexus to expression, or to conduct commonly associated with expression, 
Page 486 U. S. 751
 to pose a real and substantial threat of censorship risks.  The allowance of a facial challenge here is justified by the features that (1) the ordinance requires annual permit applications, thus permitting the licensor to measure the probable content or viewpoint of future expression by speech already uttered, and (2) the ordinance is directed narrowly and specifically at expression or conduct commonly associated with expression -- the circulation of newspapers -- and creates a licensing agency that might tend to favor censorship over speech.  The Constitution requires that the city establish neutral criteria to insure that the Mayor's licensing decision is not based on the content or viewpoint of the speech being considered.  Pp.  486 U. S. 759-762.
(c) There is no merit to the theory that the ordinance is not subject to facial challenge because the particular manner of speech (the use of newsracks) may be prohibited entirely, and thus no ""First Amendment protected activity"" is implicated by the ordinance's imposing less than a total prohibition, even assuming that newsracks may be prohibited entirely.  Presumably in the case of a hypothetical ordinance that completely prohibits a particular manner of expression, the law on its face is both content and viewpoint neutral, and the Court would apply the well settled time, place, and manner test.  In contrast, a law permitting communication in a certain manner for some, but not for others, raises the danger of content and viewpoint censorship, which is at its zenith when the determination of who may speak and who may not is left to an official's unbridled discretion.  Even if the government may constitutionally impose content-neutral prohibitions on a particular manner of speech, it may not condition that speech on obtaining a license from an official in that official's boundless discretion.  Use of the ""greater-includes-the-lesser"" reasoning in the latter context is not supported by this Court's First Amendment cases.  Pp.  486 U. S. 762-769.
2. The portions of appellant city's ordinance giving the Mayor discretion to deny a permit application and authority to condition a permit on any terms he deems ""necessary and reasonable"" are unconstitutional.  It cannot be presumed that the Mayor will adhere to standards absent from the ordinance's face, and so will deny a permit application only for reasons related to the health, safety, or welfare of city citizens, and that additional terms and conditions will be imposed only for similar reasons.  The doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion requires that the limits the city claims are implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative construction, or well established practice.  The ordinance's minimal requirement that the Mayor state his reasons for denying a permit does not provide the standards necessary to ensure constitutional decisionmaking, nor does it, of necessity, provide a solid foundation for eventual judicial review.  Even if judicial review 
Page 486 U. S. 752
 under the ordinance's provision were relatively speedy, such review does not substitute for concrete standards to guide the decisionmaker's discretion.  Pp.  486 U. S. 769-772.
3. Other questions as to the ordinance's constitutionality presented for review need not be resolved, since the holding regarding the ordinance's mayoral discretion provisions alone sustains the Court of Appeals' judgment if those provisions of the ordinance are not severable from the remainder.  Severability of a local ordinance is a question of state law, and is therefore best resolved below.  P.  486 U. S. 772.

No. 87-499
Argued April 18, 1988

486 U.S. 800

Syllabus 
The principal statutes involved in this case, which arises from a jurisdictional dispute between Courts of Appeals, are 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(1) -- granting the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision of a federal district court ""if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on"" 28 U.S.C.  1338 -- and  1338(a), which grants the district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action ""arising under"" any federal statute relating to patents.  Respondent (Colt), which is the leading manufacturer, seller, and marketer of ""M16"" rifles and their parts and accessories, held and developed patents relating to the rifle, and has maintained the secrecy as to specifications essential to the mass production of interchangeable M16 parts.  Petitioner Christianson, a former Colt employee, established a corporation (also a petitioner), and began selling M16 parts.  Colt joined petitioners with other defendants in a patent infringement lawsuit, but ultimately voluntarily dismissed its claims against petitioners.  In the meantime, Colt notified several of petitioners' current and potential customers that petitioners were illegally misappropriating Colt's trade secrets, and urged them to refrain from doing business with petitioners.  Petitioners then brought this antitrust action against Colt in Federal District Court for violations of  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  The complaint alleged, inter alia, that Colt's letters, litigation tactics, and other conduct drove petitioners out of business.  Petitioners later amended the complaint to assert a second cause of action under state law for tortious interference with their business relationships.  Colt asserted a defense that its conduct was justified by a need to protect its trade secrets, and countersued on a variety of claims arising out of petitioners' alleged misappropriation of M16 patent specifications.  Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment raising a patent law issue -- related to the validity of Colt's patents -- to which the complaint only obliquely hinted.  The District Court awarded petitioners summary judgment as to liability on both the antitrust and the tortious interference claims.  On Colt's appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction, and transferred the appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.  The Seventh Circuit, however, raising the jurisdictional issue sua sponte, 
Page 486 U. S. 801
 concluded that the Federal Circuit was ""clearly wrong,"" and transferred the case back.  The Federal Circuit, although concluding that the Seventh Circuit's jurisdictional decision was ""clearly wrong,"" addressed the merits in the ""interest of justice,"" and reversed the District Court.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would not have jurisdiction of the appeal of a final judgment in this case under 28 U.S.C.  1295(a)(1), since the action is not one ""arising under"" the patent statutes for purposes of  1338(a).  Pp.  486 U. S. 807-813.
(a) In order to demonstrate that a case is one ""arising under"" federal patent law, the plaintiff must set up some right, title, or interest under the patent laws, or at least make it appear that some right or privilege will be defeated by one construction, or sustained by the opposite construction, of those laws.  Section 1338 jurisdiction extends only to those cases in which a well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law, in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the well-pleaded claims.  A case raising a federal patent law defense does not, for that reason alone, ""arise under"" patent law, even if the defense is anticipated in the complaint, and even if both parties admit that the defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.  Nor is it necessarily sufficient that a well-pleaded claim alleges a single theory under which resolution of a patent law question is essential.  If, on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, there are reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of the patent laws why the plaintiff may or may not be entitled to the relief it seeks, then the claim does not ""arise under"" those laws.
(b) Petitioners' antitrust count can readily be understood to encompass both a monopolization claim under  2 of the Sherman Act and a group boycott claim under  1.  The patent law issue, while arguably necessary to at least one theory under each claim, is not necessary to the overall success of either claim.  Even assuming, without deciding, that the validity of Colt's patents is an essential element of petitioners' monopolization theory, rather than merely an argument in anticipation of a defense, the well-pleaded complaint rule focuses on claims, not theories, and just because an element that is essential to a particular theory might be governed by federal patent law does not mean that the entire monopolization claim ""arises under"" patent law.  Examination of the complaint reveals that the monopolization theory (on which petitioners ultimately prevailed in the District Court) is only one of several involved, and the only one for which the patent law issue is even arguably essential.  Since there are reasons completely unrelated to the provisions 
Page 486 U. S. 802
 and purposes of federal patent law why petitioners may or may not be entitled to the relief sought under their monopolization claim, the claim does not ""arise under"" federal patent law.  The same analysis obtains as to petitioners' group boycott claim under  1 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.  486 U. S. 810-813.
2. Nor does reference to congressional policy compel a finding of Federal Circuit jurisdiction.  One of Congress' objectives in creating the Federal Circuit was to reduce the lack of uniformity and uncertainty of legal doctrine in the administration of patent law.  Although arguably Congress' goals might be better served if the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction were to be fixed by reference to the case actually litigated, nevertheless, Congress determined the relevant focus when it granted Federal Circuit jurisdiction on the basis of the district courts' jurisdiction.  Since the latter courts' jurisdiction is determined by reference to the well-pleaded complaint, not the well-tried case, the referent for the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction must be the same.  The legislative history of the Federal Circuit's jurisdictional provisions confirms that focus.  Pp.  486 U. S. 813-814.
3. Federal Circuit jurisdiction here cannot be based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) by deeming the complaint amended to encompass a new and independent cause of action -- an implied cause of action under the patent laws.  Even assuming that a court of appeals could furnish itself a jurisdictional basis under such theory, there is simply no evidence of any ""express or implied consent"" among the parties, as required by the Rule, to litigate a new patent law claim.  Although the summary judgment papers focused almost entirely on patent law issues that petitioners deemed fundamental to the lawsuit, those issues fell squarely within the purview of the theories of recovery, defenses, and counterclaims that the pleadings already encompassed.  Pp.  486 U. S. 814-815.
4. There is no merit to the contention that the Federal Circuit was obliged to adopt the Seventh Circuit's analysis of the jurisdictional issue as the law of the case.  The law-of-the-case doctrine applies as much to the decisions of a coordinate court in the same case as to a court's own decisions, and the policies supporting the doctrine apply with even greater force to transfer decisions than to decisions of substantive law.  However, the Federal Circuit, in transferring the case to the Seventh Circuit, was the first to decide the jurisdictional issue.  That the Federal Circuit did not explain its rationale is irrelevant.  Thus, the law of the case was that the Seventh Circuit had jurisdiction, and it was the Seventh Circuit that departed from the law of the case.  Moreover, the doctrine merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, not a limit on their power.  Thus, even if the Seventh Circuit's decision was law of the case, the Federal Circuit 
Page 486 U. S. 803
 did not exceed its power in revisiting the jurisdictional issue, and, once it concluded that the prior decision was ""clearly wrong,"" it was obliged to decline jurisdiction.  Most importantly, law of the case cannot bind this Court in reviewing decisions below.  Pp.  486 U. S. 815-818.
5. The Federal Circuit, after concluding that it lacked jurisdiction, erred in deciding to reach the merits anyway ""in the interest of justice.""  Courts created by statute only have such jurisdiction as the statute confers.  Upon concluding that it lacked jurisdiction, the Federal Circuit had authority, under 28 U.S.C.  1631, to make a single decision -- whether to dismiss the case or, ""in the interest of justice,"" to transfer it to a court of appeals that has jurisdiction.  The rule that a court may not in any case, even in the interest of justice, extend its jurisdiction where none exists has always worked injustice in particular cases -- especially in the situation where, as here, the litigants are bandied back and forth between two courts, each of which insists that the other has jurisdiction.  Such situations inhere in the very nature of jurisdictional lines, for few jurisdictional lines can be so finely drawn as to leave no room for disagreement on close cases.  However, the courts of appeals should achieve the end of quick settlement of questions of transfer by adhering strictly to principles of law of the case.  Under those principles, if the transferee court can find the transfer decision plausible, its jurisdictional inquiry is at an end.  Pp.  486 U. S. 818-819.

486 U.S. 825

Syllabus 
After respondent collection agency obtained money judgments against participants in an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), its request to garnish the debtors' plan benefits was granted by a Georgia trial court.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Ga.Code Ann.  18-4-22.1 (1982), barring the garnishment of ""[f]unds or benefits of [an] . . . employee benefit plan or program subject to . . . [ERISA],"" exempted plan benefits from garnishment.  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, concluding that  18-4-22.1 was preempted by ERISA, and that the plan was therefore subject to garnishment under the general state garnishment law.
Held:
1. Section 18-4-22.1, which singles out ERISA employee welfare benefit plans for different treatment than non-ERISA welfare plans under state garnishment procedures, is preempted under  514(a) of ERISA, which supersedes any state law insofar as it ""relate[s] to"" ERISA-covered plans.  The state statute's express reference to ERISA plans brings it within the federal law's preemptive reach.  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85.  Moreover, the possibility that  18-4-22.1 was enacted to help effectuate ERISA's underlying purposes is not enough to save it from preemption, since  514(a) displaces all state laws that fall within its sphere, including those that are consistent with ERISA's substantive requirements.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724.  Pp.  486 U. S. 829-830.
2. Congress did not intend to preempt state law garnishment of an ERISA welfare benefit plan, even where the purpose is to collect judgments against plan participants.  Pp.  486 U. S. 830-840.
(a) Unlike  18-4-22.1, Georgia's general garnishment statute does not single out or specially mention ERISA plans of any kind.  The argument that, because the general statute requires plan trustees such as petitioners to respond to garnishment orders with funds otherwise due beneficiary-debtors, and to incur substantial administrative burdens and costs, the statute consequently ""relates to"" the plan within the meaning of  514(a) is refuted by certain other ERISA provisions, and by several aspects of that statute's structure.  Although  502(d) provides that a 
Page 486 U. S. 826
 plan may ""sue or be sued"" as an entity for specified relief and clearly contemplates the enforcement of money judgments against a plan, and although lawsuits against ERISA plans for run-of-the-mill state law contract or tort claims are relatively commonplace, ERISA does not provide an enforcement mechanism for collecting judgments won in either type of action.  In lieu of such a provision, state law collection methods, including garnishment, remain undisturbed by ERISA.  See Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 69(a).  Section 514(a)'s language does not support petitioners' attempt to distinguish, as permissible, garnishment to collect plan creditors' judgments from, as impermissible, garnishment on behalf of plan participants' judgment creditors.  The fact that  206(d)(1)'s ban on alienation or assignment is limited to pension benefits also supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to preclude garnishment of welfare plan benefits.  Section 514(a) cannot be read to protect only benefits, but not plans, from garnishment, since  206(d)(1) demonstrates Congress' ability to distinguish between benefits and plans when it wished, and since such a construction would render  206(d)(1) substantially redundant with  514(a), and therefore superfluous.  Pp.  486 U. S. 831-838.
(b) Petitioners' contention that the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 -- which specified that  514(a)'s preemption provision does not apply to ""qualified domestic relations orders"" -- establishes that  514(a), as originally enacted, preempts state attachment and garnishment procedures on the theory that, otherwise, an amendment to save such orders would have been unnecessary, is not persuasive.  An equally plausible explanation for the amendment is that Congress meant to clarify the original meaning of  514(a) by correcting court decisions that had erroneously construed the section as preempting such orders.  Even if petitioners' contention is correct, the opinion of a later Congress as to the meaning of a law enacted 10 years earlier does not control the issue.  Rather, ERISA's language and structure demonstrate the intent of the Congress that originally enacted  514(a) not to preempt state garnishment procedures.  Pp.  486 U. S. 838-840.

No. 86-1387
Argued April 19, 1988
Decided June 17, 1988
486 U.S. 825

Syllabus 
After respondent collection agency obtained money judgments against participants in an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), its request to garnish the debtors' plan benefits was granted by a Georgia trial court.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Ga.Code Ann.  18-4-22.1 (1982), barring the garnishment of ""[f]unds or benefits of [an] . . . employee benefit plan or program subject to . . . [ERISA],"" exempted plan benefits from garnishment.  The Georgia Supreme Court reversed, concluding that  18-4-22.1 was preempted by ERISA, and that the plan was therefore subject to garnishment under the general state garnishment law.
Held:
1. Section 18-4-22.1, which singles out ERISA employee welfare benefit plans for different treatment than non-ERISA welfare plans under state garnishment procedures, is preempted under  514(a) of ERISA, which supersedes any state law insofar as it ""relate[s] to"" ERISA-covered plans.  The state statute's express reference to ERISA plans brings it within the federal law's preemptive reach.  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85.  Moreover, the possibility that  18-4-22.1 was enacted to help effectuate ERISA's underlying purposes is not enough to save it from preemption, since  514(a) displaces all state laws that fall within its sphere, including those that are consistent with ERISA's substantive requirements.  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724.  Pp.  486 U. S. 829-830.
2. Congress did not intend to preempt state law garnishment of an ERISA welfare benefit plan, even where the purpose is to collect judgments against plan participants.  Pp.  486 U. S. 830-840.
(a) Unlike  18-4-22.1, Georgia's general garnishment statute does not single out or specially mention ERISA plans of any kind.  The argument that, because the general statute requires plan trustees such as petitioners to respond to garnishment orders with funds otherwise due beneficiary-debtors, and to incur substantial administrative burdens and costs, the statute consequently ""relates to"" the plan within the meaning of  514(a) is refuted by certain other ERISA provisions, and by several aspects of that statute's structure.  Although  502(d) provides that a 
Page 486 U. S. 826
 plan may ""sue or be sued"" as an entity for specified relief and clearly contemplates the enforcement of money judgments against a plan, and although lawsuits against ERISA plans for run-of-the-mill state law contract or tort claims are relatively commonplace, ERISA does not provide an enforcement mechanism for collecting judgments won in either type of action.  In lieu of such a provision, state law collection methods, including garnishment, remain undisturbed by ERISA.  See Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 69(a).  Section 514(a)'s language does not support petitioners' attempt to distinguish, as permissible, garnishment to collect plan creditors' judgments from, as impermissible, garnishment on behalf of plan participants' judgment creditors.  The fact that  206(d)(1)'s ban on alienation or assignment is limited to pension benefits also supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to preclude garnishment of welfare plan benefits.  Section 514(a) cannot be read to protect only benefits, but not plans, from garnishment, since  206(d)(1) demonstrates Congress' ability to distinguish between benefits and plans when it wished, and since such a construction would render  206(d)(1) substantially redundant with  514(a), and therefore superfluous.  Pp.  486 U. S. 831-838.
(b) Petitioners' contention that the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 -- which specified that  514(a)'s preemption provision does not apply to ""qualified domestic relations orders"" -- establishes that  514(a), as originally enacted, preempts state attachment and garnishment procedures on the theory that, otherwise, an amendment to save such orders would have been unnecessary, is not persuasive.  An equally plausible explanation for the amendment is that Congress meant to clarify the original meaning of  514(a) by correcting court decisions that had erroneously construed the section as preempting such orders.  Even if petitioners' contention is correct, the opinion of a later Congress as to the meaning of a law enacted 10 years earlier does not control the issue.  Rather, ERISA's language and structure demonstrate the intent of the Congress that originally enacted  514(a) not to preempt state garnishment procedures.  Pp.  486 U. S. 838-840.

Syllabus 
In 1977, pursuant to a plan to construct and operate a hospital in Kenner, Louisiana, petitioner formed a corporation (St. Jude) to apply for the necessary state ""certificate of need.""  During the next two years, petitioner negotiated with Loyola University over a proposal to purchase as the hospital site a portion of Loyola's Kenner land for several million dollars, coupled with a plan to rezone Loyola's adjoining land to greatly increase its value.  Federal District Court Judge Robert Collins was a member, and regularly attended the meetings, of Loyola's Board of Trustees, whose minutes indicated regular discussions of the negotiations' progress and reflected the fact that Loyola's interest in the project was dependent on the issuance of the certificate.  Petitioner also conducted negotiations with respondent's corporate predecessor, Hospital Affiliates International (HAI), culminating in HAI's purchase of a Kenner site not owned by Loyola and its filing of the certificate application upon petitioner's execution of an agreement which HAI believed gave it title to St. Jude.  After the certificate was issued in St. Jude's name, and a dispute between petitioner and HAI arose as to St. Jude's ownership, petitioner's proposal to reopen the Loyola negotiations was discussed and formally approved at the Board's meeting on November 12, 1981, which Judge Collins attended.  On November 30, 1981, respondent filed suit in the District Court seeking a declaration of ownership of St. Jude.  Judge Collins, sitting without a jury, tried the case on January 21 and 22, 1982, immediately announcing his intention to rule for petitioner.  On January 28, 1982, at a meeting which Judge Collins did not attend, the Loyola Board discussed the terms of an agreement of sale with petitioner, which provided, inter alia, that it would be void if petitioner failed to satisfy certain conditions, the fulfillment of which depended on his retention of control over the certificate.  Judge Collins did not read the minutes of that meeting until March 24, 1982.  In the meantime, on March 16, he entered judgment for petitioner, crediting petitioner's version of crucial, disputed conversations.  Ten months after the Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment, respondent, having just learned that Judge Collins was associated with Loyola while petitioner 
Page 486 U. S. 848
 and the University were engaged in negotiations concerning the hospital site, moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) to vacate the judgment on the ground that Judge Collins was disqualified under 28 U.S.C.  455(a).  Judge Collins denied the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to a different judge, who also denied the motion on the ground that, although the evidence gave rise to an appearance of impropriety, Judge Collins lacked actual knowledge of Loyola's interest in the litigation during the trial and prior to the filing of the judgment.  The Court of Appeals again reversed, ruling that the appearance of impropriety is a sufficient ground for disqualification under  455(a).  Moreover, the court ruled that vacatur was an appropriate remedy in these circumstances.
Held:
1. A violation of  455(a) -- which requires a judge to disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned -- is established when a reasonable person, knowing the relevant facts, would expect that a judge knew of circumstances creating an appearance of partiality, notwithstanding a finding that the judge was not actually conscious of those circumstances.  To require scienter as an element of a  455(a) violation would contravene that section's language and its purpose of promoting public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system.  This reading of  455(a) does not require judges to perform the impossible by disqualifying themselves based on facts they do not know, since, in proper cases, the provision can be applied retroactively to rectify an oversight once the judge concludes that ""his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.""  Here, where both lower courts found an ample basis in the record for concluding that an objective observer would have questioned Judge Collins' impartiality, his failure to disqualify himself was a plain violation of  455(a) even though it was initially the product of a temporary lapse of memory.  Pp.  486 U. S. 858-862.
2. Vacatur was a proper remedy for the  455(a) violation in the circumstances of this case.  In determining whether a  455(a) violation requires vacatur under Rule 60(b)(6) -- which gives federal courts broad authority to grant relief from a final judgment ""upon such terms as are just,"" provided that the motion is made within a reasonable time -- it is appropriate to consider the risk of injustice to the particular parties, the risk that the denial of relief will produce injustice in other cases, and the risk of undermining the public's confidence in the judicial process.  Here, despite his lack of actual knowledge of Loyola's interest in the dispute during trial, Judge Collins' participation in the case created a strong appearance of impropriety, particularly in light of his regular attendance at Board meetings, including the one on November 12, 1982, and the financial 
Page 486 U. S. 849
 importance of the project to Loyola; his failure to attend the January 28, 1982, meeting or to read the minutes of that meeting before entering judgment; his inexcusable failure to recuse himself or disclose his interest on March 24, 1982, when respondent still had time to file a new trial motion or to use the failure as an issue on direct appeal; and his failure to acknowledge, in denying the motion to vacate, that he had known about Loyola's interest both shortly before and shortly after trial, or to indicate any awareness of a duty to recuse himself in March, 1982.  Moreover, vacatur here will not produce injustice in other such cases, and may, in fact, prompt other judges to more carefully search for and disclose disqualification grounds.  Furthermore, a careful study of the merits of the underlying litigation suggests that there is a greater risk of unfairness in upholding the judgment for petitioner than in allowing a new trial, while neither petitioner nor Loyola has made a showing of special hardship by reason of their reliance on the original judgment.  Finally, although a 10-month delay would normally foreclose vacatur based on a  455(a) violation, the delay here is excusable, since it is entirely attributable to Judge Collins' conduct.  Pp.  486 U. S. 862-870.

No. 86-1992

486 U.S. 875

Syllabus 
Respondents, 16 Filipino nationals who served with the United States Armed Forces during World War II, seek United States citizenship pursuant to  701 through 705 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended in 1942.  Under  702 of the Act, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization was authorized to designate representatives to receive petitions, conduct hearings, and grant naturalization outside the United States.  In August 1945, the American Vice Consul in Manila was designated pursuant to  702 to naturalize aliens.  The Philippine Government, however, expressed its concern that a mass migration of newly naturalized veterans would drain the soon-to-be independent country's manpower, and so the naturalization officer's authority was revoked for a 9-month period between October, 1945, and August, 1946.  Respondents would have been eligible for citizenship under the provisions of the 1940 Act if they had filed naturalization applications before the Act expired on December 31, 1946, but did not do so.  More than 30 years later, they petitioned for naturalization, claiming that the 9-month absence of a  702 naturalization officer violated the 1940 Act and deprived them of rights secured by the Fifth Amendment.  The naturalization examiner, in all of the cases consolidated here, recommended against naturalization, and the District Courts rejected the naturalization petitions.  On respondents' appeals (some of which were consolidated), heard in two cases by different Ninth Circuit panels, the Court of Appeals ultimately held that the revocation of the Vice Consul's naturalization authority violated what it characterized as the 1940 Act's mandatory language, and that the naturalization of respondents was an appropriate equitable remedy.
Held:
1. Neither by application of the doctrine of estoppel, nor by invocation of equitable powers, nor by any other means does a court have the power to confer citizenship in violation of the limitations imposed by Congress in the exercise of its exclusive constitutional authority over naturalization. 
Page 486 U. S. 876
  Since respondents have no current statutory right to citizenship under the expired provisions of the 1940 Act, the Ninth Circuit lacked authority to grant the petitions for naturalization.  The reasoning of INS v. Hibi, 414 U. S. 5 -- which held that the same official acts as those alleged here did not give rise to an estoppel that prevented the Government from invoking the December 31, 1946, cutoff date in the 1940 Act -- suggests the same result as to the ""equitable remedy"" theory in this case.  Even assuming that, in reviewing naturalization petitions, federal courts sit as courts of equity, such courts can no more disregard statutory provisions than can courts of law.  Congress has given the power to the federal courts to make someone a citizen as a specific function to be performed in strict compliance with the terms of 8 U.S.C.  1421(d), which states that a person may be naturalized ""in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter, and not otherwise.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 882-885.
2. Assuming that respondents can properly invoke the Constitution's protections, and granting that they had statutory entitlements to naturalization, there is no merit to their contention that the revocation of the Vice Consul's naturalization authority deprived them of their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and under its equal protection component.  Respondents were not entitled to individualized notice of any statutory rights and to the continuous presence of a naturalization officer in the Philippines from October, 1945, until July, 1946.  Moreover, the historical record does not support the contention that the actions at issue here were motivated by any racial animus.  Pp.  486 U. S. 885-886.
3. There is no merit to the separate arguments of respondents Litonjua and Manzano, including the argument that the Government did not introduce any evidence in their cases concerning the historical events at issue.  It is well settled that the burden is on the alien applicant to establish his eligibility for citizenship.  Pp.  486 U. S. 886-887.

Syllabus 
In 1974, appellant, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, and appellee, an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, entered into a contract for appellee's delivery and installation of a boiler system at appellant's Ohio facility.  After a contract dispute arose, appellant filed this diversity action in the Northern District of Ohio in 1980.  When appellee asserted the Ohio statute of limitations as a defense, appellant responded that the limitations period had not elapsed, because, under an Ohio statute, the running of the time is tolled for claims against corporations that are not present in the State and have not designated an agent for service of process.  The District Court dismissed the action, finding that the Ohio tolling statute constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Ohio tolling statute violates the Commerce Clause, since it imposes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  To gain the protection of the limitations period, appellee -- which has no corporate office in Ohio and is not registered to do business there -- would have had to appoint a resident agent for service of process in Ohio and subject itself to the Ohio courts' general jurisdiction.  Ohio's statutory scheme thus forces a foreign corporation to choose between exposure to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts or forfeiture of the limitations defense, remaining subject to suit in Ohio in perpetuity.  Although statute of limitations defenses are not a fundamental right, they are an integral part of the legal system and are relied upon to project the liabilities of persons and corporations active in the commercial sphere.  Such defenses may not be withdrawn from out-of-state persons or corporations on conditions repugnant to the Commerce Clause.  The ability to execute service of process on foreign corporations is an important factor to consider in assessing the local interest in subjecting out-of-state entities to requirements more onerous than those imposed on domestic parties.  However, Ohio cannot justify its tolling statute as a means of protecting its residents from corporations who become liable for acts done within the State but later withdraw from the jurisdiction, for the parties concede that the Ohio long-arm statute would have permitted service on appellee 
Page 486 U. S. 889
 throughout the period of limitations.  Moreover, the suggestion that appellee had the simple alternatives of designating an agent for service of process in its contract with appellant or tendering an agency appointment to the Ohio Secretary of State is not persuasive.  Appellant's argument that a finding that the Ohio statute is unconstitutional should be applied prospectively only, and not to the parties in this case, will not be considered by this Court, since the argument was not presented to the courts below.

No. 87-367
Argued March 23, 1988
Decided June 17, 1988
486 U.S. 888

Syllabus 
In 1974, appellant, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, and appellee, an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, entered into a contract for appellee's delivery and installation of a boiler system at appellant's Ohio facility.  After a contract dispute arose, appellant filed this diversity action in the Northern District of Ohio in 1980.  When appellee asserted the Ohio statute of limitations as a defense, appellant responded that the limitations period had not elapsed, because, under an Ohio statute, the running of the time is tolled for claims against corporations that are not present in the State and have not designated an agent for service of process.  The District Court dismissed the action, finding that the Ohio tolling statute constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Ohio tolling statute violates the Commerce Clause, since it imposes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  To gain the protection of the limitations period, appellee -- which has no corporate office in Ohio and is not registered to do business there -- would have had to appoint a resident agent for service of process in Ohio and subject itself to the Ohio courts' general jurisdiction.  Ohio's statutory scheme thus forces a foreign corporation to choose between exposure to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts or forfeiture of the limitations defense, remaining subject to suit in Ohio in perpetuity.  Although statute of limitations defenses are not a fundamental right, they are an integral part of the legal system and are relied upon to project the liabilities of persons and corporations active in the commercial sphere.  Such defenses may not be withdrawn from out-of-state persons or corporations on conditions repugnant to the Commerce Clause.  The ability to execute service of process on foreign corporations is an important factor to consider in assessing the local interest in subjecting out-of-state entities to requirements more onerous than those imposed on domestic parties.  However, Ohio cannot justify its tolling statute as a means of protecting its residents from corporations who become liable for acts done within the State but later withdraw from the jurisdiction, for the parties concede that the Ohio long-arm statute would have permitted service on appellee 
Page 486 U. S. 889
 throughout the period of limitations.  Moreover, the suggestion that appellee had the simple alternatives of designating an agent for service of process in its contract with appellant or tendering an agency appointment to the Ohio Secretary of State is not persuasive.  Appellant's argument that a finding that the Ohio statute is unconstitutional should be applied prospectively only, and not to the parties in this case, will not be considered by this Court, since the argument was not presented to the courts below.  Pp.  486 U. S. 891-895.
820 F.2d 186, affirmed.

Syllabus 
Section 102(c) of the National Security Act of 1947 (NSA) authorizes the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), ""in his discretion,"" to terminate the employment of any CIA employee ""whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States.""  After respondent, a covert electronics technician in the CIA's employ, voluntarily informed the agency that he was a homosexual, he was discharged by the Director (petitioner's predecessor) under  102(c).  Respondent filed suit against petitioner in Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), of his rights to property, liberty, and privacy under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, and of his rights to procedural due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment.  After the court granted respondent's motion for partial summary judgment on his APA claim, declining to address his constitutional claims, the Court of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded.  The court agreed with the District Court that judicial review under the APA of petitioner's termination decisions made under  102(c) of the NSA was not precluded by the provision of the APA, 5 U.S.C.  701(a), which renders that Act inapplicable whenever ""(1) statutes preclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.""  However, the court held that the District Court had erred in its ruling on the merits.
Held:
1. Title 5 U.S.C.  701(a)(2) precludes judicial review under the APA of the CIA Director's termination decisions under  102(c) of the NSA. Section 701(a)(2) applies where a statute is drawn in such broad terms that, in a given case, there is no law to apply, and the court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.  In allowing termination whenever the Director ""shall deem [it] necessary or advisable,"" and not simply when the dismissal is necessary or advisable,  102(c) fairly exudes deference to the Director, and forecloses the application of any meaningful judicial standard of review for assessing a termination decision short of permitting cross-examination of the Director.  That  102(c)'s implementation was ""committed to agency 
Page 486 U. S. 593
 discretion by law"" is also strongly suggested by the overall structure of the NSA, which vests in the Director very broad authority to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.  Section 102(c) is an integral part of that structure, because the CIA's efficacy, and the Nation's security, depend in large measure on the reliability and trustworthiness of CIA employees.  Pp.  486 U. S. 599-601.
2. District Court review of respondent's constitutional claims is not precluded by  102(c) of the NSA.  Petitioner's view that all CIA employment termination decisions, even those based on policies normally repugnant to the Constitution, are given over to the Director's absolute discretion, is not supported by the required heightened showing of clear congressional intent.  Although  102(c) does commit termination decisions to the Director's discretion, 5 U.S.C.  701(a)(1) and (a)(2) remove from judicial review only those determinations specifically identified by Congress or ""committed to agency discretion by law.""  Nothing in  102(c) demonstrates that Congress meant to preclude consideration of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the Director's actions pursuant to that section.  Petitioner's contention that judicial review of constitutional claims will entail extensive ""rummaging around"" in the CIA's affairs to the detriment of national security is not persuasive, since claims attacking the CIA's employment policies under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are routinely entertained in federal court, and the District Court has the latitude to control any discovery process in order to balance respondent's need for access to proof against the CIA's extraordinary need for confidentiality.  Petitioner's contention that Congress, in the interest of national security, may deny the courts authority to decide respondent's colorable constitutional claims arising out of his discharge and to order his reinstatement if the claims are upheld is also without merit, since Congress did not mean to impose such restrictions when it enacted  102(c).  Even without such prohibitory legislation, traditional equitable principles requiring the balancing of public and private interests control the grant of declaratory or injunctive relief, and, on remand, the District Court should thus address respondent's constitutional claims and the propriety of the equitable remedies sought.

No. 86-805
Argued December 9, 1987
Decided June 15, 1988
486 U.S. 622

Syllabus 
Petitioner Pinter, an oil and gas producer and registered securities dealer, sold unregistered securities consisting of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas leases to respondent Dahl, a real estate broker and investor who was experienced in oil and gas ventures.  Dahl touted the venture to the other respondents -- his friends, family, and business associates -- and assisted them in completing subscription agreement forms prepared by Pinter, but received no commission from Pinter when each of them invested in unregistered interests on the basis of Dahl's involvement.  When the venture failed, respondents sued Pinter in Federal District Court, seeking rescission under  12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Act) for the unlawful sale of unregistered securities.  After a bench trial, the court granted judgment for respondents, apparently rejecting Pinter's common law in pari delicto defense to Dahl's suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that such defense was not available because  12(1) creates a ""strict liability offense,"" rather than liability based on intentional conduct, and distinguishing Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U. S. 299, which held that the defense applies in actions under  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on the ground that  10(b) contains an element of scienter.  The court also held that Dahl was not a ""seller"" within the meaning of  12(1), and therefore could not be held liable in contribution for the other respondents' claims against Pinter, since, although Dahl's conduct was a ""substantial factor"" in causing the other respondents' purchases, there was no evidence that he had sought or received financial benefit for himself or anyone other than the other respondents.
Held:
1. The in pari delicto defense is available in a  12(1) private rescission action.  Pp.  486 U. S. 632-641.
(a) Bateman Eichler is not limited to  10(b) claims, to cases involving willful or negligent misconduct, or to implied, as opposed to express, private causes of action.  Rather, the decision provides the appropriate test for allowance of the in pari delicto defense in a private action under any of the federal securities laws, including a  12(1) rescission suit.  Pp.  486 U. S. 633-635. 
Page 486 U. S. 623

(b) The first prong of the Bateman Eichler test is satisfied in the  12(1) context if the plaintiff is at least equally responsible for the issuer's illegal failure to register the securities or to conduct the sale in a manner that satisfies the Act's registration exemption provisions.  A purchaser's knowledge that the securities are unregistered cannot, by itself, constitute equal culpability, even where he is a sophisticated buyer who may not necessarily need the Act's protection.  Rather, the relative responsibility assessment turns upon the facts of each case.  The second prong of the Bateman Eichler test is satisfied in the  12(1) context where the plaintiff's role is primarily as a promoter, rather than as an investor.  The determination depends on a host of readily accessible factors, including, but not limited to, the extent of the plaintiff's financial involvement compared to that of the third parties he solicited, the incidental nature of his promotional activities, the benefits he received for those activities, and the extent of his involvement in the offering's planning stages.  Pp.  486 U. S. 635-639.
(c) The District Court's findings are inadequate to determine whether Dahl may be subjected to Pinter's in pari delicto defense under the Bateman Eichler test, as it applies to  12(1) actions.  Pp.  486 U. S. 639-641.
2. A nonowner of securities must solicit the purchase, motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner, in order to qualify as a ""seller"" within the meaning of  12(1), which provides that ""[a]ny person who . . . offers or sells a security"" in violation of the Act's registration requirement ""shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 641-655.
(a) Section 12(1)'s language and history, as well as the statutory purpose of protecting investors, demonstrate that ""seller"" is not limited to an owner who passes title, or other interest in a security, to the buyer for value, but extends to a broker or other person who successfully solicits a purchase of securities, so long as he is motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner.  It strains the meaning of  2(3) of the Act, which defines ""offer"" for  12(1)'s purposes as including every ""solicitation of an offer to buy . . . for value,"" to say that a person who gratuitously urges another, even strongly or enthusiastically, to make a securities purchase solely for the buyer's benefit is ""soliciting"" or is requesting value in exchange for his suggestion or seeking the value the titleholder will obtain in exchange for the ultimate sale.  Only if the soliciting person is motivated by such a financial interest can it be fairly said that the buyer ""purchased"" the security from him, such that he can be aligned with the owner in a rescission action.  Pp.  486 U. S. 642-647.
(b) The language, history, and statutory context of  12(1) demonstrate that the ""substantial factor"" test, whereby a nontransferor seller 
Page 486 U. S. 624
 is defined as one whose participation in the buy-sell transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place, is not an appropriate standard for assessing  12(1) liability as a statutory seller.  Without affording guidelines for determining when the defendant's conduct is sufficiently integral to the sale, the test would expand primary  12(1) liability beyond persons who pass title and those who ""offer"" or ""solicit"" offers for financial gain to persons who merely participate in unlawful sales transactions but are only remotely related to the relevant aspects of the transactions, including accountants and lawyers simply performing their professional services.  Such persons do not even arguably fit within the definitions set out in  2(3).  Congress did not intend such a gross departure from the statutory language.  Pp.  486 U. S. 648-654.
(c) The record is insufficient to determine whether Dahl may be liable as a statutory ""seller"" under  12(1).  The District Court's finding that Dahl solicited the other respondents' purchases is not clearly erroneous.  However, the Court of Appeals' apparent conclusion that Dahl was motivated entirely by a gratuitous desire to share an attractive investment opportunity with his friends and associates was premature, since the District Court made no findings that focused on whether he urged the other respondents' purchases in order to further some financial interest of his own or of Pinter.  Pp.  486 U. S. 654-655.
787 F.2d 985, vacated and remanded.

486 U.S. 663

Syllabus 
Section 161(v) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to offer its services, for a fee, to convert natural uranium into the enriched uranium used for fuel in commercial reactors, and provides that DOE ""shall"" restrict its enrichment of foreign-source uranium intended for use in domestic facilities ""to the extent necessary to assure the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry.""  DOE has determined that the domestic uranium industry has not been ""viable"" since 1983, and that the imposition of restrictions on DOE's enrichment of foreign uranium would not assure viability.  Respondent domestic uranium mining and milling companies filed suit against petitioners (DOE and some of its officers and employees) in Federal District Court, alleging that DOE's failure to impose restrictions on the enrichment of foreign uranium for use in domestic facilities constituted a violation of  161(v).  Respondents moved for summary judgment based on this claim, arguing that two facts -- that the domestic industry was not viable and that DOE imposed no restrictions on enrichment of foreign uranium -- established their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law under  161(v).  Petitioners filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, contending that  161(v) did not require restrictions when those restrictions would not serve the statutory goal of assuring the maintenance of a viable domestic industry.  The court entered summary judgment for respondents, holding that the statute gave DOE no discretion to determine not to impose restrictions if the domestic industry was not viable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in relevant part.
Held:  Section 161(v) does not require DOE to restrict the enrichment of foreign uranium where such restriction would not achieve the statutory goal of ""assur[ing] the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry,"" for the statute ties the amount of restriction to be imposed to the achievement of that goal.

			"|"Huffman v. Western Nuclear, Inc.
No. 87-645
Argued April 27, 1988
Decided June 15, 1988
486 U.S. 663

Syllabus 
Section 161(v) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 authorizes the Department of Energy (DOE) to offer its services, for a fee, to convert natural uranium into the enriched uranium used for fuel in commercial reactors, and provides that DOE ""shall"" restrict its enrichment of foreign-source uranium intended for use in domestic facilities ""to the extent necessary to assure the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry.""  DOE has determined that the domestic uranium industry has not been ""viable"" since 1983, and that the imposition of restrictions on DOE's enrichment of foreign uranium would not assure viability.  Respondent domestic uranium mining and milling companies filed suit against petitioners (DOE and some of its officers and employees) in Federal District Court, alleging that DOE's failure to impose restrictions on the enrichment of foreign uranium for use in domestic facilities constituted a violation of  161(v).  Respondents moved for summary judgment based on this claim, arguing that two facts -- that the domestic industry was not viable and that DOE imposed no restrictions on enrichment of foreign uranium -- established their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law under  161(v).  Petitioners filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, contending that  161(v) did not require restrictions when those restrictions would not serve the statutory goal of assuring the maintenance of a viable domestic industry.  The court entered summary judgment for respondents, holding that the statute gave DOE no discretion to determine not to impose restrictions if the domestic industry was not viable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in relevant part.
Held:  Section 161(v) does not require DOE to restrict the enrichment of foreign uranium where such restriction would not achieve the statutory goal of ""assur[ing] the maintenance of a viable domestic uranium industry,"" for the statute ties the amount of restriction to be imposed to the achievement of that goal.  Pp.  486 U. S. 671-674.

No. 87-354
Argued March 29, 1988
Decided June 15, 1988
486 U.S. 675

Syllabus 
Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477,  451 U. S. 484-485, held that a suspect who has
""expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication.""
After being arrested at the scene of a burglary, and being advised by the arresting officer of his constitutional rights, as declared in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, to remain silent and to have an attorney present during any interrogation, respondent replied that he ""wanted a lawyer before answering any questions,"" which fact was duly reported in the officer's written report.  Three days later, while respondent was still in custody, a different officer, unaware that respondent had earlier requested counsel who had not yet been provided, advised him of his rights and interrogated him about a different burglary, obtaining an incriminating statement concerning that crime.  In the prosecution for that offense, the Arizona trial court suppressed the statement in reliance upon a State Supreme Court decision that refused to distinguish Edwards with respect to a suspect who was reinterrogated about an unrelated offense after he had requested counsel, ruling that the fact that the further interrogation in Edwards had involved the same offense was not legally significant for Fifth Amendment purposes.  The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed the suppression.
Held:  The Edwards rule applies to bar police-initiated interrogation following a suspect's request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation.  Pp.  486 U. S. 680-688.
(a) The bright-line, prophylactic Edwards rule benefits the accused and the State alike.  It protects against the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation suspects who feel incapable of undergoing such questioning without the advice of counsel, by creating a presumption that any subsequent waiver of the right to counsel at the authorities' behest was coercive, and not purely voluntary.  Moreover, it provides clear and unequivocal guidelines that inform police and prosecutors with specificity what they may do in conducting custodial interrogation, and that inform courts under what circumstances statements obtained during such interrogation are not admissible.  Pp.  486 U. S. 680-682.
(b) This Court's decisions do not compel an exception to Edwards for post-request police-initiated custodial interrogation relating to a separate 
Page 486 U. S. 676
 investigation.  Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96; Connecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523; Colorado v. Spring, 479 U. S. 564; and Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, distinguished.  Pp.  486 U. S. 682-685.
(c) The nature and factual setting of this case do not compel an exception to the Edwards rule.  The argument that the existence of separate investigations in itself precludes the type of badgering that led to the decision in Edwards is not persuasive.  It is by no means clear that police engaged in separate investigations will be any less eager than police involved in only one inquiry to question a suspect in custody.  Moreover, to a suspect who has indicated his inability to cope with custodial interrogation by requesting counsel, any further interrogation without counsel will surely exacerbate whatever compulsion to speak the suspect may be feeling.  The giving of fresh sets of Miranda warnings will not necessarily ""reassure"" a suspect who has been denied requested counsel that his rights have remained untrammeled.  In fact, in a case such as this, in which three days elapsed between the unsatisfied request for counsel and the separate-offense interrogation, there is a serious risk that the mere repetition of the warnings would not overcome the presumption of coercion created by prolonged police custody.  Furthermore, the fact that it may be in an uncounseled suspect's interests to know about, and give a statement concerning, the separate offense does not compel an exception to Edwards, since the suspect, having requested counsel, can determine how to deal with the separate investigations with counsel's advice, and since the police are free to inform the suspect of the facts of the second investigation, as long as they do not interrogate him, and he is free to initiate further communication.  Finally, the fact that the officer who conducted respondent's second interrogation did not know that he had requested counsel cannot justify the failure to honor that request, since Edwards focuses on the state of mind of the suspect, and not of the police, and since the officer could have discovered the request simply by reading the arresting officer's report.  Pp.  486 U. S. 685-688.

Syllabus 
After his parents were killed in an automobile accident, respondent filed a wrongful death action in an Illinois court, alleging that defects in the automobile designed and sold by Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VWoA), in which the parents were driving, caused or contributed to their deaths.  When VWoA's answer denied that it had designed or assembled the vehicle, respondent amended his complaint to add as a defendant petitioner here (VWAG), a German corporation which is the sole owner of VWoA.  Respondent attempted to serve the amended complaint on VWAG by serving VWoA as VWAG's agent.  Filing a special and limited appearance, VWAG moved to quash the service on the grounds that it could be served only in accordance with the Hague Service Convention, and that respondent had not complied with the Convention's requirements.  The court denied the motion, reasoning that VWoA and VWAG are so closely related that VWoA is VWAG's agent for service of process as a matter of law, notwithstanding VWAG's failure or refusal to appoint VWoA formally as an agent.  The court concluded that, because service was accomplished in this country, the Convention did not apply.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, ruling that the Illinois long-arm statute authorized substituted service on VWoA, and that such service did not violate the Convention.
Held:  The Hague Service Convention does not apply when process is served on a foreign corporation by serving its domestic subsidiary which, under state law, is the foreign corporation's involuntary agent for service.  Pp.  486 U. S. 698-708.
(a) The service of process in this case is not covered by Article I of the Convention, which provides that the Convention ""shall apply . . . where there is occasion to transmit a judicial . . . document for service abroad.""  ""Service"" means a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action.  Since the Convention does not itself prescribe a standard for determining the legal sufficiency of the delivery, the internal law of the forum state controls.  Thus, where, as here, the forum state's law does not define the applicable method of serving process as requiring the transmittal of documents 
Page 486 U. S. 695
 abroad, the Convention does not apply.  This interpretation is consistent with the negotiating history and the general purposes of the Convention.  One purpose of the Convention is to provide means to facilitate service of process abroad.  The Convention implements this purpose by requiring each state to establish a central authority to assist in the service of process, and nothing in the present decision interferes with that requirement.  Another purpose of the Convention is to assure foreign defendants adequate notice.  The present decision does not necessarily advance this purpose, because it makes application of the Convention depend on the forum's internal law; however, it is unlikely that any country will draft its internal laws deliberately so as to circumvent the Convention in cases in which it would be appropriate to transmit judicial documents for service abroad.  Furthermore, this decision does not prevent voluntary compliance with the Convention even when the forum's internal law does not so require, and such compliance can be advantageous.  Pp.  486 U. S. 698-706.
(b) VWAG's contention that service upon it was not complete until VWoA transmitted the complaint to it in Germany, and that this transmission ""for service abroad"" rendered the Convention applicable to the case under Article I, is without merit.  Where, as here, service on a domestic agent is valid and complete under both state law and the Due Process Clause without an official transmission of documents abroad, the inquiry ends and the Convention has no further implications.

Syllabus 
In the 1960's and 1970's, petitioner extracted gas from properties leased from respondents in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, in exchange for agreements to pay royalties.  Petitioner's prices for interstate gas sales had to be approved by the Federal Power Commission (FPC), which permitted petitioner to collect proposed increased prices from customers prior to FPC approval on the condition that petitioner comply with regulations requiring it to refund to customers any ultimately unapproved increase plus interest at specified rates.  Petitioner withheld royalties on the unapproved increases until it obtained FPC approval.  Two of the respondents filed a class action in a Kansas court, seeking interest on the suspended payments for the period they were held and used by petitioner.  The trial court held that petitioner was liable for interest at the FPC-set rates under Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana law, and that the application of Kansas' 5-year statute of limitations rendered respondents' claims for interest on the July, 1976, payments timely.  The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contentions that (1) the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the application of the statutes of limitations of the other States, under which the suit would be barred, and (2) those same constitutional provisions mandated interpretations of the other States' substantive laws concerning interest that were different from the interpretations arrived at in this case.
Held:
1. The Constitution does not bar application of the forum State's statute of limitations to claims governed by the substantive law of a different State.  Pp.  486 U. S. 722-730.
(a) Kansas did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause by applying its own statute of limitations.  The holding of M'Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312, that statutes of limitation may be treated as procedural, and therefore governed by the forum State's law for choice-of-law purposes, was correct when handed down.  Petitioner's argument that this traditional view should be abandoned in favor of the modern understanding that statutes of limitations are substantive -- as exemplified by Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, which so held for Erie doctrine purposes -- is without merit.  Guaranty Trust itself rejected the notion that there is an equivalence between what is substantive under 
Page 486 U. S. 718
 the Erie doctrine and what is substantive for choice-of-law purposes.  The adoption of petitioner's argument under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, in the face of the traditional and still subsisting general practice to the contrary, would amount to the improper constitutionalizing of choice-of-law rules, without sufficient guiding standards.  Pp.  486 U. S. 722-729.
(b) Petitioner's due process attack upon Kansas' adoption of its own statute of limitations is without merit.  Both the tradition in place when the constitutional provision was adopted and subsequent and subsisting general practice establish that a State has legislative jurisdiction to control the remedies available in its courts by imposing statutes of limitations in the interest of regulating the courts' workload and determining when a claim is stale.  Petitioner could not have been unfairly surprised by the application of this established rule.  Pp.  486 U. S. 729-730.
2. The Kansas Supreme Court did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause or the Due Process Clause in its constructions of the laws of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana regarding interest, since it contradicted no law of those States that was clearly established and that had been brought to the court's attention.  The court pointed to laws of those States authorizing agreements to pay interest at higher than the specified rates, and petitioner did not point to decisions clearly contradicting the court's conclusion that such an agreement was implied by petitioner's undertaking with the FPC.

No. 87-16
Argued March 1, 1988
Decided June 13, 1988
486 U.S. 466

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a member of the Kentucky Bar, applied to that State's Attorneys Advertising Commission for approval of a letter that he proposed to send ""to potential clients who have had a foreclosure suit filed against them,"" which, inter alia, advised the client that ""you may be about to lose your home,"" that ""[f]ederal law may allow you to . . . ORDE[R] your creditor to STOP,"" that ""you may call my office . . . for FREE information,"" and that ""[i]t may surprise you what I may be able to do for you.""  Although the Commission did not find the letter false or misleading, it declined to approve it on the ground that a then-existing Kentucky Supreme Court Rule prohibited the mailing or delivery of written advertisements ""precipitated by a specific event . . . involving or relating to the addressee . . . as distinct from the general public.""  Nevertheless, the Commission registered its view that the Rule violated the First Amendment under Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, and recommended its amendment by the State Supreme Court.  Petitioner then sought an advisory opinion as to the Rule's validity from the State Bar Association's Ethics Committee, which upheld the Rule as consistent with Rule 7.3 of the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct.  On review of the advisory opinion, the State Supreme Court held that Zauderer compelled the State Rule's deletion, and replaced it with Rule 7.3, which also prohibits targeted, direct-mail solicitation by lawyers for pecuniary gain, without a particularized finding that the solicitation is false or misleading.  The court did not specify either the precise infirmity in the State Rule, or how Rule 7.3 cured it.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
726 S.W.2d 299, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I and II, concluding that a State may not, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, categorically prohibit lawyers from soliciting business for pecuniary gain by sending truthful and nondeceptive letters to potential clients known to face particular legal problems.  Such advertising is constitutionally protected commercial speech, which may be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest, and only through means that directly advance that interest.  Zauderer, supra.  Moreover, this Court's lawyer advertising cases have never distinguished 
Page 486 U. S. 467
 among various modes of written advertising to the general public, as is recognized by Rule 7.3's exemption for advertising
""distributed generally to persons not known to need [the particular] legal services . . but who are so situated that they might in general find such services useful.""
The court below disapproved petitioner's letter solely on the basis of its failure to qualify for this exemption, analogizing to Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, for the proposition that targeted, direct-mail solicitation by a trained lawyer to a potential client ""overwhelmed"" by his legal troubles, and therefore having an ""impaired capacity for good judgment,"" creates a serious potential for undue influence.  However, respondent's reliance on Ohralik, which held that a State could categorically ban all in-person solicitation, is misplaced, since the two factors underlying that decision -- the strong possibility of improper lawyer conduct and the improbability of effective regulation -- are much less a risk in the targeted, direct-mail solicitation context.  The recipient of such advertising is not faced with the coercive presence of a trained advocate or the pressure for an immediate yes-or-no answer to the representation offer, but can simply put the letter aside to be considered later, ignored, or discarded.  Moreover, although a personalized letter does present increased risks of isolated abuses or mistakes, these can be regulated and minimized by requiring the lawyer to file the letter with a state agency having authority to supervise mailings and penalize actual abuses.  Scrutiny of targeted solicitation letters will not be appreciably less reliable than scrutiny of other advertisements, since the reviewing agency can require the lawyer to prove or verify any fact stated, or explain how it was discovered, or require that the letter be labeled as an advertisement, or that it tell the reader how to report inaccurate or misleading matters.  That an agency reviewing such letters might have more work than one that does not simply does not outweigh the importance of the free flow of commercial information.  Pp.  486 U. S. 472-478.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Part III that, although the validity of Rule 7.3 does not turn on whether petitioner's letter itself exhibited any of the evils at which the Rule was directed, respondent's contention that the letter is particularly overreaching, and therefore unworthy of First Amendment protection, must be addressed, since the Amendment's overbreadth doctrine does not apply to professional advertising.  However, although the letter's liberal use of underscored, uppercase letters and its inclusion of subjective predictions of client satisfaction might catch the recipient's attention more than would a bland statement of purely objective facts in small type, the letter presents no risk of overreaching comparable to that of a lawyer engaged in face-to-face solicitation.  In light of the First Amendment's protection, a State 
Page 486 U. S. 468
 may claim no substantial interest in restricting truthful and nondeceptive lawyer solicitations to those least likely to be read by the recipient.  Moreover, the State may not absolutely ban certain types of potentially misleading information if the information may also be presented in a nondeceptive way, or impose a more particularized restriction unless it asserts, as respondent has not done in this case, a valid substantial interest that such a restriction would directly advance.  Although a letter may be so misleading as to warrant restriction if it unduly emphasizes trivial or relatively uninformative facts or offers overblown assurances of client satisfaction, respondent has not argued such defects here.  Such arguments may be raised and considered on remand.  Pp.  486 U. S. 478-480.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respects to Parts I and II, in which WHITE, MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined.

Syllabus 
The National Fire Protection Association -- a private organization that includes members representing industry, labor, academia, insurers, organized medicine, firefighters, and government -- sets and publishes product standards and codes related to fire protection.  Its National Electrical Code (Code), which establishes requirements for the design and installation of electrical wiring systems, is routinely adopted into law by a substantial number of state and local governments, and is widely adopted as setting acceptable standards by private product-certification laboratories, insurance underwriters, and electrical inspectors, contractors, and distributors.  Throughout the relevant period, the Code permitted the use of electrical conduit made of steel.  Respondent, a manufacturer of plastic conduit, initiated a proposal before the Association to extend Code approval to plastic conduit as well.  The proposal was approved by one of the Association's professional panels, and thus could be adopted into the Code by a simple majority of the members attending the Association's 1980 annual meeting.  Before the meeting was held, petitioner, the Nation's largest producer of steel conduit, members of the steel industry, other steel conduit manufacturers, and independent sales agents collectively agreed to exclude respondent's product from the 1981 Code by packing the annual meeting with new Association members whose only function was to vote against respondent's proposal.  After the proposal was defeated at the meeting and an appeal to the Association's Board of Directors was denied, respondent brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that petitioner and others had unreasonably restrained trade in the electrical conduit market in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The jury found petitioner liable, but the court granted a judgment n.o.v. for petitioner, reasoning that it was entitled to antitrust immunity under the doctrine of Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Noerr antitrust immunity does not apply to petitioner.
(a) The scope of Noerr protection depends on the source, context, and nature of the anticompetitive restraint at issue.  Where a restraint is the result of valid governmental action, as opposed to private action, 
Page 486 U. S. 493
 those urging the governmental action enjoy absolute immunity from antitrust liability for the anticompetitive restraint.  In this case, the relevant context is the standard-setting process of a private association without official authority that includes members having horizontal and vertical business relations and economic incentives to restrain competition.  Such an association cannot be treated as a ""quasi-legislative"" body simply because legislatures routinely adopt its Code, and thus petitioner does not enjoy the immunity afforded those who merely urge the government to restrain trade.  Pp.  486 U. S. 499-502.
(b) Nor does Noerr immunity apply to petitioner on the theory that the exclusion of plastic conduit from the Code, and the effect that exclusion had of its own force in the marketplace, were incidental to a valid effort to influence governmental action.  Although, because a large number of governments routinely adopt the Code into law, efforts to influence the Association's standard-setting process are arguably the most effective means of influencing legislation regulating electrical conduit, and although Noerr immunity is not limited to ""direct"" petitioning of government officials, the Noerr doctrine does not immunize every concerted activity that is genuinely intended to influence governmental action.  There is no merit to the argument that, regardless of the Association's nonlegislative status, petitioner's efforts to influence the Association must be given the same wide berth accorded legislative lobbying or efforts to influence legislative action in the political arena.  Pp.  486 U. S. 502-504.
(c) Unlike the publicity campaign to influence legislation in Noerr, petitioner's activity did not take place in the open political arena, where partisanship is the hallmark of decisionmaking, but took place within the confines of a private standard-setting process.  The validity of petitioner's efforts to influence the Code is not established, without more, by petitioner's literal compliance with the Association's rules, for the hope of the Code's procompetitive benefits depends upon the existence of safeguards sufficient to prevent the standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic interests in restraining competition.  An association cannot validate the anticompetitive activities of its members simply by adopting rules that fail to provide such safeguards.  At least where, as here, an economically interested party exercises decisionmaking authority in formulating a product standard for a private association that comprises market participants, that party enjoys no Noerr immunity from any antitrust liability flowing from the effect the standard has of its own force in the marketplace.  Pp.  486 U. S. 505-510.

486 U.S. 517

Syllabus 
The courts of appeals have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1291 of appeals ""from all final decisions of the district courts.""  Under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, and Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, a ""collateral order"" which does not actually end the district court litigation is nevertheless considered to be final and immediately appealable under  1291 if, inter alia, it resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  Petitioner, a resident of Belgium, was indicted in the Central District of California for fraudulently inducing respondent to lend money to a California real estate partnership engaged in renovating a Kansas City townhouse complex.  While on a trip to Switzerland, petitioner was arrested under the applicable extradition treaty and extradited to Los Angeles.  One week before his criminal trial commenced, respondent filed a civil suit against petitioner in the same District, asserting various claims arising out of the defaulted loan.  About two weeks after his sentencing following his conviction on the criminal charges, petitioner was served with the civil summons and complaint.  The District Court summarily denied petitioner's motions to dismiss, which were based upon the argument that petitioner was immune from civil process because his presence in the United States resulted from extradition, and upon forum non conveniens grounds.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing Cohen, supra, and Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511.
Held:  Neither an order denying a motion to dismiss on the ground that an extradited person is immune from civil process, nor an order denying such a motion on forum non conveniens grounds, is a collateral order subject to immediate appeal as a final judgment under  1291.  Pp.  486 U. S. 521-530.
(a) Assuming, without deciding, that the ""principle of specialty,"" see United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407, immunizes petitioner from civil service of process while his presence in this country is compelled by extradition, petitioner's claim is nevertheless effectively reviewable on appeal from final judgment, and thus is not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.  Unlike the qualified immunity claim 
Page 486 U. S. 518
 considered in Mitchell, supra, the ""essence"" of petitioner's claim of immunity under the principle of specialty is not a right not to stand trial, which would be irretrievably lost absent an immediate appeal.  The principle of specialty operates to ensure that the receiving state does not abuse the extraditing state's extradition processes, and the conduct of a civil trial does not significantly implicate the reviewing state's obligation in that regard, since the state does not bring its coercive power to bear in such circumstances, but simply provides a forum for the resolution of a private dispute.  Moreover, the defense of a civil suit does not significantly restrict a defendant's liberty, since he cannot be subjected to pretrial detention or required to post bail, and is not even compelled to be present at trial.  Furthermore, a right not to stand trial is not entailed in the mere assertion that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction because of immunity from service of process.  The right involved in this challenge must be characterized as the right not to be subject to a binding judgment, which may be effectively vindicated following final judgment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 522-527.
(b) The order denying the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds does not fall within the collateral order doctrine, since the convenience-of-the-forum question is not completely separate from the merits of the action.  Although the determination of that question may not require significant inquiry into the facts and legal issues in some cases, in the main, a district court ruling on such a motion will generally become entangled in the merits of the case in assessing such questions as the relative ease of access to the sources of proof, the availability of witnesses, and the actual locus of the alleged culpable conduct.  Thus, such determinations are unsuited for immediate appeal as of right under  1291.  This conclusion is fortified by the availability of interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C.  1292(b) offorum non conveniens determinations in appropriate cases.  Pp.  486 U. S. 527-530.
Affirmed.

The District Court summarily denied petitioner's motions to dismiss, which were based upon the argument that petitioner was immune from civil process because his presence in the United States resulted from extradition, and upon forum non conveniens grounds.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing Cohen, supra, and Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511.
Held:  Neither an order denying a motion to dismiss on the ground that an extradited person is immune from civil process, nor an order denying such a motion on forum non conveniens grounds, is a collateral order subject to immediate appeal as a final judgment under  1291.  Pp.  486 U. S. 521-530.
(a) Assuming, without deciding, that the ""principle of specialty,"" see United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407, immunizes petitioner from civil service of process while his presence in this country is compelled by extradition, petitioner's claim is nevertheless effectively reviewable on appeal from final judgment, and thus is not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.  Unlike the qualified immunity claim 
Page 486 U. S. 518
 considered in Mitchell, supra, the ""essence"" of petitioner's claim of immunity under the principle of specialty is not a right not to stand trial, which would be irretrievably lost absent an immediate appeal.  The principle of specialty operates to ensure that the receiving state does not abuse the extraditing state's extradition processes, and the conduct of a civil trial does not significantly implicate the reviewing state's obligation in that regard, since the state does not bring its coercive power to bear in such circumstances, but simply provides a forum for the resolution of a private dispute.  Moreover, the defense of a civil suit does not significantly restrict a defendant's liberty, since he cannot be subjected to pretrial detention or required to post bail, and is not even compelled to be present at trial.  Furthermore, a right not to stand trial is not entailed in the mere assertion that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction because of immunity from service of process.  The right involved in this challenge must be characterized as the right not to be subject to a binding judgment, which may be effectively vindicated following final judgment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 522-527.
(b) The order denying the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds does not fall within the collateral order doctrine, since the convenience-of-the-forum question is not completely separate from the merits of the action.  Although the determination of that question may not require significant inquiry into the facts and legal issues in some cases, in the main, a district court ruling on such a motion will generally become entangled in the merits of the case in assessing such questions as the relative ease of access to the sources of proof, the availability of witnesses, and the actual locus of the alleged culpable conduct.  Thus, such determinations are unsuited for immediate appeal as of right under  1291.  This conclusion is fortified by the availability of interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C.  1292(b) offorum non conveniens determinations in appropriate cases.  Pp.  486 U. S. 527-530.

Syllabus 
A provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) excepts from statutory liability any claim
""based upon [a federal agency's or employee's] exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.""
Upon contracting a severe case of polio after ingesting a dose of Orimune, an oral polio vaccine manufactured by Lederle Laboratories, petitioner Kevan Berkovitz, a minor, joined by his parents (also petitioners) as guardians, filed an FTCA suit alleging violations of federal law and policy by the National Institutes of Health's Division of Biologic Standards (DBS) in licensing Lederle to produce Orimune, and by the Bureau of Biologics of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in approving the release to the public of the particular lot of vaccine containing Berkovitz's dose.  The District Court denied the Government's motion to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Although rejecting the Government's argument that the discretionary function exception bars all claims arising out of federal agencies' regulatory activities, the court held that the licensing and release of polio vaccines are wholly discretionary actions protected by the exception.
Held:
1. The language, purpose, and legislative history of the discretionary function exception, as well as its interpretation in this Court's decisions, establish that the exception does not preclude liability for any and all acts arising out of federal agencies' regulatory programs, but insulates from liability only those governmental actions and decisions that involve an element of judgment or choice and that are based on public policy considerations.  Pp.  486 U. S. 535-539.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the discretionary function exception bars petitioners' claims.  Pp.  486 U. S. 539-548.
(a) Statutory and regulatory provisions require the DBS, prior to issuing a license for a product such as Orimune, to receive all data which the manufacturer is required to submit, to examine the product, and to make a determination that it complies with safety standards.  Thus, a cause of action based on petitioner's allegation that the DBS licensed Orimune without first receiving the required safety data is not barred by the discretionary function exception, since the DBS has no discretion to 
Page 486 U. S. 532
 issue a license under such circumstances, and doing so would violate a specific statutory and regulatory directive.  Petitioners' other claim -- that the DBS licensed Orimune even though the vaccine did not comply with certain regulatory safety standards -- if interpreted to mean that the DBS issued the license without determining compliance with the standards or after determining a failure to comply, also is not barred by the discretionary function exception, since the claim charges the agency with failing to act in accordance with specific mandatory directives, as to which the DBS has no discretion.  However, if this claim is interpreted to mean that the DBS made an incorrect compliance determination, the question of the discretionary function exception's applicability turns on whether the DBS officials making that determination permissibly exercise policy choice, a point that is not clear from the record and therefore must be decided by the District Court if petitioners choose to press this interpretation.  Pp.  486 U. S. 540-545.
(b) Although the regulatory scheme governing the public release of vaccine lots allows the FDA to determine the appropriate manner in which to regulate, petitioners have alleged that, under the authority granted by the regulations, the FDA has adopted a policy of testing all lots for compliance with safety standards and of preventing the public distribution of any lot that fails to comply, and that, notwithstanding this mandatory policy, the FDA knowingly approved the release of the unsafe lot in question.  Accepting these allegations as true, as is necessary in reviewing a dismissal, the holding that the discretionary function exception barred petitioners' claim was improper, since the acts complained of do not involve the permissible exercise of discretion to release a noncomplying lot on the basis of policy considerations.  Pp.  486 U. S. 545-548.
822 F.2d 1322, reversed and remanded.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was discharged from his position with the United States Postal Service.  Contending that his discharge resulted from sex discrimination, petitioner brought this suit against the Postmaster General in Federal District Court pursuant to  717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court found for petitioner and ordered his reinstatement with backpay, but refused to award prejudgment interest.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of prejudgment interest.  Relying in part on Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, which held that sovereign immunity barred the payment of interest on attorney's fees awarded against the Library of Congress under Title VII, the court concluded that Congress had not waived the Postal Service's sovereign immunity as to prejudgment interest in a Title VII suit, even though Congress had provided in the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C.  401(1), that the Postal Service may ""sue and be sued.""
Held:  Prejudgment interest may be awarded in a suit against the Postal Service brought under Title VII.  Pp.  486 U. S. 554-565.
(a) By launching the Service into the commercial world and including a sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act, Congress removed the Service's cloak of sovereignty and gave it the status of a private commercial enterprise.  The clause must be liberally construed, and the Service's liability must be presumed to be the same as that of any other business.  Thus, Congress is presumed to have waived any otherwise existing immunity of the Service from interest awards.  None of the exceptions to the liberal construction rule operate to overcome this presumption.  Franchise Tax Board of California v. USPS, 467 U. S. 512.  Pp.  486 U. S. 554-557.
(b) Since Title VII authorizes interest awards as a normal incident of suits against private parties, and since Congress, by enacting the sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act, has waived the Service's immunity from such awards, respondent may be subjected to an interest award in this case.  Pp.  486 U. S. 557-558.
(c) There is no merit to respondent's contention that the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the sue-and-be-sued clause has no force in this case.  The history of the Postal Reorganization Act, with its emphasis 
Page 486 U. S. 550
 on the availability of strong remedies for discrimination in the federal employment context, makes clear that Congress' failure to extend Title VII protections to Postal Service employees did not reflect an intent to circumscribe the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the sue-and-be-sued clause, but, rather, was a determination that a Title VII cause of action was unnecessary in light of such alternative remedies.  Nor is the sue-and-be-sued clause irrelevant merely because, when Congress extended a Title VII cause of action to federal employees in 1972, it included special procedures and limitations applicable only in actions against federal defendants.  Neither the language of  717 nor its legislative history indicates that the waiver of sovereign immunity it effected was intended to narrow the waiver of sovereign immunity of entities subject to sue-and-be-sued clauses.  Pp.  486 U. S. 560-562.
(d) Nor is there merit to respondent's contention that the statute that provides petitioner with his cause of action,  717 of Title VII, does not authorize interest awards.  Congress expressly incorporated in  717 provisions of Title VII that allow an interest award, and a  717 suit, once commenced, is delineated by the same provisions as a suit against a private employer, who is liable for prejudgment interest in a Title VII suit.  Library of Congress v. Shaw, supra, is not to the contrary.  That case started from the rule that, absent express consent by Congress, the Government is immune from interest awards, and found that Title VII did not waive the Library of Congress' immunity from interest.  However, the Library of Congress, unlike the Postal Service, was not a sue-and-be-sued agency that Congress had launched into the commercial world, and thereby broadly waived the agency's sovereign immunity.  Pp.  486 U. S. 563-565.

Observing the approach of a police car on routine patrol, respondent began to run.  The police followed him ""to see where he was going,"" and, after catching up with him and driving alongside him for a short distance, observed him discarding a number of packets.  Surmising that the pills subsequently discovered in the packets contained codeine, the police arrested him and, after a search of his person revealed other drugs and a hypodermic needle, charged him with possession of controlled substances in violation of Michigan law.  At a preliminary hearing, a Magistrate dismissed the charges on the ground that respondent had been unlawfully seized during the police pursuit preceding his disposal of the packets.  The trial court upheld the dismissal, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed.  Applying state precedents interpreting the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the latter court ruled that any ""investigatory pursuit"" amounts to a seizure under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, since the defendant's freedom is restricted as soon as the officers begin their pursuit.  The court also concluded that respondent's flight from the police was insufficient, by itself, to give rise to the particularized suspicion necessary to justify this kind of seizure.
Held:  The officers' pursuit of respondent did not constitute a ""seizure"" implicating Fourth Amendment protections.  Thus, the charges against him were improperly dismissed.  Pp.  486 U. S. 572-576.
(a) No bright-line rule applicable to all investigatory pursuits can be fashioned.  Rather, the appropriate test is whether a reasonable man, viewing the particular police conduct as a whole and within the setting of all of the surrounding circumstances, would have concluded that the police had in some way restrained his liberty so that he was not free to leave.  Pp.  486 U. S. 572-574.
(b) Under this test, respondent was not ""seized"" before he discarded the drug packets.  One officer's characterization of the police conduct as a ""chase,"" standing alone, is insufficient to implicate the Fourth Amendment, since the police conduct -- which consisted of a brief acceleration to catch up with respondent, followed by a short drive alongside him -- would not have communicated to the reasonable person an attempt to capture him or otherwise intrude on his freedom of movement.  The record does not reflect that the police activated a siren or flashers; commanded respondent to halt or displayed any weapons; or operated the

 car aggressively to block his course or to control his direction or speed.  Thus, the police conduct was not so intimidating that respondent could reasonably have believed that he was not free to disregard the police presence and go about his business.

No. 87-5468
Argued April 25, 1988
Decided June 13, 1988
486 U.S. 578

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in a Mississippi court of murder.  Finding the existence of three aggravating circumstances and that such circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced petitioner to death.  The sole evidence supporting one of the aggravating circumstances -- that petitioner had been ""previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to [another] person"" -- consisted of an authenticated copy of his commitment to prison in 1963 following his New York conviction of second-degree assault with intent to commit first-degree rape.  The prosecutor repeatedly referred to the commitment document at the sentencing hearing.  After the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's death sentence, the New York Court of Appeals reversed the 1963 conviction.  However, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied petitioner's motion for postconviction relief from the death sentence, arguing, inter alia, that (1) petitioner had waived his right to challenge the New York conviction by not raising the point on direct appeal of his death sentence; (2) Mississippi's capital sentencing procedures could be rendered capricious and standardless if the post-sentencing decision of another State could invalidate a Mississippi death sentence; and (3) the New York conviction provided adequate support for the death penalty even if it was invalid, since petitioner had served time on the conviction.
Held:  By allowing petitioner's death sentence to stand despite the fact that it was based in part on the vacated New York conviction, the Mississippi Supreme Court violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 584-590.
(a) The New York conviction did not provide any legitimate support for petitioner's sentence.  Its reversal deprives the prosecutor's sole piece of evidence as to the aggravating circumstance of any relevance to the sentencing decision.  The fact that petitioner served time in prison pursuant to an invalid conviction does not make the conviction itself relevant, or prove that petitioner was guilty of the crime.  Furthermore, use of the New York conviction in the sentencing hearing was clearly prejudicial, since the prosecutor repeatedly urged the jury to give it 
Page 486 U. S. 579
 weight in connection with its assigned task of balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances ""one against the other.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 585-586.
(b) The state court's concern that its vacatur of the death sentence here would render its capital sentencing procedures capricious is unfounded.  That court has itself held that the reversal of a Kentucky conviction supporting an enhanced sentence under Mississippi's habitual criminal statute justified postconviction relief.  Phillips v. State, 421 So.2d 476.  A rule that regularly gives a defendant the benefit of such relief is not even arguably arbitrary or capricious and, in fact, reduces the risk that a capital sentence will be imposed arbitrarily.  Pp.  486 U. S. 586-587.
(c) The state court's conclusion that petitioner's failure to raise his claim on direct appeal constitutes a procedural bar under state law does not prevent this Court from considering the claim.  Under federal law, such a bar can constitute an adequate and independent state ground for affirming a sentence only if it has been consistently or regularly applied.  The bar raised here has not been so applied in Mississippi.  In Phillips v. State, supra, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that collateral attack, rather than direct appeal, was the appropriate means of challenging a prior conviction used to enhance a habitual offender's sentence, and the Mississippi Supreme Court recently has applied that reasoning to facts substantially similar to those presented in this case.  See Nixon v. State, 533 So.2d 1078.  Pp.  486 U. S. 587-589.
(d) The State's argument that the decision below should be affirmed because the state court did not mention the New York conviction when it conducted its proportionality review of the death sentence on direct appeal is without merit, since the fact that the sentence might be consistent with Mississippi law, even absent evidence of the New York conviction, is not determinative here.  The error here extended beyond the mere invalidation of an aggravating circumstance supported by otherwise admissible evidence, since the jury was allowed to consider evidence that has been revealed to be materially inaccurate.  Moreover, the state court's express refusal to rely on harmless error analysis in upholding petitioner's sentence was plainly justified on the facts of this case.  Pp.  486 U. S. 589-590.

			"|"Johnson v. Mississippi
No. 87-5468
Argued April 25, 1988
Decided June 13, 1988
486 U.S. 578

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in a Mississippi court of murder.  Finding the existence of three aggravating circumstances and that such circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced petitioner to death.  The sole evidence supporting one of the aggravating circumstances -- that petitioner had been ""previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to [another] person"" -- consisted of an authenticated copy of his commitment to prison in 1963 following his New York conviction of second-degree assault with intent to commit first-degree rape.  The prosecutor repeatedly referred to the commitment document at the sentencing hearing.  After the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's death sentence, the New York Court of Appeals reversed the 1963 conviction.  However, the Mississippi Supreme Court denied petitioner's motion for postconviction relief from the death sentence, arguing, inter alia, that (1) petitioner had waived his right to challenge the New York conviction by not raising the point on direct appeal of his death sentence; (2) Mississippi's capital sentencing procedures could be rendered capricious and standardless if the post-sentencing decision of another State could invalidate a Mississippi death sentence; and (3) the New York conviction provided adequate support for the death penalty even if it was invalid, since petitioner had served time on the conviction.
Held:  By allowing petitioner's death sentence to stand despite the fact that it was based in part on the vacated New York conviction, the Mississippi Supreme Court violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 584-590.
(a) The New York conviction did not provide any legitimate support for petitioner's sentence.  Its reversal deprives the prosecutor's sole piece of evidence as to the aggravating circumstance of any relevance to the sentencing decision.  The fact that petitioner served time in prison pursuant to an invalid conviction does not make the conviction itself relevant, or prove that petitioner was guilty of the crime.  Furthermore, use of the New York conviction in the sentencing hearing was clearly prejudicial, since the prosecutor repeatedly urged the jury to give it 
Page 486 U. S. 579
 weight in connection with its assigned task of balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances ""one against the other.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 585-586.
(b) The state court's concern that its vacatur of the death sentence here would render its capital sentencing procedures capricious is unfounded.  That court has itself held that the reversal of a Kentucky conviction supporting an enhanced sentence under Mississippi's habitual criminal statute justified postconviction relief.  Phillips v. State, 421 So.2d 476.  A rule that regularly gives a defendant the benefit of such relief is not even arguably arbitrary or capricious and, in fact, reduces the risk that a capital sentence will be imposed arbitrarily.  Pp.  486 U. S. 586-587.
(c) The state court's conclusion that petitioner's failure to raise his claim on direct appeal constitutes a procedural bar under state law does not prevent this Court from considering the claim.  Under federal law, such a bar can constitute an adequate and independent state ground for affirming a sentence only if it has been consistently or regularly applied.  The bar raised here has not been so applied in Mississippi.  In Phillips v. State, supra, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that collateral attack, rather than direct appeal, was the appropriate means of challenging a prior conviction used to enhance a habitual offender's sentence, and the Mississippi Supreme Court recently has applied that reasoning to facts substantially similar to those presented in this case.

No. 86-1743
Argued February 22, 1988
Decided June 6, 1988
486 U.S. 330

Syllabus 
Appellee suffered a permanent back injury while working as a brakeman and conductor for appellant railroad.  After returning to work in a less physically demanding position, appellee brought an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) in a Pennsylvania state court, alleging that his injury was attributable to appellant's negligence and that his future earning power had been impaired as a result of his injury.  The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that any damages award for loss of future earnings should be reduced to present value, but instead informed the jury that the law (apparently referring to Pennsylvania case law) ""now provides that there need not be such a reduction.""  After the jury found for appellee and awarded damages, the trial judge assessed an additional amount as prejudgment interest pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 238, which requires state courts in personal injury actions to add to compensatory damages 10 percent per year, as ""damages for delay,"" from the date the complaint was filed or from the date one year after the cause of action accrued, whichever was later, to the date of the verdict.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also affirmed, characterizing Rule 238 as a mere ""rule of procedure,"" and holding that it was not inconsistent with FELA.  It also held that whether the trial judge properly refused to instruct the jury to discount future damages to present value and instead applied the ""total offset"" method, under which future inflation is presumed equal to future interest rates, was a question of federal law, and that the judge's use of the total offset rule was not inconsistent with St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. Dickerson, 470 U. S. 409.
Held:
1. State courts may not award prejudgment interest pursuant to local practice in FELA actions.  Pp.  486 U. S. 334-339.
(a) The proper measure of damages under FELA -- including the question whether prejudgment interest may be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff -- is inseparably connected with the right of action, and therefore is an issue of substance that must be settled according to federal law, rather than state law.  The Pennsylvania courts cannot avoid the application of federal law by characterizing Rule 238 as nothing more than a 
Page 486 U. S. 331
 procedural device to encourage settlements and relieve court congestion.  Pp.  486 U. S. 335-336.
(b) Federal law does not authorize awards of prejudgment interest in FELA actions.  Although neither FELA nor the general federal interest statute, 28 U.S.C.  1961, mentions prejudgment interest, when Congress enacted FELA in 1908, the common law did not allow prejudgment interest in suits for personal injury or wrongful death, and that was the rule in the federal courts.  In enacting FELA, Congress expressly dispensed with other common law doctrines of that era, and there is no indication that Congress intended to abrogate the doctrine barring prejudgment interest sub silentio.  Moreover, the lower federal courts and the state courts have held with virtual unanimity that prejudgment interest is not available under FELA.  Congress' failure to disturb such a longstanding, consistent judicial interpretation of a statute indicates that Congress at least acquiesces in, and apparently affirms, that interpretation.  Pp.  486 U. S. 336-339.
2. The trial court did not act consistently with federal law in instructing the jury not to discount appellee's future lost earnings to present value.  St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. Dickerson, supra.  The jury has the task of making the present value determination in FELA cases, but it is permissible for the judge to recommend to the jury one or more methods of calculating present value so long as the judge does not, in effect, preempt the jury's function.  In the present case, however, the trial judge instructed the jury that a zero discount rate was to be applied as a matter of law to appellee's future damages.  The instruction improperly took from the jury the essentially factual question of the appropriate rate at which to discount appellee's FELA award to present value.  Pp.  486 U. S. 339-342.

Syllabus 
Respondent, a disgruntled ex-employee of a married couple, entered the couple's home, shot the wife twice with a shotgun, shot and killed the husband, and then slit the wife's throat and stabbed her twice.  Respondent was tried in an Oklahoma court and found guilty of the first-degree murder of the husband.  The jury imposed the death penalty upon finding that two statutory aggravating circumstances, including the circumstance that the murder was ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,"" had been established, and that these circumstances outweighed the mitigating evidence.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal, and later affirmed a denial of state collateral relief.  The Federal District Court then denied respondent's habeas corpus petition, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statutory words ""heinous,"" ""atrocious,"" and ""cruel"" do not on their face offer sufficient guidance to the jury to escape the strictures of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  The court also ruled that the Oklahoma courts had not adopted a limiting construction that cured the infirmity, concluding that the construction utilized by the state appellate court, which simply declared that the facts of the case were so plainly ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" that the death penalty was warranted, was itself unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  The court therefore enjoined the execution of the death sentence, but without prejudice to further state proceedings for redetermination of the sentence.
Held:  As applied in this case, the statutory aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague.  Pp.  486 U. S. 360-366.
(a) The State's contention that factual circumstances may, in themselves, plainly characterize the killing as ""especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel"" represents an improper Due Process Clause approach to vagueness that fails to recognize the rationale of this Court's Eighth Amendment cases.  Under Furman, supra, and its progeny, the proper analysis of a vagueness claim focuses on whether the challenged aggravating circumstance adequately informs the jury as to what it must find in order to impose the death penalty, or whether it leaves the jury with unchanneled discretion to make an arbitrary and capricious decision.  Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, which applied that analysis, 
Page 486 U. S. 357
 controls this case.  The language of the Oklahoma provision gave no more guidance to the jury here than did the ""outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman"" language that was held unconstitutional in Godfrey.  Moreover, Oklahoma's addition of the word ""especially"" no more limited the overbreadth of the aggravating factor than did the addition of ""outrageously or wantonly"" to the word ""vile"" in the language considered in Godfrey.  Furthermore, the state appellate court's factual approach to construction was indistinguishable from the action of the Georgia court in Godfrey, which failed to cure the jury's unfettered discretion and to satisfy the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 360-364.
(b) The State's complaint that the Court of Appeals erroneously ruled that torture or serious physical abuse is the only constitutionally acceptable limiting construction of the aggravating circumstance is unfounded, since, although the court noted cases in which such a requirement was held to be curative, it expressly refrained from directing the State to adopt any particular construction.  The contention that the death penalty should stand because the jury found another, unchallenged aggravating circumstance sufficient to sustain the sentence is also unpersuasive, since, when this case was decided, Oklahoma had no procedure for attempting to save a death penalty when one of several aggravating circumstances found by the jury was held to be invalid or unsupported by evidence, but simply vacated the death sentence and automatically imposed a life imprisonment sentence.  The significance for this case of the state appellate court's decisions, which were issued after the Court of Appeals' decision below, to adopt a torture-or-serious-physical-abuse limiting construction of the aggravating circumstance, and to no longer automatically set aside a death penalty where one of several aggravating circumstances is invalid or inapplicable, must be decided in the first instance by the Oklahoma courts in any further proceedings for redetermination of the appropriate sentence.

|486 u.s. 367|"Mills v. Maryland
No. 87-5367
Argued March 30, 1988
Decided June 6, 1988
486 U.S. 367

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Maryland prison inmate, was tried by a state court jury and convicted of the first-degree murder of his cellmate.  In the trial's sentencing phase, the same jury found that the State had established the statutory aggravating factor that petitioner committed the murder while he was confined in a correctional institution, and marked ""no"" beside each mitigating circumstance referenced on the verdict form, thereby requiring the imposition of the death penalty under Maryland's capital sentencing scheme.  Petitioner challenged the sentence on the ground that the Maryland capital punishment statute, as applied to him, was unconstitutionally mandatory.  He asserted that the statute, as explained to the jury by the court's instructions and as implemented by the verdict form, required imposition of the death sentence if the jury unanimously found an aggravating circumstance, but could not agree unanimously as to the existence of any particular mitigating circumstance; thus, even if some or all of the jurors were to believe that some mitigating circumstance or circumstances were present, unless they could unanimously agree on the existence of the same mitigating factor, the sentence necessarily would be death.  The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that the death sentence was constitutionally sound, interpreting the statute's unanimity requirement as applying to jury determinations of all critical issues, including the acceptance or rejection of mitigating circumstances.  The court observed that the verdict form was to be regarded as requiring the jury to agree unanimously in order to mark ""no"" with respect to the existence of each mitigating circumstance, and that the trial judge's instructions stressed the need for unanimity on all issues presented.  The court concluded that, when a jury could not agree unanimously to accept or reject a particular mitigating circumstance, the answer to that circumstance on the verdict form should be left blank and the jury should proceed to the balancing phase, where each juror should weigh the mitigating circumstances he or she found to be established and balance them against the aggravating circumstances unanimously found.
Held:
1. In a capital case, the sentencer may not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any relevant circumstance, including any aspect of the defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence 
Page 486 U. S. 368
 less than death.  Under Maryland's statute, if the sentencer finds that any mitigating circumstances have been proved to exist, it then proceeds to decide whether those circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances.  But if petitioner is correct, a jury that does not unanimously agree on the existence of any single mitigating circumstance may not give mitigating evidence any effect whatsoever, and must impose the death sentence.  If that interpretation is correct, the case must be remanded for resentencing.  Pp.  486 U. S. 373-375.
2. There is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors, upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case, and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular mitigating circumstance.  Because the jury could have understood that it should mark ""no"" on the verdict form when it failed to agree unanimously that a mitigating circumstance existed, some jurors might have been prevented from considering factors which might call for a less severe penalty, and petitioner's death sentence cannot stand.  Pp.  486 U. S. 375-384.
(a) With respect to findings of guilt, a jury's verdict must be set aside if it can be supported on one ground but not on another, and the reviewing court is uncertain which of the two grounds was relied upon by the jury in reaching the verdict.  Review of death sentences demands even greater certainty that the jury's conclusions rested on proper grounds.  Pp.  486 U. S. 375-377.
(b) While the Court of Appeals' construction of the jury instructions and verdict form is plausible, it cannot be concluded, with any degree of certainty, that the jury did not adopt petitioner's interpretation instead.  Nothing in the verdict form or the judge's instructions even arguably is construable as suggesting that the jury could leave an answer blank and proceed to the next step in its deliberations.  A jury following the instructions set out in the verdict form could be precluded from considering mitigating evidence if only a single juror adhered to the view that such evidence should not be so considered.  Pp.  486 U. S. 377-380.
(c) There is no extrinsic evidence of what the jury in this case actually thought, but the portions of the record relating to the verdict form and the judge's instructions indicate that there is at least a substantial risk that the jury was misinformed.  Moreover, since the time when this case was decided below, the Court of Appeals has promulgated a new verdict form expressly covering the situation where there is a lack of unanimity as to the existence or nonexistence of a particular mitigating factor, and providing for the consideration of all mitigating evidence in determining the sentence.  This shows at least some concern on that court's part that juries could misunderstand the previous instructions as 
Page 486 U. S. 369
 to unanimity and the consideration of mitigating evidence by individual jurors.  Pp.  486 U. S. 380-384.

			"|"Mills v. Maryland
No. 87-5367
Argued March 30, 1988
Decided June 6, 1988
486 U.S. 367

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a Maryland prison inmate, was tried by a state court jury and convicted of the first-degree murder of his cellmate.  In the trial's sentencing phase, the same jury found that the State had established the statutory aggravating factor that petitioner committed the murder while he was confined in a correctional institution, and marked ""no"" beside each mitigating circumstance referenced on the verdict form, thereby requiring the imposition of the death penalty under Maryland's capital sentencing scheme.  Petitioner challenged the sentence on the ground that the Maryland capital punishment statute, as applied to him, was unconstitutionally mandatory.  He asserted that the statute, as explained to the jury by the court's instructions and as implemented by the verdict form, required imposition of the death sentence if the jury unanimously found an aggravating circumstance, but could not agree unanimously as to the existence of any particular mitigating circumstance; thus, even if some or all of the jurors were to believe that some mitigating circumstance or circumstances were present, unless they could unanimously agree on the existence of the same mitigating factor, the sentence necessarily would be death.  The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that the death sentence was constitutionally sound, interpreting the statute's unanimity requirement as applying to jury determinations of all critical issues, including the acceptance or rejection of mitigating circumstances.  The court observed that the verdict form was to be regarded as requiring the jury to agree unanimously in order to mark ""no"" with respect to the existence of each mitigating circumstance, and that the trial judge's instructions stressed the need for unanimity on all issues presented.  The court concluded that, when a jury could not agree unanimously to accept or reject a particular mitigating circumstance, the answer to that circumstance on the verdict form should be left blank and the jury should proceed to the balancing phase, where each juror should weigh the mitigating circumstances he or she found to be established and balance them against the aggravating circumstances unanimously found.
Held:
1. In a capital case, the sentencer may not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any relevant circumstance, including any aspect of the defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence 
Page 486 U. S. 368
 less than death.  Under Maryland's statute, if the sentencer finds that any mitigating circumstances have been proved to exist, it then proceeds to decide whether those circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances.  But if petitioner is correct, a jury that does not unanimously agree on the existence of any single mitigating circumstance may not give mitigating evidence any effect whatsoever, and must impose the death sentence.  If that interpretation is correct, the case must be remanded for resentencing.  Pp.  486 U. S. 373-375.
2. There is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors, upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case, and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular mitigating circumstance.  Because the jury could have understood that it should mark ""no"" on the verdict form when it failed to agree unanimously that a mitigating circumstance existed, some jurors might have been prevented from considering factors which might call for a less severe penalty, and petitioner's death sentence cannot stand.  Pp.  486 U. S. 375-384.
(a) With respect to findings of guilt, a jury's verdict must be set aside if it can be supported on one ground but not on another, and the reviewing court is uncertain which of the two grounds was relied upon by the jury in reaching the verdict.  Review of death sentences demands even greater certainty that the jury's conclusions rested on proper grounds.  Pp.  486 U. S. 375-377.
(b) While the Court of Appeals' construction of the jury instructions and verdict form is plausible, it cannot be concluded, with any degree of certainty, that the jury did not adopt petitioner's interpretation instead.  Nothing in the verdict form or the judge's instructions even arguably is construable as suggesting that the jury could leave an answer blank and proceed to the next step in its deliberations.  A jury following the instructions set out in the verdict form could be precluded from considering mitigating evidence if only a single juror adhered to the view that such evidence should not be so considered.  Pp.  486 U. S. 377-380.
(c) There is no extrinsic evidence of what the jury in this case actually thought, but the portions of the record relating to the verdict form and the judge's instructions indicate that there is at least a substantial risk that the jury was misinformed.  Moreover, since the time when this case was decided below, the Court of Appeals has promulgated a new verdict form expressly covering the situation where there is a lack of unanimity as to the existence or nonexistence of a particular mitigating factor, and providing for the consideration of all mitigating evidence in determining the sentence.  This shows at least some concern on that court's part that juries could misunderstand the previous instructions as 
Page 486 U. S. 369
 to unanimity and the consideration of mitigating evidence by individual jurors.  Pp.  486 U. S. 380-384.

After petitioner notified her employer (respondent) that she had been injured in the course of her employment and requested compensation for her medical expenses pursuant to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act, she was discharged for filing an allegedly false worker's compensation claim.  The union representing petitioner filed a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that protected employees from discharge except for ""just"" cause and that provided for arbitration of disputes between the employer and any employee concerning the effect or interpretation of the agreement.  While arbitration was proceeding, petitioner filed a retaliatory discharge action in an Illinois state court, alleging that she had been discharged for exercising her rights under the Illinois worker's compensation laws.  Respondent removed the suit to the Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, and filed a motion to dismiss the case as preempted by  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.  The court dismissed the complaint as preempted, concluding that the retaliatory discharge claim was ""inextricably intertwined"" with the collective bargaining provision prohibiting discharge without just cause, and that allowing the state law action to proceed would undermine the arbitration procedures in the collective bargaining contract.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Application of petitioner's state tort remedy was not preempted by  301.  An application of state law is preempted by  301 only if such application requires the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  486 U. S. 403-413.
(a) If the resolution of a state law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement, the application of state law (which might lead to inconsistent results, since there could be as many state law principles as there are States) is preempted and federal labor law principles -- necessarily uniform throughout the Nation -- must be employed to resolve the dispute.

(b) Under Illinois law governing the tort of retaliatory discharge for filing a worker's compensation claim, the employee must show both that he was discharged or threatened with discharge and that the employer's motive was to deter the employee from exercising rights under the 
Page 486 U. S. 400
 Workers' Compensation Act or to interfere with the exercise of those rights.  Neither of those elements requires a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement.  Similarly, the factual inquiry as to whether the employer had a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge does not turn on the meaning of any provision of a collective bargaining agreement.  Although the state law analysis might involve attention to the same factual considerations as the contractual determination of whether petitioner was fired for just cause, such parallelism does not render the state law analysis dependent upon the contractual analysis.  As long as the state law claim can be resolved without interpreting the collective bargaining agreement itself, the claim is ""independent"" of the agreement for  301 preemption purposes.  Pp.  486 U. S. 406-410.
(c) The result in this case is consistent both with the policy of fostering uniform, certain adjudication of disputes over the meaning of collective bargaining agreements and with cases that have permitted separate fonts of substantive rights to remain unpreempted by other federal labor law statutes.  Interpretation of collective bargaining agreements remains firmly in the arbitral realm; judges can determine questions of state law involving labor-management relations only if such questions do not require construing collective bargaining agreements.  There is nothing novel about recognizing that substantive rights in the labor relations context can exist without interpreting collective bargaining agreements.  Pp.  486 U. S. 410-413.

Syllabus 
A Colorado statute allows a proposed state constitutional amendment to be placed on a general election ballot if its proponents can obtain the signatures of at least 5 percent of the total number of qualified voters on an ""initiative petition"" within a 6-month period, but makes it a felony to pay petition circulators.  Concluding that they would need the assistance of paid personnel to obtain the required signatures within the allotted time, appellee proponents of a constitutional amendment that would remove motor carriers from the Colorado Public Utilities Commission's jurisdiction brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against appellant state officials, seeking a declaration that the statutory payment prohibition violated their First Amendment rights.  The District Court upheld the statute, but the Court of Appeals ultimately reversed, holding that the statute violates the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:  The statutory prohibition against the use of paid circulators abridges appellees' right to engage in political speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.  486 U. S. 420-428.
(a) The statute is subject to exacting scrutiny, since the circulation of an initiative petition seeking to deregulate the Colorado trucking industry necessarily constitutes ""core political speech,"" for which First Amendment protection is at its zenith.  The statute burdens such speech in two ways:  First, it limits the number of voices who will convey appellees' message and the hours they can speak and, therefore, limits the size of the audience they can reach.  Second, it makes it less likely that appellees will garner the number of necessary signatures, thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.  The statute's burden on speech is not relieved by the fact that other avenues of expression remain open to appellees, since the use of paid circulators is the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical means of achieving direct, one-on-one communication, and appellees' right to utilize that means is itself protected by the First Amendment.  Nor is the statutory burden rendered acceptable by the State's claimed authority to impose limitations on the scope of the state-created right to legislate by initiative; the power to ban initiatives entirely does not include 
Page 486 U. S. 415
 the power to limit discussion of political issues raised in initiative petitions.  Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, distinguished.  Pp.  486 U. S. 420-425.
(b) The State has failed to sustain its burden of justifying the statutory prohibition.  The argument that justification is found in the State's interest in assuring that an initiative has sufficient grass roots support to be placed on the ballot is not persuasive, since that interest is adequately protected by the requirement that the specified number of signatures be obtained.  Nor does the State's claimed interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process justify the prohibition, because the State has failed to demonstrate the necessity of burdening appellees' ability to communicate in order to meet its concerns.  It cannot be assumed that a professional circulator -- whose qualifications for similar future assignments may well depend on a reputation for competence and integrity -- is any more likely to accept false signatures than a volunteer motivated entirely by an interest in having the proposition placed on the ballot.  Moreover, other statutory provisions dealing expressly with the potential danger of false signatures are adequate to minimize the risk of improper circulation conduct.  Pp.  486 U. S. 425-428.

Syllabus 
Under Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738, if court-appointed appellate counsel wishes to withdraw on the ground that his client's appeal is wholly frivolous, he must include with his withdrawal motion ""a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.""  A Wisconsin Supreme Court rule essentially restates this requirement, but also requires that the brief include ""a discussion of why the issue lacks merit.""  Believing that his client's state court appeal from felony convictions was frivolous, but being unwilling to include in his withdrawal brief the discussion required by the rule, appellant's court-appointed counsel, after an unsuccessful challenge in the state intermediate appellate court, filed an original action in the State Supreme Court challenging the discussion requirement on the grounds that it is inconsistent with Anders and forces counsel to violate his client's Sixth Amendment rights.  The court upheld the requirement.
Held:  The discussion requirement -- as construed by the State Supreme Court to require a brief statement of why particular cases, statutes, or facts in the record lead the attorney to believe that the appeal lacks merit -- is constitutional under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The discussion requirement merely goes one step further than the minimum requirements stated in Anders, and satisfies the same objectives that those requirements serve:  assuring the appellate court that the attorney has protected his indigent client's constitutional rights by diligently and thoroughly searching the record for any arguable claim that might support the appeal, and allowing the court to determine whether counsel's frivolousness conclusion is correct.  Because counsel may discover previously unrecognized aspects of the law in the process of preparing his or her discussion, the discussion requirement provides an additional safeguard against mistaken frivolousness conclusions.  It may forestall some motions to withdraw, and will assist the court in passing on the soundness of counsel's conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.  It is settled that an attorney can advise a court that an appeal is frivolous without impairing his or her client's constitutional rights.  Explaining the basis for the frivolousness conclusion does not burden the rights to effective representation or to due process on appeal any more than does stating the bald conclusion.  The rule does not diminish any right a defendant

Syllabus 
Ten years after her illegitimate daughter's birth, petitioner filed a support complaint on the daughter's behalf in Pennsylvania state court, naming respondent as the father.  Although a blood test showed a 99.3% probability that respondent was the father, the court entered judgment for respondent on the basis of a state statute providing that actions to establish the paternity of an illegitimate child ordinarily must be commenced within six years of the child's birth.  The court rejected petitioner's contentions that the statute violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  While petitioner's appeal to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania was pending, the State adopted an 18-year statute of limitations for paternity actions, in order to comply with a requirement of the federal Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 (federal Act).  The Superior Court concluded, however, that the new 18-year statute of limitations did not apply retroactively, and that the 6-year period would continue to apply in cases like petitioner's.  The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the 6-year statute of limitations was constitutional.
Held:
1. Petitioner's contention that the 6-year statute of limitations is invalid because it conflicts with an asserted retroactivity requirement in the federal Act will not be addressed by this Court, since the question of federal preemption was not adequately presented to the Superior Court by petitioner's state law retroactivity argument, and was not decided by that court.  Pp.  486 U. S. 459-460.
2. The 6-year statute of limitations violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Under the heightened scrutiny analysis used in evaluating equal protection challenges to statutes of limitations that apply to illegitimate children's paternity suits, the period for obtaining support must be sufficiently long to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in illegitimate children to assert claims on their behalf, and any time limitation placed on that opportunity must be substantially related to the State's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.  Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U. S. 91; Pickett v. Brown, 462 U. S. 1.  Under this analysis, it is questionable whether Pennsylvania's 6-year period is reasonable, since a mother may for years after her child's birth be unwilling to assert a claim due to her relationship with the natural father, the emotional strain of having an illegitimate child, or the 
Page 486 U. S. 457
 desire to avoid community and family disapproval; since such a mother might realize only belatedly a loss of income attributable to the need to care for the child; and since financial difficulties are likely to increase as the child matures and incurs additional expenses.  Moreover, that the 6-year period is not substantially related to an interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims is established by a number of Pennsylvania statutes, including the 18-year statute of limitations, that permit paternity to be litigated more than six years after an illegitimate child's birth; and by the fact that increasingly sophisticated scientific tests facilitate the establishing of paternity regardless of the child's age.  Pp.  486 U. S. 460-465.

No. 87-5565
Argued April 19, 1988
Decided June 6, 1988
486 U.S. 456

Syllabus 
Ten years after her illegitimate daughter's birth, petitioner filed a support complaint on the daughter's behalf in Pennsylvania state court, naming respondent as the father.  Although a blood test showed a 99.3% probability that respondent was the father, the court entered judgment for respondent on the basis of a state statute providing that actions to establish the paternity of an illegitimate child ordinarily must be commenced within six years of the child's birth.  The court rejected petitioner's contentions that the statute violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  While petitioner's appeal to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania was pending, the State adopted an 18-year statute of limitations for paternity actions, in order to comply with a requirement of the federal Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 (federal Act).  The Superior Court concluded, however, that the new 18-year statute of limitations did not apply retroactively, and that the 6-year period would continue to apply in cases like petitioner's.  The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the 6-year statute of limitations was constitutional.
Held:
1. Petitioner's contention that the 6-year statute of limitations is invalid because it conflicts with an asserted retroactivity requirement in the federal Act will not be addressed by this Court, since the question of federal preemption was not adequately presented to the Superior Court by petitioner's state law retroactivity argument, and was not decided by that court.  Pp.  486 U. S. 459-460.
2. The 6-year statute of limitations violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Under the heightened scrutiny analysis used in evaluating equal protection challenges to statutes of limitations that apply to illegitimate children's paternity suits, the period for obtaining support must be sufficiently long to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in illegitimate children to assert claims on their behalf, and any time limitation placed on that opportunity must be substantially related to the State's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.  Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U. S. 91; Pickett v. Brown, 462 U. S. 1.  Under this analysis, it is questionable whether Pennsylvania's 6-year period is reasonable, since a mother may for years after her child's birth be unwilling to assert a claim due to her relationship with the natural father, the emotional strain of having an illegitimate child, or the 
Page 486 U. S. 457
 desire to avoid community and family disapproval; since such a mother might realize only belatedly a loss of income attributable to the need to care for the child; and since financial difficulties are likely to increase as the child matures and incurs additional expenses.  Moreover, that the 6-year period is not substantially related to an interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims is established by a number of Pennsylvania statutes, including the 18-year statute of limitations, that permit paternity to be litigated more than six years after an illegitimate child's birth; and by the fact that increasingly sophisticated scientific tests facilitate the establishing of paternity regardless of the child's age.  Pp.  486 U. S. 460-465.

 Chief Justice REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice. 
 Samuel Loring Morison was convicted in the District Court of two counts each of espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 793(d), (e), and theft of Government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 641. His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 844 F.2d 1057 (1988), and he now asks that he be allowed to remain free on bond pending the consideration of his yet-to-be- filed petition for writ of certiorari. The statutory standard for determining whether a convicted defendant is entitled to be released pending a certiorari petition is clearly set out in 18 U.S.C. 3143(b)( 1982 ed., Supp. IV), and the only real issue in this application is whether Morison's appeal ""raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal, an order for a new trial, or a sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment."" I agree with the courts below, however, that regardless of whether Morison has raised a ""substantial question"" with respect to the propriety of his conviction under the Espionage Act, he has not done so with respect to his conviction for theft of Government property under 641.

No. 87-363
Argued March 28, 1988

486 U.S. 204

Syllabus 
To cover the situation of overlapping provisions of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 fixing price ceilings for sales of various categories of natural gas and providing for phased deregulation,  101(b)(5) of the Act states that, if any natural gas qualifies under more than one provision providing for any maximum lawful price or for any exemption from such a price with respect to certain sales of gas, ""the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable.""  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) promulgated a regulation interpreting  101(b)(5) (and  121, which relates to phased deregulation) to mean that any gas that is qualified for both deregulated and regulated treatment would be treated as deregulated.  The regulation adversely affected gas producers who had entered into long-term contracts that had one clause setting the price (near the price ceiling) if the gas were regulated and another clause setting the price (on the basis of market price, or calling for renegotiation) if the gas were deregulated.  Because the market price of natural gas had plunged below the regulated price ceilings, such producers stood to reap higher contractual prices if their gas was regulated than if it was deregulated.  Numerous producers petitioned for review of FERC's regulation.  The Court of Appeals rejected FERC's interpretation and adopted the producers' position that  101(b)(5) unambiguously requires the applicable category to be that which, at any particular moment, garners the producer the highest contract price for its gas.  In explaining this holding, the Court of Appeals also rejected FERC's ruling that certain ""new tight formation gas"" subject to regulation under  107(c)(5) is automatically qualified for deregulation as new gas under  102(c) or 103.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in rejecting FERC's interpretation of  101(b)(5).  The statute's plain meaning governs.  It provides for the applicability of the overlapping provision that ""could"" result in the highest 
Page 486 U. S. 205
 price, not that provision which ""will"" (depending on actual contracts and daily market prices) result in the highest price for each producer.  Section 101(b)(5)'s words call for a simple comparison between the highest price permitted by one provision and the highest price permitted by another:  the higher the price ceiling, the higher the price that ""could"" result under the provision.  When one of the provisions sets no price ceiling at all -- i.e., it deregulates -- that provision governs.  The court erred in concluding that reading the word ""could"" with its ordinary conditional meaning makes so little sense that it must be converted to the word ""will.""  The statute does not mean to refer to particular contracts, but rather to the generic situation of parties in a precontract state:  the provision that allows the parties to contract to the highest conceivable price applies.  The statute calls for a comparison of statutory provisions, not contractual ones, and nothing in the statute or legislative history suggests that Congress wanted the classification of gas to turn on contractual terms.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals' reading is contrary to the whole thrust of the Act, for it has the effect of turning a statutory scheme of price ceilings and deregulation into a system of price supports for producers.  It also creates a chaotic scheme wherein the applicable provision for a particular type of gas varies depending on the producer, the contract, and the current market price.  Pp.  486 U. S. 209-211.
2. The Court of Appeals also erred in overturning FERC's ruling that certain gas qualified as ""new tight formation gas"" subject to regulation under  107(c)(5) of the Act is automatically qualified as deregulated ""new"" gas under  102(c) or 103.  Section 107(c)(5) gives FERC authority to make eligible, for special high-cost gas pricing, natural gas ""produced under such . . . conditions as [FERC] determines to present extraordinary risks or costs.""  There is nothing objectionable about FERC's ruling, which merely recognizes that certain ""new tight formation gas"" -- which requires the producer to file the same information (in addition to other information) that would be filed to qualify under either  102(c) or  103 -- is a subset of deregulated ""new"" gas under the latter sections.  The Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion was based on its reading of  101(b)(5), rejected above, and its erroneous interpretation of certain portions of the legislative history.  Nor does FERC's rule intrude on the jurisdiction of other state and federal agencies to make category determinations under  503.  FERC has made no category determinations, but has merely promulgated, pursuant to its ample authority, a definitional rule applicable in determination proceedings.  Pp.  486 U. S. 211-213.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted of murder and criminal attempt to commit theft in the Superior Court of Putnam County, Georgia.  In accordance with the jury's recommendation of death, the court imposed the death penalty for the murder charge, and a 10-year sentence for the attempted theft charge.  While petitioner's direct appeal was pending, an independent civil action involving a challenge to voting procedures in Putnam County was brought in Federal District Court, which found that a memorandum from the District Attorney's Office to the Putnam County Jury Commissioners was intentionally designed to result in underrepresentation of black people and women in the master jury lists from which all grand and traverse (petit) juries were drawn.  Bailey v. Vining, Civ. Action No. 76-199 MAC (MD Ga., Aug. 17, 1978).  One of the plaintiffs' attorneys had uncovered the memorandum while researching the case.  The District Court in Bailey concluded that the master lists could not be used for any purpose until the unconstitutional discrimination had been corrected, and ordered the Jury Commissioners to reconstitute the lists in conformity with the Constitution.  Citing Bailey, petitioner's attorneys, on his direct appeal, raised a challenge to the composition of the Putnam County juries that had indicted, convicted, and sentenced petitioner.  Affirming petitioner's convictions and sentences, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected his challenge to the jury on the ground that it came too late.  After exhausting his state remedies, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court on the basis of the jury composition issue, before the same judge who had decided the Bailey case.  Granting the writ and noting the Bailey decision, the court concluded that petitioner had established sufficient cause for his failure to raise in the trial court the jury challenge and sufficient prejudice to excuse the procedural default.  The Court of Appeals found the record insufficiently developed for proper review of the question of cause, and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.  On remand, the District Court held a hearing at which it received testimony from petitioner's trial lawyers, a lawyer who assisted petitioner's lawyers in developing the jury challenge on direct appeal, and the lawyer who discovered the memorandum in the Bailey case.  The judge then reaffirmed his earlier conclusion that petitioner had demonstrated adequate cause to excuse his 
Page 486 U. S. 215
 procedural default.  The Court of Appeals reversed, stating that it ""disagreed"" with the District Court's conclusion that the racial disparity on the jury lists was concealed by county officials.  The Court of Appeals found instead that the memorandum was readily discoverable in the public records, and that the lawyers had made a considered tactical decision not to mount a jury challenge.  In light of its findings, the court concluded that petitioner had not established cause for his failure to raise the constitutional challenge in accordance with Georgia procedural law.
Held:  The factual findings upon which the District Court based its conclusion that petitioner had established cause for his procedural default were not clearly erroneous, and should not have been set aside by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  486 U. S. 221-229.
(a) Although a ""tactical"" or ""intentional"" decision to forgo a procedural opportunity in state court normally cannot constitute cause, the failure of counsel to raise a constitutional issue reasonably unknown to him is a situation in which the cause requirement is met.  A showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, or that some interference by officials made compliance impracticable, constitutes cause.  The facts found by the District Court here permitted the court's legal conclusion that petitioner had established cause for his procedural default.  If the District Attorney's memorandum was not reasonably discoverable because it was concealed by county officials, and if that concealment, rather than tactical considerations, was the reason for the failure of petitioner's lawyers to raise the jury challenge in the trial court, then petitioner established ample cause to excuse his procedural default.  The Court of Appeals offered factual, rather than legal, grounds for its reversal of the District Court's order, concluding that neither of the two factual predicates for the District Court's legal conclusion was supported by the record.  However, a federal appellate court may set aside a trial court's factfindings only if they are ""clearly erroneous,"" and must give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.  The record viewed in its entirety establishes that the Court of Appeals failed properly to apply the ""clearly erroneous"" standard.  Pp.  486 U. S. 221-223.
(b) The District Court's factual finding that the District Attorney's memorandum was concealed by county officials, and therefore was not reasonably available to petitioner's lawyers, was not clearly erroneous.  Based on the record, the District Court permissibly could have concluded that the memorandum was discovered by mere fortuity, and that it would not have been ""readily discoverable"" had petitioner's trial attorneys investigated the jury lists that were relevant to his trial.  The Court of Appeals identified no evidence in the record -- aside from the 
Page 486 U. S. 216
 fact that the memorandum eventually was discovered -- that contradicted the District Court's conclusions about the concealment and availability of the memorandum.  Pp.  486 U. S. 223-224.
(c) The District Court's conclusion that petitioner's lawyers did not deliberately bypass the jury challenge also was not clearly erroneous.  Although there is significant evidence in the record to support the findings of fact favored by the Court of Appeals, there is also significant evidence to support the District Court's contrary conclusion.  Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.  Here, the District Court reasonably could have concluded that the trial lawyers' statements that they considered but ultimately rejected a jury challenge simply were not credible.  This conclusion was also supported by the directly contradictory testimony of two other witnesses at the habeas corpus hearing and by events contemporaneous with the jury selection process.  The District Court's lack of precision about the bases for its factual conclusions furnishes no excuse to ignore the dictates of the clearly erroneous standard and to engage in impermissible appellate factfinding.

Title 12 U.S.C.  1818(g)(1) authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to suspend from office an indicted official of a federally insured bank if his continued service poses a threat to the interests of the bank's depositors or threatens to impair public confidence in the bank.  Section 1818(g)(3) entitles a suspended official to a hearing before the FDIC within 30 days of his written request, and to a final decision within 60 days of the hearing.  At the hearing, the official may ""submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the agency, oral testimony) and oral argument.""  The FDIC suspended appellee, the president and a director of a federally insured bank, after he was indicted for making false statements to the FDIC and the bank for the purpose of influencing the FDIC in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001 and 1014.  A hearing was scheduled to occur 19 days after his written request for an expedited hearing, but the FDIC's regional counsel took the position that the oral testimony appellee proposed to offer at the hearing would not be necessary.  Before the hearing date, appellee filed suit in the Federal District Court, which preliminarily enjoined the FDIC from enforcing the suspension order.  Although it rejected appellee's argument that the order was invalid because it was not preceded by a hearing, the court concluded that  1818(g)(3)'s post-suspension procedure violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it does not guarantee a suspended officer a sufficiently prompt decision or an unqualified right to present oral testimony.
Held:
1. Section 1818(g)(3)'s post-suspension procedure is not unconstitutional on its face.  Pp.  486 U. S. 240-248.
(a) Appellee was not entitled to a pre-suspension hearing, since the important governmental interest in protecting depositors and maintaining public confidence, coupled with the fact that the felony indictment provided substantial assurance that the suspension was not baseless, justified prompt action before a suspension hearing was held.  Cf. Barry v. Barchi, 443 U. S. 55.  Pp.  486 U. S. 240-241.
(b) Appellee was not denied a sufficiently prompt post-suspension hearing.  Although a bank officer has an important, constitutionally protected interest in continued employment, he also has an interest in seeing 
Page 486 U. S. 231
 that a decision concerning his continued suspension is not made with excessive haste.  Moreover, a temporary suspension is not likely to augment the injury to the officer's reputation that has already been done by an indictment accusing him of serious wrongdoing.  Thus, even a delay of the full 90 days allowed by  1818(g)(3) for a post-suspension decision will usually be justified by the public interest in a correct decision as to whether depositors' interests or public confidence are threatened, and by the likelihood, arising from the grand jury's finding of probable cause that the officer has committed a felony involving dishonesty, that the suspension decision was not mistaken.  The fact that the criminal proceedings might be concluded more promptly than the FDIC proceeding is irrelevant to the due process determination, since an acquittal will require that the suspension order be vacated, while a conviction will merely strengthen the case for maintaining the suspension.  Barry v. Barchi, supra, distinguished.  Pp.  486 U. S. 241-247.
(c) The District Court's reliance on  1818(g)(3)'s failure to guarantee an opportunity to present oral testimony was misplaced.  The relevant regulation delegates the discretionary decision whether to accept oral testimony to the hearing officer, but appellee never gave that officer the opportunity to render a decision.  There is no inexorable requirement that oral testimony be heard in every administrative proceeding in which it is tendered, and unconstitutionality cannot be premised on the fact that discretionary authority to admit or reject such evidence may be applied in an arbitrary or unfair way in some hypothetical case.  Pp.  486 U. S. 247-248.
2. There was no unfairness in the FDIC's use of the  1818(g)(3) procedure in this case.  P.  486 U. S. 248.

Syllabus 
Title 12 U.S.C.  1818(g)(1) authorizes the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to suspend from office an indicted official of a federally insured bank if his continued service poses a threat to the interests of the bank's depositors or threatens to impair public confidence in the bank.  Section 1818(g)(3) entitles a suspended official to a hearing before the FDIC within 30 days of his written request, and to a final decision within 60 days of the hearing.  At the hearing, the official may ""submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the agency, oral testimony) and oral argument.""  The FDIC suspended appellee, the president and a director of a federally insured bank, after he was indicted for making false statements to the FDIC and the bank for the purpose of influencing the FDIC in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1001 and 1014.  A hearing was scheduled to occur 19 days after his written request for an expedited hearing, but the FDIC's regional counsel took the position that the oral testimony appellee proposed to offer at the hearing would not be necessary.

Syllabus 
After petitioner was charged with the capital crime of murder committed during a robbery, but before he was represented by counsel, he was subjected to a court-ordered examination by a psychologist to determine his competency to stand trial, sanity at the time of the offense, and future dangerousness.  Petitioner was not served with copies of the State's motion for the examination or the court's order.  Petitioner was later indicted, counsel was appointed to represent him, and he was arraigned.  The District Attorney, without serving a copy of his motion on defense counsel, requested a second psychiatric evaluation of petitioner as to the same matters.  Without determining whether defense counsel had been notified of the State's motion, the trial court granted the motion and ordered an examination by the same psychologist and a specified psychiatrist.  Later, a letter to the court from another psychiatrist (Dr. Grigson) appeared in the court file, stating that, pursuant to court order, he had examined petitioner and that he concluded that petitioner had ""a severe antisocial personality disorder and is extremely dangerous and will commit future acts of violence.""  After petitioner was tried by a jury and convicted of capital murder, a separate sentencing procedure was conducted in accordance with Texas law before the same jury.  Appearing as a witness for the State, Dr. Grigson testified, over defense counsel's objection, that in his opinion petitioner presented a continuing threat to society through acts of criminal violence.  The jury answered affirmatively the special verdict questions as to whether the State had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, (1) that the defendant's conduct causing the death was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the victim's death would result, and (2) that there was ""a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.""  The court, as required by state law, sentenced petitioner to death.  On petitioner's appeal of his death sentence, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the admission of Dr. Grigson's testimony violated the Sixth Amendment right, recognized in Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454, of a defendant formally charged with a capital crime to consult with counsel before submitting to a psychiatric examination designed to determine future dangerousness.  However, the court concluded that the constitutional violation 
Page 486 U. S. 250
 was subject to harmless error analysis, and that the error was harmless in this case.
Held:
1. The use, at the capital sentencing proceeding, of Dr. Grigson's testimony on the issue of future dangerousness violated the Sixth Amendment.  The Court of Criminal Appeals properly determined that there had been no compliance with the Sixth Amendment requirement, set out in Estelle v. Smith, that defense counsel be given advance notice of a psychiatric examination encompassing the issue of future dangerousness.  Petitioner's right to counsel had attached at the time Dr. Grigson examined him in jail, and the record does not support the State's contention that various ex parte motions and orders contained in the court file provided defense counsel with notice that an examination encompassing the issue of petitioner's future dangerousness would take place.  Moreover, even if the ex parte orders and filings were timely and were applicable to Dr. Grigson's examination, they did not adequately notify defense counsel that Dr. Grigson would examine the petitioner to assess his future dangerousness.  Constructive notice to defense counsel achieved by mere placement of the State's motions and the court's ex parte orders in the court file does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment.  Pp.  486 U. S. 256-258.
2. The harmless error rule set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 -- which held that, if the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a constitutional error did not contribute to the verdict, the error is harmless and the verdict may stand -- applies to the admission of psychiatric testimony in violation of the Sixth Amendment right set out in Estelle v. Smith.  Some constitutional violations -- including Sixth Amendment violations that pervade the entire criminal proceeding -- by their very nature cast so much doubt on the fairness on the trial process that, as a matter of law, they can never be considered harmless.  However, the effect of the Sixth Amendment violation in this case is limited to the admission into evidence of Dr. Grigson's testimony.  It is important to avoid error in capital sentencing proceedings.  Moreover, the evaluation of the consequences of an error in the sentencing phase of a capital case may be more difficult because of the discretion that is given to the sentencer.  Nevertheless, a reviewing court can make an intelligent judgment about whether the erroneous admission of psychiatric testimony might have affected a capital sentencing jury.  Pp.  486 U. S. 256-258.
3. The Court of Criminal Appeals improperly held that the erroneous admission of Dr. Grigson's testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The court concluded that the admission of this testimony on the critical issue of ""future dangerousness"" -- a probability of which must be found before a death sentence may be imposed under Texas law -- was harmless because the legally admitted evidence was sufficient to support 
Page 486 U. S. 251
 the jury's finding of future dangerousness.  However, under the Chapman harmless error test, the controlling question is whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.  Upon reviewing all the evidence at the sentencing hearing, this Court finds it impossible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr. Grigson's expert testimony on the issue of petitioner's future dangerousness did not influence the sentencing jury.  Pp.  486 U. S. 258-260.

Syllabus 
An Ohio statute awards a tax credit against the Ohio motor vehicle fuel sales tax for each gallon of ethanol sold (as a component of gasohol) by fuel dealers, but only if the ethanol is produced in Ohio or, if produced in another State, to the extent that State grants similar tax advantages to ethanol produced in Ohio.  Appellant, an Indiana limited partnership, manufactures ethanol in Indiana, which has no sales tax exemption for ethanol, wherefore appellant's ethanol sold in Ohio is ineligible for the Ohio tax credit.  Appellant sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, alleging that the Ohio tax credit violates the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution by discriminating against out-of-state ethanol producers.  The court denied relief; the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The Ohio statute discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  486 U. S. 273-280.
(a) The Clause's ""negative"" aspect, directly limiting the States' power to discriminate against interstate commerce, prohibits economic protectionism -- that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.  Thus, state statutes, such as Ohio's, that clearly discriminate against interstate commerce are invalid, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.  There is no merit to appellees' argument that the availability of the Ohio tax credit to some out-of-state manufacturers (those in States that give tax advantages to Ohio-produced ethanol) shows that the Ohio provision is not discriminatory but, rather, is likely to promote interstate commerce by encouraging other States to enact similar tax advantages that will spur the interstate sale of ethanol.  Discriminatory tax treatment for out-of-state goods is no more validated by the promise to remove it if reciprocity is accepted than would be the categorical exclusion of out-of-state goods.  Nor is there any merit to appellees' argument that the Ohio statute should not be considered discrimination against interstate commerce because apparently only one Ohio ethanol manufacturer (appellee South Point Ethanol) is benefited by it, and only one out-of-state manufacturer (appellant) is clearly disadvantaged.  Where discrimination is patent, as 
Page 486 U. S. 270
 it is here, neither a widespread advantage to in-state interests nor a widespread disadvantage to out-of-state competitors need be shown.  Moreover, the ""market participant"" doctrine -- under which the negative Commerce Clause's limitations apply only to a State's acting in its governmental capacity, not to its acting in the capacity of a market participant -- has no application here.  The state action at issue is not Ohio's purchase or sale of ethanol, but its assessment and computation of taxes.  Although the tax credit scheme has the purpose and effect of subsidizing a particular industry, that does not transform it into a form of state participation in the free market.  Pp.  486 U. S. 273-278.
(b) The clear discrimination in this case cannot be validated by the justifications advanced by appellees:  health and commerce.  Appellees argue that the Ohio statute encourages use of ethanol to reduce harmful exhaust emissions, both in Ohio and in surrounding States whose polluted atmosphere may reach Ohio.  There is no reason to suppose, however, that ethanol produced in a State that does not offer tax advantages to ethanol produced in Ohio is less healthy, and thus should have its importation into Ohio suppressed by denial of the otherwise standard tax credit; and ethanol use outside Ohio is just as effectively fostered by other States' subsidizing ethanol production or sale in some fashion other than by giving a tax credit to Ohio-produced ethanol.  Thus, health is not the purpose of the Ohio provision, but is merely an occasional and accidental effect of achieving what is its purpose, favorable tax treatment for Ohio-produced ethanol.  Essentially the same reasoning applies to the asserted justification that Ohio's reciprocity requirement is designed to increase commerce in ethanol by encouraging other States to enact ethanol subsidies.  Pp.  486 U. S. 278-280.

Syllabus 
A gray-market good is a foreign-manufactured good, bearing a valid United States trademark, that is imported without the consent of the United States trademark holder.  The gray market arises in three general contexts.  In case 1, despite a domestic firm's having purchased from an independent foreign firm the rights to register and use the latter's trademark as a United States trademark and to sell its foreign-manufactured products here, the foreign firm imports the trademarked goods and distributes them here, or sells them abroad to a third party who imports them here.  In case 2, after the United States trademark for goods manufactured abroad is registered by a domestic firm that is a subsidiary of (case 2a), the parent of (case 2b), or the same as (case 2c), the foreign manufacturer, goods bearing a trademark that is identical to the United States trademark are imported.  In case 3, the domestic holder of a United States trademark authorizes an independent foreign manufacturer to use that trademark in a particular foreign location.  Again, the foreign manufacturer or a third party imports and distributes the foreign made goods.  Section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of ""any merchandise of foreign manufacture"" bearing a trademark ""owned by"" a citizen of, or by
""a corporation . . . organized within, the United States, and registered in the Patent and Trademark Office by a person domiciled in the United States,""
unless written consent of the trademark owner is produced at the time of entry.  The Customs Service's implementing regulation permits the entry of goods manufactured abroad by the ""same person"" who holds the United States trademark or by a person who is ""subject to common control"" with the United States trademark holder, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(1), (2), and permits importation where the foreign manufacturer has received the United States trademark owner's authorization to use its trademark, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(3).  Respondent Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of

 American Trademarks and two of its members filed suit against the Government seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting that the regulation is inconsistent with  526, and therefore invalid.

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
252 U.S.App.D.C. 342, 790 F.2d 903, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court as to Parts I, II-A, and II-C, concluding that:
1. In determining whether a challenged regulation is consistent with the statute it implements, courts must ascertain the statute's plain meaning by looking to the particular language at issue and the language and design of the statute as a whole.  If the statute is clear and unambiguous, courts must give effect to Congress' unambiguously expressed intent, and cannot pay deference to a contrary agency interpretation.  However, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue addressed by the regulation, a reviewing court must give deference to the agency's interpretation if it does not conflict with the statute's plain meaning.  Pp.  486 U. S. 291-292.
2. Allowing the importation of foreign made goods where the United States trademark owner has authorized the use of the mark, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(3), is in conflict with the unequivocal language of  526, and cannot stand.  The regulation denies a domestic trademark holder statutory protection in the case 3 context.  Under no reasonable construction of the statutory language can goods made in a foreign country by an independent foreign manufacturer be removed from the purview of the statute.  However, the regulation subsection is severable, since its severance and invalidation will not impair the function of the statute as a whole and there is no indication that the regulation would not have been passed but for its inclusion.  Pp.  486 U. S. 293-294.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, concluded in Part II-B that the regulation's allowance of imports from companies under common control, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(1), (2), is consistent with  526, and is therefore valid because it is a permissible construction designed to resolve statutory ambiguities.  The statutory phrase ""owned by"" is sufficiently ambiguous to permit parallel importation in the case 2a foreign-parent, domestic-subsidiary context, since the phrase does not reveal which of the affiliated entities can be said to ""own"" the United States trademark if the domestic subsidiary is wholly owned by its foreign parent.  Similarly, the ambiguity contained in the statutory phrase ""merchandise of 
Page 486 U. S. 283
 foreign manufacture"" suffices to sustain the regulation as it applies to cases 2b and 2c.  It is possible to interpret the phrase to mean goods manufactured (1) in a foreign country, (2) by a foreign company, or (3) in a foreign country by a foreign company.  Thus, the agency is entitled to choose any reasonable definition and to say that goods manufactured by a foreign subsidiary or division of a domestic company are not goods ""of foreign manufacture.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 292-293.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS, agreeing that the common control exception is consistent with  526, concluded that:
1. Section 526's language does not clearly cover affiliates of foreign manufacturers.  Pp.  486 U. S. 297-299.
(a) The section's protectionist language and structure bespeak a congressional intent to extend protection only to domestic interests, and not to affiliates of foreign manufacturers.  Much of the limiting language would be pointless if a foreign manufacturer could insulate itself by the simple device of incorporating a shell domestic subsidiary and transferring to it a single asset -- the United States trademark.  Pp.  486 U. S. 297-298.
(b) The undefined statutory phrase ""owned by"" is ambiguous when applied in the case 2a context, because it cannot be confidently discerned which of the entities involved owns the trademark.  Whereas the trademark must be ""owned by"" a domestic firm to fall within  526's ban, it is the foreign parent corporation -- not the domestic subsidiary whose every decision it controls -- that better fits the bill as the true owner of any property that the subsidiary nominally possesses.  Similarly,  526 does not unambiguously cover cases 2b and 2c, because it is unclear whether merchandise manufactured abroad by a division or a subsidiary of a domestic firm is ""merchandise of foreign manufacture.""  If that phrase is interpreted to mean ""merchandise manufactured in a foreign country,""  526's ban would apply.  However, if the phrase is construed to mean ""merchandise manufactured by a foreigner,""  526's coverage is not as clear.  A domestic firm that establishes a manufacturing division abroad (case 2c) cannot be said to be a foreigner, and it is at the very least reasonable to view as ""American"" the foreign subsidiary of a domestic firm (case 2b).  Pp.  486 U. S. 298-299.
2. The common control exception is consistent with  526's purpose and legislative history, which confirm that, if Congress had any intent as to the section's application to affiliates of foreign manufacturers, it was that they ought not enjoy  526's protection.  The major stimulus for the enactment of  526 was the congressionally perceived inequity of A. Bourjois & Co. v. Katzel, 275 F. 539, which declined to protect a case 1 trademark holder.  However, the profound differences between the equities presented in the case 1 and case 2 contexts -- which result 
Page 486 U. S. 284
 from the fact that the case 1 trademark holder has a much greater investment at stake, but much less control over parallel importation and foreign sales to third parties, than its case 2 counterpart -- furnish perfectly rational reasons for Congress' distinguishing between the two situations.  Pp.  486 U. S. 300-309.
3. The deference owed longstanding administrative interpretations further buttresses the conclusion that the common control exception is consistent with  526.  While the precise language of the importation bar has varied over the years, the Customs Service has for 50 years adhered to the exception's basic premise that  526 does not require exclusion of all gray-market goods in the context of affiliated entities.  Such a longstanding administrative practice should not be lightly overturned, particularly where, as here, an immense domestic retail industry has developed in reliance upon it.  Pp.  486 U. S. 309-312.

486 U.S. 281

Syllabus 
A gray-market good is a foreign-manufactured good, bearing a valid United States trademark, that is imported without the consent of the United States trademark holder.  The gray market arises in three general contexts.  In case 1, despite a domestic firm's having purchased from an independent foreign firm the rights to register and use the latter's trademark as a United States trademark and to sell its foreign-manufactured products here, the foreign firm imports the trademarked goods and distributes them here, or sells them abroad to a third party who imports them here.  In case 2, after the United States trademark for goods manufactured abroad is registered by a domestic firm that is a subsidiary of (case 2a), the parent of (case 2b), or the same as (case 2c), the foreign manufacturer, goods bearing a trademark that is identical to the United States trademark are imported.  In case 3, the domestic holder of a United States trademark authorizes an independent foreign manufacturer to use that trademark in a particular foreign location.  Again, the foreign manufacturer or a third party imports and distributes the foreign made goods.  Section 526 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of ""any merchandise of foreign manufacture"" bearing a trademark ""owned by"" a citizen of, or by
""a corporation . . . organized within, the United States, and registered in the Patent and Trademark Office by a person domiciled in the United States,""
unless written consent of the trademark owner is produced at the time of entry.  The Customs Service's implementing regulation permits the entry of goods manufactured abroad by the ""same person"" who holds the United States trademark or by a person who is ""subject to common control"" with the United States trademark holder, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(1), (2), and permits importation where the foreign manufacturer has received the United States trademark owner's authorization to use its trademark, 19 CFR  133.21(c)(3).  Respondent Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of

 American Trademarks and two of its members filed suit against the Government seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting that the regulation is inconsistent with  526, and therefore invalid.  The Federal District Court upheld the regulation, but the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the regulation was an unreasonable administrative interpretation of  526.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
252 U.S.App.D.C. 342, 790 F.2d 903, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 31, 1988
 Rehearing Denied Aug. 4, 1988. 
 See 487 U.S. 1246. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973- 2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari. But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition because it raises the question whether the State may introduce evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct at the sentencing phase of a capital trial. 
 A jury convicted petitioner Adam Miranda of first-degree murder and assault with intent to commit murder. At the sentencing phase of the trial, the only evidence the State introduced to support the death penalty concerned a wholly unrelated murder. Petitioner had been charged with committing this murder, but had not been tried for or convicted of the crime. Moreover, the trial court refused to instruct the jury that it could consider the evidence of the unrelated murder in making a sentencing determination only if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had committed the offense. The jury imposed the death sentence. 
Page 486 U.S. 1038 , 1039
 I have stated twice this Term that the Court should consider the question whether the admission of of evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct at the penalty phase of a capital trial violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Williams v. Lynaugh, 484 U.S. 935 (1987) (dissenting from denial of certiorari); Devier v. Kemp, 484 U.S. 948 (1987) (dissenting from denial of certiorari). I have noted that this question has prompted a number of conflicting decisions nationwide. Compare State v. Bobo, 727 S.W.2d 945, 952-953 (Tenn.) (unadjudicated-crimes evidence not admissible), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 872 (1987), and State v. Bartholomew, 101 Wash.2d 631, 640-642, 683 P.2d 1079, 1085-1086 ( 1984) (en banc) (same), with Milton v. State, 599 S.W.2d 824, 827 (Tex. Crim.App.1980) (en banc) (unadjudicated-crimes evidence admissible). In addition, I have argued that the admission of unadjudicated-crimes evidence at the sentencing phase of a capital trial is difficult to reconcile with the unique constitutional concern for reliability in death sentencing proceedings. This case again demonstrates that the Court should resolve this important question.

On May 27, 1988, a threejudge District Court for the Middle District of Georgia declined to issue an injunction, concluding that the applicants had failed to establish that holding the election now contemplated would violate  5 of the Voting Rights Act, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  1973c.  The United States has submitted, and I have reviewed, a memorandum advising me that it supports the applicants' request for immediate injunctive relief.

No. 87-4
Argued March 2, 1988
Decided May 23, 1988
486 U.S. 153

Syllabus 
Petitioner, along with numerous codefendants, including Gomez-Barajas and Bravo, was charged with participating in a far-flung drug distribution conspiracy.  At the time of petitioner's trial, the District Court was considering Gomez-Barajas' offer to plead guilty to certain charges stemming from the conspiracy, and had already accepted Bravo's guilty plea to one count.  Both Gomez-Barajas and Bravo were represented by attorney Iredale.  Two court days before his trial was to commence, petitioner moved for the substitution of Iredale as his counsel as well.  Despite petitioner's assertion of his Sixth Amendment right to the counsel of his choice, and his willingness, as well as that of Gomez-Barajas and Bravo, to waive the right to conflict-free counsel, the court denied the substitution motion on the basis of irreconcilable and unwaiveable conflicts of interest for Iredale created by the likelihood that petitioner would be called to testify at any subsequent trial of Gomez-Barajas, and that Bravo would testify at petitioner's trial.  Petitioner therefore proceeded to trial with his original counsel and was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court did not err in declining petitioner's waiver of his right to conflict-free counsel and in refusing to permit his proposed substitution of attorneys.  In multiple-representation cases, district courts have a duty to take such measures as are appropriate to protect criminal defendants against counsel's conflicts of interest, including the issuance of separate representation orders.  Moreover, they often must do so at the pretrial stage, where relationships between parties are unclear, and the likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are hard to predict.  The provision of waivers by all affected parties will not necessarily cure any problems, since the courts have an independent interest in assuring compliance with ethical standards and the appearance of fairness, and since several Courts of Appeals have demonstrated an apparent willingness to entertain ineffective-assistance claims by defendants who have specifically waived the right to conflict-free counsel.  Thus, the district courts must be allowed substantial latitude to evaluate in the light of their informed judgment the facts and circumstances of each case, including any attempt by the Government to ""manufacture"" a conflict to prevent a defendant from obtaining particularly able counsel.  
Page 486 U. S. 154
 Although the courts must recognize the Sixth Amendment presumption in favor of counsel of choice, that presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but also by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.  Here, where the substitution motion was made so close to trial, it cannot be said that the District Court abused its discretion, since it was presented with complex litigation that was likely to engender conflicts of interest for Iredale if he was permitted to represent both petitioner and his codefendants.  Pp.  486 U. S. 158-164.

Syllabus 
Appellee Miller, an employee of appellant at an Ohio nuclear production facility owned by the United States but operated by appellant, a private contractor, received a workers' compensation award from appellee Ohio Industrial Commission (Commission) for injuries sustained in a fall allegedly caused by a bolt protruding from the scaffold on which he was working.  On the basis of a state safety regulation prohibiting scaffolds from having projecting parts, Miller then sought a supplemental award under a state constitutional provision authorizing such an award when an injury is caused by an employer's failure to comply with any specific state safety requirement.  The Commission denied the claim, but the State Court of Appeals ordered the Commission to consider Miller's supplemental application.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that federal law did not preempt Ohio from applying safety requirements unrelated to radiation hazards to nuclear facilities.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1257(2), since the Ohio Supreme Court upheld the application of the State's additional award provision to the facility in question as against the contention that such application violated the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  Cf. Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434.  Application of the ""pragmatic approach"" utilized in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,  420 U. S. 486, compels the conclusion that the state court's judgment was ""final"" within the meaning of  1257, even though further proceedings before the Commission are anticipated, since the judgment finally determined the federal preemption question, and a reversal of that judgment would preclude any further proceedings.  Moreover, even if appellant prevails before the Commission on nonfederal grounds, the State Supreme Court's unreviewed decision might seriously erode federal nuclear production policy by sanctioning direct state regulation of nonradiological hazards at the only facility producing nuclear fuel for the Navy, and has important implications for the regulation of federally owned nuclear production facilities in other States.  Pp.  486 U. S. 178-180.
2. The Supremacy Clause does not bar Ohio from applying its additional award provision to a private contractor operating a federally owned nuclear production facility that performs a federal function.  
Page 486 U. S. 175
 Such facilities are shielded from direct state regulation, even though the federal function is carried out by a private contractor, unless Congress provides ""clear and unambiguous"" authorization for such regulation.  Hancock v. Train, 426 U. S. 167.  Even if the additional award provision is sufficiently akin to direct state regulation to be potentially barred by the Supremacy Clause, 40 U.S.C.  290 -- which empowers States to apply ""workmen's compensation laws"" to federal premises to the same extent as such laws are applied to private facilities -- unambiguously provides the requisite clear congressional authorization for the application of the provision.  The contention that the above-quoted, undefined phrase applies only to typical workers' compensation Acts, and not to the additional award provision, cannot be squared with  290's plain language, which places no express limitation on the type of workers' compensation scheme that is authorized, or with the statute's history, which demonstrates that, at the time of its enactment, a substantial number of States provided additional awards for violation of safety regulations, a matter of which Congress was presumably aware.  The fact that, in enacting  290, Congress rejected a proposal that would have authorized States to apply their safety and insurance laws directly to federal projects does not preclude, and is in fact consistent with, the allowance of additional award provisions' incidental regulatory effects, which are significantly less intrusive than direct regulation on the operation of federal projects.

Syllabus 
In petitioner's employment compensation action, which respondent removed from a Colorado state court to the Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, judgment was entered on the jury's verdict for petitioner in an amount considerably less than he had sought.  Petitioner timely filed new trial motions and a motion for attorney's fees under Colorado law.  On May 14, 1984, the court denied the new trial motions, but found that petitioner was entitled to attorney's fees, and, on August 1, 1984, entered a final order determining the amount of the fees.  On August 29, petitioner filed notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals, covering all of the District Court's post-trial orders.  Although affirming the attorney's fees award, the court granted respondent's motion to dismiss as to all other issues on the grounds that the judgment was final and immediately appealable upon entry of the May 14 order denying the new trial motions, and that the appeal notice was not filed within 30 days of that order as required by Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) and (4).
Held:
1. The question whether the District Court's decision on the merits was appealable before the attorney's fees determination was made is governed by federal law -- specifically 28 U.S.C.  1291, which provides that all district court ""final decisions"" are appealable to the courts of appeals -- and not by Colorado law.  Although state law generally supplies the rules of decision in federal diversity cases, it does not control the resolution of issues governed by federal statute.  The contention that the application of  1291 to diversity cases would violate the Tenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is without merit, since  1291 is ""rationally capable of classification"" as a procedural rule, and is therefore necessary and proper for implementing Congress' Art. III,  1, power to establish federal courts.  Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460,  380 U. S. 472.  Pp.  486 U. S. 198-199.
2. A decision on the merits is a ""final decision"" for purposes of  1291, and is therefore immediately appealable, even though the recoverability or amount of attorney's fees for the litigation remains to be determined.  The merits order ends the litigation on the merits, and the remaining fees question does not prevent finality, since it is collateral to, and separate 
Page 486 U. S. 196
 from, the order, and resolution of it cannot alter or amend the order or moot any decisions that the order embodies.  According different treatment to attorney's fees when they are deemed part of the merits recovery by statutory or decisional law (as petitioner claims is the case in Colorado) would not serve  1291's purposes, and would disserve the interests of courts and litigants because, since the merits or nonmerits status of a fee provision is often unclear, the issue of finality, and hence the jurisdictional time for appeal, would be left in doubt.  The argument that the Court of Appeals' decision constitutes a significant change in the law, and therefore should be applied only prospectively cannot avail petitioner, since, regardless of whether such a change has occurred, the untimely filed notice of appeal did not give the court jurisdiction to review the merits decision.

Syllabus 
The two respondents are federal prison inmates whose requests for copies of their presentence investigation reports were denied by the Parole Commission.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c), a probation officer prepares the presentence report, which contains background information about the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, for use by the district court at sentencing.  Under the Rule, the court, before imposing sentence, must permit the defendant and his counsel to read the report, except portions, inter alia, containing diagnostic opinions, confidential sources of information, or information that, if disclosed, might cause harm to the defendant or others.  After sentencing, the reports are typically transmitted to the Bureau of Prisons for its use, and then -- pursuant to the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976 (Parole Act) -- are sent to the Parole Commission for eventual use in determining whether a prisoner should be paroled.  The Parole Act provides that, before a scheduled parole hearing is held, the prisoner must be given reasonable access to the report, but exempts the same three categories of information as Rule 32(c).  After the Parole Commission denied their disclosure requests, respondents filed separate suits under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the District Courts ordered disclosure.  Consolidating petitioners' appeals, the Court of Appeals affirmed.  It rejected petitioners' contentions that presentence reports are exempt from disclosure under both 
Page 486 U. S. 2
 Exemption 3 and Exemption 5 of the FOIA.  Exemption 3 pertains to matters that are ""specifically exempt[ed] from disclosure"" by another statute that ""refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.""  Exemption 5 makes the FOIA inapplicable to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""
Held:  The FOIA requires that the presentence reports be disclosed by petitioners, except as to matters relating to confidential sources, diagnostic opinions, and possibly harmful information.  Pp. 8-14.  Pp.  486 U. S. 8-14.
(a) Beyond protecting from disclosure the matters noted above, neither Rule 32(c) nor the Parole Act satisfies Exemption 3's requirements.  Recent changes, leading to their present provisions, have been made in both the Rule and the Parole Act, not to protect the presentence report from disclosure, but to ensure that it would be disclosed to the defendant who is about to be sentenced or who is up for parole.  Although Rule 32's provision requiring that all copies of reports furnished under the Rule be returned to the court, unless it directs otherwise, qualifies somewhat the defendant's access to the presentence report when it is furnished by the district court in the context of sentencing, it does not convert the Rule, a part of which is essentially designed to mandate disclosure, into a statute that ""specifically exempt[s] from disclosure"" for purposes of Exemption 3.  Moreover, the Parole Act does not contain a similar provision.  Pp.  486 U. S. 8-11.
(b) Exemption 5 of the FOIA does not support withholding of the presentence reports.  The Exemption incorporates the privileges which the Government enjoys under relevant statutory and case law in the pretrial discovery context.  The test under the Exemption is whether the documents would be ""routinely"" or ""normally"" disclosed upon a showing of relevance.  Although, in both civil and criminal cases, the courts have been reluctant to give a third party access to the presentence report prepared for some other individual in the absence of a showing of special need, a similar restriction on discovery is not applicable when the individual requesting discovery is the subject of the report.  The thrust of the disclosure portions of Rule 32(c) and the Parole Act speaks strongly against the existence of a Government privilege when the disclosure request is from the subject of the report.

Syllabus 
Appellant, a Louisiana corporation which operates 13 department stores realizing over $100 million in annual sales in that State, contracted with several out-of-state companies to design, print, and distribute merchandise catalogs.  Appellant paid for the catalogs, which were shipped free of charge to addressees; supplied the contractors with lists of addressees, 82% of whom were Louisiana residents; instructed postal authorities to return undeliverable catalogs to its New Orleans store; and initiated the distribution to improve its sales and name recognition among Louisiana residents.  Appellant did not pay any sales taxes where the catalogs were designed or printed.  The Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation, of which appellee is Secretary, assessed taxes on the catalogs' value under a statute imposing a 3% use tax on all tangible personal property used in Louisiana and defining ""use"" as the exercise of any right or power over such property incident to ownership, including distribution.  When appellant refused to pay the tax, the State filed and won a collection suit in state court.  The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed, finding that, once the catalogs landed in Louisiana mailboxes, they left the stream of interstate commerce and became part of the property mass of the State; that distribution of the catalogs constituted ""use"" subject to taxation under the statute; and that, under the four-pronged test for determining the validity of state taxes articulated in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, the use tax did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Held:  The application of Louisiana's use tax to appellant's catalogs does not violate the Commerce Clause.  It is largely irrelevant for Clause purposes whether the catalogs ""came to rest"" in the Louisiana customers' mailboxes or whether they were still considered in the stream of interstate commerce, since Complete Auto recognized that, with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.  Moreover, the argument that the assessment against the catalogs was in essence a tax on the mere presence of goods within the State is without merit, since distribution constitutes use under the statute.  Furthermore, the application of the tax to the catalogs satisfies each prong of the Complete Auto test.  The taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, 
Page 486 U. S. 25
 since it provides a credit against the use tax for sales taxes paid in other States, and since the use tax was imposed only on those catalogs distributed in-state, and not on those sent to out-of-state customers.  The tax structure likewise does not discriminate against interstate commerce, since the use tax, which is designed to compensate the State for revenue lost on out-of-state purchases of goods used in-state, is equal to the sales tax on the same goods purchased in-state; in fact, both taxes are set forth in the same statutory sections.  The use tax is also fairly related to state-provided services that facilitate appellant's in-state sales, including fire and police protection for appellant's stores and mass transit and public roads which benefit appellant's customers.  Finally, appellant's activity had a substantial nexus with Louisiana, since appellant controlled the distribution of the catalogs to approximately 400,000 state residents, the distribution was directly aimed at expanding and enhancing its Louisiana business, and it has a significant presence in the State in terms of number of stores and annual sales volume.

The Louisiana Court of Appeal affirmed, finding that, once the catalogs landed in Louisiana mailboxes, they left the stream of interstate commerce and became part of the property mass of the State; that distribution of the catalogs constituted ""use"" subject to taxation under the statute; and that, under the four-pronged test for determining the validity of state taxes articulated in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, the use tax did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.
Held:  The application of Louisiana's use tax to appellant's catalogs does not violate the Commerce Clause.  It is largely irrelevant for Clause purposes whether the catalogs ""came to rest"" in the Louisiana customers' mailboxes or whether they were still considered in the stream of interstate commerce, since Complete Auto recognized that, with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.  Moreover, the argument that the assessment against the catalogs was in essence a tax on the mere presence of goods within the State is without merit, since distribution constitutes use under the statute.  Furthermore, the application of the tax to the catalogs satisfies each prong of the Complete Auto test.  The taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, 
Page 486 U. S. 25
 since it provides a credit against the use tax for sales taxes paid in other States, and since the use tax was imposed only on those catalogs distributed in-state, and not on those sent to out-of-state customers.  The tax structure likewise does not discriminate against interstate commerce, since the use tax, which is designed to compensate the State for revenue lost on out-of-state purchases of goods used in-state, is equal to the sales tax on the same goods purchased in-state; in fact, both taxes are set forth in the same statutory sections.  The use tax is also fairly related to state-provided services that facilitate appellant's in-state sales, including fire and police protection for appellant's stores and mass transit and public roads which benefit appellant's customers.  Finally, appellant's activity had a substantial nexus with Louisiana, since appellant controlled the distribution of the catalogs to approximately 400,000 state residents, the distribution was directly aimed at expanding and enhancing its Louisiana business, and it has a significant presence in the State in terms of number of stores and annual sales volume.

No. 86-684
Argued January 11, 1988
Decided May 16, 1988
486 U.S. 35

Syllabus 
Acting on information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking, police twice obtained from his regular trash collector garbage bags left on the curb in front of his house.  On the basis of items in the bags which were indicative of narcotics use, the police obtained warrants to search the house, discovered controlled substances during the searches, and arrested respondents on felony narcotics charges.  Finding that probable cause to search the house would not have existed without the evidence obtained from the trash searches, the State Superior Court dismissed the charges under People v. Krivda, 5 Cal.3d 357, 486 P.2d 1262, which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.  Although noting a post-Krivda state constitutional amendment eliminating the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of state, but not federal, law, the State Court of Appeal affirmed on the ground that Krivda was based on federal, as well as state, law.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home.  Pp.  486 U. S. 39-44.
(a) Since respondents voluntarily left their trash for collection in an area particularly suited for public inspection, their claimed expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items they discarded was not objectively reasonable.  It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left along a public street are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.  Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through it or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.  The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.  Pp.  486 U. S. 43-44.
(b) Greenwood's alternative argument that his expectation of privacy in his garbage should be deemed reasonable as a matter of federal constitutional law because the warrantless search and seizure of his garbage was impermissible as a matter of California law under Krivda, 
Page 486 U. S. 36
 which he contends survived the state constitutional amendment, is without merit.  The reasonableness of a search for Fourth Amendment purposes does not depend upon privacy concepts embodied in the law of the particular State in which the search occurred; rather, it turns upon the understanding of society as a whole that certain areas deserve the most scrupulous protection from government invasion.  There is no such understanding with respect to garbage left for collection at the side of a public street.  Pp.  486 U. S. 43-44.
2. Also without merit is Greenwood's contention that the California constitutional amendment violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Just as this Court's Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule decisions have not required suppression where the benefits of deterring minor police misconduct were overbalanced by the societal costs of exclusion, California was not foreclosed by the Due Process Clause from concluding that the benefits of excluding relevant evidence of criminal activity do not outweigh the costs when the police conduct at issue does not violate federal law.

486 U.S. 57

Syllabus 
In 1974, after two years of unsatisfactory experience with conflicting federal and local technical standards governing the transmission of cable television broadcast signals, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) promulgated regulations preempting the field of signal quality regulation.  In 1984, this Court broadly approved the preemptive authority that the FCC had asserted over cable system regulation.  Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691.  A few months later, Congress enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (Cable Act or Act), which empowers state or local authorities to enfranchise cable systems and to specify the facilities and equipment that franchisees could use, but which also authorizes the FCC to establish technical standards for such facilities and equipment.  Pursuant to the latter provision, the FCC adopted regulations establishing technical standards governing the quality of cable signals and forbidding local authorities to impose more stringent technical standards.  Petitioners sought review of the regulations in the Court of Appeals, contesting the scope of the FCC's claimed preemptive authority and asserting that franchising authorities could impose stricter technical standards than the Commission's.  The court upheld the regulations.
Held:  The FCC did not exceed its statutory authority by forbidding local authorities to impose technical cable signal quality standards more stringent than those set forth in the Commission's regulations.
(a) Whether a federal agency has properly determined that its authority in a given area is exclusive and preempts any state regulatory efforts does not depend on the existence of express congressional authorization to displace state law.  Rather, the correct focus is on the agency itself and on the proper bounds of its lawful authority to undertake such action.  If the agency's decision to preempt represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies committed to the agency's care by statute, the accommodation should not be disturbed unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation ""is not one that Congress would have sanctioned.""  United States v. Shimer, 367 U. S. 374,  367 U. S. 383.  Pp.  486 U. S. 63-64. 
Page 486 U. S. 58

(b) In adopting the regulations at issue, the FCC explicitly stated its intent to continue its prior policy of exercising exclusive authority and of preempting state and local regulation, in order to address the potentially serious adaptability and cost problems created for cable system operators and consumers by technical standards that vary from community to community.  Thus, this case does not turn on whether there is an actual conflict between federal and state law, or whether compliance with both federal and state standards would be physically impossible.  Pp.  486 U. S. 65-66.
(c) The FCC acted within its authority under the Cable Act when it preempted state and local regulation.  In adopting the statute, Congress acted against a 10-year background of federal preemption on this particular issue, and at a time shortly after Crisp approved FCC preemption in very similar respects.  Nevertheless, Congress sanctioned in relevant respects the regulatory scheme that the Commission had already been following, without indicating explicit disapproval of the Commission's preemption of local technical standards.  Given the difficulties the FCC had experienced with inconsistent local standards, it is doubtful that Congress would have meant to overturn preemption without discussion, or even any suggestion that it was doing so.  To the contrary, the legislative history makes clear that the Cable Act was not intended to work any significant change.  Thus, nothing in the Act compels the conclusion that the decision to preempt ""is not one that Congress would have sanctioned.""  Pp.  486 U. S. 66-70.

486 U.S. 71

Syllabus 
In a state court suit upon an insurance claim for loss of a limb, the jury awarded appellee the $20,000 provided by his policy and punitive damages of $1.6 million based on appellant's bad-faith refusal to pay the claim.  Concluding that the punitive damages award was not excessive in light of appellant's financial worth and the degree of its wrongdoing, the Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed the verdict without modification, and assessed an additional 15% penalty against appellant in accordance with a state statute imposing such a penalty on parties who appeal unsuccessfully from money judgments or other categories of judgments whose value may be readily determined.  Although the appeal had not raised a federal constitutional challenge to the size of the punitive damages award, appellant argued, in its petition for rehearing, that the award ""was clearly excessive, not reasonably related to any legitimate purpose, constitutes excessive fine, and violates constitutional principles.""  Appellant's Motion to Correct Judgment also alleged that the statutory penalty violated its equal protection rights under the Federal and State Constitutions.  Without opinion, the State Supreme Court denied the petition for rehearing and the Motion to Correct Judgment.
Held:
1. This Court will not reach appellant's claims that the punitive damages award violated the Due Process, Contract, and Excessive Fines Clauses of the Federal Constitution, since those claims were not raised and passed upon in state court.  Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255, distinguished.  The petition for rehearing's vague and general appeal to constitutional principles was insufficient to adequately raise the Contract Clause or due process claims.  Similarly, the petition's reference to the award's excessiveness is too oblique to have properly raised the Federal Excessive Fines Clause claim, since no mention was made of the Clause, the Federal Constitution, or federal law, and the Mississippi Constitution contains its own Excessive Fines Clause, which the State Supreme Court could have taken to underlie the excessiveness challenge if it understood appellant to be offering a constitutional challenge.  Assuming that this Court's ""not pressed or passed upon below"" rule is not jurisdictional, but is merely a prudential restriction, the more prudent course here is to decline review of the important and difficult Federal Excessive Fines Clause issue.  This course will permit a number of less intrusive, 
Page 486 U. S. 72
 and possibly more appropriate, resolutions by the state legislature or courts, while any ultimate review of the question in this Court will gain the benefit of a well developed record and a reasoned opinion on the merits by the State Supreme Court.  Pp.  486 U. S. 76-80.
2. Mississippi's penalty statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it is reasonably tailored to achieve the State's legitimate objectives of discouraging frivolous appeals, compensating appellees for the intangible costs of litigation, and conserving judicial resources.  The statute does not discriminate against a particular class of appellants in an arbitrary and irrational fashion, since it broadly applies to both plaintiffs and defendants, as well as to a variety of specified types of readily determined judgments, and since its limitation to appellants from such judgments represents a rational, if partial, attempt to deter frivolous appeals without the substantial judicial intervention that the inclusion of other types of claims would require.  Moreover, the statute poses little danger of discouraging meritorious appeals along with insubstantial ones, since the 15% penalty operates only after a judgment has been affirmed without modification, and represents a relatively modest additional assessment.  Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56, distinguished.  Although the State might have enacted a statute that more precisely served the intended goals, perfection is not required under the rational basis test.  Pp.  486 U. S. 80-85.

486 U.S. 94

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an Astoria, Oregon, surgeon, declined an invitation by respondents to join them as a partner in the Astoria Clinic, and instead began an independent practice in competition with the Clinic.  Thereafter, petitioner experienced difficulties in his professional dealings with Clinic physicians, culminating in respondents' initiation of, and participation in, peer review proceedings to terminate petitioner's privileges at Astoria's only hospital (a majority of whose staff members were employees or partners of the Clinic), on the ground that his care of his patients was below the hospital's standards.  Petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that respondents had violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by initiating and participating in the peer review proceedings in order to reduce competition from petitioner, rather than to improve patient care.  Ultimately, the court entered a judgment against respondents, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that respondents' conduct was immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and its progeny, because Oregon has articulated a policy in favor of peer review and actively supervises the peer review process.
Held:  The state action doctrine does not protect Oregon physicians from federal antitrust liability for their activities on hospital peer review committees.  The ""active supervision"" prong of the test used to determine whether private parties may claim state action immunity requires that state officials have and exercise power to review such parties' particular anticompetitive acts and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy.  This requirement is not satisfied here, since there has been no showing that the State Health Division, the State Board of Medical Examiners, or the state judiciary reviews -- or even could review -- private decisions regarding hospital privileges to determine whether such decisions comport with state regulatory policy and to correct abuses.  The policy argument that effective peer review is essential to the provision of quality medical care, and that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent physicians from participating openly and actively in peer review proceedings, essentially challenges the wisdom of applying the antitrust 
Page 486 U. S. 95
 laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is properly directed to Congress.  Pp.  486 U. S. 99-106.

Petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that respondents had violated  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by initiating and participating in the peer review proceedings in order to reduce competition from petitioner, rather than to improve patient care.  Ultimately, the court entered a judgment against respondents, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that respondents' conduct was immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine of Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and its progeny, because Oregon has articulated a policy in favor of peer review and actively supervises the peer review process.
Held:  The state action doctrine does not protect Oregon physicians from federal antitrust liability for their activities on hospital peer review committees.  The ""active supervision"" prong of the test used to determine whether private parties may claim state action immunity requires that state officials have and exercise power to review such parties' particular anticompetitive acts and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy.  This requirement is not satisfied here, since there has been no showing that the State Health Division, the State Board of Medical Examiners, or the state judiciary reviews -- or even could review -- private decisions regarding hospital privileges to determine whether such decisions comport with state regulatory policy and to correct abuses.  The policy argument that effective peer review is essential to the provision of quality medical care, and that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent physicians from participating openly and actively in peer review proceedings, essentially challenges the wisdom of applying the antitrust

 laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is properly directed to Congress.  Pp.  486 U. S. 99-106.

Syllabus 
Under  706(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act), a complainant must file a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful employment practice, or within 300 days if the proceedings are initially instituted with a state or local agency having ""authority to grant or seek relief.""  Under  706(c), no charge may be filed with the EEOC until 60 days have elapsed from the initial filing of the charge with an authorized state or local agency, unless that agency's proceedings ""have been earlier terminated.""  This Court has held that, in light of  706(c)'s deferral period, a charge must be filed with, or referred by the EEOC to, the state or local agency within 240 days of the alleged discriminatory event in order to ensure that it may be filed within  706(e)'s extended 300-day limit, unless the state or local agency terminates its proceedings before 300 days.  Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807.  The Colorado Civil Rights Division (CCRD) and the EEOC have entered into a worksharing agreement, which provides that each will process certain categories of charges, and that the CCRD waives  706(c)'s 60-day deferral period with respect to those charges processed by the EEOC, but retains jurisdiction to act on such charges after the EEOC's proceedings conclude.  Alleging that, 290 days earlier, respondent had discharged her because of her sex in violation of Title VII, Suanne Leerssen filed a charge with the EEOC, which undertook the initial charge processing pursuant to the worksharing agreement.  The CCRD informed Leerssen that it had waived its right in this regard, but retained jurisdiction under the agreement.  Respondent refused to comply with the EEOC's administrative subpoena, and the District Court denied enforcement of the subpoena on the ground that the EEOC lacked jurisdiction because the charge was not timely filed within  706(e)'s 300-day period.  The Court of Appeals agreed, and therefore affirmed, although it rejected respondent's contention that the 300-day period was inapplicable because Leerssen had not filed the charge with the CCRD within the 180-day limitations period provided by state law.

Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
803 F.2d 581, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and III, concluding that:
1. A state agency's decision to waive  706(c)'s 60-day period, pursuant to a worksharing agreement with the EEOC, ""terminates"" the agency's proceedings within the meaning of  706(c), so that the EEOC may immediately deem the charge filed and begin to process it.  Respondent's contention, and the Court of Appeals' holding, that the CCRD did not ""terminate"" its proceedings because it retained jurisdiction to act on the EEOC's resolution of the charge must be rejected in favor of the EEOC's position that a state agency ""terminates"" its proceedings when it declares that it will not proceed, if it does so at all, for a specified interval of time, since the interpretation of ambiguous language in the Act by the EEOC, the agency having primary enforcement responsibility, is entitled to deference where it is reasonable.  The reasonableness of the EEOC's interpretation of ""terminate"" in its statutory context is more than amply supported by the legislative history of Title VII's deferral provisions, the purposes of those provisions, and the language of other sections of the Act.  Pp.  486 U. S. 114-116.
2. A complainant who files a charge that is untimely under state law is nonetheless entitled to  706(e)'s extended 300-day federal filing period.  That section's ""authority to grant or seek relief"" phrase does not preclude this conclusion on the theory that a state or local agency lacks the requisite authority in the absence of a timely filing under state law, since the phrase refers merely to enabling legislation establishing such agencies, not to state limitations requirements.  Rather, the reasoning of Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S. 750, is entirely apposite, even though that case involved the filing provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, since those provisions are virtually in haec verba with the Title VII provisions at issue here.  Thus, the failure to file a timely state law claim does not automatically preclude application of Title VII's 300-day period, since the Act contains no express requirement of timely state filing, and such a requirement should not be imported in light of the Act's remedial purposes and the fact that laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process, and would be confused by an additional state law filing requirement.  Moreover, such a requirement would embroil the EEOC in complicated state law issues which it has neither the time nor the expertise to determine.  Thus, Mohasco's 240-day filing rule applies in such cases.  Pp.  486 U. S. 122-125.

Syllabus 
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires that a civil enforcement action be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued, except that a cause of action arising out of a ""willful"" violation may be commenced within three years.  In the Secretary of Labor's enforcement action based on respondent's alleged failure to pay overtime compensation required by the FLSA, the District Court rejected respondent's claim that the 2-year statute of limitations applied, finding the 3-year exception applicable under the standard of Coleman v. Jiffy June Farms, Inc., 458 F.2d 1139, whereby an action is ""willful"" if there is substantial evidence that the employer ""knew or suspected that his actions might violate the FLSA,"" i.e., if he merely knew that the FLSA was ""in the picture.""  Vacating the judgment against respondent and remanding, the Court of Appeals rejected the Jiffy June standard in favor of the test employed in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111.
Held:  The standard of willfulness adopted in Thurston -- that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard as to whether its conduct was prohibited by the FLSA -- must be satisfied in order for the 3-year statute of limitations to apply.  This standard represents a fair reading of the Act's plain language, since it comports with the general understanding that the word ""willful"" refers to conduct that is ""voluntary,"" ""deliberate,"" or ""intentional,"" and not merely negligent.  In contrast, the statute's plain language does not support the Jiffy June standard, which effectively limits the normal 2-year statute of limitations to employers who are unaware of the FLSA and its potential applicability, and thereby virtually obliterates the distinction between willful and nonwillful violations which Congress obviously intended to draw.  Also rejected is the alternative, two-step standard espoused by the Secretary, whereby an FLSA violation would be deemed ""willful""
""if the employer, recognizing it might be covered by the FLSA, acted without a reasonable basis for believing that it was complying with the statute.""
This standard would permit a finding of willfulness to be based on nothing more than negligence, or, perhaps, on a completely good faith but incorrect assumption that a pay plan complied with the FLSA in all respects,

Syllabus 
After Leong Chong, a Singapore resident, was accidentally killed in that country while performing repair work on a ship owned by one of the respondents, a subsidiary of the other respondent, his widow, petitioner Chick Kam Choo (hereafter petitioner), also a Singapore resident, brought suit in Federal District Court alleging various causes of action, including claims under the general federal maritime law and the Texas Wrongful Death Statute.  In 1980, the court granted respondents summary judgment on the maritime law claim, concluding that applicable choice-of-law principles required that Singapore law, and not the maritime law of the United States, should apply.  The court also dismissed the rest of the case on federalforum non conveniens grounds, provided that respondents submit to the Singapore courts' jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed suit in the Texas state courts under the Texas statutes and Singapore law, but the Federal District Court enjoined petitioner from prosecuting any claims relating to her husband's death in the state courts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that the injunction violated the Anti-Injunction Act (Act), which generally bars federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings.  The court ruled that the injunction fell within the Act's ""relitigation"" exception, which permits a federal court to issue an injunction ""to protect or effectuate its judgments.""
Held:  Because the District Court's injunction barring the state court proceedings is broader than is necessary ""to protect or effectuate"" that court's 1980 judgment dismissing petitioner's lawsuit from federal court, this case must be remanded for the entry of a more narrowly tailored order.  Pp.  486 U. S. 145-151.
(a) An essential prerequisite for applying the Act's relitigation exception is that the claims or issues which the federal injunction insulates from state court litigation actually have been decided by the federal court.  This prerequisite is strict and narrow, requiring an assessment of the precise state of the record and what the earlier federal order actually said; it does not permit a post hoc judgment as to what the order was intended to say.  Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281. 
Page 486 U. S. 141

(b) Thus, since the 1980 judgment did not resolve the merits of petitioner's Singapore law claim, the injunction exceeded the Act's restrictions insofar as it barred the state courts from considering that claim.  The 1980 judgment simply resolved that petitioner's claims should be dismissed under the federal forum non conveniens doctrine, and did not determine whether the state courts are an appropriate forum for the Singapore law claim.  The Texas courts would apply a significantly different forum non conveniens analysis than the federal courts, and might well consider themselves an appropriate forum, in light of an ""open courts"" provision in the State Constitution.  The argument that an independent state forum non conveniens determination is preempted under the ""reverse-Erie"" principle of federal maritime law, see, e.g., Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207,  477 U. S. 222-223, cannot help respondents, since that preemption question was not actually litigated and decided by the District Court.  When a state proceeding presents a federal issue, even a preemption issue, the proper course under the Act is to allow the state court to resolve the issue.  Pp.  486 U. S. 148-150.
(c) Since petitioner's state law claim was necessarily adjudicated in the original federal action by the District Court's choice-of-law ruling that Singapore law controls petitioner's suit, the injunction, insofar as it barred the state courts from considering the state law claim, is within the scope of the relitigation exception, and is permissible under the Act.

 KERN TULARE WATER DISTRICTv. CITY OF BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA.No. 87-1433 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 16, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This Court has previously held that a municipality is immune from antitrust liability under the state action exemption if it can demonstrate that ""it is engaging in the challenged activity pursuant to a clearly expressed state policy."" Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 40, 1717 (1985); see Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). It is not necessary that the legislature explicitly state that it intends municipalities to engage in anticompetitive conduct pursuant to the state policy; it is enough that "" anticompetitive effects logically would result from [the] broad authority to regulate."" Hallie, supra, 471 U.S. at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 1718. From these principles, I had thought it clear that an antitrust violation would be established by showing that a municipality restrained trade by acting contrary to the clearly articulated state policy. Yet the Ninth Circuit has held here that ordinary ""abuses"" by local authorities in the field generally covered by the state policy are matters for state tribunals and not concerns of federal antitrust policy. 828 F.2d 514, 522 (1987). 
 The mischief of this unwarranted expansion of the state-action exemption can be seen in the facts of this case. All agree that an integral part of California's state water policy is its prohibition 
Page 486 U.S. 1015 , 1016
 against waste and unreasonable uses of water. Id., at 519 (citing Cal. Const., Art. 10, 2; Cal.Water Code Ann. 106.5 (West 1971)). Furthermore, the state policy expressly encourages municipalities to transfer water rights so as to improve the efficiency of water use. Cal. Water Code Ann. 109 (West Supp.1987). Here, petitioner water district alleged that respondent city controlled sources of water exceeding its annual needs, was in the business of reselling the surplus water for rural irrigation, and had entered a 35-year contract with petitioner, providing that petitioner would pay respondent $400,000 per year for 20,000 acre- feet of water per year. The water district alleged that, contrary to past years under the contract, the city refused to allow the district to transfer excess water to third parties, who evidenced their need for it by their willingness to pay. The city sent a letter explaining its stance as necessary to effectuate the contractual provision requiring that the water be used only by the district. Because the city refused to allow the district to transfer the water to third parties and because the district did not need the water, it eventually ran into the state aqueduct, either to be wasted as runoff into the sea or to flow to communities outside of the Kern County water basin. Whatever the fate of the dumped water, petitioner alleges that the city prevented the transfer to maintain its control of the resale market for irrigation water in Kern County. 
 The irony of the Ninth Circuit's decision is its bestowing of antitrust immunity for such conduct based on a state statutory scheme, which is intended to promote efficient use of water and prevent its waste. It seems questionable that the contractual prohibition of transfer rights, possibly resulting in the waste of the water and certainly preventing an efficient transfer, was the kind of action that the California Legislature contemplated when it enacted the statutory scheme. Hallie, supra, 471 U.S. at 44, 105 S.Ct. at 1719. Municipal actions that contravene express limits in the state policy would not seem to be taken pursuant to a clearly articulated policy and thus would not seem to be shielded by the state-action exemption. The Ninth Circuit's characterization of the alleged violation of state policy as an ordinary error or occasional abuse seems insufficient to insulate the municipality from liability for action that restrains competition. There seems little room in the Sherman Act's prohibition of restraint of trade for such a forgiving rule. [486 U.S. 1015 , 1017]

 KERN TULARE WATER DISTRICTv. CITY OF BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA.No. 87-1433 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 16, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This Court has previously held that a municipality is immune from antitrust liability under the state action exemption if it can demonstrate that ""it is engaging in the challenged activity pursuant to a clearly expressed state policy."" Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 40, 1717 (1985); see Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). It is not necessary that the legislature explicitly state that it intends municipalities to engage in anticompetitive conduct pursuant to the state policy; it is enough that "" anticompetitive effects logically would result from [the] broad authority to regulate."" Hallie, supra, 471 U.S. at 42, 105 S.Ct. at 1718. From these principles, I had thought it clear that an antitrust violation would be established by showing that a municipality restrained trade by acting contrary to the clearly articulated state policy. Yet the Ninth Circuit has held here that ordinary ""abuses"" by local authorities in the field generally covered by the state policy are matters for state tribunals and not concerns of federal antitrust policy. 828 F.2d 514, 522 (1987). 
 The mischief of this unwarranted expansion of the state-action exemption can be seen in the facts of this case. All agree that an integral part of California's state water policy is its prohibition

No. 87-6. Argued March 23, 1988
Decided May 2, 1988
485 U.S. 681

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides that evidence of ""other crimes, wrongs, or acts"" is not admissible to prove a person's character, but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of knowledge.  Petitioner was charged under federal law with the knowing possession and sale of stolen videocassette tapes.  At his trial, the District Court allowed the Government to introduce as evidence of ""similar acts"" under Rule 404(b) evidence of petitioner's involvement in a series of sales of allegedly stolen televisions and appliances from the same suspicious source as the tapes, concluding that such evidence had clear relevance as to petitioner's knowledge that the tapes were stolen.  The jury convicted petitioner on the possession count only, and the Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed, declaring that it could not say that the District Court had abused its discretion in admitting the ""similar acts"" evidence under United States v. Ebens, 800 F.2d 1422 (CA6), which authorized courts to admit such evidence if the proof showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant did in fact commit the prior bad act.
Held:  The district court need not itself make a preliminary finding that the Government has proved the ""other act"" by a preponderance of the evidence before it submits ""similar acts"" and other Rule 404(b) evidence to the jury.  The requirement of such a preliminary finding would be inconsistent with the structure of Article IV of the Rules, which allows the admission of relevant evidence for a proper purpose subject only to general strictures, with Rule 404(b)'s plain language, and with the legislative history behind that Rule.  Rather, ""similar"" acts evidence should be admitted if there is sufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury that the defendant committed the similar act.  Here, petitioner does not dispute that the evidence of the appliance sales was properly admitted.  Moreover, the trial court properly allowed the evidence of the television sales to go to the jury, since the jury reasonably could have concluded that the televisions were stolen in light of the low price sought by petitioner, the large quantity of televisions he offered for sale, his inability to produce a bill of sale, and his involvement in the sales of the stolen tapes and appliances.  Pp.  485 U. S. 685-692.
811 F.2d 974, affirmed.

Respondents, a newspaper and its executive editor, violated a temporary restraining order issued by the District Court in a civil suit brought to enjoin dissemination of surveillance logs and memoranda concerning the plaintiff's deceased father.  Although the court subsequently vacated the order, it nevertheless appointed a private attorney to prosecute respondents for criminal contempt of the order, declining to ask the United States Attorney to pursue the matter because of his representation of the federal defendants in the underlying civil action.  The court ultimately found respondents in criminal contempt, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the order was ""transparently invalid"" under the First Amendment.  Although the Solicitor General denied the special prosecutor authority to represent the United States in this Court in seeking reinstatement of the contempt judgment, the prosecutor nevertheless filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted, and briefed and argued the case.
Held:  Since the special prosecutor lacks authority to represent the United States before this Court, the writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Pp.  485 U. S. 699-708.
(a) Title 28 U.S.C.  518(a) and regulations issued by the Attorney General empower the Solicitor General or his designee to conduct and argue suits in this Court ""in which the United States is interested.""  Pp.  485 U. S. 699-708.

Nor does Young create an exception to 28 U.S.C.  516 and 547, and therefore to the similar provisions of  518(a).  Unlike  518(a), both  516 and  547 give the Attorney General exclusive control

Syllabus 
Petitioner and another retailer (Hartwell) were authorized by respondent manufacturer to sell its electronic calculators in the Houston area.  In response to Hartwell's complaints about petitioner's prices, respondent terminated petitioner's dealership.  Petitioner brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging that respondent and Hartwell had conspired to terminate petitioner, and that such conspiracy was illegal per se under  1 of the Sherman Act.  The court submitted a liability interrogatory to the jury asking whether there was an agreement or understanding between respondent and Hartwell to terminate petitioner's dealership because of its price cutting, and instructed the jury that the Sherman Act is violated when a seller enters into such an agreement or understanding with one of its dealers.  The jury answered the interrogatory affirmatively, awarding damages, and the court entered judgment for petitioner for treble damages.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that, to render illegal per se a vertical agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate a second dealer, the first dealer must expressly or impliedly agree to set its prices at some level.
Held:  A vertical restraint of trade is not per se illegal under  1 of the Sherman Act unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels.  Pp.  485 U. S. 723-736.
(a) Ordinarily, whether particular concerted action violates  1 is determined through case-by-case application of the rule of reason.  Per se rules are appropriate only for conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive.  Although vertical agreements on resale prices are illegal per se, extension of that treatment to other vertical restraints must be based on demonstrable economic effect, rather than upon formalistic line drawing.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, which held that vertical nonprice restraints are not per se illegal, recognized that such restraints have real potential to stimulate interbrand competition; that a rule of per se illegality for such restraints is not needed or effective to protect intrabrand competition; and that such restraints do not significantly facilitate cartelizing.  There has been no showing here that different characteristics attend an agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer to terminate a ""price cutter,"" without a further agreement on the 
Page 485 U. S. 718
 price or price levels to be charged by the remaining dealer.  A quite plausible purpose of the vertical restriction here was to enable Hartwell to provide better services under its sales franchise agreement with respondent.  There is also no merit to petitioner's contention that an agreement on the remaining dealer's price or price levels will so often follow from terminating another dealer because of its price cutting that prophylaxis against resale price maintenance warrants the District Court's per se rule.  Pp.  485 U. S. 723-731.
(b) The term ""restraint of trade"" in the Sherman Act, like the term at common law before the statute was adopted, refers not to a particular list of agreements, but to a particular economic consequence, which may be produced by quite different sorts of agreements in varying times and circumstances.  Moreover, this Court's precedents do not indicate that the pre-Sherman Act common law prohibited as illegal per se an agreement of the sort made here.  Nor is the District Court's rule of per se illegality compelled by precedents under the Sherman Act holding certain horizontal agreements to constitute price fixing, and thus to be per se illegal even though they did not set prices or price levels.  The notion of equivalence between the scope of horizontal per se illegality and that of vertical per se illegality was explicitly rejected in GTE Sylvania.  Finally, earlier vertical price-fixing cases are consistent with the proposition that vertical per se illegality requires an agreement setting a price or a price level.  Pp.  485 U. S. 731-735.

Syllabus 
The Immigration and Nationality Act provides for the denaturalization of citizens whose citizenship orders and certificates of naturalization ""were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.""  8 U.S.C.  1451(a).  In 1982, the United States filed a complaint pursuant to  1451(a) to denaturalize petitioner, who came to the United States in 1948 under an immigration visa which he had applied for in Germany in 1947 and was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1954.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioner.  It rejected the Government's first claim that petitioner had participated in executing Lithuanian citizens (most of them Jewish) in 1941, holding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charges.  Regarding the Government's second claim, the court held that, although petitioner had made false statements as to, inter alia, his date and place of birth in his visa and naturalization applications, the misrepresentations were not material within the meaning of  1451(a), as illuminated by Chaunt v. United States, 364 U. S. 350.  The court also rejected the Government's third asserted ground for denaturalization, that petitioner's citizenship had been ""illegally procured"" under  1451(a) for lack of ""good moral character,"" required for naturalization by 8 U.S.C.  1427 (a).  Although 8 U.S.C.  1101(f)(6) makes the giving of false testimony to obtain immigration or naturalization benefits determinative of lack of ""good moral character,"" the court ruled that petitioner's false statements were not covered by this provision, because they were not material.  The Court of Appeals declined to pass on the Government's submission as to its first claim, and upheld the District Court's rejection of the third asserted ground for denaturalization.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's rejection of the second ground, concluding that petitioner's willful misrepresentation in his visa and naturalization applications of the date and place of his birth was material for purposes of  1451(a)'s ""concealment or misrepresentation"" provision.  The Court of Appeals therefore reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded for denaturalization proceedings.

793 F.2d 516, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and III-A, concluding that:
1. For purposes of  1451(a)'s ""concealment or misrepresentation"" provision, the test of whether concealments or misrepresentations are ""material"" is whether they can be shown by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence to have been predictably capable of affecting, i.e., to have had a natural tendency to affect, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decisions.  This test is consistent with the lower federal courts' uniform understanding of the ""materiality"" concept as embodied in other federal statutes criminalizing false statements to public officials.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  1001, 1621, and 1623.  The dicta in Chaunt v. United States should not be used to construct a different materiality standard in the immigration context.  Materiality under  1451(a), as under other federal statutes, is an issue of law, which is for the court, and not one of fact, which must be decided by the trier of facts.  Pp.  485 U. S. 767-772.
2. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' holding (for purposes of the Government's claim under  1451(a)'s ""illegally procured"" provision),  1101 (f)(6) does not impose a materiality requirement for false testimony.  Section 1101(f)(6) -- which provides that a person shall be deemed not to be of good moral character if he ""has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining"" immigration or naturalization benefits -- is to be given its plain meaning, denominating one who has made false oral statements under oath with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration or naturalization benefits.  The absence of a materiality requirement in  1101 (f)(6) can be explained by the fact that its primary purpose is not (like the misrepresentation clause of  1451(a)) to prevent false pertinent data from being introduced into the naturalization process, but to identify lack of good moral character.  Pp.  485 U. S. 779-782.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE BRENNAN, and (as to Part III-B) JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded in Parts II-B and III-B, that:
1. Under the ""natural tendency"" test, petitioner's misrepresentation of the date and place of his birth in his 1954 naturalization petition was not shown to be clearly, unequivocally, and convincingly material within the meaning of  1451(a)'s ""concealment or misrepresentation"" provision.  It is improper to address the 1947 episode when petitioner made the same misrepresentation in his visa application, since  1451(a)'s ""concealment or misrepresentation"" clause is limited to falsehoods or deceptions that procure the order and certificate of naturalization.  As to petitioner's 
Page 485 U. S. 761
 naturalization petition, there has been no showing that the date and place of his birth were themselves relevant to his qualifications for citizenship or that true information, if supplied, would predictably have disclosed other facts relevant to his qualifications.  For purposes of determining the natural tendency of a misrepresentation to affect a decision under  1451(a), what must have a natural tendency to influence the official decision is the misrepresentation itself, not the failure to create an inconsistency with an earlier misrepresentation.
It is for the Third Circuit on remand to determine whether other misrepresentations or concealments that the District Court found to have been made in 1954 were supported by the evidence and material to the naturalization decision.  If so, it will have to reach another, independent  1451(a) issue:  whether petitioner ""procured"" his citizenship by means of those misrepresentations or concealments.  This does not require the Government to establish ""but for"" causality -- that is, that naturalization would not have been granted if the misrepresentations or concealments had not occurred.  Section 1451(a)'s ""procured by"" language should be read to express the notion that one who obtained his citizenship in a proceeding where he made material misrepresentations was presumably unqualified.  The naturalized citizen should be able to refute that presumption, and avoid the consequence of denaturalization, by showing, through a preponderance of the evidence, that the statutory requirement as to which the misrepresentation had a natural tendency to produce a favorable decision was in fact met.  Pp.  485 U. S. 772-779.
2. Although the Third Circuit erred in importing a materiality requirement into  1101(f)(6), denaturalization cannot be affirmed on the alternative basis of that section because the question whether any misrepresentation made by petitioner constituted ""false testimony for the purpose of obtaining"" immigration or naturalization benefits cannot be answered without resolving the additional question of law -- which this Court will not resolve because the case must be remanded -- as to whether petitioner's misrepresentation constituted ""testimony.""  Moreover, an additional question, which must be resolved by the trier of fact, is whether, in making the misrepresentations, petitioner possessed the subjective intent of thereby obtaining immigration or naturalization benefits.  P.  485 U. S. 782.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, would vacate the decision below and remand for further proceedings consistent with the following conclusions:
1. Our conclusion in Chaunt that the Government cannot denaturalize a citizen under the misrepresentation clause of  1451(a) without proving the existence of a disqualifying fact is supported by both the requirement that the misrepresentation be material and the requirement that it procure 
Page 485 U. S. 762
 citizenship.  Together and separately, the materiality and procurement requirements reflect congressional intent that citizenship status not be taken away unless the Government proves that the defendant was not qualified to hold that status at the time citizenship was obtained.
A misrepresentation is material within the meaning of  1451(a) only if it is capable of influencing the decision whether to confer citizenship.  Because the decision whether to confer citizenship is an objective one, the only statements that are capable of influencing the outcome are those that conceal disqualifying facts or that prevent or hinder the discovery of disqualifying facts.
To demonstrate that citizenship was ""procured by"" a material misrepresentation, the Government must demonstrate by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that it relied on the misrepresentation in deciding whether to confer citizenship.  Unless a disqualifying fact existed, it cannot be said that a misrepresentation procured citizenship.  Thus, the existence of a disqualifying fact is a necessary element of the Government's proof of materiality and reliance.  Pp.  485 U. S. 785-795.
2. A citizen cannot be found to lack good moral character under  1101(f)(6) for giving ""false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits"" under the naturalization laws unless the false statements were material and had the actual effect of securing some benefit under the immigration and naturalization laws.  A materiality requirement is implicit in  1101(f)(6).  In Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S. 490, we held that the language of  10 of the Displaced Persons Act providing for the exclusion from the United States of persons who willfully made misrepresentations for the purpose of gaining admission to the United States implicitly included a materiality requirement.  The logic of our decision in Fedorenko applies equally here.
An objective test of whether a false statement was made for the purpose of obtaining a benefit under the immigration laws is more reasonable than a subjective test.  An objective test is more consistent with the heavy burden of proof borne by the Government in denaturalization cases, and has the virtue of diminishing the risk of erroneous determinations.  Pp.  485 U. S. 795-800.

Argued April 27, 1987

485 U.S. 759

Syllabus 
The Immigration and Nationality Act provides for the denaturalization of citizens whose citizenship orders and certificates of naturalization ""were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.""  8 U.S.C.  1451(a).  In 1982, the United States filed a complaint pursuant to  1451(a) to denaturalize petitioner, who came to the United States in 1948 under an immigration visa which he had applied for in Germany in 1947 and was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1954.  The District Court entered judgment for petitioner.  It rejected the Government's first claim that petitioner had participated in executing Lithuanian citizens (most of them Jewish) in 1941, holding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charges.  Regarding the Government's second claim, the court held that, although petitioner had made false statements as to, inter alia, his date and place of birth in his visa and naturalization applications, the misrepresentations were not material within the meaning of  1451(a), as illuminated by Chaunt v. United States, 364 U. S. 350.  The court also rejected the Government's third asserted ground for denaturalization, that petitioner's citizenship had been ""illegally procured"" under  1451(a) for lack of ""good moral character,"" required for naturalization by 8 U.S.C.  1427 (a).  Although 8 U.S.C.  1101(f)(6) makes the giving of false testimony to obtain immigration or naturalization benefits determinative of lack of ""good moral character,"" the court ruled that petitioner's false statements were not covered by this provision, because they were not material.  The Court of Appeals declined to pass on the Government's submission as to its first claim, and upheld the District Court's rejection of the third asserted ground for denaturalization.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's rejection of the second ground, concluding that petitioner's willful misrepresentation in his visa and naturalization applications of the date and place of his birth was material for purposes of  1451(a)'s ""concealment or misrepresentation"" provision.  The Court of Appeals therefore reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded for denaturalization proceedings.

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting: 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973-2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate petitioner's death sentence. But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition for certiorari and remand this case for a hearing to consider petitioner's claim that the prosecutor improperly used peremptory challenges to exclude black persons from the jury in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 
 The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the prosecution's exercise of peremptory challenges against prospective jurors "" solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State's case against a black defendant."" Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89, 1719 (1986). Recognizing the ""crippling burden"" that up to then had been placed on defendants claiming discrimination, id., at 92, this Court in Batson dramatically altered the evidentiary burden facing defendants who claim that a prosecutor has improperly used peremptory challenges to exclude members of their racial group from a jury panel. Under Batson, a defendant makes a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination in the selection of the venire by showing that he is a member 
Page 485 U.S. 1040 , 1041
 of a cognizable racial group, that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race, and that these facts, along with any other relevant circumstances, raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude venirepersons on account of their race. Id., at 96. Once the defendant makes such a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the prosecution to come forward with a race-neutral explanation for challenging the prospective jurors. Id., at 97. 
 In this case, petitioner, a black man, was charged with murdering a white woman in the course of committing a robbery. During jury selection, the prosecution exercised three peremptory strikes to exclude black jurors from the venire. The prosecution also challenged for cause five other black venirepersons. Although petitioner complained about the exclusion of black persons from the jury, the trial court apparently never asked the prosecutor to explain the exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude black venirepersons, and no explanation was given. As a result of the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges and exclusions for cause, only one black person was ultimately selected to serve on the jury that convicted petitioner and sentenced him to death. Although the record is sparse, in my view petitioner has made a prima facie showing under Batson of the discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges. 
 Because petitioner has made a prima facie showing of discrimination, the burden falls on the prosecution to give a race-neutral explanation for its use of peremptory challenges. Petitioner's trial concluded before this Court decided Batson, so it is not surprising that the trial court failed to determine whether the prosecutor could proffer a race-neutral explanation for the challenges.* Under these circumstances, I would vacate the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and remand with instructions that a hearing be held to consider petitioner's claim that the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges violated his rights under the Equal Protection Clause. 
[Footnote *] In Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 328, 716 (1987), this Court ruled that the holding of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), ""is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final."" When Batson was decided, petitioner's case was still pending on direct review of his conviction and sentence.

No. 86-787
Argued December 1, 1987
Decided April 27, 1988
485 U.S. 624

Syllabus 
After respondent stopped making $150 monthly child support payments to his ex-wife under a California state court order, he was served with an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt on nine counts of failure to make the payments.  At the contempt hearing, his defense that he was financially unable to make payments was partially successful, but he was adjudged in contempt on five counts; was sentenced to a 5-day jail term on each count, to be served consecutively; and was placed on probation for three years upon suspension of the sentence.  As conditions of his probation, he was ordered to resume the monthly payments and to begin repaying $50 per month on his accumulated arrearages.  During the contempt hearing, the court rejected his contention that the application against him of Cal.Civ.Proc.Ann.  1209.5 (West 1982), governing the prima facie showing of contempt of a court order to make child support payments, was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause because it shifts to the defendant the burden of proof as to ability to comply with the order, which is an element of the crime of contempt.  The California Court of Appeal annulled the contempt order, ruling that  1209.5 purports to impose ""a mandatory presumption compelling a conclusion of guilt without independent proof of an ability to pay,"" and is therefore unconstitutional because ""the mandatory nature of the presumption lessens the prosecution's burden of proof.""  The court went on to state that, for future guidance, however, the statute should be construed as authorizing a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption.  The California Supreme Court denied review.
Held:
1. With regard to the determination of issues necessary to decide this case, the state appellate court ruled that whether the individual is able to comply with a court order is an element of the offense of contempt, rather than an affirmative defense to the charge, and that  1209.5 shifts to the alleged contemnor the burden of persuasion, rather than simply the burden of production in showing inability to comply.  Since the California Supreme Court denied review, this Court is not free to overturn the 
Page 485 U. S. 625
 state appellate court's conclusions as to these state law issues.  However, the issue whether the contempt proceeding and the relief given were properly characterized as civil or criminal in nature, for purposes of determining the proper applicability of federal constitutional protections, raises a question of federal law, rather than state law.  Thus, the state appellate court erred insofar as it sustained respondent's challenge to  1209.5 under the Due Process Clause simply because it concluded that the contempt proceeding was ""quasi-criminal"" as a matter of California law.

2. For the purposes of applying the Due Process Clause to a State's proceedings, state law provides strong guidance, but is not dispositive, as to the classification of the proceeding or the relief imposed as civil or criminal.  The critical features are the substance of the proceeding and the character of the relief that the proceeding will afford.  With regard to contempt cases, the proceeding and remedy are for civil contempt if the punishment is remedial, and for the complainant's benefit.  But if for criminal contempt, the sentence is punitive, to vindicate the court's authority.  Thus, if the relief provided is a sentence of imprisonment, it is remedial if the defendant stands committed unless and until he performs the affirmative act required by the court's order, and is punitive if the sentence is limited to unconditional imprisonment for a definite period.  If the relief provided is a fine, it is remedial when it is paid to the complainant, and punitive when it is paid to the court, though a fine that is payable to the court is also remedial when the defendant can avoid paying the fine simply by performing the act required by the court's order.  These distinctions lead to the fundamental proposition that criminal penalties may not be imposed on someone who has not been afforded the protections that the Constitution requires of criminal proceedings, including the requirement that the offense be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Pp.  485 U. S. 631-635.
3. Although the underlying purposes of particular kinds of relief are germane, they are not controlling in determining the classification of the relief imposed in a State's proceedings.  In contempt cases, both civil and criminal relief have aspects that can be seen as either remedial or punitive, or both.  If classification were to be hinged on the overlapping purposes of civil and criminal contempt proceedings, the States will be unable to ascertain with any degree of assurance how their proceedings will be understood as a matter of federal law, thus creating novel and complex problems.  Pp.  485 U. S. 635-637.
4. In respondent's contempt proceeding,  1209.5's burden of persuasion requirement (as interpreted by the state court), if applied in a criminal proceeding, would violate the Due Process Clause because it would undercut the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  
Page 485 U. S. 626
 If applied in a civil proceeding, however, this particular statute would be constitutionally valid.  There were strong indications that the proceeding was intended to be criminal in nature, such as the notice sent to respondent, which labeled the proceeding as ""criminal in nature,"" and the District Attorney's participation in the case.  However, if the trial court imposed only civil coercive remedies, it would be improper to invalidate that result merely because the Due Process Clause was not satisfied.  The relief afforded -- respondent's jail sentence, its suspension, and his fixed term of probation -- would be criminal in nature if that were all.  However, the trial court did not specify whether payment of the arrearages (which, if timely made, would be completed before expiration of the probation period) would have purged respondent's determinate sentence, thus making the relief civil in nature.  Since the state appellate court, because of its erroneous views as to these controlling principles of federal law, did not pass on this issue, it must be determined by that court on remand for its further consideration of  1209.5.

No. 86-787
Argued December 1, 1987
Decided April 27, 1988
485 U.S. 624

Syllabus 
After respondent stopped making $150 monthly child support payments to his ex-wife under a California state court order, he was served with an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt on nine counts of failure to make the payments.  At the contempt hearing, his defense that he was financially unable to make payments was partially successful, but he was adjudged in contempt on five counts; was sentenced to a 5-day jail term on each count, to be served consecutively; and was placed on probation for three years upon suspension of the sentence.  As conditions of his probation, he was ordered to resume the monthly payments and to begin repaying $50 per month on his accumulated arrearages.  During the contempt hearing, the court rejected his contention that the application against him of Cal.Civ.Proc.Ann.  1209.5 (West 1982), governing the prima facie showing of contempt of a court order to make child support payments, was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause because it shifts to the defendant the burden of proof as to ability to comply with the order, which is an element of the crime of contempt.  The California Court of Appeal annulled the contempt order, ruling that  1209.5 purports to impose ""a mandatory presumption compelling a conclusion of guilt without independent proof of an ability to pay,"" and is therefore unconstitutional because ""the mandatory nature of the presumption lessens the prosecution's burden of proof.""  The court went on to state that, for future guidance, however, the statute should be construed as authorizing a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption.  The California Supreme Court denied review.
Held:
1. With regard to the determination of issues necessary to decide this case, the state appellate court ruled that whether the individual is able to comply with a court order is an element of the offense of contempt, rather than an affirmative defense to the charge, and that  1209.5 shifts to the alleged contemnor the burden of persuasion, rather than simply the burden of production in showing inability to comply.  Since the California Supreme Court denied review, this Court is not free to overturn the 
Page 485 U. S. 625
 state appellate court's conclusions as to these state law issues.  However, the issue whether the contempt proceeding and the relief given were properly characterized as civil or criminal in nature, for purposes of determining the proper applicability of federal constitutional protections, raises a question of federal law, rather than state law.  Thus, the state appellate court erred insofar as it sustained respondent's challenge to  1209.5 under the Due Process Clause simply because it concluded that the contempt proceeding was ""quasi-criminal"" as a matter of California law.  Pp.  485 U. S. 629-630.

No. 86-2037
Argued March 29, 1988

485 U.S. 652

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a passenger engineer employed by respondent railroad corporation (Amtrak), belongs to the United Transportation Union (UTU) rather than to respondent Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), the union that represents Amtrak engineers for collective bargaining purposes.  Petitioner's request that the UTU be allowed to represent him at a company-level disciplinary hearing was denied on the ground that, under the BLE-Amtrak collective bargaining agreement, only the BLE could undertake such representation.  Petitioner represented himself at the hearing and received a 30-day suspension for violating company work rules, which he did not appeal to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.  He then filed suit in Federal District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against Amtrak and the BLE on the ground that their refusal to allow his representation by the UTU at the hearing violated his rights under the Railway Labor Act (RLA).  The court dismissed the complaint after a bench trial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The RLA does not entitle a railroad employee to be represented at company-level grievance or disciplinary proceedings by a union other than his collective bargaining representative.  Petitioner's contention that a right to such representation is implicit in  2, Eleventh (c), of the RLA, which permits a union-shop requirement to be satisfied by membership in any national union organized in accordance with the Act, is without merit, since that provision was enacted for the single, narrow purpose of preventing compulsory dual unionism or the necessity of an employee's changing unions upon a change in crafts, Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Rychlik, 352 U. S. 480, which purpose has been satisfied here, since petitioner has not been required to join the BLE.  Nor does any other RLA provision expressly address the question of minority union representation at company-level proceedings; in fact,  3, First (i), provides merely that such proceedings shall be handled in ""the usual manner.""  That Congress, in  3, First (j), expressly allowed employees the representative of their choice at the Adjustment Board level, but did not do so with regard to the earlier, company-level phase, is persuasive evidence that Congress did not believe that minority union participation at 
Page 485 U. S. 653
 the company level was necessary to accomplish the RLA's purposes.  Petitioner will not suffer appreciable prejudice because of the UTU's inability to represent him at proceedings conducted on company property, since it may be assumed that he will be adequately protected under the BLE's duty of fair representation, and since the UTU may represent him before the Adjustment Board if the company proceedings do not resolve the dispute.

Syllabus 
On the basis of their employer's policy prohibiting its employees from using illegal nonprescription drugs, respondent drug and alcohol abuse rehabilitation counselors were discharged for ingesting a small quantity of peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes during a religious ceremony of the Native American Church.  It is undisputed that respondents are members of that church and that their religious beliefs are sincere.  Respondents applied for and were denied unemployment compensation by petitioner Employment Division under an Oregon statute disqualifying employees discharged for work-connected misconduct.  The State Court of Appeals reversed.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, reasoning that, although the benefits denials were proper under Oregon law, Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, and Thomas v. Review Bd., Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, required the court to hold that the denials significantly burdened respondents' religious freedom in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution.  In reaching that conclusion, the court attached no significance to the fact that peyote possession is a felony in Oregon, declaring that the legality of ingesting peyote did not affect its analysis of the State's interest in denying benefits, which must be found in the unemployment compensation, rather than the criminal, statutes.
Held:  These cases must be remanded to the State Supreme Court for a definitive ruling as to whether the religious use of peyote is legal in Oregon, since that question is relevant to the federal constitutional analysis.  Although Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n, 480 U. S. 136, prohibited the denial of unemployment compensation to employees required to choose between fidelity to their religious beliefs and cessation of work, those cases all involved employee conduct that was perfectly legal.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, Division F. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973- 2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant this petition for certiorari because the state courts refused to grant petitioner appropriate relief for 
Page 485 U.S. 1024 , 1025
 the State's violation of his rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). In so doing, the state courts countenanced impermissible official conduct and left the victim of this conduct without effective constitutional protection. 
 I  
 In 1980, petitioner Ronald Monroe was brought to trial in New Orleans for the murder of Lenora Collins, a neighbor. The State's case against petitioner consisted solely of eyewitness identifications by the victim's two children, both of whom were present when an assailant broke into their mother's bedroom and stabbed her. There was no physical evidence linking petitioner to the offense. The jury, apparently crediting the testimony of the two children, who at the time of the murder were aged 12 and 11, found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and unanimously recommended the death sentence. 
 Six months after Monroe's conviction, Detective Joseph Gallardo of the Pontiac, Michigan, Police Department contacted a member of the New Orleans Police Department to relate information pertinent to the murder of Lenora Collins. While investigating one George Stinson's murder of his common-law wife, Detective Gallardo had received a tip suggesting that Stinson also may have murdered Collins, who was Stinson's previous wife. This tip appeared plausible because both women had died from stab wounds to the neck and chest. Two months after imparting this information, Gallardo again called the New Orleans police. This time, Gallardo told Sergeant John McKenzie about a recent interview he had conducted with Stinson's cellmate. In the interview, the cellmate had quoted Stinson as first confessing to the Michigan murder and then stating that ""the same thing happened"" to Collins. The cellmate also had reported that Stinson had confessed to threatening his stepchildren into identifying petitioner as their mother's killer. According to Gallardo, the Michigan case also contained a suggestion of witness intimidation. 
 All of this information was transmitted to the New Orleans detectives who had handled the investigation of Collins' murder. These detectives did not make any further inquiries relating to the Collins case. Neither did the detectives inform petitioner or his counsel of Gallardo's communications. Not until two years later did petitioner's counsel discover, through independent investig- [485 U.S. 1024 , 1026]

 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973- 2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant this petition for certiorari because the state courts refused to grant petitioner appropriate relief for 
Page 485 U.S. 1024 , 1025
 the State's violation of his rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). In so doing, the state courts countenanced impermissible official conduct and left the victim of this conduct without effective constitutional protection.

 In 1980, petitioner Ronald Monroe was brought to trial in New Orleans for the murder of Lenora Collins, a neighbor. The State's case against petitioner consisted solely of eyewitness identifications by the victim's two children, both of whom were present when an assailant broke into their mother's bedroom and stabbed her. There was no physical evidence linking petitioner to the offense. The jury, apparently crediting the testimony of the two children, who at the time of the murder were aged 12 and 11, found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder and unanimously recommended the death sentence. 
 Six months after Monroe's conviction, Detective Joseph Gallardo of the Pontiac, Michigan, Police Department contacted a member of the New Orleans Police Department to relate information pertinent to the murder of Lenora Collins. While investigating one George Stinson's murder of his common-law wife, Detective Gallardo had received a tip suggesting that Stinson also may have murdered Collins, who was Stinson's previous wife. This tip appeared plausible because both women had died from stab wounds to the neck and chest. Two months after imparting this information, Gallardo again called the New Orleans police. This time, Gallardo told Sergeant John McKenzie about a recent interview he had conducted with Stinson's cellmate. In the interview, the cellmate had quoted Stinson as first confessing to the Michigan murder and then stating that ""the same thing happened"" to Collins. The cellmate also had reported that Stinson had confessed to threatening his stepchildren into identifying petitioner as their mother's killer. According to Gallardo, the Michigan case also contained a suggestion of witness intimidation. 
 All of this information was transmitted to the New Orleans detectives who had handled the investigation of Collins' murder. These detectives did not make any further inquiries relating to the Collins case. Neither did the detectives inform petitioner or his counsel of Gallardo's communications. Not until two years later did petitioner's counsel discover, through independent investig- [485 U.S. 1024 , 1026]

No. 94, Orig.
Argued December 7, 1987
Decided April 20, 1988
485 U.S. 505

Syllabus 
Section 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 removes the federal income tax exemption for interest earned on publicly offered long-term bonds (hereinafter referred to as bonds) issued by state and local governments (hereinafter referred to collectively as States) unless those bonds are issued in registered (as opposed to bearer) form.  South Carolina invoked this Court's original jurisdiction, contending that  310(b)(1) is constitutionally invalid under the Tenth Amendment and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.  A Special Master was appointed.  After conducting hearings and taking evidence, he concluded that  310(b)(1) is constitutional, and recommended entering judgment for the defendant.  South Carolina and the National Governors' Association (NGA), as an intervenor, filed exceptions to various factual findings of the Master and to his legal conclusions concerning their constitutional challenges.
Held:
1. Section 310(b)(1) does not violate the Tenth Amendment or constitutional principles of federalism by effectively compelling States to issue bonds in registered form.  Pp.  485 U. S. 511-515.
(a) The Tenth Amendment limits on Congress' authority to regulate state activities are structural, not substantive -- that is, the States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.  In this case, South Carolina has not even alleged that it was deprived of any right to participate in the national political process or that it was singled out in a way that left it politically isolated and powerless.  The allegations South Carolina does make -- that Congress was uninformed and chose an ineffective remedy -- do not amount to an allegation that the political process operated in a defective manner.  Pp.  485 U. S. 512-513.
(b) NGA's contention that  310 is invalid because it commandeers the state legislative and administrative process by coercing States into enacting legislation authorizing bond registration and into administering the registration scheme finds no support in the claim left open by FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742.  Section 310 regulates state activities; it does not, as did the statute in FERC, seek to control or influence the 
Page 485 U. S. 506
 manner in which States regulate private parties.  That a State wishing to engage in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.  Moreover, under NGA's theory, any State could immunize its activities from federal regulation by simply codifying the manner in which it engages in those activities.  Pp.  485 U. S. 513-515.
2. Section 310(b)(1) does not violate the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity by taxing the interest earned on unregistered state bonds.  Section 310(b)(1) is inconsistent with this Court's holding in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, that state bond interest was immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax, but that decision has been effectively overruled by subsequent case law.  Under the intergovernmental tax immunity jurisprudence prevailing at Pollock's time, neither the Federal nor the State Governments could tax income that an individual directly derived from any contract with the other government.  This general rule was based on the rationale that any tax on income a party received under a contract with the government was a tax on the contract, and thus a tax ""on"" the government, because it burdened the government's power to enter into the contract.  That rationale has been repudiated by modern intergovernmental tax immunity case law, and the government contract immunities have been, one by one, overruled.  The owners of state bonds have no constitutional entitlement not to pay taxes on income they earn from the bonds, and States have no constitutional entitlement to issue bonds paying lower interest rates than other issuers.  The nondiscriminatory tax under  310 is imposed on and collected from bondholders, not States, and any increased administrative costs incurred by States in implementing the registration system are not ""taxes"" within the meaning of the tax immunity doctrine.  Moreover, the provisions of  310 seek to assure that all publicly offered long-term bonds are issued in registered form, whether issued by state or local governments, the Federal Government, or private corporations.  Pp.  485 U. S. 515-527.
Exceptions to Special Master's Report overruled, and judgment entered for defendant.

No. 86-622
Argued December 7, 1987

485 U.S. 535

Syllabus 
Petitioners in these cases are honorably discharged veterans who did not exhaust their ""GI Bill"" educational assistance benefits within 10 years following their military service, as required by 38 U.S.C.  1662(a)(1).  Under that section, veterans may obtain an extension of the delimiting period if they were prevented from using their benefits earlier by ""a physical or mental disorder which was not the result of [their] own willful misconduct.""  Petitioners sought to continue receiving benefits after the expiration of the 10-year period on the ground that they were disabled by alcoholism during much of that period.  The Veterans' Administration (VA) found that, under its regulation defining ""primary"" alcoholism (that which is unrelated to an underlying psychiatric disorder) as ""willful misconduct,"" petitioners were not entitled to the requested extensions.  Petitioners filed separate federal court actions to review the VA's decisions.  In No. 86-622, the District Court held that it was not foreclosed from exercising jurisdiction by 38 U.S.C.  211(a), which bars judicial review of ""the decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans' Administration providing benefits for veterans.""  The court then concluded that alcoholism is a handicap within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and that the VA therefore violated  504 of that Act, which requires that federal programs not discriminate against handicapped persons solely because of their handicap.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed on the ground that  211(a) barred judicial review of the Rehabilitation Act claim.  In No. 86-737, the District Court held that judicial review was not foreclosed by  211(a), and then invalidated the VA's alcoholism regulation as being contrary to the Rehabilitation Act.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed that judicial review was not foreclosed by  211(a), but reversed on the merits, holding that, consistently with the Rehabilitation Act, the VA could reasonably conclude, 
Page 485 U. S. 536
 pursuant to its regulation, that primary alcoholism is a ""willfully caused handicap.""
Held:
1. The question whether the VA's alcoholism regulation violates the Rehabilitation Act is not foreclosed from judicial review by  211(a).  The presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action may be overcome only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  The prohibitions of  211(a) are aimed at review only of those decisions of law or fact that arise in the administration by the VA of a statute providing benefits for veterans.  The text and legislative history of  211(a) provide no clear and convincing evidence of any congressional intent to preclude a suit claiming that  504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a statute applicable to all federal agencies, has invalidated an otherwise valid regulation issued by the VA and purporting to have the force of law.  The present cases involve the issue whether the law sought to be administered is valid in light of a subsequent statute whose enforcement is not the exclusive domain of the VA.  Permitting these cases to go forward will not undermine  211(a)'s purposes.  Pp.  485 U. S. 541-545.
2. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act is not violated by the VA's characterizing, for purposes of 38 U.S.C.  1662(a)(1), petitioners' primary alcoholism as ""willful misconduct"" precluding the allowance of petitioners' requested time extensions.  Congress did not use the term ""willful misconduct"" inadvertently in 1977 when it amended  1662(a)(1) to create the exception to the delimiting period.  The same term had long been used in other veterans' benefits statutes, and the VA had long construed the term as encompassing primary alcoholism.  The legislative history confirms that Congress intended that the VA apply the same test of ""willful misconduct"" in granting extensions of time under  1662(a)(1).  In 1978, when  504 was amended to extend its discrimination prohibition to programs conducted by federal agencies, Congress did not affirmatively evince any intent to repeal  1662(a)(1)'s ""willful misconduct"" provision.  Moreover, petitioners have not overcome the cardinal rule that repeals by implication are not favored.  The 1978 legislation did not expressly contradict the more narrow and specific 1977 legislation, and is not rendered meaningless, even with respect to those who claim to have been handicapped as a result of alcoholism, if the ""willful misconduct"" provision of  1662(a)(1) is allowed to retain the import originally intended by Congress.  There is no inconsistency between  504 and a conclusive presumption that alcoholism not motivated by mental illness is necessarily ""willful.""  Pp.  485 U. S. 545-551.

485 U.S. 568

Syllabus 
Because a construction company building a department store for a tenant at petitioner's shopping mall allegedly paid substandard wages and fringe benefits, respondent union peacefully distributed handbills at the mall's entrances (but did not picket or otherwise patrol), urging customers not to shop at any of the mall's stores until petitioner promised that all mall construction would be done by contractors paying fair wages.  A complaint based on petitioner's charge that respondent had committed an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was dismissed by the National Labor Relations Board (Board), which concluded that the handbilling was protected by  8 (b)(4)'s proviso exempting nonpicketing publicity intended to inform the customers of a distributor of goods that the goods were produced by an employer involved in a labor dispute.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  But this Court reversed on the ground that the publicity proviso did not apply, since petitioner and the other mall tenants did not distribute the construction company's products, and remanded for a determination whether  8(b)(4) had been violated, and, if so, whether the handbilling was protected by the First Amendment.  Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. NLRB, 463 U. S. 147.  On remand, the Board held that the handbilling violated  8(b)(4)(ii)(B) -- which forbids a union to ""threaten, coerce, or restrain"" any person to cease doing business with another person -- but declined to consider First Amendment questions.  Because it had serious doubts about  8(b)(4)'s constitutionality under the Board's interpretation, the Court of Appeals below applied NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, and ruled that neither the statute's language nor its legislative history revealed a clear congressional intent to proscribe such handbilling.  Consequently, construing the section as not prohibiting consumer publicity, the court denied enforcement of the Board's order.
Held:  The Court of Appeals did not err in construing  8(b)(4) as not reaching respondent's handbilling.  That construction makes it unnecessary to pass upon the serious First Amendment questions that would be raised by the Board's interpretation.  Pp.  485 U. S. 574-588. 
Page 485 U. S. 569

(a) Although the Board's NLRA interpretations are normally entitled to deference, where, as here, an otherwise acceptable construction would raise serious constitutional problems, Catholic Bishop requires courts to construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to Congress' intent.  Pp.  485 U. S. 574-578.
(b) Section 8(b)(4) does not contain any clear expression of congressional intent to proscribe respondent's handbilling.  Contrary to the Board's interpretation, such handbilling need not be held to ""coerce"" mall customers or secondary employers within the meaning of  8(b) (4)(ii)(B), since there was no violence, picketing, patrolling, or other intimidating conduct, but only an attempt to persuade customers not to shop in the mall.  Cf. NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58.  NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, 447 U. S. 607, distinguished.  Moreover, the fact that handbilling and other nonpicketing consumer appeals not involving a distributor are outside the publicity proviso's protection does not require the conclusion that such appeals must be considered coercive under  8(b)(4)(ii).  It was this very issue on which this Court earlier remanded this case.  The proviso need not be treated as establishing an exception to an otherwise all-encompassing prohibition on publicity, but may more reasonably be read as providing protection for a type of communication that might otherwise be considered coercive, even though other forms of publicity would not be so considered.  Nor does the legislative history contain any clear indication that Congress intended  8(b)(4)(ii) to proscribe peaceful handbilling, unaccompanied by picketing, urging a consumer boycott of a neutral employer.  Pp.  485 U. S. 578-588.

A complaint based on petitioner's charge that respondent had committed an unfair labor practice under  8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was dismissed by the National Labor Relations Board (Board), which concluded that the handbilling was protected by  8 (b)(4)'s proviso exempting nonpicketing publicity intended to inform the customers of a distributor of goods that the goods were produced by an employer involved in a labor dispute.  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  But this Court reversed on the ground that the publicity proviso did not apply, since petitioner and the other mall tenants did not distribute the construction company's products, and remanded for a determination whether  8(b)(4) had been violated, and, if so, whether the handbilling was protected by the First Amendment.  Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. NLRB, 463 U. S. 147.  On remand, the Board held that the handbilling violated  8(b)(4)(ii)(B) -- which forbids a union to ""threaten, coerce, or restrain"" any person to cease doing business with another person -- but declined to consider First Amendment questions.  Because it had serious doubts about  8(b)(4)'s constitutionality under the Board's interpretation, the Court of Appeals below applied NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, and ruled that neither the statute's language nor its legislative history revealed a clear congressional intent to proscribe such handbilling.  Consequently, construing the section as not prohibiting consumer publicity, the court denied enforcement of the Board's order.
Held:  The Court of Appeals did not err in construing  8(b)(4) as not reaching respondent's handbilling.  That construction makes it unnecessary to pass upon the serious First Amendment questions that would be raised by the Board's interpretation.  Pp.  485 U. S. 574-588. 
Page 485 U. S. 569

(a) Although the Board's NLRA interpretations are normally entitled to deference, where, as here, an otherwise acceptable construction would raise serious constitutional problems, Catholic Bishop requires courts to construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to Congress' intent.  Pp.  485 U. S. 574-578.
(b) Section 8(b)(4) does not contain any clear expression of congressional intent to proscribe respondent's handbilling.  Contrary to the Board's interpretation, such handbilling need not be held to ""coerce"" mall customers or secondary employers within the meaning of  8(b) (4)(ii)(B), since there was no violence, picketing, patrolling, or other intimidating conduct, but only an attempt to persuade customers not to shop in the mall.  Cf. NLRB v. Fruit Packers, 377 U. S. 58.  NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, 447 U. S. 607, distinguished.  Moreover, the fact that handbilling and other nonpicketing consumer appeals not involving a distributor are outside the publicity proviso's protection does not require the conclusion that such appeals must be considered coercive under  8(b)(4)(ii).  It was this very issue on which this Court earlier remanded this case.  The proviso need not be treated as establishing an exception to an otherwise all-encompassing prohibition on publicity, but may more reasonably be read as providing protection for a type of communication that might otherwise be considered coercive, even though other forms of publicity would not be so considered.  Nor does the legislative history contain any clear indication that Congress intended  8(b)(4)(ii) to proscribe peaceful handbilling, unaccompanied by picketing, urging a consumer boycott of a neutral employer.  Pp.  485 U. S. 578-588.

Syllabus 
The Private Express Statutes establish the postal monopoly and generally prohibit the private carriage of letters over postal routes without the payment of postage to the United States Postal Service.  On the basis of those statutes, the state university (governed by appellant Regents and hereafter referred to as appellant) refused the request of a union to use its internal mail system to carry unstamped letters from the union to certain of its employees whom the union was attempting to organize.  Appellee Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) upheld the union's charge that appellant's refusal violated the requirement of the California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) that employers grant unions access to their ""means of communication.""  Agreeing with this holding, but noting that the HEERA right of access was expressly subject to ""reasonable regulations,"" the State Court of Appeal remanded for a determination whether appellant's refusal was reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances, including the Private Express Statutes.  PERB then found that the HEERA requirement was consistent with federal law because the carriage involved fell within the ""letters of the carrier"" and the ""private hands"" exceptions to the Private Express Statutes.  The Court of Appeal affirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied review.
Held:  Appellant's delivery of the union's unstamped letters would violate the Private Express Statutes.  Pp.  485 U. S. 594-603.
(a) The ""letters of the carrier"" exception, which permits the private carriage of letters that ""relate"" to the ""current business"" of the carrier, does not apply.  The alleged ""business"" in this case -- the union's efforts to organize appellant's employees -- although a subject in which appellant certainly is interested, is not close enough to appellant's own affairs to be the natural subject of letters concerning appellant's ""current business.""  It is a subject more accurately described as the union's own current business.  The argument that HEERA makes harmonious labor relations the business of state universities, thereby rendering the union's business appellant's business, is a far too expansive reading of the exception, since that reading would permit a State to define mail delivery as the 
Page 485 U. S. 590
 ""current business"" of some state agency, and thereby defeat the postal monopoly.  Rather, the legislative history confirms that the statutory language is much narrower than appellees contend, which view is consistent with this Court's only previous decision concerning the exception, United States v. Erie R. Co., 235 U. S. 513.
(b) Nor does the ""private hands"" exception apply, since delivery of the union's letters would violate the exception's requirement that carriage be ""without compensation.""  Giving the quoted phrase its normal meaning, it is clear that Congress unambiguously intended that no form of compensation, whether direct or indirect, may flow from the sender to the carrier.  An arm's-length business relationship such as the one between the union and the employees on the one side and appellant on the other ordinarily involves an exchange of benefits constituting ""compensation"" for the carrier.  By delivering the union's unstamped letters, appellant would perform a service for its employees that they would otherwise pay for through their union dues, which service would become part of the employees' package of monetary and nonmonetary benefits that appellant provides in exchange for their labor.  Thus, the facts that the union would not specifically pay for appellant's carriage of its letters, and that appellant would merely be performing a duty imposed by state law, do not render the carriage ""without compensation.""  Pp.  485 U. S. 594-597.
(c) Because this Court's analysis of the ""letters of the carrier"" and ""private hands"" exceptions and their legislative history reveals Congress' clear intent, the issue of deference to the Postal Service's regulations construing the exceptions need not be addressed.  Pp.  485 U. S. 601-602.

No. 86-978

485 U.S. 415

Syllabus 
In 1981, the federal statute authorizing the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was amended to provide that a family receiving nonrecurring lump-sum income is ineligible for benefits for the number of months that the income would satisfy the family's standard of need.  In 1983, respondent's husband received a lump-sum Social Security disability payment, which was expended within two days to pay family bills.  Respondent reported the receipt and expenditure of the lump-sum payment to her Minnesota Department of Human Services (Department) caseworker and was advised that, under the 1981 amendment, her family would be ineligible for benefits for the next several months.  The family continued to receive benefits while respondent's administrative appeal was pending, but the Department ultimately concluded that the federal statute must be enforced even though respondent had not received advance notice of the new lump-sum rule.  Respondent then intervened in a pending class action in Federal District Court; the court held that the Department's implementation of the new lump-sum rule without adequate notice to AFDC applicants and recipients violated a federal notice regulation that, as promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) before the 1981 amendment was enacted, requires that individuals be given ""information in written form, and orally as appropriate, about . . . conditions of eligibility.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment in pertinent part.
Held:  The federal notice regulation was not violated by the Department.  Pursuant to the regulation, the Department has distributed two printed brochures that generally describe the AFDC program and the recipient's duty to report all household income monthly.  When the 1981 amendment was enacted, the Department sent a letter to all AFDC recipients advising them of the major changes in the program and alerting them to the new lump-sum rule.  The plain language of the federal regulation does not require that information be disseminated regarding every specific change in eligibility requirements.  Moreover, the plain language of the notice provision and of other provisions in the same section of the 
Page 485 U. S. 416
 regulations establishes that only applicants, and not recipients, are addressed by the requirement that individuals be given information about the program.  Further, even as to applicants, the notice provision requires only that printed information about access to AFDC benefits be available, and that such information may be transmitted orally as well.  Finally, the Secretary believes it appropriate to rely on an oral explanation of the consequences of receiving a lump-sum payment when the recipient reports it to the family's caseworker.  In sum, the notice regulation simply requires the State to publish a general description of the basic structure of the AFDC program and its availability.  Pp.  485 U. S. 423-432.

Argued November 30, 1987
Decided April 19, 1988
485 U.S. 439

Syllabus 
In 1982, the United States Forest Service prepared a final environmental impact statement for constructing a paved road through federal land, including the Chimney Rock area of the Six Rivers National Forest.  This area, as reported in a study commissioned by the Service, has historically been used by certain American Indians for religious rituals that depend upon privacy, silence, and an undisturbed natural setting.  Rejecting the study's recommendation that the road not be completed through the Chimney Rock area because it would irreparably damage the sacred areas, and also rejecting alternative routes outside the National Forest, the Service selected a route through the Chimney Rock area that avoided archeological sites and was removed as far as possible from the sites used by the Indians for specific spiritual activities.  At about the same time, the Service also adopted a management plan allowing for timber harvesting in the same area, but providing for protective zones around all the religious sites identified in the study.  After exhausting administrative remedies, respondents -- an Indian organization, individual Indians, nature organizations and members thereof, and the State of California -- filed suit in Federal District Court challenging both the road-building and timber harvesting decisions.  The court issued a permanent injunction that prohibited the Government from constructing the Chimney Rock section of the road or putting the timber harvesting plan into effect, holding, inter alia, that such actions would violate respondent Indians' rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and would violate certain federal statutes.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in pertinent part.
Held:
1. The courts below did not clearly explain whether -- in keeping with the principle requiring that courts reach constitutional questions only when necessary -- they determined that a decision on the First Amendment issue was necessary because it might entitle respondents to relief beyond that to which they were entitled on their statutory claims.  The structure and wording of the District Court's injunction, however, suggest that the statutory holding would not have supported all the relief 
Page 485 U. S. 440
 granted, and the Court of Appeals' silence as to the necessity of reaching the First Amendment issue may have reflected its understanding that the District Court's injunction necessarily rested in part on constitutional grounds.  Because it appears reasonably likely that the First Amendment issue was necessary to the decisions below, and because the Government is confident that it can cure the statutory defects identified below, it would be inadvisable for this Court to vacate and remand without addressing the constitutional question on the merits.  Pp.  485 U. S. 445-447.
2. The Free Exercise Clause does not prohibit the Government from permitting timber harvesting in the Chimney Rock area or constructing the proposed road.  Pp.  485 U. S. 447-458.
(a) In Bowen v. Roy, 476 U. S. 693 -- which held that a federal statute requiring States to use Social Security numbers in administering certain welfare programs did not violate Indian religious rights under the Free Exercise Clause -- this Court rejected the same kind of challenge that respondents assert.  Just as in Roy, the affected individuals here would not be coerced by the Government's action into violating their religious beliefs; nor would the governmental action penalize the exercise of religious rights by denying religious adherents an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.  Incidental effects of government programs, which may interfere with the practice of certain religions, but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, do not require government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions.  The Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.  Even assuming that the Government's actions here will virtually destroy the Indians' ability to practice their religion, the Constitution simply does not provide a principle that could justify upholding respondents' legal claims.  Pp.  485 U. S. 447-453.
(b) The Government's right to the use of its own lands need not and should not discourage it from accommodating religious practices like those engaged in by the Indian respondents.  The Government has taken numerous steps to minimize the impact that construction of the road will have on the Indians' religious activities -- such as choosing the route that best protects sites of specific rituals from adverse audible intrusions and planning steps to reduce the visual impact of the road on the surrounding country.  Such solicitude accords with the policy and requirements of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.  Contrary to respondents' contention, however, that Act does not create any enforceable legal right that could authorize the District Court's injunction.  Pp.  485 U. S. 453-455.

Syllabus 
Under the nonclaim provision of Oklahoma's Probate Code, creditors' claims against an estate are generally barred unless they are presented to the executor or executrix within two months of the publication of notice of the commencement of probate proceedings.  Appellee executrix published the required notice in compliance with the terms of the nonclaim statute and a probate court order, but appellant, the assignee of a hospital's claim for expenses connected with the decedent's final illness, failed to file a timely claim.  For this reason, the probate court denied appellant's application for payment, and both the State Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that, in failing to require more than publication notice, the nonclaim statute violated due process.  That contention was based upon Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, which held that state action that adversely affects property interests must be accompanied by such notice as is reasonable under the particular circumstances, balancing the State's interest and the due process interests of individuals, and Mennonite Board of Missions v.

Held:  If appellant's identity as a creditor was known or ""reasonably ascertainable"" by appellee (a fact which cannot be determined from the present record), the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted by Mullane and Mennonite, requires that appellant be given notice by mail or such other means as is certain to ensure actual notice.

Syllabus 
Under the nonclaim provision of Oklahoma's Probate Code, creditors' claims against an estate are generally barred unless they are presented to the executor or executrix within two months of the publication of notice of the commencement of probate proceedings.  Appellee executrix published the required notice in compliance with the terms of the nonclaim statute and a probate court order, but appellant, the assignee of a hospital's claim for expenses connected with the decedent's final illness, failed to file a timely claim.  For this reason, the probate court denied appellant's application for payment, and both the State Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that, in failing to require more than publication notice, the nonclaim statute violated due process.  That contention was based upon Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.

No. 86-1406
Argued February 29, 1988
Decided April 19, 1988
485 U.S. 495

Syllabus 
In 1973, Congress passed the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act (EPAA), which required the President to promulgate regulations governing allocation and pricing of petroleum products, and expressly preempted state and local regulation of allocation and pricing that conflicted with those regulations.  Under the EPAA, the President's regulatory authority was to terminate in 1975, but subsequent amendments (including an amendment by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in 1975) extended his authority until September 30, 1981, when it expired.  In 1986, Puerto Rico, which had suspended its regulation of petroleum products when the EPAA was passed, imposed an excise tax on oil refiners, and petitioner Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs issued regulations requiring that advance notice of price increases be given to the Department's Secretary, prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the tax to retailers, and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by wholesalers to retailers.  Respondent oil companies brought actions, which were consolidated by the District Court, alleging that the Department's regulations were unconstitutional on preemption grounds.  The court enjoined enforcement of the regulations, holding that the Department's authority was preempted by the decision of Congress to decontrol petroleum prices.  The Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Department's regulations are not preempted.  The test for federal preemption of Puerto Rico law is the same as the test under the Supremacy Clause for preemption of the law of a State.  There is no merit to respondents' contention that the EPAA evinced a federal intent to enter the field of petroleum allocation and price regulation, and that the EPCA never countermanded that intent, but merely changed the nature of the federally imposed regime from one of federal hands-on regulation to one of federally mandated free-market control.  Although the Constitution permits congressional creation of such a regime, it is to be assumed that the historic police powers of the States are not superseded by a federal statute unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.

 whenever the Federal Government terminates or reduces its regulation of a field of commerce, replacing the normal need for finding a federal intent to preempt with a need to find a federal intent to retransfer authority to the States.  Since Congress has withdrawn from all substantial involvement in petroleum allocation and price regulation, there is no extant action that can create an inference of preemption in an unregulated segment of an otherwise regulated field, and preemption, if it is intended, must be explicitly stated.

 Leslie LOWENFIELDv. Robert Hilton BUTLER, Warden.No. A-792 (87-6780) 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 13, 1988
 Case below, 843 F.2d 183. 
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Leslie Lowenfield has been sentenced to death. The law of the State that is about to execute him entitles him to ""rais[e] at any time"" the issue of his ""mental incapacity to proceed"" with the execution. La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 642 (West 1981). See State v. Perry, 502 So. 2d 543, 564 (La.1986). If there is a ""reasonable ground to doubt"" petitioner's sanity, the court ""shall order a mental examination,"" La.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 643 (West 1981), and may permit ""no further steps"" in his punishment until he ""is found to have the mental capacity to proceed,"" Art. 642. In any event, state law affords petitioner the right to pre- execution review by a sanity commission if he can ""show by a preponderance of evidence that he lacks the present capacity to undergo execution."" Perry, supra, at 564. 
 Petitioner moved for review by a sanity commission, presenting evidence that he is currently insane. The evidence consisted of a sworn affidavit by Dr. Marc L. Zimmerman, a duly licensed clinical psychologist who interviewed and tested petitioner for five hours on March 26, 1988, and concluded that ""it is highly probable that Mr. Lowenfield is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. . . . A study has found that 85% of persons who obtain the same profile as Mr. Lowenfield . . . are diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenics."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2 (citation omitted). Dr. Zimmerman continued: ""As a paranoid schizophrenic, Mr. Lowenfield's capacity to understand the death penalty would be impaired. Indeed, my 
Page 485 U.S. 995 , 996
 clinical interview with Mr. Lowenfield indicated that he is currently unable to understand the death penalty."" Id., at 3 (emphasis added). The State presented no evidence either to refute Dr. Zimmerman's conclusions or to question his credentials. In the face of that unrefuted evidence, the Louisiana trial court, and then the Louisiana Supreme Court, denied the motion without explanation. 
 Petitioner thereafter filed an application for habeas relief with the District Court. The District Court denied on the basis of an ""extended conversation"" with Dr. Zimmerman. Civ. Action No. 88-1549, p. 3 (ED La., Apr. 12, 1988) 1988 WL 34935. From that conversation, which the District Court conducted without any notice to petitioner's counsel and apparently before petitioner's application was filed, the District Court concluded that, contrary to Dr. Zimmerman's affidavit, ""petitioner has the capacity to understand the realities of the pending execution. Petitioner, though [ a] paranoid schizophrenic, is apparently able to understand that the execution is going forward in accordance with law."" Ibid. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion that reached this chambers a mere 15 minutes before the scheduled execution. 843 F.2d 183 ( CA5 1988). 
 Every court that has considered petitioner's insanity claim has made a mockery of this Court's precedent and of the most fundamental principles of ordered justice. In Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 409, 2602 (1986), we held that ""the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane."" In the course of the opinion, we characterized any such execution as "" 'savage and inhuman' "" id., at 406 (citation omitted): "" 'a miserable spectacle, both against Law, and of extreme inhumanity and cruelty,' "" id., at 407 (citation omitted); "" 'cruel and inhumane,' "" id., at 408, n. 1, n. 1 (citation omitted); and ""abhorren[t],"" id., at 409. 
 A majority of this Court did not agree on the precise procedures that the Constitution requires when the question is raised of a prisoner's sanity for execution. A majority did, however, hold that due process demands a hearing at least once the prisoner has made some ""threshold showing"" that he has become insane since his trial. Id., at 417, 106 S.Ct ., at 2605 (opinion of MARSHALL, J., joined by BRENNAN, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.); id., at 426 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

No. 86-1764
Argued February 29, 1988
Decided April 4, 1988
485 U.S. 399

Syllabus 
Under the Medicare program of the Social Security Act, a qualified provider of health care services, in order to obtain reimbursement from the Secretary of Health and Human Services for its cost of providing covered services to Medicare patients, must submit an annual cost report to a fiscal intermediary, usually a private insurance company acting as the Secretary's agent.  The intermediary then audits the cost report and determines the amount of reimbursement due to the provider.  The statute, 42 U.S.C.  1395oo (1982 ed. and Supp. III), authorizes the provider to appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.  The Board may affirm, modify, or reverse the intermediary's decision.  The Secretary, either on his own motion or at the provider's request, may review the matter further, and a provider that remains dissatisfied with a final decision of the Board or Secretary may seek review in a federal district court.  In their cost reports for 1980, petitioner providers, in apportioning malpractice insurance costs, followed a 1979 regulation of the Secretary that disallowed certain claims for malpractice insurance premium costs.  Petitioners later filed a request for a hearing before the Board, challenging the validity of the malpractice regulation and seeking reimbursement for malpractice costs in accordance with the pre-1979 methodology.  Because the amounts had been ""self-disallowed"" in the reports filed with the intermediary, however, the Board determined that it was without jurisdiction to hear petitioners' claims.  In proceedings challenging the 1979 regulation, the District Court held that the Board should have exercised jurisdiction over the matter.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Board may not decline to consider a provider's challenge to a regulation of the Secretary on the ground that the provider failed to contest the regulation's validity in the cost report submitted to its fiscal intermediary.  The plain language of  1395oo(a) demonstrates that the Board had jurisdiction to entertain this action.  There is no merit to the Secretary's contention that a provider's right to a hearing before the Board extends only to claims presented to a fiscal intermediary, because the provider cannot be ""dissatisfied"" with the intermediary's decision to 
Page 485 U. S. 400
 award the amounts requested in the provider's cost report.  The submission of a cost report in full compliance with the unambiguous dictates of the Secretary's rules and regulations does not, by itself, bar the provider from claiming dissatisfaction with the amount of reimbursement allowed by those regulations.  Providers know that, under the statutory scheme, the intermediary is confined to the mere application of the Secretary's regulations, that the intermediary is without power to award reimbursement except as the regulations provide, and that any attempt to persuade the intermediary to do otherwise would be futile.  While the express language of  1395oo(a) requires the conclusion reached here, that conclusion is also supported by the language and design of the statute as a whole.  Neither the intermediary nor the Board has the authority to declare regulations invalid, but, as the predicate to the right of providers to obtain judicial review of an intermediary's action, the Board must first determine that it is without authority to decide the matter because the provider's claim involves a question of law or regulations.

No. 86-1715
Argued February 23, 1988
Decided April 4, 1988
485 U.S. 409

Syllabus 
Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 generally requires that federal agencies and labor unions bargain in good faith concerning terms and conditions of employment.  A statutory exemption provides that an agency has a duty to bargain when an agency rule or regulation is involved ""only if the [Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority)] has determined . . . that no compelling need . . . exists for the rule or regulation,"" 5 U.S.C.  7117(a)(2), and details procedures for making that determination.   7117(b).  When respondent Aberdeen Proving Ground refused to negotiate an administrative leave proposal by its employees' union because the proposal conflicted with agency regulations, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority.  An Administrative Law Judge held in respondent's favor, finding that the proposal was inconsistent with agency regulations and was not subject to negotiations because the Authority had not previously determined under  7117(b) that there was no compelling need for the regulations.  The Authority reversed, holding, inter alia, that a compelling need determination may be unified with an unfair labor practice proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that a  7117(b) negotiability appeal is the sole means of determining a compelling need question.
Held:  Section 7117(b) provides the exclusive procedure for determining whether there is a compelling need for an agency regulation.  The plain language of Title VII unambiguously provides that the procedure specified in  7117(b) is exclusive, rather than one of multiple options.  This reading of Title VII is consistent with the statute's legislative history and asserted purpose of achieving a balance between the rights of federal employees to bargain collectively and the public interest in effective government.

			"|"FLRA v. Aberdeen Proving Grounds
No. 86-1715
Argued February 23, 1988
Decided April 4, 1988
485 U.S. 409

Syllabus 
Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 generally requires that federal agencies and labor unions bargain in good faith concerning terms and conditions of employment.  A statutory exemption provides that an agency has a duty to bargain when an agency rule or regulation is involved ""only if the [Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority)] has determined . . . that no compelling need . . . exists for the rule or regulation,"" 5 U.S.C.  7117(a)(2), and details procedures for making that determination.   7117(b).  When respondent Aberdeen Proving Ground refused to negotiate an administrative leave proposal by its employees' union because the proposal conflicted with agency regulations, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority.  An Administrative Law Judge held in respondent's favor, finding that the proposal was inconsistent with agency regulations and was not subject to negotiations because the Authority had not previously determined under  7117(b) that there was no compelling need for the regulations.  The Authority reversed, holding, inter alia, that a compelling need determination may be unified with an unfair labor practice proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that a  7117(b) negotiability appeal is the sole means of determining a compelling need question.
Held:  Section 7117(b) provides the exclusive procedure for determining whether there is a compelling need for an agency regulation.  The plain language of Title VII unambiguously provides that the procedure specified in  7117(b) is exclusive, rather than one of multiple options.  This reading of Title VII is consistent with the statute's legislative history and asserted purpose of achieving a balance between the rights of federal employees to bargain collectively and the public interest in effective government.

485 U.S. 395

Syllabus 
Relying on an Arkansas statute authorizing the State to seize a prisoner's property, including his Social Security benefits, in order to help defray the cost of maintaining its prison system, Arkansas filed suit in state court to attach petitioner's Social Security benefits.  The trial court directed that a portion of petitioner's benefits be seized, rejecting his argument that the state law violates the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution because it permits the State to attach funds that are exempt from legal process under 42 U.S.C.  407(a).  The Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed, holding that there is no conflict between the state and federal statutes because  407(a) contains an ""implied exception to exemption from legal process"" when a State provides for a Social Security recipient's care and maintenance.
Held:  The Arkansas statute violates the Supremacy Clause.  There is no ""implied exception"" to the express language of  407(a) and its clear intent that Social Security benefits not be attachable, even though the State provides for all of petitioner's needs.  The State is not a statutorily intended beneficiary of petitioner's Social Security benefits.  Rose v. Rose, 481 U. S. 619, distinguished.

Syllabus 
Under  5(e) of the Housing Act of 1937, certain state and local public housing agency obligations, commonly termed ""Project Notes,"" are ""exempt from all taxation . . . imposed by the United States.""  It was generally assumed that this exemption applied only to the federal income tax until, in 1984, a Federal District Court ruled that Project Notes were also exempt from federal estate taxes.  Shortly thereafter, Congress enacted the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA),  641 of which eliminated the purported exemption and foreclosed those who had already paid estate taxes on Project Notes from obtaining a refund thereon.  After the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied appellee executors such refunds, they filed suit in the District Court below, which concluded that their Project Notes were tax exempt when they filed their estate tax returns.  The court also held that  641 of the DEFRA unconstitutionally denied appellees due process and equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment.  The United States appealed directly to this Court under 28 U.S.C.  1252.
Held:
1. Section 5(e) of the Housing Act does not exempt Project Notes from federal estate taxation.  The settled presumption against implied tax exemptions applies here, particularly since 26 U.S.C.  2001 and 2002 (1982 ed. and Supp. III), which define the taxable estate for estate tax calculation, by their terms include Project Notes.  Moreover, an exemption of property from all taxation, such as that contained in  5(e), has long been understood to apply only to direct taxes such as the federal income tax, and not to excise taxes such as the estate tax.  The various aspects of the legislative history relied on by appellees as indicia of congressional intent are insufficient to demonstrate unambiguously that Project Notes are exempt from estate taxes.in contravention of the aforesaid presumption and the understood meaning of  5(e).

2. Resolution of the estate tax exemption question obviates the need for this Court to consider the constitutionality of  641 of the DEFRA.

Syllabus 
Under  109 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA), no household may become eligible to participate in the food stamp program while any of its members is on strike, or receive an increase in the allotment of food stamps it is already receiving because the income of the striking member has decreased.  Appellee unions and union members brought suit in Federal District Court, contending that  109 is unconstitutional.  The court granted appellees summary judgment and issued a declaratory judgment, holding the statute unconstitutional on the grounds that it interferes with appellees' associational rights and strikers' expressive rights under the First Amendment, and violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Secretary of Agriculture appealed the decision directly to this Court under 28 U.S.C.  1252.
Held:
1. Section 109 does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.  485 U. S. 364-369.
(a) The statute does not infringe the individual appellees' right to associate with their families or the associational rights of the individual appellees and their unions.  It does not prohibit individuals from dining together or associating together to conduct a strike, nor in any other way ""directly and substantially"" interfere with family living arrangements or workers' ability to combine together to assert their lawful rights.  Even if isolated instances can be found in which a striking individual may have left the other members of his household in order to increase their allotment of food stamps or left his union for that purpose, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it is ""exceedingly unlikely"" that  109 will have any effect at all.  Cf. Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U. S. 635.  The Constitution does not require the Government to furnish funds to maximize the exercise of the right of association or to minimize any resulting economic hardship.  Pp.  485 U. S. 364-368.
(b) The statute does not abridge appellees' right to express themselves about union matters free of coercion by the Government.  Rather 
Page 485 U. S. 361
 than exacting payments from individuals, coercing particular beliefs, or requiring appellees to participate in political activities or support political views with which they disagree,  109 merely declines to extend additional food stamp assistance to strikers simply because the strike has caused a decline in their income.  Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Education, 431 U. S. 209, distinguished.  The Constitution does not confer an entitlement to such governmental funds as may be necessary for individuals to realize all the advantages of their right to free expression.  P.  485 U. S. 369.
2. Section 109 does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, since it is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of avoiding undue favoritism in private labor disputes.  Although the statute does work at least some discrimination against strikers and their households, this Court must defer to Congress' view that the disbursement of food stamps to such persons damages the program's public integrity, and thus endangers its legitimate goals.  The fact that  109 is harder on strikers than on ""voluntary quitters"" does not render it irrational, since the neutrality concern does not arise with respect to the latter persons.  Congress' considered efforts to avoid favoritism are evidenced by  109's provisos preserving prestrike eligibility and eligibility when a household member has refused to accept employment because of a strike or lockout.  OBRA was also enacted for the legitimate purpose of protecting the Government's fiscal integrity by cutting expenditures, and, although this objective cannot be pursued by discriminating against individuals or groups, the Constitution does not permit this Court to disturb the judgment of Congress, the body having discretion as to how best to spend money to improve the general welfare, that passing  109 along with its provisos was preferable to undertaking other budget cuts in the food stamp program.  The contention that  109 irrationally ""strikes at the striker through his family"" is without merit, since the food stamp program generally operates against the household of an ineligible person, and the fact that the Act determines benefits on a ""household"" rather than an individual basis is not constitutionally significant.

Syllabus 
Petitioner sued respondent in state court for breach of contract.  Respondent did not remove the action to federal court, but, one month later, filed a diversity action against petitioner in the Federal District Court for breach of the same contract.  The District Court denied petitioner's motion to stay or dismiss the action before it, finding that the facts of the case fell short of those necessary to justify the requested discontinuance under Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, which held that, in ""exceptional"" circumstances, a district court may stay or dismiss an action because of the pendency of similar state court litigation.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that neither 28 U.S.C.  1291 -- which provides for appeals from ""final decisions"" of the district courts -- nor  1292(a)(1) -- which authorizes appeals from interlocutory orders granting or denying injunctions -- allowed an immediate appeal from the District Court's order.  The court also declined to treat petitioner's notice of appeal as an application for a writ of mandamus under the All Writs Act.
Held:
1. A district court order denying a motion to stay or dismiss an action when a similar suit is pending in state court is not immediately appealable under  1291 or  1292(a)(1).  Pp.  485 U. S. 275-288.
(a) Since the order in question does not end the litigation, but ensures that it will continue in the District Court, it is not appealable under  1291.  The order does not fall within the collateral order exception to  1291, since it fails to satisfy the exception's ""conclusiveness"" requirement in that it is inherently tentative, and not made with the expectation that it will be the final word on the subject addressed.  Given both the nature of the factors to be considered under Colorado River and the natural tendency of courts to attempt to eliminate matters that need not be decided from their dockets, a district court usually will expect to revisit and reassess an order denying a stay in light of events occurring in the normal course of litigation.  Pp.  485 U. S. 275-278.
(b) Since the order in question relates only to the conduct or progress of litigation before the District Court, it cannot be considered an injunction 
Page 485 U. S. 272
 appealable under  1292(a)(1).  Petitioner's claim that the order is appealable pursuant to the doctrine of Enelow v. New York Life Ins. Co., 293 U. S. 379, and Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 317 U. S. 188, under which orders granting or denying stays of ""legal"" proceedings on ""equitable"" grounds were considered to be immediately appealable injunctions, is rejected.

Under a Michigan statute (Act 144), a public utility transporting natural gas in Michigan for public use must obtain approval of the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) before issuing long-term securities.  Act 144 directs the MPSC to approve a proposed security issuance when it is satisfied that the funds derived therefrom are to be applied to lawful purposes and that the issuance is essential to the successful carrying out of the purposes, or represents accumulated and undistributed earnings invested in capital assets and not previously capitalized.  Respondent companies, which serve customers in other States as well as in Michigan, are natural gas companies within the meaning of the federal Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), and are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  They filed suit against petitioners, members of the MPSC, in Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the MPSC lacked jurisdiction over their security issuances because Act 144 was preempted by the NGA and because it violated the Commerce Clause.  The court rejected respondents' claims.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that both the preemptive effect of the federal regulatory scheme and the Commerce Clause barred application of Act 144 to respondents.
Held:  The MPSC regulation of respondents through Act 144 impinges on a field that the federal regulatory scheme has occupied to the exclusion of state law, and Act 144 therefore is preempted.  Pp.  485 U. S. 300-310.
(a) Although FERC is not expressly authorized to regulate natural gas companies' issuance of securities, the NGA is a comprehensive scheme of federal regulation of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce that gives FERC a number of tools -- such as its authority to fix rates and to withhold certificates of public convenience and necessity -- for examining and controlling the issuance of such securities in the exercise of its comprehensive authority.  Pp.  485 U. S. 300-304.
(b) Congressional intent to preempt state regulation of securities issuances to finance the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas cannot be inferred, as respondents contended, from the mere fact that States might have been precluded from such regulation under ""dormant"" Commerce Clause principles at the time of the NGA's enactment in 1938.  Nor can any inferences as to the States' authority to regulate be drawn, 
Page 485 U. S. 294
 as petitioners contended, from Congress' subsequent failure to enact proposed legislation that would have given FERC explicit authority to regulate the issuance of natural gas companies' securities.  Pp.  485 U. S. 304-306.
(c) When applied to natural gas companies, Act 144 amounts to a regulation of rates and facilities used in transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce, a field occupied by federal regulation.  Although every state statute that has some indirect effect on natural gas companies' rates and facilities is not preempted, Act l44's effect is not ""indirect.""  Its central purpose is to regulate matters that Congress intended FERC to regulate exclusively.  Pp.  485 U. S. 305-309.
(d) The conclusion that Act 144 seeks to regulate a field that the NGA has occupied is also supported by the imminent possibility of collision between Act 144 and the NGA.  P.  485 U. S. 310.

Syllabus 
District of Columbia Code  22-1115 makes it unlawful, within 500 feet of a foreign embassy, either to display any sign that tends to bring the foreign government into ""public odium"" or ""public disrepute"" (display clause), or to congregate and refuse to obey a police dispersal order (congregation clause).  Petitioners, who wish to engage in conduct that would violate both clauses, filed suit in Federal District Court against respondent city officials, asserting a facial First Amendment challenge to  22-1115.  The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that both clauses were constitutional.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
255 U.S.App.D.C.19, 798 F.2d 1450, affirmed in part and reversed in part.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-B, III, IV, and V, concluding that:
1. Section 22-1115's display clause is facially violative of the First Amendment, since it is a content-based restriction on political speech in a public forum, which is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  Assuming, without deciding, that protecting the dignity of foreign diplomats by shielding them from criticism of their governments is a ""compelling"" interest for First Amendment purposes, the ready availability of a significantly less restrictive alternative -- 18 U.S.C.  112, which prohibits intimidating, coercing, or harassing foreign officials or obstructing them in the performance of their duties -- amply demonstrates that the display clause is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to withstand exacting scrutiny.  Respondents' defense of the clause is further undercut by  1302 of the Onmibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, in which Congress requested that the District of Columbia review and revise  22-1115 in the interest of protecting First Amendment rights, and the District responded by repealing the section, contingent on the prior extension of  112 to the District.  This Court may rely on the judgment of Congress, the body primarily responsible for implementing international law obligations, that  112 adequately satisfies the Government's interest in protecting diplomatic personnel and 
Page 485 U. S. 313
 that, accordingly,  22-1115's display clause is not narrowly tailored.  Pp.  485 U. S. 321-329.
2. Section 22-1115's congregation clause, as construed by the Court of Appeals, is not facially violative of the First Amendment.  The clause is not overbroad, even though its actual language is problematic both because it applies to any congregation for any reason within 500 feet of an embassy and because it appears to place no limits on police dispersal authority.  These difficulties are alleviated by the Court of Appeals' narrowing construction that the clause permits dispersal only of congregations that are directed at an embassy and only when the police reasonably believe that the embassy's ""security or peace"" is threatened.  Thus, the clause does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, since it merely regulates the place and manner of certain demonstrations, is site-specific to areas within 500 feet of embassies, and does not prohibit peaceful congregations.  Nor is the clause, as narrowed, impermissibly vague simply because the Court of Appeals has not defined or limited the word ""peace.""  Given the particular context for which the clause is crafted, it is apparent that the prohibited quantum of disturbance is determined by whether normal embassy activities have been or are about to be disrupted.  Pp.  485 U. S. 329-332.
3. The contention that, since  22-1116 excludes labor picketing from  22-1115's general prohibitions, both of  22-1115's clauses require unequal treatment of nonlabor and labor activities in violation of the Equal Protection Clause is without merit.  Section 22-1116's primary function of ensuring that the display clause did not prohibit labor picketing is largely preempted by this Court's conclusion that that clause violates the First Amendment.  Moreover, under the Court of Appeals' construction of the congregation clause as applying only to congregations that threaten an embassy's security or peace, any peaceful congregation, including a peaceful labor congregation, is permitted.  This Court will not adopt the unreasonable interpretation that  22-1116's sole purpose is to protect violent labor congregations.  Thus,  22-1116 does not violate equal protection.  Pp.  485 U. S. 332-334.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part II-A that  22-1115's display clause is content-based, since whether it prohibits picketing in front of a particular embassy depends entirely upon whether the picket signs are critical of the foreign government.  The argument that the clause is content-neutral because it does not select between particular viewpoints, but determines a sign's permissible message solely on the basis of the foreign government's policies, is without merit, since even a viewpoint-neutral regulation violates the First Amendment when it prohibits an entire category of speech -- here, signs critical of foreign governments.  Also rejected is the contention 
Page 485 U. S. 314
 that, since the clause's real concern is not the suppression of speech, but is rather the ""secondary effect"" of implementing the international law obligation to shield diplomats from speech that offends their dignity, the clause is content-neutral under Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41.  As used in Renton, the phrase ""secondary effects"" refers to secondary features that happen to be associated with the particular type of speech but have nothing to do with its content, whereas, here, the asserted justification for the display clause focuses only on the content of picket signs and their primary and direct emotive impact on their audience.  Pp.  485 U. S. 318-321.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, agreeing that, even under the Renton analysis,  22-1115's display clause constitutes a content-based restriction, and that ""secondary effects"" cannot include listeners' reactions to speech, concluded that the content-based nature of a restriction on speech cannot turn on whether the restriction ""aims"" at ""secondary effects,"" and that, at any rate, the Renton analysis should be limited to the context of businesses purveying sexually explicit materials and not applied to political speech.  The Renton analysis creates extensive dangers and uncertainty, and denies speakers the equal right to speak and listeners the right to an undistorted debate.  The traditional bright-line rule should continue to apply, whereby any restriction on speech, the application of which turns on the speech's content, is content-based regardless of its underlying motivation.  Pp.  485 U. S. 334-338.
O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-B, and V, in which BRENNAN, MARSHALL, STEVENS, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and with respect to Parts III and IV, in which all participating Members joined, and an opinion with respect to Part II-A, in which STEVENS and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

No. 86-1672
Argued January 13, 1988
Decided March 22, 1988
485 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
Because Kentucky's usury law limited the annual interest rate for noncorporate borrowers, lenders willing to provide money only at higher rates required such borrowers to use a corporate nominee as the nominal debtor and record titleholder of mortgaged property.  Accordingly, respondents, who formed a series of partnerships to develop Kentucky apartment complexes, in each instance entered into an agreement with a corporation wholly owned by respondent Bollinger, which provided that the corporation would hold title to the property as the partnership's nominee and agent solely to secure financing, that the partnership would have sole control of and responsibility for the complex, and that the partnership was the principal and owner of the property during financing, construction, and operation.  All parties who had contact with the complexes, including lenders, contractors, managers, employees, and tenants, regarded the partnerships as the owners and knew that the corporation was merely the partnerships' agent, if they were aware of the corporation at all.  Income and losses from the complexes were reported on the partnerships' tax returns, and respondents reported their distributive share of the income and losses on their individual returns.  Although the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed respondents' losses on the ground that they were attributable to the corporation as the owner of the property, the Tax Court held that the corporation was the partnerships' agent, and should therefore be disregarded for tax purposes, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The partnerships were the owners of the complexes for federal income tax purposes, since in each instance the relationship between them and the corporation was, in both form and substance, an agency with the partnership as principal.  It is reasonable for the Commissioner to demand unequivocal evidence of an agency relationship's genuineness in the corporation-shareholder context in order to prevent tax evasion.  However, there is no merit to the Commissioner's contention that National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner, 336 U. S. 422, requires such evidence to include arm's-length dealing between principal and agent and the payment of an agency fee.  The genuineness of an agency is adequately assured, where, as here, the fact that the corporation is acting as 
Page 485 U. S. 341
 its shareholders' agent with respect to a particular asset is set forth in a written agreement at the time the asset is acquired, the corporation functions as agent and not principal with respect to the asset for all purposes, and the corporation is held out as the agent, and not the principal, in all dealings with third parties relating to the asset.

Petitioners filed a wrongful death action against respondents under the Death on the High Seas Act (Act).  This Act contains no provision regarding costs, and the District Court's judgment for respondents did not mention costs.

Petitioners did not file a second notice of appeal.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal for failure to file a timely appeal because, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), a notice of appeal filed before the

Held:  A prevailing party's motion for costs in a wrongful death action brought under the Death on the High Seas Act does not constitute a Rule 59 motion rendering ineffective a notice of appeal filed prior to the disposition of that motion.  Rule 59(e) generally is invoked only to support reconsideration of matters encompassed in the decision on the merits, not when a party is seeking what is due because of the judgment.  Because the Act does not provide for costs, respondents' motion for costs  raised issues wholly collateral to the judgment on the main cause of action, and is properly viewed as a motion for costs to a prevailing party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d).  The incorrect designation of respondents' Rule 54(d) motion as a Rule 59(e) motion cannot change this fact or deprive petitioners of the benefit of their timely notice of appeal.

Syllabus 
Petitioners filed a wrongful death action against respondents under the Death on the High Seas Act (Act).  This Act contains no provision regarding costs, and the District Court's judgment for respondents did not mention costs.  After petitioners filed a notice of appeal, respondents filed an application for costs styled as a ""Motion to Amend or Alter Judgment"" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), which the District Court granted.  Petitioners did not file a second notice of appeal.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal for failure to file a timely appeal because, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), a notice of appeal filed before the

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 15, 1988
 On application to vacate stay. 
 The application of the Attorney General of Florida for an order to vacate the stay of execution of sentence of death entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting. 
 Larry Joe Johnson was scheduled to be executed on March 9, 1988. The State informs us that it was served with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus at about 5:45 p.m. on March 7, 1988. That petition raised an issue, under Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320 (1985), in which Johnson claims that the sentencing jury was improperly informed that its role in the sentencing decision was merely advisory. Noting that issues similar or identical to Johnson's Caldwell claim are pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and before this Court, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida granted an indefinite stay of execution. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the State's mo- 
Page 485 U.S. 945 , 946
 tion to vacate the stay. The State then applied to the Circuit Justice for the Eleventh Circuit for a vacation of the stay, and the application was referred to the full Court. Johnson did not file any response, and this Court has voted to deny the application. I respectfully dissent. 
 The State argues that Johnson has abused the writ of habeas corpus by raising his Caldwell claim at this time. The State avers that Johnson had raised the same claim, along with others, in a previous petition for federal habeas, which was filed before this Court's decision in Caldwell. The claim was rejected on procedural grounds at that time, and it was not among the issues on which Johnson appealed to the Eleventh Circuit. Our decision in Caldwell was announced while the appeal was pending in the Eleventh Circuit, and Johnson apparently did not bring it to the attention of that court. Concluding that the claim was abandoned, the State now urges that Johnson's effort to renew the claim at this time constitutes an abuse of the writ. 
 In my view, the State is clearly correct to argue that the writ of habeas corpus is abused when a claim is raised in one petition, abandoned on appeal, and then raised again in a successive petition. If Johnson's Caldwell claim falls into this category, then the District Court would seem to have abused its discretion by granting an indefinite stay of execution on the ground that Caldwell issues are present in other cases pending before the Eleventh Circuit and before this Court. 
 Without ruling out the possibility that extraordinary circumstances might justify a stay of execution in this case, I note that no such circumstances have been called to our attention. The District Court did not address the argument that the State has made to this Court. The State explains this in the following way. In an effort to facilitate the District Court's consideration of any habeas petition that Johnson might file, it lodged an anticipatory response with that court. That response did not address Johnson's Caldwell claim because the State considered that claim abandoned. After Johnson filed his petition on March 7, the State prepared a supplemental response, which it expected to offer to the court at a hearing that was scheduled for the next morning at 10 o'clock. Counsel for the State arrived at 9:30, but ""was informed that the hearing was cancelled and that the [District] Court had entered a stay without allowing the State to be heard."" The State's attorney filed its written supplemental response with [485 U.S. 945 , 947]

Argued October 6, 1987
Decided March 7, 1988
485 U.S. 176

Syllabus 
A ""gray market"" good is a foreign-manufactured good that bears a valid United States trademark and is imported without the consent of the United States trademark owner.  Section 526(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of certain gray market goods.  The Customs Service's implementing regulation allows importation where the foreign manufacturer is affiliated with the United States trademark owner or has received the owner's authorization to use its trademark.  Respondent Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks and two of its members filed a Federal District Court suit against the Government for injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting, inter alia, that the regulation is inconsistent with  526(a), and is therefore invalid.  Petitioner 47th Street Photo, Inc., intervened as a defendant and filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Court of International Trade had exclusive jurisdiction over the case.  The District Court rejected the motion and upheld the regulation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the jurisdictional ruling, but reversed on the merits.
Held:
1. The District Court had jurisdiction under both the general federal question provision, 28 U. S.C.  1331, and the specific provision regarding actions ""arising under any Act of Congress relating to . . . trademarks.""   1338(a).  P.  485 U. S. 182.
2. The Court of International Trade did not have exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1581(i)(3), which grants such jurisdiction over certain suits involving
""embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety.""
Pp.  485 U. S. 182-190.
(a) Although the Court of Appeals properly rejected the theory that  526(a) imposes an ""embarg[o]"" within the meaning of  1581(i)(3), the court's reasoning -- that  1581(i)(3) only extends to embargoes arising 
Page 485 U. S. 177
 out of trade policy -- is unpersuasive.  Trade policy is not the sole, nor perhaps even the primary, purpose served by embargoes, which are also imposed, inter alia, to protect the public health, safety, or morality.  Had Congress intended to constrain the meaning of ""embargoes"" as suggested by the Court of Appeals, it would have been unnecessary to exclude expressly health or safety embargoes from  1581(i)(3)'s jurisdictional grant, or to deny the Court of International Trade jurisdiction over suits arising from the importation of prohibited ""immoral articles,"" see  1581(j).  P.  485 U. S. 184.
(b) The ordinary meaning of ""embargo,"" which Congress apparently adopted in  1581(i)(3), is a governmentally imposed quantitative restriction -- of zero -- on the importation of merchandise.  Section 526(a)'s importation prohibition is not such an ""embargo,"" since, rather than reflecting a governmental restriction on the quantity of a particular product that will enter, it merely provides a mechanism by which a trademark owner might, at its own option, enlist the Customs Service's aid in barring foreign-made goods bearing its trademark in order to enforce its own private trademark right.  The contention that ""embargo"" should be defined as any governmental ""import regulation that takes the form of a prohibition, regardless of . . . its ultimate purpose,"" is rejected, since, in fact, not every governmental import prohibition is an embargo.  Pp.  485 U. S. 185-187.
(c) Section 1581(i)(3)'s purpose of eliminating jurisdictional confusion and its legislative history provide no indication that Congress intended to depart from the ordinary meaning of ""embargoes.""  If Congress had meant to give the Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction over ""importation prohibitions"" rather than ""embargoes,"" it would have said so.  Pp.  485 U. S. 187-190.
3. The Court of International Trade did not have exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1581(i)(4), which grants such jurisdiction over certain suits involving ""administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to"" in  1581(a), which in turn applies to actions contesting the administrative ""denial of a protest"" challenging a Customs officer's order excluding merchandise from entry.  Since this action does not involve the ""matte[r] referred to"" in  1581(a) -- the ""denial of a protest,"" or at the very broadest, ""a protest"" -- it cannot involve ""administration and enforcement with respect to"" that matter.  Pp.  485 U. S. 190-191.
4. The cases are restored to the calendar for reargument on the merits.  P.  485 U. S. 191.

485 U.S. 197

Syllabus 
Respondents, who operate a family farm, obtained secured loans from petitioners.  Following a 1984 default on the loan payments, one petitioner filed a state court replevin action seeking possession of the farm equipment pledged as security, but respondents obtained an automatic stay of the action when they filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (Code).  On petitioners' motions for relief from the automatic stay, the District Court found respondents' reorganization plan to be infeasible and affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's decision to grant petitioners relief.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that respondents could file a feasible reorganization plan (as suggested by the court), and rejecting petitioners' contention that the Code's ""absolute priority rule,"" 11 U.S.C.  1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) (1982 ed. and Supp. IV) -- which provides that a dissenting class of unsecured creditors must be provided for in full before any junior class can receive or retain any property under the plan -- barred confirmation of any plan which allowed respondents to retain their equity interest in the farm, which was junior to creditors' unsecured claims.  The court held that, under Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., 308 U. S. 106, the absolute priority rule did not bar respondents from retaining their equity interest if they contributed ""money or money's worth"" to the reorganized enterprise, and that their yearly contributions of ""labor, experience, and expertise"" would constitute such a contribution, therefore permitting confirmation of a reorganization plan over petitioners' objections.
Held:  The absolute priority rule applies, and respondents' promise of future labor warrants no exception to its operation.  Pp.  485 U. S. 202-211.
(a) The dicta in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., relied upon by the Court of Appeals, is not applicable here.  Viewed from the time of the plan's approval, respondents' promise of future services was intangible, inalienable, and, in all likelihood, unenforceable.  Unlike ""money or money's worth,"" such promise cannot be exchanged in any market for something of value to the creditors today.  No broader exception to the absolute priority rule than that suggested in Los Angeles Lumber's dicta exists.  The statutory language and  1129(b)'s legislative history bar any expansion of any exception to the absolute priority 
Page 485 U. S. 198
 rule beyond that recognized in this Court's cases at the time Congress enacted the 1978 Bankruptcy Code.  Pp.  485 U. S. 202-206.
(b) The provisions of the Code do not support the contentions that the equitable nature of bankruptcy proceedings prevents petitioners from voting in the class of unsecured creditors, and requires confirmation of a ""fair and equitable"" reorganization plan in the best interests of all creditors and debtors; and that respondents' wholly unsecured creditors (as opposed to petitioners, who have undersecured claims) would fare better under the proposed reorganization plan than if the farm was liquidated.  Whatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must be exercised within the Code's confines.  Pp.  485 U. S. 206-207.
(c) There is no merit to respondents' argument that the absolute priority rule does not apply on the ground that, because the farm has no ""going concern"" value (apart from their own labor on it), any equity interest they retain in a reorganization is worthless to the senior unsecured creditors, and therefore is not ""property"" under the rule.  Even where debts far exceed the current value of assets, a debtor who retains his equity interest in the enterprise retains ""property.""  The legislative history suggests that Congress' meaning of ""property"" was broad, including both tangible and intangible property.  The interest respondents would retain under any reorganization must be considered ""property,"" and therefore can only be retained pursuant to a plan accepted by their creditors or formulated in compliance with the absolute priority rule.  Pp.  485 U. S. 207-209.
(d) Relief from current problems facing farm families cannot come from a misconstruction of the bankruptcy laws, but rather only from action by Congress.  Moreover, the Family Farmers Bankruptcy Act of 1986 creates a new Chapter 12 bankruptcy proceeding whereby family farmers can retain an equity interest in their farms while making loan repayments under a reorganization plan.  To uphold the Court of Appeals' decision would create a method of proceeding under Chapter 11 which would be far more advantageous to farmers than is Chapter 12; this would be contrary to Congress' intent.  Pp.  485 U. S. 209-211.

To uphold the Court of Appeals' decision would create a method of proceeding under Chapter 11 which would be far more advantageous to farmers than is Chapter 12; this would be contrary to Congress' intent.

No. 86-751
Argued December 9, 1987
Decided March 7, 1988
485 U.S. 212

Syllabus 
Under  1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, the term ""capital asset"" means ""property held by the taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business), but does not include"" five specified classes of property.  Between 1968 and 1974, petitioner, a diversified holding company, acquired approximately 65% of a bank's stock.  The bank was apparently prosperous until 1972, when federal examiners classified it as a problem bank.  In 1975, petitioner sold the bulk of the stock at a loss, which it claimed as an ordinary loss deduction on its federal income tax return for that year.  The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction, finding that the loss was a capital loss rather than an ordinary loss.  The Tax Court, relying on cases interpreting Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U. S. 46, held that, since the stock acquired through 1972 was purchased with a substantial investment purpose, it was a capital asset under  1221 and therefore gave rise to a capital loss when it was sold; however, the loss realized on the stock acquired after 1972 was subject to ordinary loss treatment, since that stock had been bought and held exclusively for the business purpose of protecting petitioner's reputation by fending off the bank's failure.  The Court of Appeals reversed the latter determination, ruling that all of the stock sold in 1975 was subject to capital loss treatment.
Held:  A taxpayer's motivation in purchasing an asset is irrelevant to the question whether it falls within the broad definition of ""capital asset"" in  1221.  Petitioner's reading of Corn Products as authorizing ordinary asset treatment for any asset acquired and held for business, rather than investment, purposes is too expansive.  That reading finds no support in  1221's language, which does not mention a business motive test, and is in direct conflict with  1221's broad definition of capital asset.  Similarly, the contention that  1221's five listed exceptions are merely illustrative, rather than exhaustive, is refuted by the statute's ""does not include"" phrase, and by the legislative history and the applicable Treasury regulation.  Moreover, petitioner's reading would make surplusage of three of the statutory exceptions, whose excluded classes of property would undoubtedly satisfy a business motive test.  Corn Products must instead be interpreted as standing for the narrow proposition that ""hedging"" 
Page 485 U. S. 213
 transactions that are an integral part of a business' inventory purchase system fall within  1221's first exception for ""property . . . which would properly be included in the [taxpayer's] inventory.""  Since petitioner, which is not a dealer in securities, has never suggested that its bank stock falls within the inventory exclusion, Corn Products has no application in the present context.  Because petitioner's bank stock falls within 1221's broad definition of ""capital asset"" and is outside the classes of excluded property, the loss arising from its sale is a capital loss.

No. 86-279
Argued November 2, 1987

485 U.S. 224

Syllabus 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5, promulgated under  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act), prohibits, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security, the making of any untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of a material fact that would render statements made not misleading.  In December 1978, Combustion Engineering, Inc., and Basic Incorporated agreed to merge.  During the preceding two years, representatives of the two companies had various meetings and conversations regarding the possibility of a merger; during that time Basic made three public statements denying that any merger negotiations were taking place or that it knew of any corporate developments that would account for heavy trading activity in its stock.  Respondents, former Basic shareholders who sold their stock between Basic's first public denial of merger activity and the suspension of trading in Basic stock just prior to the merger announcement, filed a class action against Basic and some of its directors, alleging that Basic's statements had been false or misleading, in violation of  10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and that respondents were injured by selling their shares at prices artificially depressed by those statements.  The District Court certified respondents' class, but granted summary judgment for petitioners on the merits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the class certification, agreeing that, under a ""fraud-on-the-market"" theory, respondents' reliance on petitioners' misrepresentations could be presumed, and thus that common issues predominated over questions pertaining to individual plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded, rejecting the District Court's view that preliminary merger discussions are immaterial as a matter of law, and holding that even discussions that might not otherwise have been material become so by virtue of a statement denying their existence.
Held:
1. The standard set forth in TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, whereby an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that its disclosure would have been considered significant by a reasonable investor, is expressly adopted for the  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context.  Pp.  485 U. S. 230-232. 
Page 485 U. S. 225

2. The ""agreement-in-principle"" test, under which preliminary merger discussions do not become material until the would-be merger partners have reached agreement as to the price and structure of the transaction, is rejected as a bright-line materiality test.  Its policy-based rationales do not justify the exclusion of otherwise significant information from the definition of materiality.  Pp.  485 U. S. 232-236.
3. The Court of Appeals' view that information concerning otherwise insignificant developments becomes material solely because of an affirmative denial of their existence is also rejected:  Rule 10b-5 requires that the statements be misleading as to a
material fact.  Pp.  485 U. S. 237-238.
4. Materiality in the merger context depends on the probability that the transaction will be consummated, and its significance to the issuer of the securities.  Thus, materiality depends on the facts, and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Pp.  485 U. S. 238-241.
5. The courts below properly applied a presumption of reliance, supported in part by the fraud-on-the-market theory, instead of requiring each plaintiff to show direct reliance on Basic's statements.  Such a presumption relieves the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff of an unrealistic evidentiary burden, and is consistent with, and supportive of, the Act's policy of requiring full disclosure and fostering reliance on market integrity.  The presumption is also supported by common sense and probability:  an investor who trades stock at the price set by an impersonal market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.  Because most publicly available information is reflected in market price, an investor's reliance on any public material misrepresentations may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b-5 action.  Pp.  485 U. S. 241-247.
6. The presumption of reliance may be rebutted:  Rule 10b-5 defendants may attempt to show that the price was not affected by their misrepresentation, or that the plaintiff did not trade in reliance on the integrity of the market price.  Pp.  485 U. S. 248-249.

Syllabus 
Two years after respondent, a management-level employee in one of petitioner city's agencies, successfully appealed a temporary suspension to petitioner's Civil Service Commission (Commission), he was transferred to a clerical position in another city agency, from which he was laid off the next year.  In respondent's suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, the jury found petitioner liable on the theory that respondent's First Amendment rights had been violated through retaliatory actions taken in response to his suspension appeal.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment entered on this verdict, finding that the jury had implicitly determined that respondent's layoff was brought about by an unconstitutional city policy.  Applying a test under which a ""policymaker"" is one whose employment decisions are ""final"" in the sense that they are not subjected to de novo review by higher ranking officials, the court concluded that petitioner could be held liable for adverse personnel decisions made by respondent's supervisors.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
798 F.2d 1168, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that:
1. Petitioner's failure to timely object under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 to a jury instruction on municipalities'  1983 liability for their employees' unconstitutional acts does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to determine the proper legal standard for imposing such liability.  The same legal issue was raised by petitioner's motions for summary judgment and a directed verdict, was considered and decided by the Court of Appeals, and is likely to recur in  1983 litigation against municipalities.  Review in this Court will not undermine the policy of judicial efficiency that underlies Rule 51.  Pp.  485 U. S. 118-121.
2. The Court of Appeals applied an incorrect legal standard for determining when isolated decisions by municipal officials or employees may expose the municipality to  1983 liability.  The identification of officials having ""final policymaking authority"" is a question of state (including local) law, rather than a question of fact for the jury.  Here, it appears that petitioner's City Charter gives the authority to set employment policy to the Mayor and Aldermen, who are empowered to enact ordinances, 
Page 485 U. S. 113
 and to the Commission, whose function is to hear employees' appeals.  Petitioner cannot be held liable unless respondent proved the existence of an unconstitutional policy promulgated by officials having such authority.  The Mayor and Aldermen did not enact an ordinance permitting retaliatory transfers or layoffs.  Nor has the Commission indicated that such actions were permissible; it has, on the contrary, granted respondent at least partial relief in a series of appeals from adverse personnel decisions.  The Court of Appeals' findings that the decisions of respondent's supervisors were not individually reviewed for ""substantive propriety"" by higher supervisory officials, and were accorded substantial deference by the Commission on appeal, are insufficient to support the conclusion that the supervisors had been delegated the authority to establish transfer and layoff policy.  When a subordinate's discretionary decisions are constrained or subjected to review by authorized policymakers, they, and not the subordinate, have final policymaking authority.  Positing a delegation based on their mere acquiescence in, or failure to investigate the basis of, the subordinate's decisions does not serve  1983's purposes where (as here) the wrongfulness of those decisions arises from a retaliatory motive or other unstated rationale.  Pp.  485 U. S. 122-131.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, agreed that respondent's supervisor at his first agency did not possess delegated authority to establish final employment policy such that petitioner could be held liable under  1983 for the allegedly unlawful decision to transfer respondent to a dead-end job, but concluded that, in any case in which the policymaking authority of a municipal tortfeasor is in doubt, although state law will naturally be the appropriate starting point, ultimately the factfinder must determine where such policymaking authority actually resides, and not simply where the applicable state law purports to put it.  JUSTICE BRENNAN also concluded that the ""custom or usage"" doctrine cannot compensate for the inherent inflexibility of an approach that relies exclusively on state law, for that doctrine simply does not apply to isolated unconstitutional acts by subordinates having de facto, but not statutory, final policymaking authority; that a subordinate's decisions are not rendered nonfinal simply because they are subject to some form of review, however limited; and that the question is open whether a municipality can be subjected to liability for a policy that, while not unconstitutional in and of itself, may give rise to constitutional deprivations.

Argued January 11, 1988
Decided March 1, 1988
485 U.S. 88

Syllabus 
In its 1985 opinion in this litigation, the Court ruled that Alabama and Mississippi, rather than the United States, own their respective portions of the bed under Mississippi Sound, and directed the parties to submit to the Special Master a proposed appropriate decree.  470 U. S. 93.  Mississippi and the United States submitted proposed supplemental decrees which reflected their disagreement as to Mississippi's coastline at two points (Alabama's coastline is no longer in dispute).  The first point of contention occurs between two islands along the Sound's southern boundary.  The second point involves Mississippi's claimed interest in seabed south of Mississippi Sound in the vicinity of Chandeleur Sound.  In his Supplemental Report, the Master concluded (a) that the decree proposed by Mississippi should not be entered, and (b) that, while the United States' solution as to the second disputed point would be preferable, it would amount to a modification of the Court's 1985 opinion because it would be beyond the scope of the reference to the Master, which concerned only Mississippi Sound and its boundary.  The Master recommended that the Court enter an order directing the parties to submit a decree defining the coastline of Alabama and Mississippi ""to the extent agreed upon""; defining Mississippi's coastline as to the first disputed point as proposed by the United States; and defining Mississippi's coastline as to the second point as lying along a described line heading west from an island on Mississippi Sound's southern boundary to the Louisiana border.  Mississippi noted exceptions relating only to the second point of contention, and not at all to the first contention.  The United States is in opposition.
Held:
1. Since the current phase of this litigation has so far dealt only with Mississippi Sound, and has not focused on Mississippi's interest south of that Sound, this Court will not on the present record determine the extent of Mississippi's rights thereto without the parties' complete agreement and the Special Master's ready acquiescence.  However, any party may advance such claims as it might have with respect to the area south of Mississippi Sound and in the vicinity of Chandeleur Sound by filing a timely complaint in these proceedings.  Pp.  485 U. S. 92-93. 
Page 485 U. S. 89

2. Because Mississippi's presently pending objections do not relate to Mississippi Sound nor contest the validity of that Sound's closing lines recommended by the Master, all parties are in agreement as to that Sound and its boundary.  P.  485 U. S. 92.
Exceptions of Mississippi overruled, and Special Master's Supplemental Report and his recommendations, to the extent they are consistent with this opinion, adopted and confirmed.

Argued December 1, 1987

485 U.S. 94

Syllabus 
Respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, overstayed his visa.  After he pleaded guilty in 1981 to drug charges, deportation proceedings were initiated, at which he expressly declined to seek asylum as a refugee.  In 1982, he was ordered deported, and in 1984, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal.  In 1985, while his petition for review in the Court of Appeals was pending, respondent filed a motion with the BIA requesting a reopening of his deportation proceeding to enable him to apply for asylum and a withholding of deportation.  He claimed that he had a well-founded fear that, if he was returned to Ghana, his life and freedom would be threatened by the government that had seized power in 1981.  Moreover, in 1984, he had received a surprise visit from a former acquaintance who had become a Ghana government official and who, respondent believed, was attempting to entice him to return in order to force him to disclose the whereabouts of his brother and other government enemies.  The BIA denied respondent's motion both on the ground that he had failed to make out a prima facie case of eligibility for asylum and on the alternative ground that he had failed to explain reasonably his decision not to request asylum in the first instance.  The BIA noted that all of the facts set forth in the motion had been available to respondent at the time of the deportation hearing, except for the 1984 visit, which may have been in fact a purely social visit.  The Court of Appeals consolidated respondent's petitions for review and affirmed the deportation order, but reversed the order denying the motion to reopen and remanded for further proceedings.  Stating that the sole issue was whether respondent had made a prima facie case for reopening, the court ruled that the appropriate standard of judicial review was the strict standard that would be applied when passing on a motion for summary judgment, rather than an abuse-of-discretion standard.
Held:
1. Regardless of what may be the appropriate standard of judicial review when the BIA holds that the movant for reopening deportation proceedings has not established a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought (an issue not decided here), the abuse-of-discretion standard of review is appropriate when the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen 
Page 485 U. S. 95
 is based on its finding that the movant has not introduced previously unavailable, material evidence or, in an asylum application case, that the movant has not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum initially.  The reasons why motions to reopen are disfavored in deportation proceedings are comparable to those that apply to petitions for rehearing and to motions for new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence -- particularly the strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.  The appropriate analogy is not a motion for summary judgment but, instead, a motion for a new trial in a criminal case on the basis of newly discovered evidence, as to which the moving party bears a heavy burden.  Pp.  485 U. S. 104-110.
2. If respondent had made a timely application for asylum, supported by the factual allegations and exhibits set forth in his motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge would have been required to grant him an evidentiary hearing.  However, an alien who has already been found deportable has a much heavier burden when he first advances his request for asylum in a motion to reopen.  The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it held that respondent had not reasonably explained his failure to apply for asylum prior to the completion of the initial deportation proceeding.  Pp.  485 U. S. 110-111.
802 F.2d 1096, reversed.

 Robert A. BRECHEENv. OKLAHOMA.No. 86-7002 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 29, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This Court has insisted that an accused be tried by ""a public tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement, and tyrannical power."" Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 236-237, 476-477 (1940). We have recognized that failure to ensure the impartiality of a jury ""violates even the minimal standards of due process."" Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 722, 1642 (1961). The Oklahoma court's denial of petitioner's unopposed motion for change of venue raises serious doubts about whether those minimal standards were met in this case. These doubts demand that we undertake two separate inquiries. First, we must consider whether and to what extent our precedents regarding jury impartiality set constitutional limits on state change of venue standards. Second, we must address the proper application of those precedents to the unique setting of capital sentencings. 
 I  
 On March 23, 1983, Marie Stubbs, wife of Hilton Stubbs, a prominent storekeeper in Ardmore, Oklahoma, was shot and killed in her home. The murder and the subsequent arrest of petitioner Robert Brecheen were the subject of extensive local newspaper and television coverage. Ardmore, which has a population of approximately 25,000, is located in Carter County, which has a population of approximately 40,000. Petitioner's attorney filed a motion, accompanied by affidavits, for change of venue from Carter County. Although the motion was unopposed, the trial judge refused to grant it after conducting voir dire. The jury that was finally empaneled contained one person who knew the victim, one 
Page 485 U.S. 909 , 910
 who knew the victim's daughter, and three who knew the victim's husband. All but one of the jurors were customers at the Stubbs' family store. Three jurors knew the prosecuting attorney and three knew officers who would testify for the prosecution. All of the jurors had heard of the case through pretrial publicity. The jury convicted petitioner of burglary and homicide and sentenced him to death. 
 On appeal, petitioner challenged, inter alia, the trial court's refusal to grant him a change of venue. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioner's claim, holding that ""[i]t is only when a criminal defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that a fair trial is a virtual impossibility that such a motion should be granted ."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. 
 II  
 This Court has established that a refusal to grant a motion for change of venue may constitute a violation of due process. See Groppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U.S. 505 (1971); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723 (1963); Irvin v. Dowd, supra. A defendant seeking to establish such a violation must demonstrate either that his trial resulted in ""identifiable prejudice"" or that it gave rise to a presumption of prejudice because it involved ""such a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process."" Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 542-543, 1632-1633 (1965). In deciding whether such a presumption of prejudice is warranted, courts must examine ""any indications in the totality of circumstances that petitioner's trial was not fundamentally fair."" Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 799, 2036 (1975). 
 We have had little occasion to apply these basic principles to determine whether particular state standards for change of venue comport with the requirements of due process. Most of our precedents regarding due process and jury neutrality consist of careful examinations of the circumstances surrounding specific trials to determine whether they give rise to a presumption of prejudice. See, e.g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333 (1966); Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466 (1965). Although we did strike down one state venue statute which categorically denied change of venue for misdemeanors, see Groppi v. Wisconsin, supra, we have not considered any other wholesale restrictions on venue change. [485 U.S. 909 , 911]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 29, 1988
 Rehearing Denied June 20, 1988. 
 See 487 U.S. 1211. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether a plaintiff may prevail on a disparate treatment claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq., only by establishing that the employer's discriminatory intent was the ""but for"" cause of the adverse employment action. 
Page 485 U.S. 914 , 915
 The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held in this case that a Title VII plaintiff must prove that ""the discriminatory motivation was a determining factor in the challenged employment decision in that the employee would have received the job absent the discriminatory motivation ."" 830 F.2d 659, 664 (1987). The court found support for this ""but for"" standard of causation in the language of Title VII, which prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee or potential employee "" because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin ."" 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). 
 The Seventh Circuit expressly rejected the standard of causation adopted by the Eighth Circuit in Bibbs v. Block, 778 F.2d 1318 (1985) (en banc). A plaintiff can establish Title VII liability under Bibbs merely by proving that ""an unlawful motive played some part in the employment decision."" Id., at 1323. If the employer establishes that discriminatory intent was not the determinative factor in the employment decision, however, the plaintiff's recovery is limited to declaratory relief, an injunction against future or continued discrimination, and partial attorney's fees. 
 The Seventh Circuit's view that Title VII liability is established only when an unlawful motive was the ""but for"" cause of the challenged employment action is shared by three other Circuits. See Haskins v. United States Dept. of Army, 808 F.2d 1192, 1198 (CA6), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 815 (1987); Lewis v. University of Pittsburgh, 725 F.2d 910, 915-916 (CA3 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 892 (1984); Mack v. Cape Elizabeth School Bd., 553 F.2d 720, 722 (CA1 1977). Two Circuits have indicated that the discriminatory motive must be a ""significant"" or ""substantial"" factor, but not necessarily the determinative factor, before liability may be imposed on an employer under Title VII. See Fadhl v. City and County of San Francisco, 741 F.2d 1163, 1166 (CA9 1984); Whiting v. Jackson State University, 616 F.2d 116, 121 (CA5 1980). 
 Accordingly, in view of the divergent positions taken by the Federal Courts of Appeals with regard to the standard of causation to be applied in determining Title VII liability, I would grant certiorari.

Ed.2d 859 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. But even if I did not hold this view, I would grant this petition in order to address the important unresolved issue whether an instruction that reduces a jury's sense of responsibility over a death sentence is nonetheless per se constitutional if it is accurate and nonmisleading, even when the instruction serves no legitimate state penological interest. 
 II  
 In this case, petitioner was sentenced to death in accordance with the jury's recommendation. The trial court had instructed the jury: 
Page 485 U.S. 916 , 917
 Court follows certain additional procedures required by laws of this State. Therefore, even if you recommend the death penalty, the law requires the Court to decide whether or not the defendant, David Joseph Steffen, will actually be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment."" Pet. for Cert. 6.
 The Ohio Supreme Court characterized this as an ""instruction to the jury that their recommendation of death would not be binding on the court, and that the final responsibility for the imposition of the death penalty rests with the court."" 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 509 N.E.2d 383, 387 (1987 ). The Ohio Supreme Court then rejected petitioner's argument that ""such an instruction impermissibly reduces the jury's sense of responsibility and increases the likelihood of a recommendation of death,"" ibid., relying upon State v. Buell, 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 489 N.E.2d 795 (1986), a prior Ohio Supreme Court case that had rejected the same challenge to a substantially similar instruction. Although Buell went out of its way to "" emphatically emphasize [that] the better procedure would be to have no comment by the prosecutor or by the trial judge on the question of who bears the ultimate responsibility,"" the court concluded that the instruction was neither an inaccurate nor a misleading statement of Ohio law and held that the instruction was thus constitutional. Id., at 144, 489 N.E.2d at 813. 
 I have no cause to second-guess the conclusion that this instruction accurately reflects the state of Ohio law, as authoritatively construed by the Ohio Supreme Court itself. I note, however, that although an Ohio jury's recommendation of death is not binding on a trial court, a trial court cannot impose the death sentence when the jury recommends life imprisonment. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2929.03(D)(2) (1987). Ohio's statutory scheme thus contemplates that juries will bear a crucial responsibility in deciding whether Ohio will impose a death sentence: making their recommendation necessary, if not sufficient, to any sentence of death. The question this case presents is whether an instruction stressing the preliminary nature of a jury's decision can so minimize the jury's sense of responsibility for its decision and so increase the likelihood of a recommendation of death as to be unconstitutional despite the accuracy of the instruction. This question is particularly sharpened here, where the state court evidently concedes that the instruction serves no valid state interest and in- [485 U.S. 916 , 918]

 See 485 U.S. 1015. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973-2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate petitioner's death sentence. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition because petitioner William Andrews was convicted of murder and sentenced to death under circumstances raising grave concerns

 of impermissible racial bias. These circumstances include a midtrial incident in which a juror handed the bailiff a napkin with a drawing of a man on a gallows above the inscription, ""Hang the Niggers."" The District Court in this case refused even to undertake an evidentiary hearing to investigate petitioner's substantial allegations of racial prejudice. The Constitution cannot countenance such indifference and summary treatment when a person's life is at stake. 
 I  
 Petitioner was convicted for his role in a multiple murder during the robbery of a hi-fi shop in Ogden, Utah. The ringleader of the crimes, Dale Pierre, was executed last year. Evidence at trial indicated that petitioner had a substantially less active role in the murders than Pierre . The two men entered the shop together and forced five people into the store's basement. There the victims were forced to drink liquid drain cleaner, which induced violent vomiting. One of the two victims who survived the robbery testified that petitioner said, ""I can't do it, I'm scared,"" and that petitioner left the scene shortly thereafter. Only after petitioner left did Pierre carry out, in particularly gruesome fashion, the multiple murders for which petitioner has been sentenced to die. Pet. for Cert. 3. 
 The murders understandably attracted substantial attention in the local press and the community from which the jury venire was drawn. The incident also may have generated racist sentiments, inasmuch as the defendants were black people and the victims were white members of the local community. The single black member of the venire was excluded, and an all-white jury was empaneled. 
 An ugly racial incident involving the jury occurred during the trial. The jury was eating lunch in a separate dining room when a juror presented the bailiff with a drawing that had been made on a napkin. The drawing represented a stick figure hanging on a gallows. Underneath the figure were the words, ""Hang the Niggers."" The bailiff was unable to say who had made the drawing or how many other jurors had seen it, although he did inform the court that ""some of the jurors"" had asked him ""what the court may do about this."" The only action the trial court took in response was to issue a general instruction to the jury to ""ignore communications from foolish people."" Id., at 9-10, and n. 4. [485 U.S. 919 , 921]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 29, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 447, 2365, 41 L. Ed.2d 182 (1974), this Court expressly left open the question of the admissibility of physical evidence obtained as a result of an interrogation conducted contrary to the rules set forth in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Since that time, the state and federal courts have been divided on this question. [Footnote 1] Indeed, in Massachusetts v. White, 439 U.S. 280 
Page 485 U.S. 922 , 923
 (1978), this Court was evenly divided on the issue of the admissibility of physical evidence obtained from an interrogation that violated Miranda. 
 Here, petitioner was arrested in Mexico by local officials when he attempted to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a store in Tijuana. While still in the custody of Mexican police, petitioner was questioned by United States Secret Service agents who failed to inform him of his rights under Miranda. During the questioning, petitioner provided agents with a detailed description of a counterfeiting operation based in San Diego, California. Agents used petitioner's confession to obtain a warrant to search the facility petitioner described; there, a variety of items relating to the counterfeiting enterprise were discovered. 
 Petitioner argued that the physical evidence obtained in the search of the counterfeiting operation should be suppressed, claiming that this evidence was inadmissible as ""fruits"" of the interrogation which violated Miranda. But the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's rejection of this contention. 812 F.2d 1188 (1987). The Court of Appeals rested its conclusion in part on prior Ninth Circuit decisions, e.g., United States v. Lemon, 550 F.2d 467, 473 (1977), and in part on our decision in Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304-309, 1290-1293 (1985), which held that a confession that was the ""fruit"" of an earlier violation of Miranda (but not the Fifth Amendment) was admissible. 
 While Elstad has been considered illuminating by some Courts of Appeals on the question of admissibility of physical evidence yielded from a Miranda violation,2 that decision did not squarely address the question presented here, and in fact, left the matter open. Elstad, supra, 470 U.S ., at 308, 105 S.Ct. at 1292; Id., at 347, n. 29, n. 29 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Consequently, I would grant certiorari in this case [485 U.S. 922 , 924]

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973-2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate petitioner's death sentence. 
 I [ Engle v. Florida 485 U.S. 924 (1988) ][924-Continued.] 
 Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition for certiorari to consider petitioner's contention that the Florida Supreme Court is applying the review standard of Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (1975) (per curiam ), in a manner that has denigrated the role of legitimate mitigating circumstances in Florida's sentencing scheme and that has led to the arbitrary infliction of the death penalty. Petitioner's sentencing jury recommended life imprisonment, but the trial judge overrode the jury's recommendation and imposed the death sentence. Under Florida's unusual system of capital sentencing, the trial judge is given the power to overturn a sentencing jury's rejection of the death penalty. In upholding Florida's sentencing system against various constitutional challenges, this Court repeatedly has relied on the Florida rule, announced in Tedder, that ""[i]n order to sustain a sentence of death following a jury's recommendation of life, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ,"" ibid. See Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 465- 466, 3164-3166 (1984); Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939, 955-956, 958, 3427-3429 ( 1983) (REHNQUIST, J., joined by BURGER, C.J., and WHITE and O'CONNOR, JJ .); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 249, 2965d 913 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.). The trial judge in this case failed even to consider the reasonableness of the jury's recommendation and refused to recognize petitioner's lesser role in the crime as a valid mitigating circumstance. The Florida Supreme Court nonetheless affirmed the override of the jury's recommendation, arguing that it would be 
Page 485 U.S. 924 , 925
 ""unreasonable . . . to conclude that [petitioner] played no part in the brutal slaying."" 510 So.2d 881, 884 (1987) (per curiam ). This reasoning evinces a cramped view of mitigating circumstances regarding evidence of petitioner's lesser role that is contrary to the constitutional principles recognized in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 ( 1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 ( 1982). In addition, a review of this and other cases convinces me that the Florida Supreme Court has embraced conflicting views of whether such mitigating evidence may justify the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment. The court's inconsistent application of the Tedder standard in felony-murder cases has led to the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. 
 Petitioner was charged, along with Rufus Stevens, with the murder of Eleanor Tolin, a cashier at the Majik Market in Jacksonville, Florida. [Footnote 1] Evidence presented by the State at trial indicated that Stevens had a leadership role and planned the robbery of the market, whereas petitioner was the follower in the scheme. Evidence also indicated that Stevens was the actual killer. During guilt-phase deliberations, the jurors twice asked the judge whether they had ""to be convinced the defendant personally killed the victim to render a [verdict] of murder in the first degree."" Pet. for Cert. 5.2 The penalty phase of the trial began immediately after the jury returned the guilty verdict. No additional evidence was presented. Counsel presented closing arguments and the jury was instructed to base its penalty recommendation on the evidence presented during the guilt phase. In his summation to the jury prior to the sentencing phase, the prosecutor stated:

Counsel presented closing arguments and the jury was instructed to base its penalty recommendation on the evidence presented during the guilt phase.

No. 86-753
Argued November 10, 1987
Decided February 24, 1988
485 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Under a San Jose, Cal., rent control ordinance (Ordinance), a landlord may automatically raise the annual rent of a tenant in possession by as much as eight percent, but if a tenant objects to a higher increase, a hearing is required to determine whether the landlord's proposed increase is ""reasonable under the circumstances,"" and the hearing officer is directed to consider specified factors, including ""the hardship to a tenant.""  Appellants, an individual landlord and Tri-County Apartment House Owners Association (Association), which represents owners and lessors of real property located in San Jose, filed a state court action seeking a declaration that the Ordinance, particularly the ""tenant hardship"" provision, is facially invalid under the Federal Constitution.  The court entered judgment on the pleadings in appellants' favor, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  However, the California Supreme Court reversed, rejecting appellants' arguments under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Held:
1. Appellants have standing to challenge the Ordinance's constitutionality, even though they did not allege that either the individual appellant or appellant Association's members have ""hardship tenants"" who might trigger the Ordinance's hearing process, or that they have been or will be aggrieved by a hearing officer's determination that a certain proposed rent increase is unreasonable on the ground of tenant hardship.  When standing is challenged on the basis of the pleadings, all material allegations of the complaint must be taken as true, and the complaint must be 
Page 485 U. S. 2
 construed in favor of the complaining party.  Appellants alleged that their properties are subject to the Ordinance, and stated at oral argument that the Association represents ""most of the residential unit owners in the city and [has] many hardship tenants.""  Thus, the likelihood of enforcement of the Ordinance, with the concomitant probability that a rent will be reduced below what the landlord would otherwise be able to obtain, is a sufficient threat of actual injury to satisfy Art. III's requirement that a plaintiff who challenges a law must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the law's operation or enforcement.  Pp.  485 U. S. 6-8.
2. Appellants' contention that application of the Ordinance's tenant hardship provision violates the Takings Clause -- since reducing, because of tenant hardship, what would otherwise be a ""reasonable"" rent under the other, objective factors specified in the Ordinance relating to the landlord's costs or the rental market's condition, accomplishes a taking and transfer of the landlord's property to individual hardship tenants -- is premature.  There is no evidence that the tenant hardship provision has in fact ever been relied upon by a hearing officer to reduce a rent below the figure it would have been set at on the basis of the other specified factors.  In addition, the Ordinance does not require that a hearing officer in fact reduce a proposed rent increase on grounds of tenant hardship, but only makes it mandatory that tenant hardship be considered.  In takings cases, the constitutionality of laws should not be decided except in an actual factual setting that makes such a decision necessary.  Pp.  485 U. S. 8-11.
3. The mere provision in the Ordinance that a hearing officer may consider the tenant's hardship in finally fixing a reasonable rent does not render the Ordinance facially invalid under the Due Process Clause.  The Ordinance's purpose of preventing unreasonable rent increases caused by the city's housing shortage is a legitimate exercise of appellees' police powers.  Moreover, there is no merit to appellants' argument that it is arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant for appellees to attempt to accomplish the additional goal of reducing the burden of housing costs on low-income tenants by requiring that ""hardship to a tenant"" be considered in determining the amount of excess rent increase that is ""reasonable under the circumstances.""  The protection of consumer welfare is a legitimate and rational goal of price or rate regulation.  The Ordinance's scheme represents a rational attempt to accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that landlords are guaranteed a fair return on their investment.  Pp.  485 U. S. 11-14.
4. The Ordinance, on its face, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Its classification scheme is rationally related to the legitimate

 purpose of protecting tenants.  It is not irrational for the Ordinance to treat landlords differently on the basis of whether or not they have hardship tenants.  Pp.  485 U. S. 14-15.

No. 86-937

Decided February 24, 1988
485 U.S. 25

Syllabus 
At respondent's federal court jury trial, which resulted in his conviction of counts of mail fraud involving arson-related insurance claims, defense counsel urged several times in his closing argument that the Government had not allowed respondent (who did not testify) to explain his side of the story, and had unfairly denied him the opportunity to explain his actions.  Out of the jury's presence, the prosecutor objected to defense counsel's remarks and contended that the defense had ""opened the door"" to commenting upon respondent's failure to testify.  The judge agreed and respondent did not object.  The prosecutor then, in his rebuttal summation, remarked that respondent ""could have taken the stand and explained it to you.""  Defense counsel did not object and did not request a cautionary instruction, but the judge admonished the jury that no inference could be drawn from a defendant's election not to testify.  The Court of Appeals reversed respondent's convictions, holding, inter alia, that the prosecutor's comment had deprived respondent of a fair trial under the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  The prosecutor's comment did not violate respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege to be free from compulsory self-incrimination.  The trial court reasonably interpreted defense counsel's closing argument remarks to mean that the Government had not allowed respondent to explain his side of the story either before or during trial.  The prosecutor's statement that respondent could have explained his story to the jury did not, in the light of defense counsel's comments, infringe upon respondent's Fifth Amendment rights.  Where the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's silence, or to treat the defendant's silence as substantive evidence of guilt, Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, holds that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is violated.  But where, as in this case, the prosecutor's reference to the defendant's opportunity to testify is a fair response to a claim made by the defendant or his counsel, there is no violation of the privilege.

485 U.S. 46

Syllabus 
Respondent, a nationally known minister and commentator on politics and public affairs, filed a diversity action in Federal District Court against petitioners, a nationally circulated magazine and its publisher, to recover damages for, inter alia, libel and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the publication of an advertisement ""parody"" which, among other things, portrayed respondent as having engaged in a drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.  The jury found against respondent on the libel claim, specifically finding that the parody could not ""reasonably be understood as describing actual facts . . . or events,"" but ruled in his favor on the emotional distress claim, stating that he should be awarded compensatory and punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' contention that the ""actual malice"" standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, must be met before respondent can recover for emotional distress.  Rejecting as irrelevant the contention that, because the jury found that the parody did not describe actual facts, the ad was an opinion protected by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution, the court ruled that the issue was whether the ad's publication was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Held:  In order to protect the free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern, the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures and public officials from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by reason of the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody at issue without showing in addition that the publication contains a false statement of fact which was made with ""actual malice,"" i.e., with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.  The State's interest in protecting public figures from emotional distress is not sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is patently offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury when that speech could not reasonably have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the public figure involved.  Here, respondent is clearly a ""public figure"" for First Amendment purposes, and the lower courts' finding that the ad parody was not reasonably believable must be accepted.  ""Outrageousness""

485 U.S. 58

Syllabus 
Petitioner, an employee of the Small Business Administration (SBA), was the principal SBA contact for James DeShazer, the president of a company that participated in an SBA program.  DeShazer believed that his company was not being provided with certain program benefits because he had rejected petitioner's repeated requests for loans.  Assisting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in an investigation of the matter, DeShazer, under FBI surveillance, offered petitioner a previously requested loan, which petitioner agreed to accept.  Later, DeShazer met petitioner and gave him the money.  Petitioner was immediately arrested and charged with the federal offense of accepting a bribe in exchange for an official act.  The District Court denied petitioner's pretrial motion seeking to raise an entrapment defense, ruling that entrapment was not available because petitioner would not admit all of the elements (including the requisite mental state) of the offense.  Petitioner testified in his own defense that, although he had accepted the loan, he believed it was a personal loan unrelated to his SBA duties.  The court refused to instruct the jury as to entrapment, the jury found petitioner guilty, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Even if the defendant in a federal criminal case denies one or more elements of the crime, he is entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment -- a defense that has the two related elements of Government inducement of the crime, and a lack of predisposition on the defendant's part to engage in the criminal conduct.  There is no merit to the Government's contention that, because entrapment presupposes the commission of a crime, a defendant should not be allowed both to deny the offense or an element thereof, and to rely on the inconsistent, affirmative defense of entrapment.  Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically authorize inconsistent pleading, the absence of a cognate provision in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is not because of the Rules' intent to more severely restrict criminal defendants than civil parties, but because of the much less elaborate system of pleadings -- particularly with respect to the defendant -- in a criminal case.  A simple not guilty plea puts the prosecution to its proof as to all elements of the crime charged, and raises the defense of entrapment.  Moreover, the Government's arguments that allowing a defendant to rely on inconsistent defenses 
Page 485 U. S. 59
 will encourage perjury, lead to jury confusion, and subvert the trial's truthfinding function are not persuasive.  The question whether the evidence at trial was insufficient to support an entrapment instruction was pretermitted by the Court of Appeals, and is open for consideration by that court on remand.

485 U.S. 80

Syllabus 
In 1982, a default judgment was entered against appellant in appellee medical center's Texas state court suit to recover a sum allegedly due under appellant's guarantee of a hospital debt incurred by one of his employees.  The judgment was recorded, a writ of attachment was issued, and appellant's real property was sold to satisfy the judgment.  In 1984, appellant initiated a bill of review proceeding seeking, inter alia, to set aside the default judgment and void the sale, and alleging that, since the original service of process itself showed it was untimely made and, in fact, he had never been personally served, the judgment was void under Texas law.  The court entered summary judgment for appellee on the ground that it must be shown in a bill of review proceeding that the complainant had a meritorious defense to the action in which the judgment was entered, which appellant conceded he did not have.  In affirming, the State Court of Appeals rejected appellant's contention that the meritorious defense requirement violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, declaring that the requirement was ""not onerous.""  The State Supreme Court denied appellant's application for a writ of error, noting ""No Reversible Error.""
Held:  The holding below contravenes this Court's precedents, under which a judgment entered without notice or service violates the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306; Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U. S. 545.  The argument that appellant suffered no harm from the default judgment, since the same judgment would again be entered on retrial absent a meritorious defense, is untenable because, had he had notice of the suit, appellant might have impleaded the employee whose debt had been guaranteed, worked out a settlement, paid the debt, or sold the property himself rather than suffer its sale at a constable's auction for allegedly much less than its true value.  Nor is there any doubt that the entry of the judgment itself had substantial adverse consequences, since the judgment was entered on county records, became a lien on appellant's property which impaired his ability to mortgage or alienate the property, and was the basis for issuance of the writ of execution under which the property was promptly sold, again without notice.  The contention that appellant has other

Syllabus 
Petitioners hold record title to 42 acres of Mississippi land underlying a bayou and a number of streams, which, although several miles north of the Gulf Coast and nonnavigable, are nonetheless influenced by the tide, since they are adjacent and tributary to a navigable river flowing into the Gulf of Mexico that is affected by the tide's ebb and flow.  Petitioners brought a quiet title suit after the State issued oil and gas leases for the property in question on the theory that it had acquired at the time of statehood and held in public trust all land lying under any waters influenced by the tide, whether navigable or not.  The State Supreme Court affirmed the Chancery Court's decision finding that the State had fee simple title to the property, rejecting petitioners' contention that the State had acquired title only to lands under navigable waters.
Held:
1. Since the States, upon entering the Union, were given ownership over all lands beneath waters subject to the tide's influence -- see, e.g., Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1; Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161 -- the lands at issue passed to Mississippi at the time of statehood, even though the waters under which they lay were not navigable in fact.  Pp.  484 U. S. 473-481.
(a) Petitioners' contention that, under the English common law rule, the Crown's ownership of lands beneath tidewaters actually rested on the navigability of those waters, rather than the ebb and flow of the tide, is not persuasive, since the cases relied on by petitioners did not deal with tidal, nonnavigable waters, while Shivley v. Bowlby, supra, and its progeny, clearly establish how this Court has interpreted the common law.  Although none of the latter cases actually dealt with lands such as those involved here, this Court has never suggested that its rule that the States owned all the soil beneath waters affected by the tide was anything less than an accurate description of the governing law.  Pp.  484 U. S. 477-478.
(b) Petitioners' contention that subsequent cases from this Court developing the American public trust doctrine make it clear that navigability -- and not tidal influence -- has become the sine qua non of the public trust interest in tidelands in this country is a!so not persuasive.  Although The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, and 
Page 484 U. S. 470
 Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, did extend admiralty jurisdiction and public trust doctrine to navigable freshwaters and the lands beneath them, those cases did not simultaneously withdraw from public trust coverage the lands beneath waters influenced by the ebb and flow of the tide which had been consistently recognized by this Court as being within the doctrine's scope.  Pp.  484 U. S. 478-480.
(c) Petitioners' position is weakened by their concession that the States own the nonnavigable tidelands bordering the oceans, bays, and estuaries.  While it is obvious that these waters are part of the sea, and that the lands beneath them are state property, ultimately, the only proof of this fact can be that the waters are influenced by the ebb and flow of the tide.  Moreover, although there is a difference in degree between the waters in this case and nonnavigable seashore waters that are affected by the tide, there is no difference in kind, since both types of waters are connected to the sea and share those geographical, chemical, and environmental qualities that make lands beneath tidal waters unique.  The ebb-and-flow rule has the benefit of uniformity, certainty, and ease of application, and will not be abandoned now, after its lengthy history, in favor of one of the unpersuasive and unsatisfactory alternatives offered by petitioners.  Pp.  484 U. S. 480-481.
2. The contention that the State Supreme Court's decision is inequitable, and would upset various kinds of property expectations and interests which have matured since the State joined the Union, is without merit.  By consistently holding that the public trust in lands under water includes ""title to all land under tidewater,"" and by describing uses of such lands not related to navigability, Mississippi cases have clearly and unequivocally indicated the State's claims to tidelands, whether navigable or not, such that any contrary expectations cannot be considered reasonable.  Affirming the judgment below will not upset land titles in all coastal States, as petitioners contend, but will simply confirm prevailing ownership rights both in States having the same rule as Mississippi and in other States that have granted all or a portion of their tidelands to adjacent upland property owners.  Indeed, it would be far more upsetting to settled expectations to reverse on the ground that the scope of the public trust is limited to lands beneath navigable tidal waters, since many lands titles, interests, and rights have been created on the basis of the ebb-and-flow rule.  The fact that petitioners have long been the record titleholders, or paid taxes on the lands in question, cannot divest the State of its ownership, since the State Supreme Court held that, under Mississippi law, the State's ownership could not be lost via adverse possession, laches, or any other equitable doctrine.

No. 86-939
Argued November 3, 1987
Decided February 23, 1988*
484 U.S. 495

Syllabus 
In 1982, petitioner ETSI Pipeline Project entered into a 40-year contract with petitioner Secretary of the Interior to withdraw up to a certain amount of water per year from Lake Oahe, a reservoir located on the Missouri River in South Dakota, for use in an interstate coal slurry pipeline.  Respondents Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin performance of the contract, alleging that, under the Flood Control Act of 1944 (Act), the Interior Secretary lacked authority to execute a contract to provide water from the reservoir for industrial uses without obtaining the approval of the Secretary of the Army.  Pursuant to the Act, the Oahe Reservoir was built by the Corps of Engineers, now part of the Department of the Army (successor of the Department of War), which has always maintained and operated the reservoir.  The Act was directed to both flood control and navigation matters that concerned the War Department and reclamation and irrigation problems that concerned the Interior Department, thus also implicating the tensions between the Upper Missouri River Basin States' interests in irrigation and reclamation and the interests of the Lower Basin States (including respondents) in flood control.  The District Court ruled for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Secretary of the Interior exceeded the authority Congress delegated to him by the Act.  Pp.  484 U. S. 505-517.
(a) In light of the Act's provisions specifying the powers of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior -- particularly the former's authority as to the use and disposal of water at any reservoir under the Army Department's control -- as well as the Act's general background, the Interior Secretary does not possess the authority to execute a contract to provide water from an Army reservoir for industrial use without obtaining the Army Secretary's approval.  Under the Act's language, if the Interior Secretary wishes to remove water from an Army reservoir for any purpose, the approval of the Army Secretary must be secured.  As long as ample water remains in the Oahe Reservoir for the purposes embodied in the Act, and absent any allocation for 
Page 484 U. S. 496
 irrigation pursuant to the Act's terms -- the record supporting the District Court's findings that there was no such allocation or use of the reservoir's water for irrigation -- the Army Secretary has exclusive authority to contract to remove water for industrial use.  Pp.  484 U. S. 505-509.
(b) There is no merit to petitioners' contention that the Act's provisions approving general comprehensive plans for projects to be operated by both the Interior and Army Departments represent congressional approval of any functional division of authority between those Departments and allows the Interior Secretary unilaterally to remove water from Army reservoirs for irrigation purposes and for other related uses.  Such contention is wide of the mark in view of the Act's specific jurisdictional provisions discussed above as to the use of Army reservoirs, and is grounded on a misuse of the legislative history.  There is no indication that control over individual reservoirs was to be divided among various Departments of the Federal Government.  Nor is petitioners' argument supported by a provision of the Act stating that reclamation and power developments to be undertaken by the Interior Secretary shall be governed by federal reclamation laws, which authorize him to reallocate water under his control for industrial use.  Such provision of the Act applies only to projects that the Interior Department itself may undertake under the Act.  But as the District Court found, the reservoir project engineered by the Army at Oahe is neither a power development nor a reclamation development undertaken by the Interior Secretary.  Moreover, there is no merit to petitioners' contention that, although the Interior Department must consult with the Army Department before withdrawing water for industrial use from the Oahe Reservoir, the Interior Department can proceed without the Army Department's approval as long as the latter does not object.  Pp.  484 U. S. 509-515.
(c) It is unnecessary to consider petitioners' contention that deference to the Interior Secretary's interpretation of the Act is appropriate here, and their related arguments about the history of relations between the Army and Interior Departments under the Act, for even if the Interior Department's interpretation would be entitled to any deference in these circumstances, the Executive Branch is not permitted to administer the Act in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.  The Act speaks directly to the dispute, and congressional intent as expressed in the Act indicates clearly that the Interior Secretary may not enter into a contract to withdraw water from an Army reservoir for industrial use without the approval of the Army Department.

No. 86-1552
Argued December 2, 1987
Decided February 23, 1988
484 U.S. 518

Syllabus 
Title 5 U.S.C. Ch. 75, provides a ""two-track"" system for undertaking ""adverse actions"" against certain Government employees.  An employee removed for ""cause,""  7511-7514, has a right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board),  7513(d), that includes a hearing.  The Board reviews such removals under a preponderance of the evidence standard.   7701.  An employee is also subject to summary removal based on national security concerns.  Such a removal is not appealable to the Board, but the employee has certain specified procedural rights, including a hearing by an agency authority.   7532.  Respondent was removed from his laborer's job at a submarine facility after the Navy denied him a required security clearance.  Without a security clearance, respondent was not eligible for any job at the facility.  Upon respondent's appeal of his removal under  7513(d), the Board's presiding official reversed the Navy's decision, holding that the Board had the authority to review the merits of the underlying security clearance determination and that the Navy had failed to show that it reached a reasonable and warranted decision on this question.  The full Board reversed and sustained the Navy's removal action, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that, since the Navy had chosen to remove respondent under  7512 rather than  7532, review under  7513 applied, including review of the merits of the underlying security clearance determination.
Held:  In an appeal pursuant to  7513, the Board does not have authority to review the substance of an underlying security clearance determination in the course of reviewing an adverse action.  Pp.  484 U. S. 526-534.
(a) The grant or denial of security clearance to a particular employee is a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call that is committed by law to the appropriate Executive Branch agency having the necessary expertise in protecting classified information.  It is not reasonably possible for an outside, nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment, and such review cannot be presumed merely because the statute does not expressly preclude it.  Pp.  484 U. S. 526-530.
(b) The statute's express language and structure confirm that it does not confer broad authority on the Board to review security clearance determinations.  A clearance denial is not one of the enumerated ""adverse actions"" that are subject to Board review, and nothing in the 
Page 484 U. S. 519
 Act directs or empowers the Board to go beyond determining whether ""cause"" for a denial existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible.  The application of  7701's preponderance of the evidence standard to security clearance determinations would inevitably alter the ""clearly consistent with the interests of the national security"" standard normally applied in making such determinations, and would involve the Board in second-guessing an agency's national security determinations, a result that it is extremely unlikely Congress intended.  Respondent's argument that the availability of the alternative  7532 summary removal procedure compels a conclusion of reviewability, since an anomalous situation would otherwise exist whereby the more ""drastic""  7532 remedy would actually entitle a removed employee to greater procedural protections -- particularly to a preremoval trial-type hearing -- than would  7513, is unpersuasive.  Section 7532 provides a procedure that is harsh and drastic both for the employee and for the agency head, who must act personally in suspending and removing the employee, and removal thereunder, even as envisioned by respondent, would not have amounted to ""more"" procedural protection than respondent received under  7513.  The procedures under the two sections are not anomalous, but merely different.  Pp.  484 U. S. 530-534.

			"|"Department of the Navy v. Egan
No. 86-1552
Argued December 2, 1987
Decided February 23, 1988
484 U.S. 518

Syllabus 
Title 5 U.S.C. Ch. 75, provides a ""two-track"" system for undertaking ""adverse actions"" against certain Government employees.  An employee removed for ""cause,""  7511-7514, has a right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board),  7513(d), that includes a hearing.  The Board reviews such removals under a preponderance of the evidence standard.   7701.  An employee is also subject to summary removal based on national security concerns.  Such a removal is not appealable to the Board, but the employee has certain specified procedural rights, including a hearing by an agency authority.   7532.  Respondent was removed from his laborer's job at a submarine facility after the Navy denied him a required security clearance.  Without a security clearance, respondent was not eligible for any job at the facility.  Upon respondent's appeal of his removal under  7513(d), the Board's presiding official reversed the Navy's decision, holding that the Board had the authority to review the merits of the underlying security clearance determination and that the Navy had failed to show that it reached a reasonable and warranted decision on this question.  The full Board reversed and sustained the Navy's removal action, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that, since the Navy had chosen to remove respondent under  7512 rather than  7532, review under  7513 applied, including review of the merits of the underlying security clearance determination.
Held:  In an appeal pursuant to  7513, the Board does not have authority to review the substance of an underlying security clearance determination in the course of reviewing an adverse action.  Pp.  484 U. S. 526-534.
(a) The grant or denial of security clearance to a particular employee is a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call that is committed by law to the appropriate Executive Branch agency having the necessary expertise in protecting classified information.  It is not reasonably possible for an outside, nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment, and such review cannot be presumed merely because the statute does not expressly preclude it.  Pp.  484 U. S. 526-530.
(b) The statute's express language and structure confirm that it does not confer broad authority on the Board to review security clearance determinations.  A clearance denial is not one of the enumerated ""adverse actions"" that are subject to Board review, and nothing in the 
Page 484 U. S. 519
 Act directs or empowers the Board to go beyond determining whether ""cause"" for a denial existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible.  The application of  7701's preponderance of the evidence standard to security clearance determinations would inevitably alter the ""clearly consistent with the interests of the national security"" standard normally applied in making such determinations, and would involve the Board in second-guessing an agency's national security determinations, a result that it is extremely unlikely Congress intended.  Respondent's argument that the availability of the alternative  7532 summary removal procedure compels a conclusion of reviewability, since an anomalous situation would otherwise exist whereby the more ""drastic""  7532 remedy would actually entitle a removed employee to greater procedural protections -- particularly to a preremoval trial-type hearing -- than would  7513, is unpersuasive.  Section 7532 provides a procedure that is harsh and drastic both for the employee and for the agency head, who must act personally in suspending and removing the employee, and removal thereunder, even as envisioned by respondent, would not have amounted to ""more"" procedural protection than respondent received under  7513.  The procedures under the two sections are not anomalous, but merely different.  Pp.  484 U. S. 530-534.

484 U.S. 539

Syllabus 
An employer may have a contractual duty under a collective bargaining agreement to make contributions to a pension fund during the agreement's term, and may also have a duty under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to continue making such contributions after the agreement's expiration while negotiations for a new contract are in process.  Section 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) obligates an employer to pay to a multiemployer plan contributions that are required ""under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement.""  Section 502(g)(2) of ERISA authorizes the multiemployer plan's trustees to enforce such liability by bringing an action in federal district court for the unpaid contributions, prejudgment interest thereon, liquidated damages, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, and other appropriate relief.  Respondent company was a party to two multiemployer collective bargaining agreements that required monthly contributions to eight employee benefit plans.  Respondent made the contributions until the agreements' expiration date, but made no contributions thereafter.  The plans' trustees (hereinafter petitioners) brought suit against respondent to collect the post-contract contributions, alleging that respondent's actions constituted a breach of its duty to bargain in good faith under  8(a)(5) of the NLRA, and that the Federal District Court had jurisdiction under  502(g)(2) and 515 of ERISA.  The court granted respondent summary judgment on the grounds that  515 does not apply to an employer's obligation under  8(a)(5) of the NLRA, and that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners' claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The remedy provided in  515 and 502(g)(2) of ERISA is limited to contractual, ""promised contributions,"" and does not confer jurisdiction on district courts to determine whether an employer's unilateral decision to refuse to make post-contract contributions violates the NLRA.  Pp.  484 U. S. 545-553. 
Page 484 U. S. 540

(a) The text and the legislative history of  515 and 502(g)(2) clearly require this result.  Both  515 and the legislative history plainly describe the employer's contractual obligation to make contributions, but omit any reference to the noncontractual obligation imposed by the NLRA.  Conversely, in defining the contribution obligation of an employer wishing to withdraw from a multiemployer plan,  4212(a) of ERISA unambiguously includes both the employer's contractual obligations and its NLRA obligations, thereby demonstrating that Congress was aware of the two different sources of an employer's duty to contribute to covered plans.  Pp.  484 U. S. 545-549.
(b) Petitioners' policy arguments for broadly construing  515 to include post-contract delinquencies are rejected in light of Congress' plain intent, as discussed above, and because countervailing policy arguments make it highly unlikely that the limited reach of the statute is the consequence of inadvertence, rather than deliberate choice.  Petitioners' first argument -- that denying district courts jurisdiction of post-contract delinquency collection actions leaves a ""gap"" in the enforcement scheme -- is unpersuasive, since there are indications that it may not be a problem of serious magnitude; since the issues that must be decided in a post-contract delinquency dispute are more complex than those that are presented in a simple collection action; and since the resolution of the type of question presented is usually left to the NLRB.  Petitioners' second argument -- that the remedies available in an NLRB proceeding are less effective than those in an ERISA action -- may be correct, but is ultimately unavailing, since the asserted defects in NLRB remedies are characteristic of all unfair labor practice proceedings.  The NLRA duty to make post-contract contributions is simply a consequence of a broader duty that was created to protect the collective bargaining process, and does not provide ERISA plan trustees with a unique and preferred procedure for obtaining redress.

Syllabus 
As a result of injuries suffered in an attack at a federal prison, correctional counselor John Foster's memory was severely impaired.  Nevertheless, in an interview with the investigating FBI agent, Foster described the attack, named respondent as his attacker, and identified respondent from photographs.  At respondent's Federal District Court trial for assault with intent to commit murder, Foster testified, inter alia, that he clearly remembered so identifying respondent.  On cross-examination, however, he admitted that he could not remember seeing his assailant, seeing any of his numerous hospital visitors except the FBI agent, or whether any visitor had suggested that respondent was the assailant.  Defense counsel unsuccessfully sought to refresh his recollection with hospital records, including one indicating that he had attributed the assault to someone other than respondent.  Respondent was convicted, but the Court of Appeals reversed, upholding challenges based on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and Rule 802 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which generally excludes hearsay.
Held:  Neither the Confrontation Clause nor Rule 802 is violated by admission of a prior, out-of court identification statement of a witness who is unable, because of memory loss, to explain the basis for the identification.  Pp.  484 U. S. 557-564.
(a) The Confrontation Clause, which guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not successful cross-examination, is satisfied where, as here, the defendant has a full and fair opportunity to bring out the witness' bad memory and other facts tending to discredit his testimony.  Cf. Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15.  This analysis is not altered by the fact that the testimony here involved an out-of-court identification that would traditionally be categorized as hearsay, since the Confrontation Clause's requirements are satisfied when a hearsay declarant is present at trial, takes an oath, is subject to unrestricted cross-examination, and the jury has an opportunity to observe his demeanor.  Pp.  484 U. S. 557-561.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Rule 801(d)(1)(C) -- under which a prior identification statement is not hearsay if the declarant is ""subject to cross-examination concerning the statement"" -- did not apply to Foster's identification statement because of his memory loss. 
Page 484 U. S. 555

A more natural reading of the Rule is that a witness is ""subject to cross-examination"" when, as here, he is placed on the stand, under oath, and responds willingly to questions.  Meaningful cross-examination within the Rule's intent is not destroyed by the witness' assertion of memory loss, which is often the very result sought to be produced by cross-examination, and which can be effective in destroying the force of the prior statement.  Moreover, the Rule does not, on its face, require more than that the cross-examination ""concer[n] the statement.""  The Advisory Committee's notes on the Rule, the Rule's legislative history, and the language of Rule 804(a)(3) -- which, in defining ""unavailability as a witness"" to include memory-loss situations, demonstrates Congress' awareness of the recurrent evidentiary problem of witness forgetfulness -- all support this reading of the Rule.  Respondent's contention that this reading is impermissible because it creates an internal inconsistency in the Rules -- i.e., the forgetful witness who is deemed ""subject to cross-examination"" under Rule 801(d)(1)(C) is simultaneously deemed ""unavailable"" under Rule 804(a)(3) -- is semantic, rather than substantive.  Because the characterizations in the two Rules were made for entirely different purposes, there is no requirement or expectation that they should coincide.  Pp.  484 U. S. 561-664.

Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2950, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would vacate the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court insofar as it left undisturbed the sentence of death imposed in this case. 
Page 484 U.S. 1079 , 1080
 II 
 Even if I did not hold this view, I would vacate petitioner's sentence because it was imposed under the same circumstances this Court recently condemned in Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987). In Booth, the Court invalidated a Maryland statute that required the sentencer in a capital case to consider information contained in a ""victim impact statement."" The statement was prepared by the Maryland State Division of Parole and Probation, and it described the emotional impact of the crime on the victim's family members as well as their opinions of the offense, the offender, and the appropriate punishment. This Court held that such information is irrelevant to a capital sentencing decision and that its admission creates a constitutionally impermissible risk that the jury will impose the death penalty in an arbitrary manner. We concluded that the introduction of such evidence is inconsistent with the reasoned decisionmaking required in capital cases. 
 In the instant case, petitioner Ronald Ray Post entered a plea of no contest to charges of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery arising out of the killing of a motel desk clerk during an armed robbery of the motel. A three-judge panel convicted petitioner on all counts and convened a sentencing hearing. At the sentencing hearing, the panel received a presentence report prepared by the county department of probation that contained a victim impact statement. In addition, the victim's son testified orally to the panel regarding the effect of the murder on the victim's family and urged the panel to return a sentence of death. The panel found one aggravating circumstance-that the murder was committed during the course of an armed robbery-and no mitigating circumstances; it therefore sentenced petitioner to death. 
 The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's sentence on appeal, rejecting petitioner's argument that his sentence must be vacated because it was imposed in violation of Booth v. Maryland, supra. 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 513 N.E.2d 754 (1987). The court recognized that the admission of the written victim impact statement and the oral testimony of the victim's son was error under both Ohio law and the federal constitutional analysis of Booth. But the court concluded that the error was not prejudicial [484 U.S. 1079 , 1081]

|484 u.s. 383|"Virginia v. American Booksellers Association, Inc.
No. 86-1034
Argued November 4, 1987
Decided January 25, 1988
484 U.S. 383

Syllabus 
A 1985 amendment to a Virginia statute makes it unlawful for any person ""to knowingly display for commercial purposes in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse"" certain visual or written sexual or sadomasochistic material that is harmful to juveniles.  What is ""harmful to juveniles"" is defined elsewhere in the statute.  Plaintiffs, a number of booksellers' organizations and two Virginia non-""adults only,"" general purpose bookstores (appellees here), filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the amendment is facially violative of the First Amendment in that it significantly and unnecessarily burdens the expressive rights of adults because of the economically devastating and extremely restrictive measures booksellers must adopt to comply; is overbroad in that it restricts access by mature juveniles to works that are ""harmful"" only to younger children; and is unconstitutionally vague because it is impossible to determine what standard should be used in deciding whether a work is appropriate for juveniles of different ages and levels of maturity.  At the trial, the owners of the bookstores introduced as exhibits 16 general subject books they believed to be covered by the amendment, and testified that the law might apply to as much as one-half of their inventory.  However, on cross-examination, they admitted their unfamiliarity with the portion of the law defining ""harmful to juveniles.""  Nevertheless, upon finding, inter alia, that the amendment would cover between 5 and 25 percent of a typical bookseller's inventory, the court held the amendment unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Although critical of the evidentiary basis for the determination, the court neither accepted nor rejected the District Court's finding as to the statute's scope.  However, the court did declare that booksellers would face ""significant"" difficulty in attempting to comply.  In so ruling, the court rejected the State's suggestion that a bookseller could avoid prosecution by merely tagging offensive materials or placing them behind ""blinder"" racks.  The court also questioned whether treating all juveniles identically was constitutional, but did not determine the issue. 
Page 484 U. S. 384

Held:
1. Plaintiffs had standing to bring suit.  The ""injury in fact"" standing requirement is met here, since the amendment is aimed directly at plaintiffs, who, if their interpretation is correct, will have to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution.  The usual rule that a party may assert only a violation of its own rights must give way to the exception allowing the assertion of the free expression rights of others, since plaintiffs have alleged an infringement of the First Amendment rights of bookbuyers.  The preenforcement nature of the suit is irrelevant, since plaintiffs have alleged an actual and well-founded fear that the statute will be enforced against them, and there is no reason to assume otherwise.  Indeed, the statute's alleged danger is, in large measure, one of self-censorship, a harm that can be realized even without an actual prosecution.  Pp.  484 U. S. 392-393.
2. In light of the case's unique factual and procedural setting, this Court will not attempt to decide the constitutional issues presented, but instead certifies two questions of statutory interpretation to the Virginia Supreme Court, answers to which will substantially aid this Court's review and may determine the case entirely.  Pp.  484 U. S. 393-398.
(a) Under the unusual circumstances of the case, where the amendment's constitutionality turns upon the way in which it is read, but where none of the conflicting interpretations are reliable, and where the State Attorney General apparently is willing to concede the case if the statute is not narrowly interpreted, it is essential that this Court have the benefit of the Virginia Supreme Court's authoritative answer to the certified question whether any of the books introduced by plaintiffs as exhibits below fall within the statute's scope, and what general standard should be used to determine the statute's reach in light of juveniles' differing ages and levels of maturity.  The Attorney General's interpretation that the statute covers only a very few ""borderline"" obscene works, and none of plaintiffs' exhibits, cannot be accepted as authoritative, since the Attorney General does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement authorities.  Moreover, the District Court's holding that the law applies to up to a quarter of a typical bookstore's inventory is not supported by reliable evidence, since the bookstore owners who testified were unfamiliar with the statutory definition of ""harmful to minors.""  Nor can the Court of Appeals' construction that the amendment would confront booksellers with a ""substantial"" compliance problem be relied upon, since, although it criticized the basis of the District Court's holding, the Court of Appeals gave no alternative basis for its own determination.  Pp.  484 U. S. 393-396.
(b) The question whether, as asserted by the State at oral argument, the amendment is satisfied if a bookseller, as a matter of policy, 
Page 484 U. S. 385
 prevents a juvenile observed reviewing covered works from continuing to do so, even if the restricted materials are not segregated from nonobjectionable works, and, if not, whether the statute would be complied with if the store's policy were announced or otherwise manifested to the public, is also certified, since an affirmative answer to the first alternative would mean, while a positive response to the second alternative might mean, that the burden to the bookseller, and therefore to the adult book-buying public, is significantly less than that feared and asserted by plaintiffs.  There is some advantage and no cost, either in terms of the First Amendment chilling effect or unnecessary delay, in certifying this question, which proffers a narrowing construction that is neither inevitable nor impossible, in light of the unusual circumstances of this case; i.e., that another question is already being certified, that enforcement of the statute will remain enjoined throughout the certification process, and that no state court has ever had the opportunity to interpret the pertinent statutory language.

No. 86-1034
Argued November 4, 1987
Decided January 25, 1988
484 U.S. 383

Syllabus 
A 1985 amendment to a Virginia statute makes it unlawful for any person ""to knowingly display for commercial purposes in a manner whereby juveniles may examine and peruse"" certain visual or written sexual or sadomasochistic material that is harmful to juveniles.  What is ""harmful to juveniles"" is defined elsewhere in the statute.  Plaintiffs, a number of booksellers' organizations and two Virginia non-""adults only,"" general purpose bookstores (appellees here), filed suit in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the amendment is facially violative of the First Amendment in that it significantly and unnecessarily burdens the expressive rights of adults because of the economically devastating and extremely restrictive measures booksellers must adopt to comply; is overbroad in that it restricts access by mature juveniles to works that are ""harmful"" only to younger children; and is unconstitutionally vague because it is impossible to determine what standard should be used in deciding whether a work is appropriate for juveniles of different ages and levels of maturity.  At the trial, the owners of the bookstores introduced as exhibits 16 general subject books they believed to be covered by the amendment, and testified that the law might apply to as much as one-half of their inventory.  However, on cross-examination, they admitted their unfamiliarity with the portion of the law defining ""harmful to juveniles.""  Nevertheless, upon finding, inter alia, that the amendment would cover between 5 and 25 percent of a typical bookseller's inventory, the court held the amendment unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Although critical of the evidentiary basis for the determination, the court neither accepted nor rejected the District Court's finding as to the statute's scope.  However, the court did declare that booksellers would face ""significant"" difficulty in attempting to comply.  In so ruling, the court rejected the State's suggestion that a bookseller could avoid prosecution by merely tagging offensive materials or placing them behind ""blinder"" racks.  The court also questioned whether treating all juveniles identically was constitutional, but did not determine the issue.

Syllabus 
Well in advance of petitioner's state court trial for attempted murder, the prosecutor filed a discovery motion requesting a list of defense witnesses.  Petitioner's answer failed to list one Wormley, as did his amended answer, submitted and accepted on the first day of trial, identifying two witnesses who were never called to testify.  On the second day of trial, after the prosecution's two principal witnesses had completed their testimony, petitioner's counsel made an oral motion to further amend the discovery answer to include Wormley.  Counsel explained that Wormley had probably seen the entire incident that led to the indictment, and that, although petitioner had told counsel about Wormley earlier, counsel had been unable to locate Wormley.  At a subsequent voir dire examination, Wormley testified that he had not been a witness to the incident itself, but had earlier seen the victim and his brother carrying guns and threatening petitioner, and that he just happened to run into petitioner and warned him to watch out.  On cross-examination, Wormley acknowledged that he had first met petitioner over two years after the incident in question, and that defense counsel had visited him at his home during the week before the trial began.  As a sanction for the failure to identify Wormley in the discovery answer, the trial judge refused to allow Wormley to testify before the jury.  The judge explained that petitioner's counsel had committed a blatant and willful violation of the discovery rules, and that the judge doubted the veracity of Wormley's testimony.  The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed petitioner's conviction.
Held:
1. The Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment may, in an appropriate case, be violated by the imposition of a discovery sanction that entirely excludes the testimony of a material defense witness.  The Clause is not merely a guarantee that the accused shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, but confers on the accused the fundamental right to present witnesses in his own defense.  Pp.  484 U. S. 407-409.
2. However, the Compulsory Process Clause does not create an absolute bar to preclusion of the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for violating a discovery rule.  Although a trial court may not ignore the fundamental character of the defendant's right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor, the mere invocation of that right cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests.  If discovery 
Page 484 U. S. 401
 violations are willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage or to conceal a plan to present fabricated testimony, it would be entirely appropriate to exclude the witnesses' testimony regardless of whether other, less drastic sanctions might be available, adequate, and merited.  Pp.  484 U. S. 410-416.
3. The exclusion of Wormley's testimony did not constitute constitutional error.  Pp.  484 U. S. 416-418.
(a) The fact that the voir dire examination of Wormley may have adequately protected the prosecution from prejudice resulting from surprise does not render the imposition of the preclusion sanction unnecessarily harsh.  The record raises strong inferences that petitioner's counsel was deliberately seeking a tactical advantage in failing to list Wormley as a witness, and that ""witnesses [were] being found that really weren't there.""  Thus, the case fits into the category of willful misconduct for which the severe sanction of preclusion is justified in order to protect the integrity of the judicial process.  Pp.  484 U. S. 416-417.
(b) It is not unfair to hold petitioner responsible for his lawyer's misconduct.  The lawyer necessarily has full authority to manage the conduct of the trial, and the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer's trial decisions.  Pp.  484 U. S. 417-418.

Syllabus 
In November, 1980, the Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) advised respondent, a nonpreference eligible employee in the excepted service, that it intended to dismiss him for a number of reasons, including unauthorized use of a Government vehicle.  After he was discharged without being informed of grievance rights granted to him by the FWS regulations, respondent sought review by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which dismissed his appeal on the ground that, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service has no right to appeal to the MSPB.  In 1982, the FWS reconsidered the matter, concluded that only a 30-day suspension for misuse of a Government vehicle was warranted, and offered respondent backpay from the date the suspension would have ended until the date the program for which he was hired closed.  On respondent's appeal, the Secretary of the Interior upheld the FWS decision, rejecting respondent's claims that his suspension was unwarranted and that he was entitled to additional backpay for the 30 days and a period beyond the close of the program.  Respondent then filed this action under the Back Pay Act in the Claims Court, which dismissed on the ground that the CSRA was exclusively applicable and did not provide for judicial review in this situation.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that respondent could seek Claims Court review traditionally available under the Tucker Act based on the Back Pay Act, that his suspension was wrongful, and that he was entitled to backpay for the period of the suspension.
Held:  The CSRA, which affords to nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service no administrative or judicial review of adverse personnel action of the type involved here, precludes judicial review for those employees under the Tucker Act based on the Back Pay Act.  The CSRA was designed to replace the haphazard arrangements that had built up over almost a century with one integrated system for administrative and judicial review of adverse personnel action.  The Act's comprehensive nature, its attention throughout to the rights of nonpreference excepted service employees, and the structure of the Act combine to establish that its failure to include these employees in the provisions for administrative and judicial review of the type of adverse personnel action involved 
Page 484 U. S. 440
 here represents a congressional judgment that judicial review is not available.  Interpreting the CSRA to foreclose review in this case is not contrary to the established principle of statutory construction that Congress will be presumed to have intended judicial review of agency action unless there is ""persuasive reason"" to believe otherwise.  Here, in view of the statutory scheme, there is ample basis for applying the exception contained in the principle.  Moreover, the principle of statutory construction disfavoring repeals by implication is not applicable here with regard to the CSRA's effect on the Back Pay Act.

No. 86-728
Argued November 9, 1987
Decided January 20, 1988
484 U.S. 305

Syllabus 
In order to assure that States receiving federal financial assistance will provide a ""free appropriate public education"" for all disabled children, including those with serious emotional disturbances, the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA or Act) establishes a comprehensive system of procedural safeguards designed to provide meaningful parental participation in all aspects of a child's educational placement, including an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing with respect to any complaints such parents have concerning their child's placement, and the right to seek administrative review of any decisions they think inappropriate.  If that review proves unsatisfactory, either the parents or the local educational agency may file a civil action in any state or federal court for ""appropriate"" relief.  20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(2).  The Act's ""stay-put"" provision directs that a disabled child ""shall remain in [his or her] then current educational placement"" pending completion of any review proceedings, unless the parents and state or local educational agencies otherwise agree.   1415(e)(3).  Respondents Doe and Smith, who were emotionally disturbed students, were suspended indefinitely for violent and disruptive conduct related to their disabilities, pending the completion of expulsion proceedings by the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD).  After unsuccessfully protesting the action against him, Doe filed a suit in Federal District Court, in which Smith intervened, alleging that the suspension and proposed expulsion violated the EHA, and seeking injunctive relief against SFUSD officials and petitioner, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.  The court entered summary judgment for respondents on their EHA claims and issued a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed with slight modifications.
Held:
1. The case is moot as to respondent Doe, who is now 24 years old, since the Act limits eligibility to disabled children between the ages of 3 and 21.  However, the case is justiciable with respect to respondent Smith, who continues to be eligible for EHA educational services, since he is currently only 20 and has not yet completed high school.  This Court has jurisdiction, since there is a reasonable likelihood that Smith 
Page 484 U. S. 306
 will again suffer the deprivation of EHA-mandated rights that gave rise to this suit.  Given the evidence that he is unable to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms, and the absence of any suggestion that he has overcome his behavioral problems, it is reasonable to expect that he will again engage in aggressive and disruptive classroom misconduct.  Moreover, it is unreasonable to suppose that any future educational placement will so perfectly suit his emotional and academic needs that further disruptions on his part are improbable.  If Smith does repeat the objectionable conduct, it is likely that he will again be subjected to the same type of unilateral school action in any California school district in which he is enrolled, in light of the lack of a state-wide policy governing local school responses to disability-related misconduct, and petitioner's insistence that all local school districts retain residual authority to exclude disabled children for dangerous conduct.  In light of the ponderousness of review procedures under the Act, and the fact that an aggrieved student will often be finished with school or otherwise ineligible for EHA protections by the time review can be had in this Court, the conduct Smith complained of is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Thus, his EHA claims are not moot.  Pp.  484 U. S. 317-323.
2. The ""stay-put"" provision prohibits state or local school authorities from unilaterally excluding disabled children from the classroom for dangerous or disruptive conduct growing out of their disabilities during the pendency of review proceedings.  Section 1415(e)(3) is unequivocal in its mandate that ""the child shall remain in the then current educational placement"" (emphasis added), and demonstrates a congressional intent to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students, from school.  This Court will not rewrite the statute to infer a ""dangerousness"" exception on the basis of obviousness or congressional inadvertence, since, in drafting the statute, Congress devoted close attention to Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866, and Pennsylvania Assn. for Retarded Children v. Pennsylvania, 334 F.Supp. 1257, and 343 F.Supp. 279, thereby establishing that the omission of an emergency exception for dangerous students was intentional.  However, Congress did not leave school administrators powerless to deal with such students, since implementing regulations allow the use of normal, nonplacement-changing procedures, including temporary suspensions for up to 10 schooldays for students posing an immediate threat to others' safety, while the Act allows for interim placements where parents and school officials are able to agree, and authorizes 
Page 484 U. S. 307
 officials to file a  1415(e)(2) suit for ""appropriate"" injunctive relief where such an agreement cannot be reached.  In such a suit,  1415(e)(3) effectively creates a presumption in favor of the child's current educational placement which school officials can rebut only by showing that maintaining the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or to others.  Here, the District Court properly balanced respondents' interests under the Act against the state and local school officials' safety interest, and both lower courts properly construed and applied  1415(e)(3), except insofar as the Court of Appeals held that a suspension exceeding 10 schooldays does not constitute a prohibited change in placement.  The Court of Appeals' judgment is modified to that extent.  Pp.  484 U. S. 323-328.

No. 86-728
Argued November 9, 1987
Decided January 20, 1988
484 U.S. 305

Syllabus 
In order to assure that States receiving federal financial assistance will provide a ""free appropriate public education"" for all disabled children, including those with serious emotional disturbances, the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA or Act) establishes a comprehensive system of procedural safeguards designed to provide meaningful parental participation in all aspects of a child's educational placement, including an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing with respect to any complaints such parents have concerning their child's placement, and the right to seek administrative review of any decisions they think inappropriate.  If that review proves unsatisfactory, either the parents or the local educational agency may file a civil action in any state or federal court for ""appropriate"" relief.  20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(2).  The Act's ""stay-put"" provision directs that a disabled child ""shall remain in [his or her] then current educational placement"" pending completion of any review proceedings, unless the parents and state or local educational agencies otherwise agree.   1415(e)(3).  Respondents Doe and Smith, who were emotionally disturbed students, were suspended indefinitely for violent and disruptive conduct related to their disabilities, pending the completion of expulsion proceedings by the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD).  After unsuccessfully protesting the action against him, Doe filed a suit in Federal District Court, in which Smith intervened, alleging that the suspension and proposed expulsion violated the EHA, and seeking injunctive relief against SFUSD officials and petitioner, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.  The court entered summary judgment for respondents on their EHA claims and issued a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed with slight modifications.
Held:
1. The case is moot as to respondent Doe, who is now 24 years old, since the Act limits eligibility to disabled children between the ages of 3 and 21.  However, the case is justiciable with respect to respondent Smith, who continues to be eligible for EHA educational services, since he is currently only 20 and has not yet completed high school.  This Court has jurisdiction, since there is a reasonable likelihood that Smith 
Page 484 U. S. 306
 will again suffer the deprivation of EHA-mandated rights that gave rise to this suit.  Given the evidence that he is unable to conform his conduct to socially acceptable norms, and the absence of any suggestion that he has overcome his behavioral problems, it is reasonable to expect that he will again engage in aggressive and disruptive classroom misconduct.  Moreover, it is unreasonable to suppose that any future educational placement will so perfectly suit his emotional and academic needs that further disruptions on his part are improbable.  If Smith does repeat the objectionable conduct, it is likely that he will again be subjected to the same type of unilateral school action in any California school district in which he is enrolled, in light of the lack of a state-wide policy governing local school responses to disability-related misconduct, and petitioner's insistence that all local school districts retain residual authority to exclude disabled children for dangerous conduct.  In light of the ponderousness of review procedures under the Act, and the fact that an aggrieved student will often be finished with school or otherwise ineligible for EHA protections by the time review can be had in this Court, the conduct Smith complained of is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Thus, his EHA claims are not moot.  Pp.  484 U. S. 317-323.
2. The ""stay-put"" provision prohibits state or local school authorities from unilaterally excluding disabled children from the classroom for dangerous or disruptive conduct growing out of their disabilities during the pendency of review proceedings.  Section 1415(e)(3) is unequivocal in its mandate that ""the child shall remain in the then current educational placement"" (emphasis added), and demonstrates a congressional intent to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students, from school.  This Court will not rewrite the statute to infer a ""dangerousness"" exception on the basis of obviousness or congressional inadvertence, since, in drafting the statute, Congress devoted close attention to Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866, and Pennsylvania Assn. for Retarded Children v. Pennsylvania, 334 F.Supp. 1257, and 343 F.Supp. 279, thereby establishing that the omission of an emergency exception for dangerous students was intentional.  However, Congress did not leave school administrators powerless to deal with such students, since implementing regulations allow the use of normal, nonplacement-changing procedures, including temporary suspensions for up to 10 schooldays for students posing an immediate threat to others' safety, while the Act allows for interim placements where parents and school officials are able to agree, and authorizes 
Page 484 U. S. 307
 officials to file a  1415(e)(2) suit for ""appropriate"" injunctive relief where such an agreement cannot be reached.  In such a suit,  1415(e)(3) effectively creates a presumption in favor of the child's current educational placement which school officials can rebut only by showing that maintaining the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the student or to others.  Here, the District Court properly balanced respondents' interests under the Act against the state and local school officials' safety interest, and both lower courts properly construed and applied  1415(e)(3), except insofar as the Court of Appeals held that a suspension exceeding 10 schooldays does not constitute a prohibited change in placement.  The Court of Appeals' judgment is modified to that extent.  Pp.  484 U. S. 323-328.
3. Insofar as the Court of Appeals' judgment affirmed the District Court's order directing the State to provide services directly to a disabled child where the local agency has failed to do so, that judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  Pp.  484 U. S. 328-329.

Syllabus 
A husband and wife (hereinafter respondents) filed a complaint in a Pennsylvania state court against petitioners, the husband's former employer and his former supervisor, alleging a single federal law age discrimination claim and a number of state law claims, all arising from the husband's discharge by petitioners.  After petitioners removed the case to Federal District Court under 28 U.S.C.  1441(a), the court granted respondents' motion to amend their complaint to delete the age discrimination allegations and their motion to remand the suit to state court on the ground that such amendment eliminated their sole federal law claim, which had provided the basis for removal in the first place.  The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' application for a writ of mandamus.
Held:  A federal district court has discretion under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction to remand to state court a removed case upon a proper determination that retaining jurisdiction over the case would be inappropriate.  Where, as here, all federal law claims in the action have been eliminated and only pendent state law claims remain, the district court has a powerful reason to choose not to continue to exercise jurisdiction.  A wide discretion to remand rather than to dismiss will enable district courts to deal with appropriate cases involving pendent claims in the manner that best serves the principles of judicial economy, procedural convenience, fairness to litigants, and comity to the States which underlie the pendent jurisdiction doctrine.  For example, a remand generally will be preferable to dismissal when the statute of limitations on the plaintiff's state law claims has expired before the federal court has determined that it should relinquish jurisdiction.  Even when the applicable statute of limitations has not expired, a remand may best promote the aforesaid principles, in light of the increased expense and time involved in enforcing state law that dismissal would entail.  The fact that the federal removal statute, 28 U.S.C.  1441-1451, explicitly authorizes remand in only two situations inapplicable to this case does not mean that Congress intended to preclude remands of removed cases involving pendent claims.  Given that the statute's silence does not negate the courts' undoubted power to dismiss such cases, that silence cannot be 
Page 484 U. S. 344
 read to negate the power to remand them.  Indeed,  1441(c), which gives district courts discretionary power either to adjudicate or to remand otherwise nonremovable ""separate and independent"" claims that have been joined with a removable claim, strongly suggests that, had Congress decided to address the proper disposition of removed cases involving pendent claims, it would have authorized their remand.  The statement in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, that a case may not be remanded on a ground not specified in the removal statute applies only to situations in which the district court has no authority to decline to hear the removed case, and not to cases like the present, in which the district court has undoubted discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction.  The fact that, under the rule announced in this case, a plaintiff might attempt to manipulate the forum by deleting federal law claims and requesting remand is a concern which should be considered by the district court in deciding whether to remand, but hardly justifies a categorical prohibition on the remand of all cases involving pendent state law claims.

Syllabus 
When a bankruptcy petition is filed,  362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides an automatic stay of actions taken to realize the value of collateral given by the debtor.  Section 362(d) authorizes the bankruptcy court to grant relief from the stay ""(1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of . . . [a] party in interest,"" or ""(2) with respect to a stay of an act against property,"" if the debtor does not have an equity in such property (i.e., the creditor is undersecured) and the property is ""not necessary to an effective reorganization.""  Section 361 provides that adequate protection of an entity's interest in property may be provided by granting such relief ""as will result in the realization by such entity of the indubitable equivalent of its interest.""  After respondent filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Code, petitioner, an undersecured creditor, moved the Bankruptcy Court for relief from the  362(a) stay on the ground that there was a lack of ""adequate protection"" of its interest within the meaning of  362(d)(1).  The court granted relief, conditioning continuance of the stay on monthly payments by respondent on the estimated amount realizable on the foreclosure that the stay prevented.  The District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Undersecured creditors are not entitled to compensation under  362(d)(1) for the delay caused by the automatic stay in foreclosing on their collateral.  Pp.  484 U. S. 370-380.
(a) The language of other Code provisions that deal with the rights of secured creditors, and the substantive dispositions that those provisions effect, establish that the ""interest in property"" protected by  362(d)(1) does not include a secured party's right to immediate foreclosure.  First, petitioner's contrary interpretation contradicts the carefully drawn substantive disposition effected by  506(b), which codifies the pre-Code rule denying undersecured creditors post-petition interest on their claims.  Had Congress nevertheless meant to give undersecured creditors interest on the value of their collateral, it would have said so plainly in  506(b).  Moreover, the meaning of  362(d)(1)'s ""interest in property"" phrase is clarified by the use of similar terminology in  506(a), where it must be interpreted to mean only the creditor's security interest 
Page 484 U. S. 366
 in the property without regard to his right to immediate possession on default.  Second,  552(b), which makes possession of a perfected security interest in post-petition rents or profits from collateral a condition of having them applied to satisfy the secured creditor's claim ahead of the claims of unsecured creditors, is inconsistent with petitioner's interpretation of  362(d)(1), under which the undersecured creditor who lacks such a perfected security interest in effect could achieve the same result by demanding the ""use value"" of his collateral.  Third, petitioner's interpretation of  362(d)(1) makes a practical nullity of  362(d)(2), which, on petitioner's theory, would be of use only to a secured creditor who was fully protected both as to the value of, and interest on, its collateral, but nonetheless wanted to foreclose.  Petitioner's contention that undersecured creditors will face inordinate and extortionate delay if they are denied compensation under  362(d)(1) is also belied by  362(d)(2), which requires relief from the stay unless the debtor establishes a reasonable possibility of a successful reorganization within a reasonable time, and under which numerous cases have provided relief within less than a year from the filing of the bankruptcy petition.  Pp.  484 U. S. 370-376.
(b) Denying petitioner compensation under  362(d)(1) is not inconsistent with  361(3)'s use of the phrase ""indubitable equivalent.""  Although the same phrase appears in  1129(b), under which section, as a condition for confirmation of a reorganization plan, a secured claimant has a right to receive the present value of his collateral (including interest if the claim is to be paid over time), the source of the right in  1129 is not the ""indubitable equivalent"" language, but the provision guaranteeing payments of a value, ""as of the effective date of the plan,"" equal to the value of the collateral.  Similarly, petitioner's contention that, since general administrative expenses do not have priority over secured claims, see  506(c), 507(a), the Code embodies a principle prohibiting secured creditors from bearing any of the costs of reorganization, is without merit.  Congress could not have intended that its readoption of the pre-Code administrative expenses rule would work a change in the also readopted pre-Code rule denying undersecured creditors post-petition interest.  Finally, although failure to interpret  362(d)(1) to require compensation for undersecured creditors appears inconsistent with  726(a)(5), which allows post-petition interest on unsecured claims when the debtor proves solvent, this anomaly pertains to such a rare occurrence that it is likely the product of congressional inadvertence, and, in any case, its inequitable effects are entirely avoidable.  Pp.  484 U. S. 377-379.
(c) General statements in the legislative history of  361 and 362(d)(1) that ""[s]ecured creditors should not be deprived of the benefit of their bargain"" are inadequate to overcome the plain textual indication in 
Page 484 U. S. 367
  506 and 362(d)(2) of Congress' intent, as discussed above.  It is most improbable that Congress would have made a major change entitling undersecured creditors to post-petition interest without specifically mentioning it in the legislative history.  Petitioner's argument that pre-Code Chapter XI gave undersecured creditors the absolute right to foreclose, and that the silence of the Code's legislative history as to the withdrawal of that right indicates a congressional intent to provide interest on the collateral during the stay as a substitute, is flawed.  The authorities are far from clear that there was a distinctive Chapter XI rule of absolute entitlement to foreclose, but, even assuming there was,  362(d)(2) indicates that, in enacting Chapter 11 of the current Code, Congress adopted the approach of pre-Code Chapters X and XII, under which the undersecured creditor did not have such an absolute right.  Pp.  484 U. S. 379-382.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 19, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oregon. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the difficult question whether a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 when the underlying action has become moot because of compliance by the defendant with a court order. Here petitioners challenged respondents' plans to incorporate formal public prayer in the commencement exercises of a public high school. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to persuade respondents to drop the public prayer, petitioners brought suit in state court, challenging 
Page 484 U.S. 1032 , 1033
 respondents' plans as violative of the State and Federal Constitutions and seeking attorney's fees under state law and 1988. The trial court made an oral ruling that the planned public prayer violated state and federal law, and consequently respondents dropped the public prayer from the commencement exercises. About a month after the commencement exercises, the trial court issued a written order reaffirming the earlier oral decision and awarding attorney's fees. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the holding that the planned public prayer violated the State Constitution and affirmed the award of attorney's fees under 1988. 79 Or.App. 384, 719 P.2d 875 (1986). 
 The Oregon Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the trial court to vacate the judgment. 303 Or. 574, 738 P.2d 1389 (1987). The court reasoned that there was no longer a justiciable controversy because petitioners had already graduated, public prayer was not included in their commencement exercises, and petitioners did not seek to enjoin future repetitions of this challenged conduct. The court held that under Oregon law, the oral order was not an effective preliminary injunction or final order until it was reduced to writing and by the time it was rendered in writing the controversy was no longer justiciable. 
 The Oregon Supreme Court's decision that a 1988 fees award is not available in this case creates a conflict in the courts over the award of fees when the underlying action is rendered unreviewable after it has been filed. The courts are in agreement that a 1988 fees award is proper where the defendant ""voluntarily"" complies under threat of the lawsuit, for such compliance, although mooting the lawsuit, shows acquiescence in the plaintiff's position. E.g., Martin v. Heckler, 773 F.2d 1145, 1148- 1149 (CA11 1985) (en banc); DeMier v. Gondles, 676 F.2d 92 (CA4 1982); see Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761, 2676 (1987) (""[I]f the defendant, under pressure of the lawsuit, alters his conduct (or threatened conduct) towards the plaintiff that was the basis for the suit, the plaintiff will have prevailed""). The more difficult question presented by this case is whether a defendant's ""involuntary"" compliance with a seemingly valid court order supports an award of fees under 1988, where such compliance, under fear of contempt, moots a lawsuit such as this one but does not demonstrate acquiescence in plaintiff's position. The decision here denying an award of fees under 1988 conflicts with decisions from [484 U.S. 1032 , 1034]

 Steven KAY et al.v. DAVID DOUGLAS SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 40 et al.No. 87-734 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 19, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oregon. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the difficult question whether a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 when the underlying action has become moot because of compliance by the defendant with a court order. Here petitioners challenged respondents' plans to incorporate formal public prayer in the commencement exercises of a public high school. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to persuade respondents to drop the public prayer, petitioners brought suit in state court, challenging 
Page 484 U.S. 1032 , 1033
 respondents' plans as violative of the State and Federal Constitutions and seeking attorney's fees under state law and 1988. The trial court made an oral ruling that the planned public prayer violated state and federal law, and consequently respondents dropped the public prayer from the commencement exercises. About a month after the commencement exercises, the trial court issued a written order reaffirming the earlier oral decision and awarding attorney's fees. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the holding that the planned public prayer violated the State Constitution and affirmed the award of attorney's fees under 1988. 79 Or.App. 384, 719 P.2d 875 (1986). 
 The Oregon Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the trial court to vacate the judgment. 303 Or. 574, 738 P.2d 1389 (1987). The court reasoned that there was no longer a justiciable controversy because petitioners had already graduated, public prayer was not included in their commencement exercises, and petitioners did not seek to enjoin future repetitions of this challenged conduct. The court held that under Oregon law, the oral order was not an effective preliminary injunction or final order until it was reduced to writing and by the time it was rendered in writing the controversy was no longer justiciable. 
 The Oregon Supreme Court's decision that a 1988 fees award is not available in this case creates a conflict in the courts over the award of fees when the underlying action is rendered unreviewable after it has been filed. The courts are in agreement that a 1988 fees award is proper where the defendant ""voluntarily"" complies under threat of the lawsuit, for such compliance, although mooting the lawsuit, shows acquiescence in the plaintiff's position. E.g., Martin v. Heckler, 773 F.2d 1145, 1148- 1149 (CA11 1985) (en banc); DeMier v. Gondles, 676 F.2d 92 (CA4 1982); see Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761, 2676 (1987) (""[I]f the defendant, under pressure of the lawsuit, alters his conduct (or threatened conduct) towards the plaintiff that was the basis for the suit, the plaintiff will have prevailed"").

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 19, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The issue here is whether it is consistent with the Federal Magistrates Act for a district court to delegate jury selection to a magistrate. In this case, petitioner was convicted by a federal jury on the felony charge of stealing Government property. A United States Magistrate presided over the selection of the jury which, despite the relatively routine nature of the charges, took about four hours and was not free of difficulty. Neither the Government nor defense counsel expressly consented or objected to the Magistrate's presiding over the voir dire proceedings. On appeal, petitioner argued that the District Court violated the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. 631-639 (1982 ed. and Supp. III), by allowing the Magistrate to preside over jury selection. A 
Page 484 U.S. 1034 , 1035
 panel of the Fifth Circuit rejected this argument. 797 F.2d 1329 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070 (1987). 
 The case was accepted for rehearing en banc, and in a split decision the full court affirmed, though on other grounds. It ruled that the Act does not grant a district court the power to delegate jury selection to a magistrate as an ""additional dut[y]"" under 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(3), and that the opposite construction of this section would pose ""grave constitutional issues."" 824 F.2d 1430, 1435 (1987). Nonetheless, it affirmed the conviction because petitioner had failed to object to this procedure at trial and the violation did not amount to plain error because it did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. Judge Jolly concurred in the result, concluding that under the Act and the Constitution a magistrate may conduct voir dire at a jury trial unless the defendant objects. Id., at 1439. Judge Rubin dissented, joined by three other judges, concluding that it does not violate either the Act or the Constitution for a magistrate to conduct the voir dire proceedings in a criminal trial. Id., at 1440-1448. 
 If the decision below is incorrect, and this use of the magistrate violates either the Act or the Constitution, then it is not obvious that this violation can be dismissed under the ""plain error"" doctrine. And the position of the Fifth Circuit on this issue conflicts with two decisions of the Ninth Circuit. United States v. Peacock, 761 F.2d 1313, 1317-1319, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847 (1985); United States v. Bezold, 760 F.2d 999, 1001-1003 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063 (1986). See also United States v. Rivera-Sola, 713 F.2d 866, 872-873 (CA1 1983) (dictum). The split among the Circuits on this issue warrants our granting certiorari.

 January 19, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 The issue presented by this petition for certiorari is what is the correct test for determining if prosecutorial preindictment delay amounts to a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783 ( 1977). In this case, the petitioner argued that he was prejudiced by the prosecutorial delay in filing the indictment against him, for it was filed 13 days after he turned 21 years of age, and consequently he was ineligible for the protections of the Federal Juvenile Delin- 
Page 484 U.S. 1035 , 1036

The Second Circuit held that there was no due process violation because petitioner ""made no showing of an improper prosecutorial motive."" 825 F.2d 667, 671 (1987). Other Circuits have similarly required a showing of prosecutorial misconduct designed to obtain a tactical advantage over the defendant or to advance some other impermissible purpose in order to establish a due process violation. United States v. Ismaili, 828 F.2d 153, 166 (CA3 1987); United States v. Lebron-Gonzalez, 816 F.2d 823, 831 (CA1), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 843, and 857, and 166, and 120 (1987); United States v.

Two Circuits, however, have concluded that intentional misconduct is not the sine qua non for a due process violation from prosecutorial preindictment delay, and instead they hold that the proper inquiry is to balance the prejudice to the defendant against the Government's justification for delay.

No. 86-6867
Argued October 14, 1987
Decided January 13, 1988
484 U.S. 231

Syllabus 
At petitioner's state court trial on charges of killing five people, the jury returned guilty verdicts on three counts of first-degree murder, an essential statutory element of which, under the circumstances, was a finding of intent ""to kill or inflict great bodily harm upon more than one person.""  At the penalty phase, in response to notes from the jury indicating difficulty in reaching a decision, the court twice polled the jury as to whether further deliberations would be helpful in reaching a verdict, a majority of the jurors answering affirmatively in each instance.  After the second poll, the judge reiterated earlier instructions, declaring that he would impose a sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspended sentence if the jurors were unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, and admonishing them to consult and consider each other's views with the objective of reaching a verdict, but not to surrender their own honest beliefs in doing so.  Defense counsel did not object to either poll, to the manner in which they were conducted, or to the supplemental instruction.  The jury then returned a verdict in 30 minutes, sentencing petitioner to death on all three first-degree murder counts upon finding the statutory aggravating circumstance of ""knowingly creat[ing] a risk of death or great bodily harm to more than one person.""  After the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld petitioner's convictions and sentences, the Federal District Court denied him habeas corpus relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. When considered in context and under all the circumstances, the two jury polls and the supplemental charge did not impermissibly coerce the jury to return a death sentence.  The supplemental charge is similar to the traditional Allen charge long approved by this Court on the ground that it is an attempt to secure jury unanimity, which reasoning applies with even greater force here, since this charge does not speak specifically to the minority jurors.  Although not without constitutional weight, the fact that one of the purposes served by such a charge -- the avoidance of the societal costs of a retrial -- is not present here, because Louisiana law requires the court to impose a life sentence if the jury is hung, does not render the charge impermissible under the Due Process 
Page 484 U. S. 232
 Clause and the Eighth Amendment in light of the State's strong interest in having capital sentencing juries express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death.  Jenkins v. United States, 380 U. S. 445, and United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, cannot aid petitioner, since the supplemental instruction given in this case did not require the jury to reach a decision.  Similarly, Brasfield v. United States, 272 U. S. 448, cannot help petitioner, since the questions asked the jury here did not require it to reveal the nature or extent of its division on the merits.  Although coercion is suggested by the fact that the jury returned its verdict soon after receiving the supplemental instruction, defense counsel's failure to object to either the polls or the instruction at the time indicates that the potential for coercion argued now was not then apparent.  Pp.  484 U. S. 237-241.
2. The death sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment simply because the single statutory ""aggravating circumstance"" found by the jury duplicates an element of the underlying offense of first-degree murder.  To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing scheme must
""genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty, and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.""
Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862,  462 U. S. 877; cf. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153.  This narrowing function may constitutionally be provided in either of two ways:  the legislature may broadly define capital offenses and provide for narrowing by jury findings of aggravating circumstances at the penalty phase, as most States have done, or the legislature may itself narrow the definition of capital offenses so that the jury finding at the guilt phase responds to this concern, as Louisiana has done here.  See Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262.  Thus, the duplicative nature of the statutory aggravating circumstance did not render petitioner's sentence infirm, since the constitutionally mandated narrowing function was performed at the guilt phase, and the Constitution did not require an additional aggravating circumstance finding at the penalty phase.

No. 86-836
Argued October 13, 1987
Decided January 13, 1988
484 U.S. 260

Syllabus 
Respondents, former high school students who were staff members of the school's newspaper, filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the school district and school officials, alleging that respondents' First Amendment rights were violated by the deletion from a certain issue of the paper of two pages that included an article describing school students' experiences with pregnancy and another article discussing the impact of divorce on students at the school.  The newspaper was written and edited by a journalism class, as part of the school's curriculum.  Pursuant to the school's practice, the teacher in charge of the paper submitted page proofs to the school's principal, who objected to the pregnancy story because the pregnant students, although not named, might be identified from the text, and because he believed that the article's references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for some of the younger students.  The principal objected to the divorce article because the page proofs he was furnished identified by name (deleted by the teacher from the final version) a student who complained of her father's conduct, and the principal believed that the student's parents should have been given an opportunity to respond to the remarks or to consent to their publication.  Believing that there was no time to make necessary changes in the articles if the paper was to be issued before the end of the school year, the principal directed that the pages on which they appeared be withheld from publication even though other, unobjectionable articles were included on such pages.  The District Court held that no First Amendment violation had occurred.  The Court of Appeals reversed.

			"|"Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier
No. 86-836
Argued October 13, 1987
Decided January 13, 1988
484 U.S. 260

Syllabus 
Respondents, former high school students who were staff members of the school's newspaper, filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioners, the school district and school officials, alleging that respondents' First Amendment rights were violated by the deletion from a certain issue of the paper of two pages that included an article describing school students' experiences with pregnancy and another article discussing the impact of divorce on students at the school.  The newspaper was written and edited by a journalism class, as part of the school's curriculum.  Pursuant to the school's practice, the teacher in charge of the paper submitted page proofs to the school's principal, who objected to the pregnancy story because the pregnant students, although not named, might be identified from the text, and because he believed that the article's references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for some of the younger students.  The principal objected to the divorce article because the page proofs he was furnished identified by name (deleted by the teacher from the final version) a student who complained of her father's conduct, and the principal believed that the student's parents should have been given an opportunity to respond to the remarks or to consent to their publication.  Believing that there was no time to make necessary changes in the articles if the paper was to be issued before the end of the school year, the principal directed that the pages on which they appeared be withheld from publication even though other, unobjectionable articles were included on such pages.  The District Court held that no First Amendment violation had occurred.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Respondents' First Amendment rights were not violated.
(a) First Amendment rights of students in the public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.

484 U.S. 292

Syllabus 
Respondents, husband and wife, brought a state law tort suit in state court alleging that, while working as a federal civilian employee at an Army Depot, the husband received chemical burns when he was exposed to toxic soda ash that was improperly stored at the depot as a result of the negligence of petitioner supervisors.  The Federal District Court to which petitioners removed the action held that petitioners were absolutely immune from suit, since the alleged tort was committed while they were acting within the scope of their employment, and granted summary judgment in their favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a federal employee enjoys immunity only if the challenged conduct, in addition to being within the scope of the employee's duties, is also a discretionary act.
Held:  Conduct by federal officials must be discretionary in nature, as well as being within the scope of their employment, before the conduct is absolutely immune from state law tort liability.  See Doe v. McMillan, 412 U. S. 306.  Granting absolute immunity for nondiscretionary functions would not further the official immunity doctrine's central purpose of promoting effective government by insulating the decisionmaking process from the harassment of prospective litigation which could make federal officials unduly timid in carrying out their duties.  The threat of tort liability cannot detrimentally inhibit conduct that is not the product of independent judgment, and it is only when officials exercise decisionmaking discretion that potential liability may shackle the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of governmental policies.  Petitioners' alternative argument that the discretionary function requirement is satisfied if the precise conduct of the federal official is not prescribed by law and the official exercises ""minimal discretion"" is rejected.  This approach loses sight of the underlying purpose of the official immunity doctrine by ignoring the balance of potential benefits and costs under the circumstances, and, if adopted, would render the discretionary function requirement essentially meaningless.  Virtually all official acts involve some modicum of choice, and yet such acts will often be largely unaffected by the prospect of tort liability, thereby making the provision of absolute immunity unnecessary and unwise.  Here, since no evidence was presented controverting respondents' assertion that petitioners were not involved

484 U.S. 301

Syllabus 
The New York City Police Department and groups representing various of its minority officers reached a settlement of the groups' employment discrimination suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which settlement was first approved by the District Court on an interim basis and, finally, after a hearing, by consent decree.  Although petitioners -- a group of white officers claiming to be adversely affected by the settlement -- presented their objections at the hearing, they chose not to move to intervene either initially as codefendants or later for purposes of appeal, but instead filed suit during the period between the interim approval of the settlement and the final consent decree, claiming a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights.  In the Marino case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of petitioners' suit, deeming it an impermissible collateral attack on a consent decree by persons who could have intervened in the underlying litigation.  In the Costello case, the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' attempt to appeal from the consent decree because they were not parties to the litigation giving rise to the decree.
Held:
1. Insofar as the Court of Appeals' Marino judgment affirmed the District Court's dismissal of petitioners' suit as an impermissible collateral attack by nonparties, that judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.
2. As to the issue raised in Costello, the well-settled general rule that only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment prohibits petitioners from appealing from the consent decree approving the settlement of the underlying Title VII action.  Despite the Court of Appeals' suggestion that an exception to the general rule may exist when a nonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial court's judgment, the better practice is for the nonparty to seek intervention for purposes of appeal.

No. 86-964
Argued October 6, 1987
Decided January 12, 1988
484 U.S. 174

Syllabus 
Under the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980 (PKPA or Act), States are required to afford full faith and credit to valid child custody determinations entered by a sister State's courts.  When a California state court's award of joint custody to respondent and petitioner over their son became infeasible because of respondent's decision to move to Louisiana, the court granted respondent sole custody pending an investigator's report, whereupon the court intended to make a more studied custody determination.  After respondent obtained a Louisiana court order enforcing the California decree and awarding her sole custody, the California court, having received and reviewed the investigator's report, entered an order granting sole custody to petitioner.  Without first attempting to enforce the California decree in Louisiana, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court seeking an order declaring the Louisiana decree invalid and the California decree valid, and enjoining the enforcement of the Louisiana decree.  The court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that petitioner had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
Held:  The PKPA does not provide an implied cause of action in federal court to determine which of two conflicting state custody decisions is valid.  The context in which the PKPA was enacted -- the existence of jurisdictional deadlocks among the States in custody cases and a nationwide problem of interstate parental kidnaping -- suggests that Congress' principal aim was to extend the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to custody determinations, and not to create an entirely new cause of action.  The language and placement of the Act reinforce this conclusion, in that the Act is an addendum to, and is therefore clearly intended to have the same operative effect as, the federal full faith and credit statute, the Act's heading is ""Full faith and credit given to child custody determinations,"" and, unlike statutes that explicitly confer a right on a specified class of persons, the Act is addressed to States and to state courts.  Moreover, in discussing the congressional rejection of a competing legislative proposal that would have extended the district courts' diversity jurisdiction to custody decree enforcement actions, the PKPA's legislative history provides an unusually clear indication that Congress did not intend the federal courts to play the enforcement role.  
Page 484 U. S. 175
 The fact that the cause of action petitioner seeks to infer is narrower than the congressionally rejected alternative is not controlling, since the federal courts would still be entangled in traditional state law questions that they have little expertise to resolve.  The argument that failure to infer a cause of action would render the PKPA nugatory is also not persuasive, since it is based on the unacceptable presumption that the States are either unable or unwilling to enforce the Act's provisions, and since ultimate review remains available in this Court for truly intractable deadlocks.

Syllabus 
Upon application for a warrant to search one of the corporate respondents' premises for evidence of theft and other crimes that were the subject of an ongoing state grand jury investigation, a state court judge issued a warrant authorizing petitioner law enforcement officers to seize documents.  Alleging that petitioners' execution of the warrant violated various of their federal constitutional rights and engendered certain pendent state law claims, respondent business entities and their owners filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in Federal District Court seeking equitable relief, including the return of all documents seized, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees.  The court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss on abstention grounds, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, ruling that Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and its progeny did not require the District Court to abstain from adjudicating respondents' equitable claims.  As to respondents' claims for money damages and attorney's fees, the Court of Appeals applied its Circuit's rule that, even when abstaining entirely from the adjudication of equitable claims, a District Court is required to stay, rather than to dismiss, federal claims that are not cognizable in the state forum.  Subsequently, the grand jury returned an indictment against three of the respondents, and the state trial court to which the indictment was assigned took jurisdiction over respondents' equitable claims for the return of the seized documents.  Respondents represent here that they wish to withdraw such claims from their federal complaint and seek injunctive relief exclusively in the state proceedings.
Held:
1. In light of respondents' aforesaid representation to this Court, there is no longer a live controversy between the parties over whether a federal court can hear the equitable claims, and the abstention issue is moot in this regard.  Accordingly, the portion of the Court of Appeals' judgment addressing those claims is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the claims with prejudice.  This disposition will prevent a regeneration of the controversy by respondents' reassertion of the right to litigate in federal court their equitable claims arising out of the events surrounding the search warrant's execution.  Pp.  484 U. S. 199-201. 
Page 484 U. S. 194

2. Even if the Younger doctrine required abstention here, the District Court had no discretion to dismiss, rather than to stay, respondents' claims for monetary relief that cannot be redressed in the state proceeding.  The Circuit rule requiring a stay in such circumstances is sound, since it allows the parallel state proceeding to go forward without interference from its federal sibling, while enforcing the federal courts' duty to exercise their jurisdiction.  Petitioners' assertion that this case presents extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify abdication of that duty is unpersuasive.  First, the speculation that the District Court, if allowed to retain jurisdiction, would ""hover"" intrusively about the state proceeding is based on the groundless assumption that the District Court would not hold up its end of the comity bargain.  Second, even if Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, would prevent the District Court from adjudicating respondents' state law claims as petitioners contend, this would not require the dismissal of respondents' federal damages claims, which are substantial, and sufficient to justify the District Court's retention of jurisdiction.  Third, the dismissal of the federal complaint would not prevent piecemeal litigation, which is inevitable even without federal court involvement, since the state criminal proceeding can provide only equitable relief.

Petitioner was tried in state court on charges of murder and armed robbery stemming from a 1981 store robbery during which his accomplice and the storekeeper's mother were killed in a fight after petitioner left the store.  Although petitioner testified that the mother had not even entered the store before he left, and that he had not intended to kill or harm anyone, the jury was instructed ""that malice is implied or presumed from the use of a deadly weapon.""  After his conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus from that court, arguing, inter alia, that the burden-shifting instruction given at trial was unconstitutional under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510.  While the habeas corpus application was pending, petitioner also called to the state court's attention this Court's subsequent decision in Francis v. Franklin, 471 U. S. 307.  After this Court summarily vacated the state court's summary denial of the writ and remanded the case ""for further consideration in light of Francis,"" the state court, although acknowledging that the jury instruction suffered from the same infirmities addressed in Francis, denied relief on state law grounds without considering whether Francis might apply retroactively, and without discussing Sandstrom.
Held:  As a matter of federal law, petitioner's conviction cannot stand in light of Francis.  Pp.  484 U. S. 215-218.
(a) Sandstrom, which had been decided before petitioner's trial took place, established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits jury instructions that have the effect of relieving the State of its burden of proof on the critical question of intent in a criminal prosecution.  Francis was merely an application of that governing principle.  Accordingly, respondents' argument that a newly announced constitutional rule should not generally be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review cannot operate to deny petitioner the benefit of Francis.  That argument simply does not apply where the ""new"" holding is merely an application of a rule that was well settled at the time of conviction.  Pp.  484 U. S. 215-217.
(b) The State's contention that it has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings and to refuse therein to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law retroactively is rejected. since Francis did not announce a new rule and since the state court's opinion 
Page 484 U. S. 212
 does not place any limit on the issues it will entertain in collateral proceedings.  Having considered the merits of the federal claim, that court has the duty to grant the relief that federal law requires.  Pp.  484 U. S. 217-218.

Syllabus 
Respondent, an Illinois state court judge, had authority under state law to appoint and discharge probation officers.  After hiring petitioner as a probation officer and later promoting her, respondent demoted and then discharged her.  Petitioner filed a damages action in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that she was demoted and discharged on account of her sex in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although the jury found in her favor, the court granted summary judgment to respondent on the ground that he was entitled to absolute immunity from a civil damages suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A state court judge does not have absolute immunity from a damages suit under  1983 for his decisions to demote and dismiss a court employee.  Pp.  484 U. S. 223-230.
(a) Because the threat of personal liability for damages can inhibit government officials in the proper performance of their duties, various forms of official immunity from suit have been created.  Aware, however, that the threat of such liability may also have the salutary effect of encouraging officials to perform their duties in a lawful and appropriate manner, this Court has been cautious in recognizing absolute immunity claims other than those decided by constitutional or statutory enactment.  Accordingly, the Court has applied a ""functional"" approach under which the nature of the functions entrusted to particular officials is examined in order to evaluate the effect that exposure to particular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those functions.  Even with respect to constitutional immunities granted for certain functions of Congress and the President, the Court has been careful not to extend the scope of protection further than its purposes require.  Pp.  484 U. S. 223-225.
(b) Judges have long enjoyed absolute immunity from liability in damages for their judicial or adjudicatory acts, primarily in order to protect judicial independence by insulating judges from vexatious actions by disgruntled litigants.  Truly judicial acts, however, must be distinguished from the administrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges may occasionally be assigned by law to perform.  It is the nature of the function performed -- adjudication -- rather than the identity of the actor 
Page 484 U. S. 220
 who performed it -- a judge -- that determines whether absolute immunity attaches to the act.  Pp.  484 U. S. 225-229.
(c) Respondent's decisions to demote and discharge petitioner were administrative, rather than judicial or adjudicative, in nature.  Such decisions are indistinguishable from those of an executive branch official responsible for making similar personnel decisions, which, no matter how crucial to the efficient operation of public institutions, are not entitled to absolute immunity from liability in damages under  1983.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that the threat of vexatious lawsuits by disgruntled ex-employees could interfere with the quality of a judge's decisions.  However true this may be, it does not serve to distinguish judges from other public officials who hire and fire subordinates.  In neither case is the danger that officials will be deflected from the effective performance of their duties great enough to justify absolute immunity.  This does not imply that qualified immunity, like that available to executive branch officials who make similar discretionary decisions, is unavailable to judges for their employment decisions, a question not decided here.

 Robert L. STREETMANv. James A. LYNAUGH, Director, Texas Department of Corrections.No. A-527 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 7, 1988
 The application for stay of execution of the sentence of death, presented to Justice WHITE and by him referred to the Court, is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the application for a stay and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, for the reasons stated below I still would be compelled to vote to overturn this sentence. 
 I  
 Streetman was convicted in Texas of murder and sentenced by a jury to die. Pursuant to Texas law, Tex.Code of Crim.Proc.Ann., 
Page 484 U.S. 992 , 993
 Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon 1981, and Supp. 1988), the jury was told that if they answered ""yes"" to two special questions, Streetman would automatically be sentenced to death. 
 The first question asked ""whether the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result."" As Justice BLACKMUN has observed, an affirmative answer to this question is generally a foregone conclusion because intent is usually an element of the underlying crime of capital murder. Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 916-917, and n. 1, 3406-3407, and n. 1 (1983) (dissenting opinion). Thus, Streetman's life hinged on the second question: ""whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society."" 
 The jury returned with their answers: ""Yes"" to both questions. The sentence was accordingly fixed at death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the judgment. 698 S.W.2d 132 (1985). Streetman's first state and federal habeas corpus petitions (raising issues unrelated to the issue discussed below) were denied. 634 F.Supp. 290 (ED Tex.1986); 812 F.2d 950 (CA5 1987); 818 F.2d 865 (CA5 1987). He then filed a second state habeas corpus petition in the state court calling into question, inter alia, the constitutionality of the Texas death penalty scheme's treatment of mitigating evidence. The petition was denied in state court, and the subsequent second federal habeas corpus petition was denied by the District Court and the Court of Appeals. 674 F.Supp. 229; 835 F.2d 1519; 835 F.2d 1521 (1988). This application for a stay followed. 
 II  
 In 1976, this Court approved generally the Texas death penalty scheme . Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262 (1976). In the course of its analysis, the Court considered the treatment of mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase. The joint opinion announcing the judgment found that the Texas courts had construed the second special question ""so as to allow a defendant to bring to the jury's attention whatever mitigating circumstances he may be able to show.""

 State of Texas, Plaintiffv. New Mexico.No. 65. 
 March 231, 1988
 On motion for allowance of interim fees and disbursements. 
 The motion of the Special Master for allowance of interim fees and disbursements is granted. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 Charles J. Meyers, formerly the dean of Stanford Law School and now a partner in the Denver branch of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a large Los Angeles law firm, on July 2, 1984, was appointed by this Court, see 468 U.S. 1202, to succeed the Honorable Jean S. Breitenstein, Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and since deceased, as Special Master in this litigation between Texas and New Mexico. 
 In December 1985, the successor Master filed an application for interim fees of $33,511 and for reimbursement of expenses of $702.09, a total of $34,213.09. That request was granted by the Court over three dissenting votes. See 475 U.S. 1004 (1986 ). Chief Justice Burger, writing for the dissenters, complained about Master Meyers' omission of ""any information concerning the experience levels of the four attorneys for whose services he seeks to charge""; about the absence of any statement that the four even were members of the Bar; and about the lack of information as to hourly rates charged. Ibid. The Chief Justice cited his corresponding dissent to the allowance of compensation requested by this same applicant as Master in Louisiana v. Mississippi, 466 U.S. 921 (1984). He repeated his earlier observation that a Special Master's charges, when allowed by the Court, "" 'represent our assurance to the parties that the charges are reasonable and proper,' "" and that this is so even where ""the parties do not oppose the application."" 475 U.S., at 1004. THE CHIEF JUSTICE also 
Page 485 U.S. 953 , 954
 noted: "" 'I believe the public service aspect of the appointment is a factor that is not to be wholly ignored in determining the reasonableness of fees charged in a case like this.' "" He stated: ""The contending litigants have a right to expect this Court to exercise its independent judgment on fees rather than requiring each or both of them to challenge the amounts."" Id., at 1005. 
 In September 1986, this Special Master once again moved for interim fees, this time for an amount totaling $69,608.50. The Court granted that motion as well. 479 U.S. 806 (1986). 
 The present application for more interim fees and for reimbursement of expenses was filed January 11, 1988. Master Meyers now requests $69, 661.25 in fees and $2,544.37 for expenses, a total of $72,205.62. He says that these amounts are those incurred since the interim allowance of $69, 608.50 in late 1986. 
 The applicant attaches a computer printout to his motion. He asserts that nearly all the work during this period was performed either by him or by Diana Poole, ""who has replaced Steven Crafton as my law clerk on this matter""; that clerk Crafton left the Denver office of the firm in August 1986; and that Ms. Poole assumed her duties in July 1987 and, revealingly , ""expended considerable effort in the early months mastering the background of the case before commencing research on the issues arising in devising a decree."" 
 The Master points out once again that he is a partner in his law firm and is head of its ""Natural Resources Group""; that he received his law degree from the University of Texas and his master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia University; and that he has taught at Texas, Columbia, and Stanford, and was dean of Stanford Law School for five years. He states that Ms. Poole received her law degree in 1983 from the University of Minnesota, where she was an editor of the Law Review, and that she now is an associate (nonpartner) lawyer in his firm's Denver office. She worked for one year as a law clerk for Judge Myron H. Bright of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and ""has been in private practice for over three years."" 
 The Master requests compensation for his time at a ""weighted average"" of $275.12 per hour. He requests compensation at a ""weighted average"" of $ 181.30 per hour for the time of Ms. Poole. He says that he spent 85.25 hours on the case; that Ms. Poole spent 246.25 hours; and that small additional amounts of time were ex- [485 U.S. 953 , 955]

 UNITED STEELWORKERS OF AMERICA, AFL-CIO-CLC, et al.v. CHEROKEE ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE.No. 87-1274 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 2, 1988
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether labor and management may be compelled to arbitrate a grievance that indisputably was filed outside the time limits provided by their collective-bargaining agreement. 
 The parties to this action entered into a collective-bargaining agreement that provided that ""[a]ny grievance not reported within five (5) working days of first knowledge of the occurrence causing the grievance shall be deemed wiaved [sic ] and non-existent."" The grievance at issue here was not reported within the 5-day period. The employer therefore refused to submit the grievance to arbitration. 
 The union brought an action to compel arbitration in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The court dismissed the action on summary judgment on the ground that the employer ""did not agree to submit to arbitration grievances which on their face are untimely and to which the timeliness issue is not disputed."" The court rejected the union's contention that the timeliness issue ought to have been submitted to the arbitrator. ""To permit an arbitrator to arbitrate the issue of timeliness where there is no dispute over the facts bearing on the timeliness issue would be to waste the time of the arbitrator and of the parties,"" reasoned the court, ""and if an arbitrator should erroneously find that this particular grievance was timely filed, the finding would be so manifestly arbitrary and capricious as to require a reviewing 
Page 485 U.S. 1038 , 1039
 court to set it aside."" The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed summarily. 829 F.2d 1131 (1987). 
 The decision in this case conflicts with decisions of several other Federal Courts of Appeals. Those courts have construed our decision in John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543d 898 (1964), as requiring that the arbitrator resolve all procedural objections to arbitration so long as the subject matter of the grievance is covered by an arbitration agreement. See, e.g., Niro v. Fearn Int'l, Inc., 827 F.2d 173, 175-176 (CA7 1987); Washington Hospital Center v. Service Employees Int'l Union, Local 722, 241 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 189-191, 746 F.2d 1503, 1506-1508 (1984); Automotive, Petroleum & Allied Industries Employees Union, Local 618 v. Town & Country Ford, Inc., 709 F.2d 509, 511-514 (CA8 1983). 
 In Washington Hospital Center, for example, the union failed to give notice that a grievance had been referred to arbitration within the time specified by the collective-bargaining agreement. It was nonetheless held that the arbitrability of the grievance had to be decided by the arbitrator rather than the courts. The District of Columbia Circuit reasoned that a dispute over "" 'the significance of a default in literal compliance with a contractual procedural requirement,' "" like a dispute over a substantive contractual provision, requires "" 'a determination of the intention of the parties to the contract' "" that must be made by the arbitrator. 241 U.S.App.D.C., at 191, 746 F.2d, at 1508 (quoting Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers, Local 765 v. Stroehmann Bros. Co., 625 F.2d 1092, 1093 (CA3 1980)). 
 I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on this question of federal labor law.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 25, 1988
 On petition for rehearing. 
 The petition for rehearing is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 2973- 2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would vacate the decision below insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. 
 II [ Romine v. Georgia 484 U.S. 1048 (1988) ][1048-Continued.] 
 Even if I did not hold this view, I would vacate petitioner's sentence of death for reconsideration in light of this Court's recent decision in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231. The Court in Lowenfield rejected a claim, similar to the one advanced by petitioner in this case, that the administration of an Allen charge to a capital sentencing jury was coercive. The Court recognized, however, that such a charge must be considered "" 'in its context and under all the circumstances.' "" Id., at 237 (quoting Jenkins v. United States, 380 U.S. 445, 446, 1060 ( 1965) (per curiam) ). Moreover, the Court explicitly limited its holding to the facts of the case before it, stating that ""we do not mean to be understood as saying other combinations of supplemental charges and polling might not require a different conclusion."" Id., at 241. The circumstances surrounding the administration of the Allen charge in the instant case differed substantially from those in Lowenfield. Moreover, they did so in ways that the Court in Lowenfield recognized as relevant to the issue of coercion. The Georgia Supreme Court therefore should be given an opportunity to re-evaluate petitioner's sentence in light of this Court's decision in Lowenfield. 
 Petitioner Larry Romine was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. His death sentence was reversed on appeal by the Georgia Supreme Court, and the case was remanded for a new sentencing trial. 251 Ga. 208, 305 S.E.2d 93 (1983). On retrial, after almost seven hours of deliberations and an overnight recess, the foreman of the jury sent the court a note that read: ""We are unable to reach a unanimous decision and are certain we will not 
Page 484 U.S. 1048 , 1049
 ever be able to reach one."" App. A to Pet. for Cert. 3. The court called the jury in and inquired: ""[C]an you just give me the numerical breakdown of how you stand?"" Ibid. The foreman replied that the jury was divided 11 to 1. The court sent the jury back for further deliberations, over the objection of defense counsel. When the jury still had not reached a verdict 51/2 hours later, the court called the jury in again to give it "" some other instructions."" Id., at 4. The court then administered an Allen charge, urging the jurors to reexamine the grounds of their opinions and attempt to reach a verdict. Two hours later, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of death. 
 In Georgia, as in Lowenfield's State of Louisiana, a hung jury in a capital sentencing trial results in the automatic imposition of a life sentence. See Ga.Code Ann. 17-10-31 (1982); Hill v. State, 250 Ga. 821, 301 S.E.2d 269 (1983); Miller v. State, 237 Ga. 557, 229 S.E.2d 376 (1976 ). Thus, the State's usual interest in an Allen charge-avoiding the societal costs of a retrial-is not present. The Court in Lowenfield recognized that this difference ""weighs in the constitutional calculus."" 484 U.S., at 238. The Court nonetheless concluded that the circumstances surrounding the administration of the charge in Lowenfield's case did not warrant a reversal on the ground of jury coercion. The discussion in Lowenfield, however, indicates that the circumstances relevant to petitioner's claim may produce a different result in the ""constitutional calculus."" 
 First, the jury polling that preceded the Allen charge in this case was far more coercive than the polling tolerated in Lowenfield. The Court in Lowenfield took great pains to establish that ""the inquiry as to the numerical division of the jury was not as to how they stood on the merits of the verdict, but how they stood on the question whether further deliberations might assist them in returning a verdict."" 484 U.S., at 240. Here, the court's question undoubtedly was directed at the jury's division on the merits, placing it squarely within this Court's holding in Brasfield v. United States, 272 U.S. 448 (1926), which the Lowenfield Court held to be ""instructive as to the potential dangers of jury polling."" 484 U.S., at 240. 
 Second, the jury's expression of its deadlock was much more unequivocal in this case than in Lowenfield. In Lowenfield, the jury's note to the court stated that it was unable to reach a verdict at that time. Id., at 234, 108 S.Ct., at ___. In the instant case, the jury not only stated that it was unable to reach a unanimous decision, but speci- [484 U.S. 1048 , 1050]
