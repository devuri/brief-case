No. 88-1474
Argued Nov. 1, 1989
Decided Dec. 11, 1989
493 U.S. 132

Syllabus 
In 1970 and 1971, Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company (Great Britain) Limited (Goodyear G.B.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear), a domestic corporation, filed income tax returns in, and paid taxes to, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.  It also distributed dividends to Goodyear, its sole shareholder, which Goodyear reported on its federal tax return.  Thereafter Goodyear sought an indirect credit for a portion of the foreign taxes paid by Goodyear G.B. as permitted by  902 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), which limits a domestic parent corporation's credit to the amount of tax paid by the subsidiary attributable to the dividend issued.  The credit is calculated by multiplying the total foreign tax paid by that portion of the subsidiary's after-tax ""accumulated profits"" that is actually issued to the domestic parent in the form of a taxable dividend.  After Goodyear G.B. carried back a net loss reported on its 1973 British tax return to offset portions of its 1970 and 1971 income, British taxing authorities recalculated its 1970 and 1971 income and tax liability, and the company received a refund for those years.  Pursuant to  905(c) of the Code -- which permits redetermination of the foreign tax credit whenever any tax paid is refunded -- the Commissioner of Internal Revenue recalculated the indirect tax credit available to Goodyear for 1970 and 1971 by lowering the foreign taxes paid to reflect the refund.  However, he refused to lower accumulated profits for those years to reflect the British tax authorities' redetermination because, applying United States tax principles, Goodyear G.B.'s loss would not have been allowable had the company been a domestic corporation filing a federal tax return.  Thus, the Commissioner assessed, and Goodyear paid, tax deficiencies for 1970 and 1971.  Goodyear subsequently sought a refund in the Claims Court, which rejected Goodyear's claim that foreign tax law principles govern the calculation of ""accumulated profits"" in  902's tax credit, finding instead that the purposes underlying  902 favored calculation of ""accumulated profits"" in accordance with United States tax concepts.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ""plain meaning"" of  902 required that ""accumulated profits"" be determined under foreign law.  It also held that the congressional 
Page 493 U. S. 133
 purpose underlying  902 to eliminate international double taxation would be defeated if a foreign subsidiary's taxes, but not its ""accumulated profits,"" were calculated under foreign law.
Held:  ""Accumulated profits,"" as that term appears in  902's indirect tax credit, are to be calculated in accordance with domestic tax principles.   493 U. S.  138-145.
(a) Section 902's text does not resolve how ""accumulated profits"" are to be calculated, since it relates such profits both to the foreign tax paid by the subsidiary, calculated in accordance with foreign law, and to the dividend issued by the subsidiary, calculated in accordance with domestic law.  Pp.  493 U. S. 138-139.
(b) No definitional approach to ""accumulated profits"" uniformly and unqualifiedly satisfies the indirect credit's dual congressional purposes, as clearly demonstrated by the credit's history, of protecting a domestic parent from double taxation of its income and treating foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries alike in terms of the tax credits they generate for their domestic companies.  Goodyear correctly claims that calculating such profits according to domestic tax principles can result in situations in which  902's statutory goal of avoiding double taxation will be disserved.  However, as the Government contends, defining the profits in terms of foreign tax principles can unfairly advantage domestic companies that operate through foreign subsidiaries over those that operate through unincorporated branches.  Pp.  493 U. S. 139-140.
(c) The Government's interpretation of ""accumulated profits"" is more faithful to congressional intent.  The risk of double taxation is less substantial than the risk of unequal treatment.  Goodyear offers no basis for its suggestion that double taxation -- which can result only when a dividend is sourced to a year in which domestic tax concepts recognize little or no income and yet a subsidiary pays substantial foreign tax -- commonly occurs.  On the other hand, Goodyear's approach leads to unequal tax treatment of subsidiaries and branches whenever the foreign taxing authority calculates income more or less generously than the United States, a result that is difficult to square with the express congressional purpose of ensuring tax parity between corporations that operate through foreign subsidiaries and those that operate through foreign branches.  The Government's approach is also supported by administrative interpretations of  902 and by the statutory canon that tax provisions should generally be read to incorporate domestic tax concepts absent a clear congressional expression that foreign concepts control, Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 573, 578.  Pp.  493 U. S. 143-145.

No. 88-1083
Argued Oct. 2, 1989
Decided Dec. 11, 1989
493 U.S. 146

Syllabus 
In connection with a 1978 periodic audit, respondent defense contractor and petitioner Defense Contract Auditing Agency (DCAA) corresponded concerning respondent's accounting treatment of certain costs.  Eight years later, a federal grand jury investigating possible fraudulent practices by respondent issued a subpoena requesting respondent's documents relating to the 1978 cost allocation question.  Respondent submitted to the DCAA a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for any documents relating to the subject matter of their correspondence.  The DCAA denied the request citing, inter alia, Exemption 7(A) of the FOIA, which exempts from disclosure ""records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes"" under certain circumstances.  Two days later, the requested records were transferred to petitioner Federal Bureau of Investigation, which denied respondent's renewed FOIA request, citing Exemption 7(A).  Respondent sought review in the District Court, which ruled that petitioners were not required to turn over any of the documents and dismissed the complaint, stating that disclosure would jeopardize the grand jury proceeding.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the Government may not invoke Exemption 7(A) to protect from disclosure materials that were not investigatory records when originally collected, but have since acquired investigative significance.
Held:  Exemption 7(A) may be invoked to prevent the disclosure of documents not originally created for, but later gathered for, law enforcement purposes.  The plain words of the statute contain no requirement that compilation be effected at a specific time, but merely require that the objects sought be compiled when the Government invokes the Exemption.  The Court of Appeals erred in interpreting the word ""compile"" to mean ""originally compiled,"" since ""compiled"" naturally refers to the process of gathering at one time records and information that were generated on an earlier occasion, and for a different purpose.  This reading of the statute recognizes the balance struck by Congress between the public's interest in greater access to information and the Government's need to protect certain kinds of information from disclosure, and is supported by the FOIA's legislative history.

493 U.S. 165

Syllabus 
After petitioner employer ordered a reduction in force and discharged or demoted some 1,200 workers, respondent affected employees filed in the District Court a collective action seeking relief under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).  In order to meet the requirement of 29 U.S.C.  216(b) -- a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) incorporated in the ADEA by 29 U.S.C.  626(b) -- that an individual may become a party plaintiff in a collective action only if he files with the court his ""consent in writing,"" respondents moved for discovery of the names and addresses of similarly situated employees and requested that the court send notice to all potential plaintiffs who had not yet filed consents.  The court held that it could facilitate notice of an ADEA suit to absent class members in appropriate cases so long as the court avoided communicating any encouragement to join the suit or any approval of the suit on its merits.  Thus it, inter alia, ordered petitioner to comply with the request for the names and addresses of discharged employees and authorized respondents to send to all employees who had not yet joined the suit a court-approved consent document and a notice stating that it had been authorized by the District Court, but that the court had taken no position on the merits of the case.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that there was no legal impediment to court-authorized notice in an appropriate case.  It declined to review the notice's form and contents, including the district Court's authorization statement.
Held:  District courts have discretion, in appropriate cases, to implement  216(b), as incorporated by  626(b), in ADEA actions by facilitating notice to potential plaintiffs.  However, as did the Court of Appeals, this Court declines to examine the terms of the notice used here.
(a) The District Court was correct to permit discovery of the discharged employees' names and addresses, since such discovery was relevant to the subject matter of the action, and since there were no grounds to limit discovery under the facts and circumstances of this case.
(b) Once an ADEA suit is filed, a district court has a managerial responsibility to oversee the joinder of additional parties to assure that the task is accomplished in an efficient way, and has the discretion to begin its involvement at the point of the initial notice rather than at a 
Page 493 U. S. 166
 later time.  Court-authorized notice may counter the potential for misuse of the class device, avoids a multiplicity of duplicative suits, and sets reasonable cut-off dates to expedite the action's disposition.  Moreover, by monitoring preparation and distribution of the notice, a court can ensure that the notice is timely, accurate, and informative, and can settle disputes about the notice's content before it is distributed.  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 83 -- which endorses measures to regulate the actions of the parties to a multiparty suit -- and 16(b) -- which requires the entry of scheduling orders limiting the time for, inter alia, the joinder of additional parties -- provide further support for the trial court's authority.  Petitioner's contention that court involvement in the notice process would thwart Congress' intention to relieve employers from the burden of multiparty actions, as expressed in the FLSA's 1947 amendments, is rejected, since those amendments merely limited private FLSA plaintiffs to employees who asserted their own rights, thus abolishing the right to sue of representatives with no personal interest in a suit's outcome, and left intact the ""similarly situated"" language providing for collective actions.
(c) This Court's decision does not imply that trial courts have unbridled discretion in managing ADEA actions.  In exercising the discretionary authority to oversee the notice-giving process, courts must be scrupulous to respect judicial neutrality by avoiding even the appearance of judicial endorsement of the merits of the action.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 11, 1989
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. 
 Denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Petitioner, Joe Sorola, was indicted for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. 19.03(a)(2) (Supp.1988-1989). At trial, the State announced in open court that it would not seek the death penalty and jury selection proceeded as if the death penalty was not at issue. [Footnote 1] As the lower court explained: 
Page 493 U.S. 1005 , 1006
 ""The record reflects that following the jury's decision that [ Sorola] was guilty of capital murder, the jury was sent back to the jury room. Outside the presence of the jury, the trial court, the State, and [Sorola] agreed that because the State had waived the death penalty in this case, the proper procedure was to have the court assess punishment. The trial court then found [Sorola] guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Corrections. Thereafter without objection, the court informed the parties he was going to release the jury panel."" 674 S. W.2d 809, 810 (Tex.App.1984). 
 Petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that under state law, the State cannot waive its right to seek the death penalty, and a defendant cannot waive the right to a jury's assessment of punishment. 693 S.W.2d 417, 419 (1985). Upon remand for a new trial, petitioner filed an application for writ of habeas corpus arguing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from seeking the death penalty if he were once again found guilty of capital murder on retrial. [Footnote 2] The Texas courts rejected his claim and he now seeks certiorari. [Footnote 3] 769 S.W.2d 920, 926-928 (Tex.Crim.App.1989). Because I believe the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State from subjecting petitioner to the death penalty on retrial, I would grant the petition and reverse the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. 
 I  
 In Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981), this Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the State from subjecting a defendant who received a life sentence in his first sentencing proceeding to the possibility of a death sentence on retrial after reversal of his conviction or sentence.

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a multi-employer collective bargaining agreement, respondent union operates a hiring hall through which it refers both members and nonmembers for work at the request of employers.  The hiring hall is ""nonexclusive,"" in that workers are free to seek employment through other means, and employers are not restricted to hiring persons recommended by the union.  Petitioner, a member of the union, filed suit alleging that respondent:  (1) violated  101(a)(5) and 609 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) -- which forbid a union to ""fine, suspend, expe[l] or otherwise discipline"" a member for exercising LMRDA-secured rights -- by refusing to refer him through the hiring hall as a result of his political opposition to respondent's leadership; and (2) breached its duty of fair representation under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by discriminating against him in respect to such referrals.  The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that discrimination in hiring hall referrals constitutes an unfair labor practice subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board).  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that fair representation claims must be brought before the Board, and that petitioner had failed to state a claim under the LMRDA.
Held:
1. The District Court did not lack jurisdiction over petitioner's fair representation suit.  Pp.  493 U. S. 73-90.
(a) The NLRB does not have exclusive jurisdiction over a union member's claim that his union breached its duty of fair representation by discriminating against him in job referrals made by the union hiring hall.  The fact that the alleged violation of respondent's duty of fair representation might also be an unfair labor practice, over which state and federal courts lack jurisdiction under San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236,  359 U. S. 245, did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction over petitioner's fair representation claim, since Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, held that Garmon's preemption rule does not extend to suits alleging such claims.  No exception to the Vaca rule can be created for fair representation complaints arising out of the operation of hiring 
Page 493 U. S. 68
 halls on the ground that the NLRB has developed substantial expertise in dealing with hiring hall policies.  Such a rule would remove an unacceptably large number of fair representation claims from federal courts, since the NLRB has developed an unfair labor practice jurisprudence in many areas traditionally encompassed by the duty of fair representation.  Decisions of this Court containing language recognizing the need for a single expert federal agency to adjudicate difficult hiring hall problems are distinguished, since those cases focused on whether exclusive hiring halls had encouraged union membership impermissibly as forbidden by the NLRA, rather than on whether unions have administered properly out-of-work lists as required by their duty of fair representation.  Also distinguished are the Court's decisions holding that state court hiring hall suits are preempted by NLRB jurisdiction, since state law claims frequently involve tort, contract, and other substantive areas of law that have developed independently of federal labor law, whereas the duty of fair representation has ""judicially evolved"" as part of federal labor law and is unlikely generally to create conflicts with the operative realities of federal labor policy.  The Court of Appeals' holding that an employee cannot prevail in a fair representation suit against his union if he fails to allege that his employer breached the collective bargaining agreement constitutes a misstatement of existing law.  Although Vaca recognized the desirability of having the same entity adjudicate a joint fair representation/breach of contract action, it in no way implied that a fair representation action requires a concomitant claim against the employer.  Independent federal court jurisdiction exists over fair representation claims because the duty of fair representation is implied from the NLRA's grant of exclusive representation status to unions, such that the claims ""aris[e] under a[n] Act of Congress regulating commerce"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1337(a), the pertinent jurisdictional provision.  Moreover, a fair representation claim is a separate cause of action from any possible suit against the employer.  Thus, this Court declines to adopt a rule that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the NLRB over any fair representation suit whose hypothetical accompanying claim against the employer might be raised before the Board.  Pp.  493 U. S. 73-84.
(b) Petitioner has not failed to allege a fair representation claim.  There is no merit to respondent's contention that it did not breach its duty of fair representation because that duty should be defined in terms of what is an unfair labor practice, and because it committed no such practice, since the NLRA forbids only union discrimination based on union membership or lack thereof, and not on any other form of maladministration of a job-referral system.  Equating breaches of the duty of fair representation with unfair labor practices would make the two redundant, despite their different purposes, and would eliminate some 
Page 493 U. S. 69
 of the prime virtues of the fair representation duty -- flexibility and adaptability.  That duty is not intended to mirror the contours of unfair labor practices, but arises independently in order to prevent arbitrary conduct against individuals deprived by the NLRA of traditional forms of redress against unions.  Also without merit is respondent's contention that it should be relieved of its duty of fair representation because, in the hiring hall context, it is acting essentially as an employer in matching up job requests with available personnel, and therefore does not ""represent"" the employees as a bargaining agent.  That the particular function of job referral resembles a task that an employer might perform is of no consequence, since the union is administering a provision of the collective bargaining agreement, and is therefore subject to the duty of fair representation.  Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U. S. 335,  375 U. S. 342.  In fact, if a union assumes the employer's role in a hiring hall, its responsibility to exercise its power fairly increases, rather than decreases, since the individual employee then stands alone against a single entity, the joint union/employer.  Pp.  493 U. S. 84-90.
2. Respondent's alleged refusal to refer petitioner to employment through the union hiring hall as a result of his political opposition to the union's leadership does not give rise to a claim under  101(a)(5) and 609 of the LMRDA.  By using the phrase ""otherwise discipline,"" those sections demonstrate a congressional intent to denote only punishment authorized by the union as a collective entity to enforce its rules, and not to include all acts that deterred the exercise of LMRDA-protected rights.  The construction that the term refers only to actions undertaken under color of the union's right to control the member's conduct in order to protect the interests of the union or its membership is buttressed by the legislative history and by the statute's structure, which specifically enumerates types of discipline -- fine, expulsion, and suspension -- that imply some sort of established disciplinary process, rather than ad hoc retaliation by individual union officers, and which, in  101(a)(5), includes procedural safeguards designed to protect against improper disciplinary action -- ""written specific charges,"" ""a reasonable time to prepare a defense,"" and a ""full and fair hearing"" -- that would apply to the type of procedure encountered in Boilermakers v. Hardeman, 401 U. S. 233,  402 U. S. 236-237, whereby a union imposes ""discipline"" by virtue of its own authority over its members, and not to instances of unofficial, sub rosa discrimination.  Here, the opprobrium of the union as an entity was not visited on petitioner, since he has alleged only that he was the victim of personal vendettas of union officers, and not that he was punished by any tribunal or subjected to any proceedings convened by respondent.

After this Court held that respondent city had violated federal law by conditioning the renewal of petitioner's taxicab franchise on settlement of a pending labor dispute between petitioner and its union, Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608 (Golden State I), the District Court enjoined the city to reinstate the franchise.  However, the court concluded that  1983 did not authorize a compensatory damages award, since the Supremacy Clause does not create individual rights that may be vindicated in an action for damages under  1983; and since, even though the city's conduct was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) under Golden State I, there had been no ""direct violation"" of the statute, and the Act's comprehensive enforcement scheme precluded resort to  1983.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Petitioner is entitled to maintain a  1983 action for compensatory damages.  Pp.  493 U. S. 105-113.
(a) The Supremacy Clause, of its own force, does not create rights enforceable under  1983.

A  1983 remedy is not precluded by the existence of a comprehensive enforcement scheme, since the NLRA provides no mechanism to address state interference with federally protected labor rights.  Moreover, the city's argument that its conduct did not violate any rights secured by the NLRA is rejected, since petitioner is the intended beneficiary of a statutory scheme that gives parties to a collective bargaining agreement the right to make use of ""economic weapons,"" not expressly set forth in the NLRA, free of federal or state governmental interference.

Nos. 87-1979, 88-127
Argued October 3, 1989
Decided November 28, 1989
493 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Respondents, employees of petitioner railroads, were injured while working at petitioners' Virginia terminals, where coal was being loaded from railway cars to ships on.navigable waters.  The injuries to respondents in No. 87-1979, who were laborers doing housekeeping and janitorial services, occurred while they were undertaking one of their duties: cleaning spilled coal from loading equipment to prevent fouling.  The injury to respondent in No. 88-127, a pier machinist, occurred when he was engaged in his primary duty of repairing coal loading equipment.  Each respondent brought suit in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Petitioners challenged jurisdiction under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), which, inter alia, provides the exclusive remedy for an employee injured at a relevant situs while
""engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor-worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and ship-breaker.""
33 U.S.C.  902(3).  The trial courts dismissed the suits, concluding that each respondent was an employee covered by the LHWCA.  The Supreme Court of Virginia consolidated the appeals of respondents in No. 87-1979 and reversed the dismissal of their cases, stating that the key question was whether an employee's activities had a realistically significant relationship to the loading of cargo on ships, and ruling that the activities of employees performing purely maintenance tasks did not.  On the basis of this decision, the court then reversed the dismissal of the suit by respondent repairman in No. 88-127.
Held:  Respondents were engaged in maritime employment within the meaning of  902(3).   493 U. S.  45-48.
(a) Since employment that is maritime within the meaning of  902(3) includes not only the specified occupations or employees who physically handle cargo, but also land-based activity occurring within the relevant situs if it is an integral or essential part of loading or unloading a vessel, Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249; P.C. Pfeiffer 
Page 493 U. S. 41
 Co. v. Ford, 444 U. S. 69; Herb's Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414, employees who are injured while maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process are covered by the Act.  Someone who repairs or maintains such equipment is just as vital to and as integral a part of the loading process as the operator of the equipment, since, when machinery breaks down or becomes clogged because of the lack of cleaning, the loading process stops until the difficulty is cured.  It is irrelevant that an employee's contribution to that process is not continuous, that he has other duties not integrally connected with the process, or that repair or maintenance is not always needed.  The conclusion that the Act covers essential repair and maintenance is buttressed by the fact that every Federal Court of Appeals to have addressed the issue has reached this result, as has the Department of Labor, the agency charged with administering the Act.  Pp.  493 U. S. 45-48.

			"|"Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company v. Schwalb
Nos. 87-1979, 88-127
Argued October 3, 1989
Decided November 28, 1989
493 U.S. 40

Syllabus 
Respondents, employees of petitioner railroads, were injured while working at petitioners' Virginia terminals, where coal was being loaded from railway cars to ships on.navigable waters.  The injuries to respondents in No. 87-1979, who were laborers doing housekeeping and janitorial services, occurred while they were undertaking one of their duties: cleaning spilled coal from loading equipment to prevent fouling.  The injury to respondent in No. 88-127, a pier machinist, occurred when he was engaged in his primary duty of repairing coal loading equipment.  Each respondent brought suit in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Petitioners challenged jurisdiction under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA or Act), which, inter alia, provides the exclusive remedy for an employee injured at a relevant situs while
""engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor-worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and ship-breaker.""
33 U.S.C.  902(3).  The trial courts dismissed the suits, concluding that each respondent was an employee covered by the LHWCA.  The Supreme Court of Virginia consolidated the appeals of respondents in No. 87-1979 and reversed the dismissal of their cases, stating that the key question was whether an employee's activities had a realistically significant relationship to the loading of cargo on ships, and ruling that the activities of employees performing purely maintenance tasks did not.  On the basis of this decision, the court then reversed the dismissal of the suit by respondent repairman in No. 88-127.
Held:  Respondents were engaged in maritime employment within the meaning of  902(3).   493 U. S.  45-48.
(a) Since employment that is maritime within the meaning of  902(3) includes not only the specified occupations or employees who physically handle cargo, but also land-based activity occurring within the relevant situs if it is an integral or essential part of loading or unloading a vessel, Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249; P.C. Pfeiffer 
Page 493 U. S. 41
 Co. v. Ford, 444 U. S. 69; Herb's Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470 U. S. 414, employees who are injured while maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process are covered by the Act.  Someone who repairs or maintains such equipment is just as vital to and as integral a part of the loading process as the operator of the equipment, since, when machinery breaks down or becomes clogged because of the lack of cleaning, the loading process stops until the difficulty is cured.  It is irrelevant that an employee's contribution to that process is not continuous, that he has other duties not integrally connected with the process, or that repair or maintenance is not always needed.  The conclusion that the Act covers essential repair and maintenance is buttressed by the fact that every Federal Court of Appeals to have addressed the issue has reached this result, as has the Department of Labor, the agency charged with administering the Act.  Pp.  493 U. S. 45-48.
(b) Each of the respondents is covered by the LHWCA.  It makes no difference that the particular kinds of repairs being done by respondent in No. 88-127 might be considered traditional railroad work or might be done by railroad employees wherever railroad cars are unloaded, since the determinative consideration is that the shiploading process could not continue unless the equipment respondent worked on was operating properly and loading was, in fact, stopped while he made the repairs.  Respondents in No. 87-1979 were also performing duties essential to the overall loading process, in light of testimony that, if coal which spills onto the loading equipment is not periodically removed, the equipment may become clogged and inoperable.

|493 u.s. 52|"United States v. Sperry Corporation
No. 88-952
Argued Oct. 10, 1989
Decided Nov. 28, 1989
493 U.S. 52

Syllabus 
Prior to the 1979 seizure of the United States Embassy in Tehran, appellees, American parent and subsidiary corporations (hereinafter Sperry), entered into contracts with the Government of Iran.  After the Embassy seizure, Sperry filed suit for claims against Iran in a Federal District Court and obtained a prejudgment attachment of Iranian assets.  Subsequently, the United States and Iran entered into the Algiers Accords, which, inter alia, established the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (Tribunal) to arbitrate Americans' claims against Iran, specified that Tribunal awards are final, binding, and enforceable in the courts of any nation, and placed $1 billion of Iranian assets in a Security Account for the payment of awards to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB) and thence to claimants.  After Executive Orders implementing the Accords invalidated Sperry's attachment and prohibited it from further pursuing its claim in American courts, it filed a claim with the Tribunal and ultimately entered into a settlement agreement whereby Iran promised to pay it $2.8 million, which agreement was recorded as an award of the Tribunal.  Congress then enacted  502 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987, which requires the FRB to deduct from any Tribunal award and to pay into the United States Treasury before remitting the award to the claimant a percentage of the award
""as reimbursement to the . . . Government for expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of claims . . . before [the] Tribunal and the maintenance of the Security Account.""
When the FRB so deducted a percentage of Sperry's award, Sperry renewed a suit it had previously filed in the Claims Court, arguing that the deduction authorized by  502 was unconstitutional.  The court rejected the claim and dismissed the suit, but the Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  Section 502 is not unconstitutional.  Pp.  493 U. S. 59-66.
(a) Section 502 does not violate the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Sperry has not identified any of its property that was taken without just compensation.  No taking occurred because Sperry's prejudgment attachment was nullified by the Executive Orders implementing the Accords, since Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654,  453 U. S. 674, n. 6, held that American litigants against Iran had no property interest in such attachments.  Nor did Sperry suffer the deprivation of its claim against Iran, since it presented the claim to the Tribunal and 
Page 493 U. S. 53
 settled it for a substantial sum, and now makes no claim that the award was less than could have been recovered in ordinary litigation or that being forced to take the lesser amount was an unconstitutional taking.  Moreover, the deduction is not a taking, but is a reasonable ""user fee"" assessed against claimants before the Tribunal and intended to reimburse the Government for its costs in connection with the Tribunal.  The amount of a user fee need not be precisely calibrated to the use that a party makes of governmental services, and, on the facts of this case, the  502 deduction is not so clearly excessive as to belie its purported character as a user fee.  Sperry's contention that it did not benefit from the procedures established by the Accords is rejected, since those procedures assured Sperry that its award could be enforced in the courts of any nation and actually paid in this country, whereas, absent those procedures, Sperry would have had no assurance that it could have pursued its action to judgment or that a judgment would have been readily collectible.  It is not dispositive that the award was more the result of private negotiations than Tribunal procedures, since Sperry filed its claim with the Tribunal and had a formal award entered, and since Sperry could be required to pay a charge for available governmental services that it never actually used.  Pp.  493 U. S. 59-64.
(b) Section 502 does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The retroactive application of the  502 deductions to awards, such as Sperry's, made prior to the statute's enactment is justified by a rational legislative purpose:  ensuring that all successful claimants before the Tribunal are treated alike in that all have to contribute to the Tribunal's costs.  If  502's application had been prospective only, those costs would have fallen disproportionately on claimants whose awards were delayed, and claimants who obtained awards prior to enactment would have enjoyed a windfall by avoiding contribution.  Nor does  502 violate the Clause's equal protection component by failing to assess a user fee against all claimants before the Tribunal, since Congress could have rationally concluded that only successful claimants realize a benefit sufficient to justify assessment of a fee and that assessing all claimants would undesirably deter small or uncertain claims.  Pp.  493 U. S. 64-66.
(c) This Court will not reach the merits of Sperry's argument that  502 was enacted in violation of the Origination Clause of Article I,  7, of the Constitution.  The question whether Origination Clause claims present nonjusticiable political questions is presently pending before the Court, see United States v. Munoz-Flores, cert. granted, post, p. 808, and it would be inappropriate to address Sperry's claim before the threshold justiciability question is decided.  Furthermore, even assuming that Origination Clause claims are justiciable, this Court would benefit 
Page 493 U. S. 54
 from the views of the Court of Appeals, which found it unnecessary to address the Origination Clause issue.  P.  493 U. S. 66.

No. 88-995
Argued October 4, 1989
Decided November 7, 1989
493 U.S. 6

Syllabus 
Texas law provides that any party dissatisfied with a State Industrial Accident Board workers' compensation ruling may bring a civil suit to set the decision aside.  The court determines such cases de novo, and the party seeking compensation bears the burden of proof regardless of which party prevailed before the board.  Pursuant to Texas law, respondent Brewer, a Texas citizen employed by a Texas corporation, filed a workers' compensation claim with the board against the employer's insurer, petitioner here, an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in that State.  After the board awarded Brewer compensation, petitioner filed an action in Federal District Court, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1332.  The court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Holding that Fifth Circuit precedent, Campbell v. Insurance Co. of North America, 552 F.2d 604, required it to apply the direct action proviso of  1332(c) -- which states that,
""in any direct action against the insurer of a policy . . . of liability insurance . . such insurer shall be deemed a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen. . . .""
-- the court attributed the employer's Texas citizenship to petitioner, thus eliminating diversity between petitioner and Brewer.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The direct action proviso does not apply to actions brought in federal court by an insurer.  The proviso's language unambiguously applies only to actions against insurers and does not mention actions by insurers.  This reading is reinforced by the proviso's legislative history.  Campbell's analysis -- that an action such as petitioner's is an action against an insurer, since the entire process is initiated by an employee's claim to the board, since the employee has the burden of proof at the trial, and since the insurer's action is merely an ""appeal"" of the board's ruling -- is rejected.  Although the employee retains some of the characteristics of a plaintiff at trial, the action is commenced when the insurer files the complaint in court, not when the employee files his claim with the board.  Moreover, the board's award is vacated once the court acquires jurisdiction over the suit.  The seeming incongruity Congress created by retaining diversity jurisdiction over actions brought by out-of-state insurers while withdrawing removal jurisdiction when it eliminated diversity 
Page 493 U. S. 7
 jurisdiction in actions brought against them is insufficient to persuade this Court to extend the scope of the proviso's precise wording.  Cf. Horton v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 367 U. S. 348,  367 U. S. 351-352.  Pp.  493 U. S. 9-13.

Argued October 4, 1989

493 U.S. 20

Syllabus 
Subsection (a)(1) of the citizen suit provision of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.  6972, permits any person to commence a civil action against an alleged violator of waste disposal regulations promulgated under the Act, ""[except] as provided in subsection (b).""  Subsection (b), entitled ""[a]ctions prohibited,"" provides that no such suit may be commenced prior to 60 days after a plaintiff has given notice of the violation to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal body charged with enforcing RCRA, to the State in which the alleged violation occurred, and to the alleged violator.  Believing that respondent's sanitary landfill violated RCRA standards, petitioners, the owners of a farm next to the landfill, sent respondent written notice of their intent to sue and, one year later, commenced this action.  Respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because petitioners had failed to notify the State of Oregon and the EPA as required by  6972(b).  Petitioners then notified the state and federal agencies of the suit.  The District Court denied respondent's motion on the ground that petitioners satisfied RCRA's notice requirement by notifying these agencies and, after trial, held that respondent had violated RCRA.  The Court of Appeals remanded the action with instructions to dismiss, concluding that petitioners' failure to comply with the 60-day notice requirement deprived the District Court of subject matter jurisdiction.
Held:  Where a party suing under RCRA's citizen suit provision fails to meet the notice and 60-day delay requirements of  6972(b), the action must be dismissed as barred by the terms of the statute.  Pp.  493 U. S. 25-33.
(a) The plain language of the statute establishes that compliance with the 60-day notice provision is a mandatory, not optional, condition precedent for suit, and may not be disregarded at a court's discretion.  Actions commenced prior to 60 days after notice are ""prohibited"" under  6972(b), and, because this language is expressly incorporated by reference into  6972(a), it acts as a specific limitation on a citizen's right to bring suit.  Pp.  493 U. S. 25-26.
(b) None of petitioners' arguments for giving the statute a flexible or pragmatic construction require this Court to disregard the statute's plain language.  The argument that the notice requirement should be deemed 
Page 493 U. S. 21
 satisfied if a suit commenced without proper notice is stayed until 60 days after notice has been given is rejected.  Whether or not a stay is in fact the functional equivalent of precommencement delay, staying judicial action once the suit has been filed does not honor  6972(b)'s prohibition on the filing of a complaint before the 60-day notice requirement is fulfilled.  Although Congress excepted parties from complying with a delay requirement elsewhere in RCRA, it did not do so in petitioners' situation, and this Court may not create such an exception where Congress has declined to do so.  The contention that the 60-day notice provision is subject to equitable modification and cure is also unavailing.  The equities do not weigh in favor of modifying statutory requirements when the procedural default is caused by petitioners' failure to take the minimal steps necessary to preserve their claims.  Nor can petitioners' failure be excused on the ground that it would be unfair to hold them, as laypersons, to strict compliance with the statute, since this suit, like RCRA citizen suits generally, was filed by a trained lawyer.  Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, distinguished.  Petitioners' reliance on the legislative history of citizen suit provisions is also misplaced, since nothing in that history militates against honoring the plain language of the notice requirement.  In fact, requiring citizens to comply with the notice and delay requirements furthers Congress' goal of striking a balance between encouraging citizen suits and avoiding burdening the federal courts with excessive numbers of such suits, since notice allows government agencies and alleged violators to achieve compliance without the need for suit.  Petitioners' assertion that giving effect to the literal meaning of the notice provisions would allow violations to go unchecked during the 60-day waiting period is not persuasive, since this problem results from the balance knowingly struck by Congress in developing the citizen suit provisions, and since it is likely that compliance with the notice requirement will trigger appropriate federal or state enforcement actions to prevent serious damage.  Moreover, it is not irrational to require a citizen to wait 60 days to commence suit after agencies and alleged violators have specifically declined to act in response to notice by the citizen, since a violator or agency may change its mind as the threat of suit becomes imminent.  Pp.  493 U. S. 26-31.
(c) In light of this Court's literal interpretation of the statutory requirement, the question whether  6972(b) is jurisdictional in the strict sense of that term, or is merely procedural, need not be determined.  Requiring dismissal for noncompliance with the notice provision is supported by the EPA, and will further judicial efficiency by relieving courts of the need to make case-by-case determinations of when or whether failure to comply is fatal.   493 U. S.  31-32. 
Page 493 U. S. 22

(d) Although there is some merit to petitioners' contention that requiring dismissal of this action wastes judicial resources, the factors that have led this Court to apply decisions nonretroactively are not present here:  this decision does not establish a new rule of law or overrule clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, and the statute itself put petitioners on notice of the requirements for bringing suit.  Retroactive operation of this decision will further Congress' purpose of giving agencies and alleged violators a 60-day nonadversarial period to achieve compliance with RCRA regulations.  Moreover, dismissal will not deprive petitioners of their ""right to a day in court,"" since they remain free to give the statutorily required notice and file their suit.  Pp.  493 U. S. 32-33.

			"|"Hallstrom v. Tillamook County
No. 88-42
Argued October 4, 1989
Decided November 7, 1989
493 U.S. 20

Syllabus 
Subsection (a)(1) of the citizen suit provision of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C.  6972, permits any person to commence a civil action against an alleged violator of waste disposal regulations promulgated under the Act, ""[except] as provided in subsection (b).""  Subsection (b), entitled ""[a]ctions prohibited,"" provides that no such suit may be commenced prior to 60 days after a plaintiff has given notice of the violation to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal body charged with enforcing RCRA, to the State in which the alleged violation occurred, and to the alleged violator.  Believing that respondent's sanitary landfill violated RCRA standards, petitioners, the owners of a farm next to the landfill, sent respondent written notice of their intent to sue and, one year later, commenced this action.  Respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because petitioners had failed to notify the State of Oregon and the EPA as required by  6972(b).  Petitioners then notified the state and federal agencies of the suit.  The District Court denied respondent's motion on the ground that petitioners satisfied RCRA's notice requirement by notifying these agencies and, after trial, held that respondent had violated RCRA.  The Court of Appeals remanded the action with instructions to dismiss, concluding that petitioners' failure to comply with the 60-day notice requirement deprived the District Court of subject matter jurisdiction.

 Frederick LYNN, petitioner,v. ALABAMA. No. 89-5503. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 30, 1989
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama. 
 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition to determine whether a prosecutor's reliance on a nonracial criterion in exercising his peremptory jury challenges violates the Equal Protection Clause where that criterion is highly correlated to race and the 
Page 493 U.S. 945 , 946
 bias that the prosecutor seeks to exclude through the use of that criterion could easily have been discovered on voir dire. 
 Petitioner Frederick Lynn, an Afro-American, was convicted of murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. During voir dire, the prosecutor exercised 11 of his 14 peremptory challenges to remove all of the potential Afro-American jurors. The crime occurred in Barbour County, Alabama, a small community with approximately equal white and Afro- American populations. General Population Characteristics, Alabama, Census of Population 2-15 (1980) (13,693 whites, 11,003 Afro-Americans). Certain neighborhoods within the community are populated predominately by people of color. 
 While Lynn's appeal was pending, this Court lowered the threshold showing required for a criminal defendant to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in jury selection. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 97, 1723 (1986). To make out such a case, a defendant must establish first that he is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the prosecutor has acted to remove members of that group from the venire; second, that the procedure used by the State permits those ""who are of a mind to discriminate"" to do so; and third, that the facts and circumstances of the case raise the inference that the State acted in a discriminatory manner. Id., at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723. To rebut a prima facie case of racial discrimination, the prosecutor must offer a "" 'clear and reasonably specific' explanation of his 'legitimate reasons' for exercising the challenges."" Id., at 98, n. 20, n. 20 (quoting Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 258, 1096 (1981)). We subsequently determined that the ruling in Batson applies retroactively to state convictions pending on direct review at the time of the Batson decision. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987). 
 The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded Lynn's case to the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on his Batson claim. At that hearing, the prosecutor gave a juror-by-juror explanation of his peremptory strikes. The prosecutor stated that he exercised his fourth strike to exclude an Afro-American juror that ""live[d] on the Gammage Road in an area where the defendant, Frederick Lynn, was living at the time of this crime, and also where . . . the defendant's grandmother and aunt . . . have lived for numerous years. I felt that friendship would possibly be there that would bias [the juror], and for that reason struck him."" [493 U.S. 945 , 947]

|493 u.s. 1|"Terrell v. Morris
No. 88-7535
Decided October 10, 1989
493 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
When petitioner Terrell sought postconviction relief in the Ohio courts, they held that he had defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal, as required by State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112.  Before Cole, Ohio had permitted such claims in collateral challenges even if they had not been presented on direct appeal.  Terrell then petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the Cole rule postdated his appeal and that he could not have known that he would default his claim if he failed to raise it on direct appeal.  The District Court agreed, finding that Ohio could not invoke its procedural default rule retroactively, but proceeded to deny Terrell's claim on the merits.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the District Court properly determined that the ineffective assistance claim was not reviewable because of Terrell's failure to raise it in the state court proceedings.
Held:  The Court of Appeals affirmed a decision that the District Court never made, and so never reviewed that court's actual decision.  The District Court reached the merits of Terrell's claim after it determined that the only applicable default rule postdated his conviction.  However, the Court of Appeals neither noted nor addressed the retroactivity issue.  Review of the procedural bar and retroactivity issues should be undertaken based on a correct formulation of the District Court's ruling.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 10, 1989
 Leave to File Petition for Rehearing Denied March 19, 1990. 
 See 494 U.S. 1050. 
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 A question presented in this case is whether liability under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C., 1961 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V), may be imposed where neither the "" enterprise"" nor the ""pattern of racketeering activity"" had any profit- making element. The Second and Eighth Circuits have held that it may not. United States v. Ivic, 700 F.2d 51, 58-65 (CA2 1983) (enterprise or predicate acts must have financial purpose); United States v. Flynn, 852 F.2d 1045, 1052 (CA8) (enterprise must be directed toward economic goal), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 974 (1988). The Third Circuit in this case upheld RICO liability despite the absence of any economic motivation on the part of the defendants. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict. 
 On the order list of October 2, 1989, the Court also denied certiorari in the following cases. 
 Norton v. United States, No. 88-1889, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871: The Eleventh Circuit held that law enforcement officers reasonably relied on warrants calling for the search and seizure of "" 'all corporate records . . . which are evidence and instrumentalities of the offense set forth in Section 1954 of Title 18 of the United States Code,' "" and that the evidence seized pursuant to that warrant was admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule articulated in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 
Page 493 U.S. 901 , 902
 897 (1984). 867 F.2d 1354, 1360 (1989). The decision of the Eleventh Circuit conflicts with the Tenth Circuit's decision that a warrant ordering the seizure of all records ""relating to the purchase, sale and illegal exportation of materials in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778, and the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C.App. 2410,"" was so facially overbroad that law enforcement officers could not reasonably rely on it, United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d 592, 594 (1988), and a similar decision of the Ninth Circuit suppressing evidence seized under a warrant seeking "" documents, books, ledgers, records and objects which are evidence of violations of federal criminal law,"" Center Art Galleries-Hawaii, Inc. v. United States, 875 F.2d 747, 749 (1989). The conflict should be resolved. 
 Bergen v. F/V St. Patrick, No. 88-1960, and Kidd v. F/V St. Patrick, No. 88-1762, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871: The Ninth Circuit held that where a Death on the High Seas Act claim, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U.S.C.App. 761 et seq. (1982 ed., Supp. V), is joined with a Jones Act claim, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.App. 688 (1982 ed., Supp. V), neither statutory scheme may be supplemented by an award of punitive damages under general maritime law. 816 F.2d 1345 (1987), modified, 866 F.2d 318 (1989). This holding is contrary to the Fifth Circuit's decision in In re Merry Shipping, Inc., 650 F.2d 622, 625-626 (1981), that punitive damages are available under general maritime law even when such a claim is joined with a Jones Act claim. The conflict should be resolved. 
 Tiller v. Fludd, No. 88-2088, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 872: The Eleventh Circuit held that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), prohibits the use of race-based peremptory challenges by an attorney in a civil action. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the trial court's participation in the exercise of the peremptory strikes provided the state action necessary to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. 863 F.2d 822 (1989). The Eighth Circuit has expressed "" 'strong doubts' "" whether Batson applies to civil actions, see Swapshire v. Baer, 865 F.2d 948, 953 (1989); Wilson v.

 Michael McMONAGLE, et al., petitioners,v. NORTHEAST WOMEN'S CENTER, INC. No. 88-2137. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 10, 1989
 Leave to File Petition for Rehearing Denied March 19, 1990. 
 See 494 U.S. 1050. 
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 A question presented in this case is whether liability under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C., 1961 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V), may be imposed where neither the "" enterprise"" nor the ""pattern of racketeering activity"" had any profit- making element. The Second and Eighth Circuits have held that it may not. United States v. Ivic, 700 F.2d 51, 58-65 (CA2 1983) (enterprise or predicate acts must have financial purpose); United States v. Flynn, 852 F.2d 1045, 1052 (CA8) (enterprise must be directed toward economic goal), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 974 (1988). The Third Circuit in this case upheld RICO liability despite the absence of any economic motivation on the part of the defendants. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict. 
 On the order list of October 2, 1989, the Court also denied certiorari in the following cases. 
 Norton v. United States, No. 88-1889, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871: The Eleventh Circuit held that law enforcement officers reasonably relied on warrants calling for the search and seizure of "" 'all corporate records . . . which are evidence and instrumentalities of the offense set forth in Section 1954 of Title 18 of the United States Code,' "" and that the evidence seized pursuant to that warrant was admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule articulated in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 
Page 493 U.S. 901 , 902
 897 (1984). 867 F.2d 1354, 1360 (1989). The decision of the Eleventh Circuit conflicts with the Tenth Circuit's decision that a warrant ordering the seizure of all records ""relating to the purchase, sale and illegal exportation of materials in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778, and the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C.App. 2410,"" was so facially overbroad that law enforcement officers could not reasonably rely on it, United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d 592, 594 (1988), and a similar decision of the Ninth Circuit suppressing evidence seized under a warrant seeking "" documents, books, ledgers, records and objects which are evidence of violations of federal criminal law,"" Center Art Galleries-Hawaii, Inc. v. United States, 875 F.2d 747, 749 (1989). The conflict should be resolved. 
 Bergen v. F/V St. Patrick, No. 88-1960, and Kidd v. F/V St. Patrick, No. 88-1762, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871: The Ninth Circuit held that where a Death on the High Seas Act claim, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U.S.C.App. 761 et seq. (1982 ed., Supp. V), is joined with a Jones Act claim, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C.App. 688 (1982 ed., Supp. V), neither statutory scheme may be supplemented by an award of punitive damages under general maritime law. 816 F.2d 1345 (1987), modified, 866 F.2d 318 (1989). This holding is contrary to the Fifth Circuit's decision in In re Merry Shipping, Inc., 650 F.2d 622, 625-626 (1981), that punitive damages are available under general maritime law even when such a claim is joined with a Jones Act claim. The conflict should be resolved.

 and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death penalty in this case. Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition to decide whether a court's failure either to inform a capital sentencing jury that it must consider mitigating evidence or to explain the concept of mitigation undermines a capital defendant's right to have the jury "" consider and give effect to any mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant's background and character or the circumstances of the crime."" Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 328, 2952 ( 1989).

I therefore would vacate petitioner's death sentences and remand for new sentencing. 
 Petitioner Johnny Watkins was convicted of murder in two separate proceedings and sentenced to death for both crimes. The same judge presided at both trials. At the sentencing phase of each trial, petitioner's counsel introduced mitigating evidence concerning Watkins' character and urged the jury to consider those factors that called for mercy. The judge's instructions in each case stated that the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of two aggravating circumstances: 
 ""(1) That, after consideration of the circumstances surrounding this offense or the prior history and background of the defendant, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society; or

 The instructions stated that each jury could sentence Watkins to death if it found that the State had proved the existence of one of the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt; alternatively, the jury could choose the punishment of life imprisonment if it believed ""from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified.""

 October 10, 1989
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
 Denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 There is a critical difference between a judgment of affirmance and an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari. The former determines the rights of the parties; the latter expresses no opinion on the merits of the case. [Footnote 1] Partly for that reason, and 
Page 493 U.S. 910 , 911
 partly because our certiorari docket is so crowded, the Court does not explain its reasons for entering such orders. There is, accordingly, a danger that an individual Justice's statement of his or her views respecting the denial of certiorari may be misleading or counterproductive. 2 Nevertheless, I am persuaded that a brief comment on this troublesome and unusual case is appropriate. 
 This is a capital case. It is one of 63 such cases that were considered at our conference during the week of September 25, 1989. Despite the contrary views that were once expressed,3 it is neither feasible nor wise for this Court to review the merits of every capital case in which the petitioner asks us to review the decision of a State's highest court. In many of these cases review of the federal constitutional issues is more effectively administered in federal habeas corpus proceedings. [Footnote 4] The burdens associated with the delay in the date of execution are more than offset by the benefit of complete and adequate review of the decision to impose a death sentence. 
 In this case, despite the fact that petitioner was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to death in 1981, the Federal District Court has not yet had an opportunity to review his federal constitutional claims. 5 The Indiana Supreme Court has, however, considered the validity of the death sentence on four different occasions. First, while the case was pending on direct review, the court unanimously granted the State's petition to remand the case to the trial judge to enable him to make the findings of fact that the Indiana statute requires to support a death sentence.

 Rehearing Denied Nov. 27, 1989. 
 See 493 U.S. 985. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether a defendant may be prevented from questioning prospective jurors regarding their ability to adhere to a state sentencing law that precludes jurors from considering the likelihood of parole in their decision whether to impose life imprisonment or death. 
Page 493 U.S. 876 , 877
 Both the Georgia Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit have held that such a limit on voir dire is constitutional. 259 Ga. 96, 101, 376 S.E.2d 851, 856 (1989); King v. Lynaugh, 850 F.2d 1055, 1060-1061 (CA5 1988). These decisions, however, cannot be squared with minimal due process requirements permitting a defendant to ensure that the jurors who sentence him consider only those factors that the State has deemed relevant to their decision. In the many States that prohibit jury consideration of parole, the Constitution demands that the defendant be allowed to test the jurors' ability to set that factor aside. 
 Jack Howard Potts was convicted of murder. During voir dire in his sentencing proceeding, several members of the venire volunteered the information that their decision whether to impose the death penalty would be significantly affected by their assessment of the likelihood of parole if they sentenced petitioner to life in prison. Georgia law forbids jurors to consider the possibility of parole during their deliberations. Ga.Code Ann. 17-8-76(a) (1982); Horton v. State, 249 Ga. 871, 873, 295 S.E.2d 281, 284 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1188, 74 L. Ed.2d 1030 (1983). Accordingly, the trial judge asked these jurors if they could make their sentencing decision without regard to the possibility of parole; some suggested that they could not. Petitioner sought to question other prospective jurors about the nature and strength of their attitudes about parole on the ground that they, too, might be unable to set such considerations aside. The court refused to permit the questioning. 
 During its subsequent deliberations, the jury requested information about Potts' eligibility for parole if it were to impose a life sentence. The court instructed the jury to ignore parole in its deliberations, and the jury recommended that Potts be sentenced to death. 
 A sentence of death is the most violent and final sanction the State can inflict. Jurors who are charged with deciding whether to impose this most serious sanction must make their decision on the basis of law, not on prejudices that operate to the defendant's detriment. If a court fails to permit a defendant to take all reasonable steps to ensure impartial jury deliberations, it undermines the legitimacy of the capital sentencing process and of the legal system itself. By refusing to permit Potts to explore the jurors' [493 U.S. 876 , 878]

The court refused to permit the questioning. 
 During its subsequent deliberations, the jury requested information about Potts' eligibility for parole if it were to impose a life sentence. The court instructed the jury to ignore parole in its deliberations, and the jury recommended that Potts be sentenced to death. 
 A sentence of death is the most violent and final sanction the State can inflict. Jurors who are charged with deciding whether to impose this most serious sanction must make their decision on the basis of law, not on prejudices that operate to the defendant's detriment. If a court fails to permit a defendant to take all reasonable steps to ensure impartial jury deliberations, it undermines the legitimacy of the capital sentencing process and of the legal system itself. By refusing to permit Potts to explore the jurors' [493 U.S. 876 , 878]

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death penalty in this case. Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition because it raises the recurring issue whether evidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct may be introduced at the sentencing stage of a capital trial. As I have noted before, see, e.g., Miranda v. California, 486 U.S. 1038 (1988) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Williams v. Lynaugh, 484 U.S. 935 (1987) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), the States' highest courts have reached varying conclusions on this issue. 
 In addition, the petition poses a second question of profound constitutional significance: whether a defendant's waiver of his [ Robertson v. California 493 U.S. 879 (1989) 
]
Page 493 U.S. 879 , 880
 
right to a jury in a capital sentencing proceeding is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent when no evidence indicates that he was aware of a state statute requiring the court to impose a life sentence if the sentencing jury failed to reach a unanimous decision. The California statute at issue here provides that ""[i]f the trier of fact [at the sentencing stage] is a jury and has been unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to what the penalty shall be, the court shall dismiss the jury and impose a punishment of confinement in state prison for life without possibility of parole."" 1977 Cal.Stats., ch. 316, 12. State high courts faced with the issue whether a defendant must be aware of similar capital sentencing provisions have reached differing conclusions. Compare Harris v. State, 295 Md. 329, 339-340, 455 A.2d 979, 984 (1983) (holding that a court must explain the effect of a jury deadlock for a waiver to be effective), with People v. Morgan, 112 Ill.2d 111, 141-142, 97 Ill.Dec. 430, 442-443, 492 N.E.2d 1303, 1315-1316 (1986) (holding that a court need only explain that a unanimous vote is required before a jury can impose the death penalty), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1101 (1987). 
 In 1978, a jury convicted Andrew Robertson of murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the California Supreme Court vacated that sentence and remanded the case to the trial court. 33 Cal.3d 21, 188 Cal. Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279 (1982). In a second sentencing proceeding, Robertson indicated his intention to waive his right to a jury. The court then asked him several questions in an attempt to ascertain if Robertson was aware of the effects of a waiver. At no time during the colloquy did the judge read or paraphrase the jury deadlock provision; instead, the court simply stated: ""You understand, also, that if you do waive jury and submit [your sentencing] to the Court, the Court will act solely. If you have a jury trial, before a verdict can be returned either way, it requires unanimous agreement of all twelve jurors; do you understand that ?"" Pet. for Cert. 8. Robertson answered that he understood and then waived his right to a sentencing jury. He was again sentenced to death; this time, the California Supreme Court affirmed. 
 Robertson now claims that his sentence should be overturned because his agreement to waive a jury in the second sentencing proceeding was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Petitioner concedes that the court's instruction was literally correct; if the jurors were not unanimous in recommending life imprisonment, they could not return a verdict to that effect.

Syllabus 
Appellees, state-employed health professionals and private nonprofit corporations providing abortion services, brought suit in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of a Missouri statute regulating the performance of abortions.  The statute, inter alia:  (1) sets forth ""findings"" in its preamble that ""[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,"" and that ""unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and wellbeing,""  1.205.1(1), (2), and requires that all state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this Court's precedents,  1.205.2; (2) specifies that a physician, prior to performing an abortion on any woman whom he has reason to believe is 20 or more weeks pregnant, must ascertain whether the fetus is ""viable"" by performing ""such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of [the fetus'] gestational age, weight, and lung maturity,""  188.029; (3) prohibits the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life,  188.210, 188.215; and (4) makes it unlawful to use public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of ""encouraging or counseling"" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life,  188.205, 188.210, 188.215.  The District Court struck down each of the above provisions, among others, and enjoined their enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the provisions in question violated this Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and subsequent cases.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
851 F.2d 1071, reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C, concluding that:
1. This Court need not pass on the constitutionality of the Missouri statute's preamble.  In invalidating the preamble, the Court of Appeals misconceived the meaning of the dictum in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 444, that ""a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions.""  
Page 492 U. S. 491
 That statement means only that a State could not ""justify"" any abortion regulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade on the ground that it embodied the State's view about when life begins.  The preamble does not, by its terms, regulate abortions or any other aspect of appellees' medical practice, and  1.205.2 can be interpreted to do no more than offer protections to unborn children in tort and probate law, which is permissible under Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 161-162.  This Court has emphasized that Roe implies no limitation on a State's authority to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464,  432 U. S. 474, and the preamble can be read simply to express that sort of value judgment.  The extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the state courts can definitively decide, and, until those courts have applied the preamble to restrict appellees' activities in some concrete way, it is inappropriate for federal courts to address its meaning.  Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450,  325 U. S. 460.  Pp.  492 U. S. 504-507.
2. The restrictions in  188.210 and 188.215 of the Missouri statute on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions do not contravene this Court's abortion decisions.  The Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government may not deprive the individual.  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U. S. 189,  489 U. S. 196.  Thus, in Maher v. Roe, supra; Poelker v. Doe, 432 U. S. 519; and Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, this Court upheld governmental regulations withholding public funds for nontherapeutic abortions but allowing payments for medical services related to childbirth, recognizing that a government's decision to favor childbirth over abortion through the allocation of public funds does not violate Roe v. Wade.  A State may implement that same value judgment through the allocation of other public resources, such as hospitals and medical staff.  There is no merit to the claim that Maher, Poelker, and McRae must be distinguished on the grounds that preventing access to a public facility narrows or forecloses the availability of abortion.  Just as in those cases, Missouri's decision to use public facilities and employees to encourage childbirth over abortion places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but leaves her with the same choices as if the State had decided not to operate any hospitals at all.  The challenged provisions restrict her ability to obtain an abortion only to the extent that she chooses to use a physician affiliated with a public hospital.  Also without merit is the assertion that 
Page 492 U. S. 492
 Maher, Poelker, and McRae must be distinguished on the ground that, since the evidence shows that all of a public facility's costs in providing abortion services are recouped when the patient pays, such that no public funds are expended, the Missouri statute goes beyond expressing a preference for childbirth over abortion by creating an obstacle to the right to choose abortion that cannot stand absent a compelling state interest.  Nothing in the Constitution requires States to enter or remain in the abortion business or entitles private physicians and their patients access to public facilities for the performance of abortions.  Indeed, if the State does recoup all of its costs in performing abortions and no state subsidy, direct or indirect, is available, it is difficult to see how any procreational choice is burdened by the State's ban on the use of its facilities or employees for performing abortions.  The cases in question all support the view that the State need not commit any resources to performing abortions, even if it can turn a profit by doing so.  Pp.  492 U. S. 507-511.
3. The controversy over  188.205's prohibition on the use of public funds to encourage or counsel a woman to have a nontherapeutic abortion is moot.  The Court of Appeals did not consider  188.205 separately from  188.210 and 188.215 -- which respectively prohibit the use of public employees and facilities for such counseling -- in holding all three sections unconstitutionally vague and violative of a woman's right to choose an abortion.  Missouri has appealed only the invalidation of  188.205.  In light of the State's claim, which this Court accepts for purposes of decision, that  188.205 is not directed at the primary conduct of physicians or health care providers, but is simply an instruction to the State's fiscal officers not to allocate public funds for abortion counseling, appellees contend that they are not ""adversely"" affected by the section, and therefore that there is no longer a case or controversy before the Court on this question.  Since plaintiffs are masters of their complaints even at the appellate stage, and since appellees no longer seek equitable relief on their  188.205 claim, the Court of Appeals is directed to vacate the District Court's judgment with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the complaint with prejudice.  Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193,  484 U. S. 200.  Pp.  492 U. S. 511-513.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Parts II-D and III that:
1. Section 188.029 of the Missouri statute -- which specifies, in its first sentence, that a physician, before performing an abortion on a woman he has reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks gestational age, shall first determine if the unborn child is viable by using that degree of care, skill, and proficiency that is commonly exercised by practitioners in the field; but which then provides, in its second sentence, that, in making the viability determination, the physician shall 
Page 492 U. S. 493
 perform such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the unborn child's gestational age, weight, and lung maturity -- is constitutional, since it permissibly furthers the State's interest in protecting potential human life.  Pp.  492 U. S. 513-521.
(a) The Court of Appeals committed plain error in reading  188.029 as requiring that, after 20 weeks, the specified tests must be performed.  That section makes sense only if its second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful in making subsidiary viability findings.  Reading the sentence to require the tests in all circumstances, including when the physician's reasonable professional judgment indicates that they would be irrelevant to determining viability or even dangerous to the mother and the fetus, would conflict with the first sentence's requirement that the physician apply his reasonable professional skill and judgment.  It would also be incongruous to read the provision, especially the word ""necessary,"" to require tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability.  Pp.  492 U. S. 514-515.
(b) Section 188.029 is reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where the fetus is viable.  The section's tests are intended to determine viability, the State having chosen viability as the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded.  The section creates what is essentially a presumption of viability at 20 weeks, which the physician, prior to performing an abortion, must rebut with tests -- including, if feasible, those for gestational age, fetal weight, and lung capacity -- indicating that the fetus is not viable.  While the District Court found that uncontradicted medical evidence established that a 20-week fetus is not viable, and that 23 1/2 to 24 weeks' gestation is the earliest point at which a reasonable possibility of viability exists, it also found that there may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age, which supports testing at 20 weeks.  Pp.  492 U. S. 515-516.
(c) Section 188.029 conflicts with Roe v. Wade and cases following it.  Since the section's tests will undoubtedly show in many cases that the fetus is not viable, the tests will have been performed for what were, in fact, second-trimester abortions.  While Roe, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 162, recognized the State's interest in protecting potential human life as ""important and legitimate,"" it also limited state involvement in second-trimester abortions to protecting maternal health, id. at  410 U. S. 164, and allowed States to regulate or proscribe abortions to protect the unborn child only after viability, id. at  410 U. S. 165.  Since the tests in question regulate the physician's discretion in determining the viability of the fetus,  188.029 conflicts with language in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379,  439 U. S. 388-389, stating that the viability determination is, and must be, a matter for the responsible attending physician's judgment.  And, in light of District Court findings that the tests increase the expenses of abortion, their validity 
Page 492 U. S. 494
 may also be questioned under Akron, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 434-435, which held that a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals was invalid because it substantially increased the expenses of those procedures.  Pp.  492 U. S. 516-517.
(d) The doubt cast on the Missouri statute by these cases is not so much a flaw in the statute as it is a reflection of the fact that Roe's rigid trimester analysis has proved to be unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.  In such circumstances, this Court does not refrain from reconsidering prior constitutional rulings, notwithstanding stare decisis. E.g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528.  The Roe framework is hardly consistent with the notion of a Constitution like ours that is cast in general terms and usually speaks in general principles.  The framework's key elements -- trimesters and viability -- are not found in the Constitution's text, and, since the bounds of the inquiry are essentially indeterminate, the result has been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations, rather than a body of constitutional doctrine.  There is also no reason why the State's compelling interest in protecting potential human life should not extend throughout pregnancy, rather than coming into existence only at the point of viability.  Thus, the Roe trimester framework should be abandoned.  Pp.  492 U. S. 517-520.
(e) There is no merit to JUSTICE BLACKMUN's contention that the Court should join in a ""great issues"" debate as to whether the Constitution includes an ""unenumerated"" general right to privacy as recognized in cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479.  Unlike Roe, Griswold did not purport to adopt a whole framework, complete with detailed rules and distinctions, to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest would apply.  The Roe framework sought to deal with areas of medical practice traditionally left to the States, and to balance once and for all, by reference only to the calendar, the State's interest in protecting potential human life against the claims of a pregnant woman to decide whether or not to abort.  The Court's experience in applying Roe in later cases suggests that there is wisdom in not necessarily attempting to elaborate the differences between a ""fundamental right"" to an abortion, Akron, supra, at  462 U. S. 420, n. 1, a ""limited fundamental constitutional right,"" post at  492 U. S. 555, or a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  Moreover, although this decision will undoubtedly allow more governmental regulation of abortion than was permissible before, the goal of constitutional adjudication is not to remove inexorably ""politically devisive"" issues from the ambit of the legislative process, but is, rather, to hold true the balance between that which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that which it does not.  Furthermore, the suggestion that legislative bodies, in a Nation 
Page 492 U. S. 495
 where more than half the population is female, will treat this decision as an invitation to enact abortion laws reminiscent of the dark ages misreads the decision and does scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who elect them.  Pp.  492 U. S. 520-521.
2. This case affords no occasion to disturb Roe's holding that a Texas statute which criminalized all nontherapeutic abortions unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion derived from the Due Process Clause.  Roe is distinguishable on its facts, since Missouri has determined that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded.  P.  492 U. S. 521.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, agreeing that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to interpret the second sentence of  188.029 as meaning that doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight, and lung maturity, concluded that the section was constitutional as properly interpreted by the plurality, and that the plurality should therefore not have proceeded to reconsider Roe v. Wade.  This Court refrains from deciding constitutional questions where there is no need to do so, and generally does not formulate a constitutional rule broader than the precise facts to which it is to be applied.  Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,  297 U. S. 346,  297 U. S. 347.  Since appellees did not appeal the District Court's ruling that the first sentence of  188.029 is constitutional, there is no dispute between the parties over the presumption of viability at 20 weeks created by that first sentence.  Moreover, as properly interpreted by the plurality, the section's second sentence does nothing more than delineate means by which the unchallenged 20-week presumption may be overcome if those means are useful in determining viability and can be prudently employed.  As so interpreted, the viability testing requirements do not conflict with any of the Court's abortion decisions.  As the plurality recognizes, under its interpretation of  188.029's second sentence, the viability testing requirements promote the State's interest in potential life.  This Court has recognized that a State may promote that interest when viability is possible.  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747,  476 U. S. 770-771.  Similarly, the basis for reliance by the lower courts on Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379,  439 U. S. 388-389, disappears when  188.029 is properly interpreted to require only subsidiary viability findings, since the State has not attempted to substitute its judgment for the physician's ascertainment of viability, which therefore remains ""the critical point.""  Nor does the marginal increase in the cost of an abortion created by  188.029's viability testing provision, as interpreted, conflict with Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 434-439, since, here, such costs do not place a ""heavy, and unnecessary burden"" on a woman's abortion decision, whereas the statutory requirement in Akron, which related to 
Page 492 U. S. 496
 previablity abortions, more than doubled a woman's costs.  Moreover, the statutory requirement in Akron involved second-trimester abortions generally;  188.029 concerns only tests and examinations to determine viability when viability is possible.  The State's compelling interest in potential life postviability renders its interest in determining the critical point of viability equally compelling.  Thornburgh, supra, at  476 U. S. 770-771.  When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns upon the constitutional validity of Roe, there will be time enough to reexamine Roe, and to do so carefully.  Pp.  492 U. S. 525-531.
JUSTICE SCALIA would reconsider and explicitly overrule Roe v. Wade.  Avoiding the Roe question by deciding this case in as narrow a manner as possible is not required by precedent and not justified by policy.  To do so is needlessly to prolong this Court's involvement in a field where the answers to the central questions are political, rather than juridical, and thus to make the Court the object of the sort of organized pressure that political institutions in a democracy ought to receive.  It is particularly perverse to decide this case as narrowly as possible in order to avoid reading the inexpressibly ""broader than was required by the precise facts"" structure established by Roe v. Wade.  The question of Roe's validity is presented here, inasmuch as  188.029 constitutes a legislative imposition on the judgment of the physician concerning the point of viability and increases the cost of an abortion.  It does palpable harm, if the States can and would eliminate largely unrestricted abortion, skillfully to refrain from telling them so.  Pp.  492 U. S. 532-537.

No. 88-605
Argued April 26, 1989
Decided July 3, 1989
492 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
Appellees, state-employed health professionals and private nonprofit corporations providing abortion services, brought suit in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of a Missouri statute regulating the performance of abortions.  The statute, inter alia:  (1) sets forth ""findings"" in its preamble that ""[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,"" and that ""unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and wellbeing,""  1.205.1(1), (2), and requires that all state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this Court's precedents,  1.205.2; (2) specifies that a physician, prior to performing an abortion on any woman whom he has reason to believe is 20 or more weeks pregnant, must ascertain whether the fetus is ""viable"" by performing ""such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of [the fetus'] gestational age, weight, and lung maturity,""  188.029; (3) prohibits the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life,  188.210, 188.215; and (4) makes it unlawful to use public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of ""encouraging or counseling"" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life,  188.205, 188.210, 188.215.  The District Court struck down each of the above provisions, among others, and enjoined their enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the provisions in question violated this Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and subsequent cases.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
851 F.2d 1071, reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C, concluding that:
1. This Court need not pass on the constitutionality of the Missouri statute's preamble.  In invalidating the preamble, the Court of Appeals misconceived the meaning of the dictum in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 444, that ""a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions.""  
Page 492 U. S. 491
 That statement means only that a State could not ""justify"" any abortion regulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade on the ground that it embodied the State's view about when life begins.  The preamble does not, by its terms, regulate abortions or any other aspect of appellees' medical practice, and  1.205.2 can be interpreted to do no more than offer protections to unborn children in tort and probate law, which is permissible under Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 161-162.  This Court has emphasized that Roe implies no limitation on a State's authority to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464,  432 U. S. 474, and the preamble can be read simply to express that sort of value judgment.  The extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the state courts can definitively decide, and, until those courts have applied the preamble to restrict appellees' activities in some concrete way, it is inappropriate for federal courts to address its meaning.  Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450,  325 U. S. 460.  Pp.  492 U. S. 504-507.
2. The restrictions in  188.210 and 188.215 of the Missouri statute on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions do not contravene this Court's abortion decisions.  The Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government may not deprive the individual.  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services, 489 U. S. 189,  489 U. S. 196.  Thus, in Maher v. Roe, supra; Poelker v. Doe, 432 U. S. 519; and Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, this Court upheld governmental regulations withholding public funds for nontherapeutic abortions but allowing payments for medical services related to childbirth, recognizing that a government's decision to favor childbirth over abortion through the allocation of public funds does not violate Roe v. Wade.  A State may implement that same value judgment through the allocation of other public resources, such as hospitals and medical staff.  There is no merit to the claim that Maher, Poelker, and McRae must be distinguished on the grounds that preventing access to a public facility narrows or forecloses the availability of abortion.  Just as in those cases, Missouri's decision to use public facilities and employees to encourage childbirth over abortion places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but leaves her with the same choices as if the State had decided not to operate any hospitals at all.  The challenged provisions restrict her ability to obtain an abortion only to the extent that she chooses to use a physician affiliated with a public hospital.  Also without merit is the assertion that 
Page 492 U. S. 492
 Maher, Poelker, and McRae must be distinguished on the ground that, since the evidence shows that all of a public facility's costs in providing abortion services are recouped when the patient pays, such that no public funds are expended, the Missouri statute goes beyond expressing a preference for childbirth over abortion by creating an obstacle to the right to choose abortion that cannot stand absent a compelling state interest.  Nothing in the Constitution requires States to enter or remain in the abortion business or entitles private physicians and their patients access to public facilities for the performance of abortions.  Indeed, if the State does recoup all of its costs in performing abortions and no state subsidy, direct or indirect, is available, it is difficult to see how any procreational choice is burdened by the State's ban on the use of its facilities or employees for performing abortions.  The cases in question all support the view that the State need not commit any resources to performing abortions, even if it can turn a profit by doing so.  Pp.  492 U. S. 507-511.
3. The controversy over  188.205's prohibition on the use of public funds to encourage or counsel a woman to have a nontherapeutic abortion is moot.  The Court of Appeals did not consider  188.205 separately from  188.210 and 188.215 -- which respectively prohibit the use of public employees and facilities for such counseling -- in holding all three sections unconstitutionally vague and violative of a woman's right to choose an abortion.  Missouri has appealed only the invalidation of  188.205.  In light of the State's claim, which this Court accepts for purposes of decision, that  188.205 is not directed at the primary conduct of physicians or health care providers, but is simply an instruction to the State's fiscal officers not to allocate public funds for abortion counseling, appellees contend that they are not ""adversely"" affected by the section, and therefore that there is no longer a case or controversy before the Court on this question.  Since plaintiffs are masters of their complaints even at the appellate stage, and since appellees no longer seek equitable relief on their  188.205 claim, the Court of Appeals is directed to vacate the District Court's judgment with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the complaint with prejudice.  Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193,  484 U. S. 200.  Pp.  492 U. S. 511-513.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE WHITE and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Parts II-D and III that:
1. Section 188.029 of the Missouri statute -- which specifies, in its first sentence, that a physician, before performing an abortion on a woman he has reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks gestational age, shall first determine if the unborn child is viable by using that degree of care, skill, and proficiency that is commonly exercised by practitioners in the field; but which then provides, in its second sentence, that, in making the viability determination, the physician shall 
Page 492 U. S. 493
 perform such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the unborn child's gestational age, weight, and lung maturity -- is constitutional, since it permissibly furthers the State's interest in protecting potential human life.  Pp.  492 U. S. 513-521.
(a) The Court of Appeals committed plain error in reading  188.029 as requiring that, after 20 weeks, the specified tests must be performed.  That section makes sense only if its second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful in making subsidiary viability findings.  Reading the sentence to require the tests in all circumstances, including when the physician's reasonable professional judgment indicates that they would be irrelevant to determining viability or even dangerous to the mother and the fetus, would conflict with the first sentence's requirement that the physician apply his reasonable professional skill and judgment.  It would also be incongruous to read the provision, especially the word ""necessary,"" to require tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability.  Pp.  492 U. S. 514-515.
(b) Section 188.029 is reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where the fetus is viable.  The section's tests are intended to determine viability, the State having chosen viability as the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded.  The section creates what is essentially a presumption of viability at 20 weeks, which the physician, prior to performing an abortion, must rebut with tests -- including, if feasible, those for gestational age, fetal weight, and lung capacity -- indicating that the fetus is not viable.  While the District Court found that uncontradicted medical evidence established that a 20-week fetus is not viable, and that 23 1/2 to 24 weeks' gestation is the earliest point at which a reasonable possibility of viability exists, it also found that there may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age, which supports testing at 20 weeks.  Pp.  492 U. S. 515-516.
(c) Section 188.029 conflicts with Roe v. Wade and cases following it.  Since the section's tests will undoubtedly show in many cases that the fetus is not viable, the tests will have been performed for what were, in fact, second-trimester abortions.  While Roe, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 162, recognized the State's interest in protecting potential human life as ""important and legitimate,"" it also limited state involvement in second-trimester abortions to protecting maternal health, id. at  410 U. S. 164, and allowed States to regulate or proscribe abortions to protect the unborn child only after viability, id. at  410 U. S. 165.  Since the tests in question regulate the physician's discretion in determining the viability of the fetus,  188.029 conflicts with language in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379,  439 U. S. 388-389, stating that the viability determination is, and must be, a matter for the responsible attending physician's judgment.  And, in light of District Court findings that the tests increase the expenses of abortion, their validity 
Page 492 U. S. 494
 may also be questioned under Akron, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 434-435, which held that a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals was invalid because it substantially increased the expenses of those procedures.  Pp.  492 U. S. 516-517.
(d) The doubt cast on the Missouri statute by these cases is not so much a flaw in the statute as it is a reflection of the fact that Roe's rigid trimester analysis has proved to be unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.  In such circumstances, this Court does not refrain from reconsidering prior constitutional rulings, notwithstanding stare decisis. E.g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528.  The Roe framework is hardly consistent with the notion of a Constitution like ours that is cast in general terms and usually speaks in general principles.  The framework's key elements -- trimesters and viability -- are not found in the Constitution's text, and, since the bounds of the inquiry are essentially indeterminate, the result has been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations, rather than a body of constitutional doctrine.  There is also no reason why the State's compelling interest in protecting potential human life should not extend throughout pregnancy, rather than coming into existence only at the point of viability.  Thus, the Roe trimester framework should be abandoned.  Pp.  492 U. S. 517-520.
(e) There is no merit to JUSTICE BLACKMUN's contention that the Court should join in a ""great issues"" debate as to whether the Constitution includes an ""unenumerated"" general right to privacy as recognized in cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479.  Unlike Roe, Griswold did not purport to adopt a whole framework, complete with detailed rules and distinctions, to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest would apply.  The Roe framework sought to deal with areas of medical practice traditionally left to the States, and to balance once and for all, by reference only to the calendar, the State's interest in protecting potential human life against the claims of a pregnant woman to decide whether or not to abort.  The Court's experience in applying Roe in later cases suggests that there is wisdom in not necessarily attempting to elaborate the differences between a ""fundamental right"" to an abortion, Akron, supra, at  462 U. S. 420, n. 1, a ""limited fundamental constitutional right,"" post at  492 U. S. 555, or a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.  Moreover, although this decision will undoubtedly allow more governmental regulation of abortion than was permissible before, the goal of constitutional adjudication is not to remove inexorably ""politically devisive"" issues from the ambit of the legislative process, but is, rather, to hold true the balance between that which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that which it does not.  Furthermore, the suggestion that legislative bodies, in a Nation 
Page 492 U. S. 495
 where more than half the population is female, will treat this decision as an invitation to enact abortion laws reminiscent of the dark ages misreads the decision and does scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who elect them.  Pp.  492 U. S. 520-521.
2. This case affords no occasion to disturb Roe's holding that a Texas statute which criminalized all nontherapeutic abortions unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion derived from the Due Process Clause.  Roe is distinguishable on its facts, since Missouri has determined that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded.  P.  492 U. S. 521.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, agreeing that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to interpret the second sentence of  188.029 as meaning that doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight, and lung maturity, concluded that the section was constitutional as properly interpreted by the plurality, and that the plurality should therefore not have proceeded to reconsider Roe v. Wade.  This Court refrains from deciding constitutional questions where there is no need to do so, and generally does not formulate a constitutional rule broader than the precise facts to which it is to be applied.  Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,  297 U. S. 346,  297 U. S. 347.  Since appellees did not appeal the District Court's ruling that the first sentence of  188.029 is constitutional, there is no dispute between the parties over the presumption of viability at 20 weeks created by that first sentence.  Moreover, as properly interpreted by the plurality, the section's second sentence does nothing more than delineate means by which the unchallenged 20-week presumption may be overcome if those means are useful in determining viability and can be prudently employed.  As so interpreted, the viability testing requirements do not conflict with any of the Court's abortion decisions.  As the plurality recognizes, under its interpretation of  188.029's second sentence, the viability testing requirements promote the State's interest in potential life.  This Court has recognized that a State may promote that interest when viability is possible.  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747,  476 U. S. 770-771.  Similarly, the basis for reliance by the lower courts on Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379,  439 U. S. 388-389, disappears when  188.029 is properly interpreted to require only subsidiary viability findings, since the State has not attempted to substitute its judgment for the physician's ascertainment of viability, which therefore remains ""the critical point.""  Nor does the marginal increase in the cost of an abortion created by  188.029's viability testing provision, as interpreted, conflict with Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 434-439, since, here, such costs do not place a ""heavy, and unnecessary burden"" on a woman's abortion decision, whereas the statutory requirement in Akron, which related to 
Page 492 U. S. 496
 previablity abortions, more than doubled a woman's costs.  Moreover, the statutory requirement in Akron involved second-trimester abortions generally;  188.029 concerns only tests and examinations to determine viability when viability is possible.  The State's compelling interest in potential life postviability renders its interest in determining the critical point of viability equally compelling.  Thornburgh, supra, at  476 U. S. 770-771.  When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns upon the constitutional validity of Roe, there will be time enough to reexamine Roe, and to do so carefully.  Pp.  492 U. S. 525-531.
JUSTICE SCALIA would reconsider and explicitly overrule Roe v. Wade.  Avoiding the Roe question by deciding this case in as narrow a manner as possible is not required by precedent and not justified by policy.  To do so is needlessly to prolong this Court's involvement in a field where the answers to the central questions are political, rather than juridical, and thus to make the Court the object of the sort of organized pressure that political institutions in a democracy ought to receive.  It is particularly perverse to decide this case as narrowly as possible in order to avoid reading the inexpressibly ""broader than was required by the precise facts"" structure established by Roe v. Wade.  The question of Roe's validity is presented here, inasmuch as  188.029 constitutes a legislative imposition on the judgment of the physician concerning the point of viability and increases the cost of an abortion.  It does palpable harm, if the States can and would eliminate largely unrestricted abortion, skillfully to refrain from telling them so.  Pp.  492 U. S. 532-537.

Greater Pittsburgh Chapter
No. 87-2050
Argued February 22, 1989
Decided July 3, 1989*
492 U.S. 573

Syllabus 
This litigation concerns the constitutionality of two recurring holiday displays located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh.  The first, a creche depicting the Christian nativity scene, was placed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, which is the ""main,"" ""most beautiful,"" and ""most public"" part of the courthouse.  The creche was donated by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic group, and bore a sign to that effect.  Its manger had at its crest an angel bearing a banner proclaiming ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo,"" meaning ""Glory to God in the Highest.""  The second of the holiday displays in question was an 18-foot Chanukah menorah or candelabrum, which was placed just outside the City-County Building next to the city's 45-foot decorated Christmas tree.  At the foot of the tree was a sign bearing the mayor's name and containing text declaring the city's ""salute to liberty.""  The menorah is owned by Chabad, a Jewish group, but is stored, erected, and removed each year by the city.  Respondents, the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and seven local residents, filed suit seeking permanently to enjoin the county from displaying the creche and the city from displaying the menorah on the ground that the displays violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to state governments by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, relying on Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, which held that a city's inclusion of a creche in its annual Christmas display in a private park did not violate the Establishment Clause.  The Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing Lynch v. Donnelly and holding that the creche and the menorah in the present case must be understood as an impermissible governmental endorsement of Christianity and Judaism under Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602. 
Page 492 U. S. 574

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded.
842 F.2d 655, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III-A, IV, and V, concluding that:
1. Under Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. at  403 U. S. 612, a ""practice which touches upon religion, if it is to be permissible under the Establishment Clause,"" must not, inter alia, ""advance [or] inhibit religion in its principal or primary effect.""  Although, in refining the definition of governmental action that unconstitutionally ""advances"" religion, the Court's subsequent decisions have variously spoken in terms of ""endorsement,"" ""favoritism,"" ""preference,"" or ""promotion,"" the essential principle remains the same:  the Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from ""making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community.""  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. at  465 U. S. 687 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).  Pp.  492 U. S. 589-594.
2. When viewed in its overall context, the creche display violates the Establishment Clause.  The creche angel's words endorse a patently Christian message:  Glory to God for the birth of Jesus Christ.  Moreover, in contrast to Lynch, nothing in the creche's setting detracts from that message.  Although the government may acknowledge Christmas as a cultural phenomenon, it may not observe it as a Christian holy day by suggesting that people praise God for the birth of Jesus.  Pp.  492 U. S. 598-602.
3. JUSTICE KENNEDY's reasons for permitting the creche on the Grand Staircase and his condemnation of the Court's reasons for deciding otherwise are unpersuasive.  Pp.  492 U. S. 602-613.
(a) History cannot legitimate practices like the creche display that demonstrate the government's allegiance to a particular sect or creed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 602-605.
(b) The question whether a particular practice would constitute governmental proselytization is much the same as the endorsement inquiry, except to the extent the proselytization test requires an ""obvious"" allegiance between the government and the favored sect.  This Court's decisions, however, impose no such burden on demonstrating that the government has favored a particular sect or creed, but, to the contrary, have required strict scrutiny of practices suggesting a denominational preference.  E.g., Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228,  456 U. S. 246.  Pp.  492 U. S. 605-609.
(c) The Constitution mandates that the government remain secular, rather than affiliating itself with religious beliefs or institutions, precisely in order to avoid discriminating against citizens on the basis of their religious faiths.  Thus, the claim that prohibiting government from celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday discriminates against Christians 
Page 492 U. S. 575
 in favor of nonadherents must fail, since it contradicts the fundamental premise of the Establishment Clause itself.  In contrast, confining the government's own Christmas celebration to the holiday's secular aspects does not favor the religious beliefs of non-Christians over those of Christians, but simply permits the government to acknowledge the holiday without expressing an impermissible allegiance to Christian beliefs.  Pp.  492 U. S. 610-613.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-B that the concurring and dissenting opinions in Lynch v. Donnelly set forth the proper analytical framework for determining whether the government's display of objects having religious significance improperly advances religion.  465 U.S. at  465 U. S. 687-694 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id. at  465 U. S. 694-726 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  Pp.  492 U. S. 594-597.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded in Part VI that the menorah display does not have the prohibited effect of endorsing religion, given its ""particular physical setting.""  Its combined display with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty does not impermissibly endorse both the Christian and Jewish faiths, but simply recognizes that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter holiday season, which has attained a secular status in our society.  The widely accepted view of the Christmas tree as the preeminent secular symbol of the Christmas season emphasizes this point.  The tree, moreover, by virtue of its size and central position in the display, is clearly the predominant element, and the placement of the menorah beside it is readily understood as simply a recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of celebrating the season.  The absence of a more secular alternative to the menorah negates the inference of endorsement.  Similarly, the presence of the mayor's sign confirms that, in the particular context, the government's association with a religious symbol does not represent sponsorship of religious beliefs, but simply a recognition of cultural diversity.  Given all these considerations, it is not sufficiently likely that a reasonable observer would view the combined display as an endorsement or disapproval of his individual religious choices.  Pp.  492 U. S. 613-621.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR also concluded that the city's display of a menorah, together with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, does not violate the Establishment Clause.  The Christmas tree, whatever its origins, is widely viewed today as a secular symbol of the Christmas holiday.  Although there may be certain secular aspects to Chanukah, it is primarily a religious holiday, and the menorah its central religious symbol and ritual object.  By including the menorah with the tree, however, and with the sign saluting liberty, the city conveyed a message of pluralism and freedom of belief during the holiday season, which, in this particular physical setting, could not be interpreted by a reasonable 
Page 492 U. S. 576
 observer as an endorsement of Judaism or Christianity or disapproval of alternative beliefs.  Pp.  492 U. S. 632-637.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that both the menorah display and the creche display are permissible under the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  492 U. S. 655-667.
(a) The test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612 -- which prohibits the ""principal or primary effect"" of a challenged governmental practice from either advancing or inhibiting religion -- when applied with the proper sensitivity to our traditions and case law, supports the conclusion that both the creche and the menorah are permissible displays in the context of the holiday season.  The requirement of neutrality inherent in the Lemon formulation does not require a relentless extirpation of all contact between government and religion.  Government policies of accommodation, acknowledgment, and support for religion are an accepted part of our political and cultural heritage, and the Establishment Clause permits government some latitude in recognizing the central role of religion in society.  Any approach less sensitive to our heritage would border on latent hostility to religion, as it would require government in all its multifaceted roles to acknowledge only the secular, to the exclusion, and so to the detriment, of the religious.  Thus, this Court's decisions disclose two principles limiting the government's ability to recognize and accommodate religion:  it may not coerce anyone to support or participate in any religion or its exercise; and it may not, in the guise of avoiding hostility or callous indifference, give direct benefits to a religion in such a degree that it, in fact, establishes a state religion or tends to do so.  In other words, the government may not place its weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion.  On the other hand, where the government's act of recognition or accommodation is passive and symbolic, any intangible benefit to religion is unlikely to present a realistic risk of establishment.  To determine whether there exists an establishment, or a tendency toward one, reference must be made to the other types of church-state contacts that have existed unchallenged throughout our history or that have been found permissible in our case law.  For example, Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, upheld a city's holiday display of a creche, and Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, held that a State's practice of employing a legislative chaplain was permissible.  Pp.  492 U. S. 655-663.
(b) In permitting the displays of the menorah and the creche, the city and county sought merely to ""celebrate the season,"" and to acknowledge the historical background and the religious as well as secular nature of the Chanukah and Christmas holidays.  This interest falls well within the tradition of governmental accommodation and acknowledgment of religion 
Page 492 U. S. 577
 that has marked our history from the beginning.  If government is to participate in its citizens' celebration of a holiday that contains both a secular and a religious component, enforced recognition of only the secular aspect would signify the callous indifference toward religious faith that our cases and traditions do not require; for by commemorating the holiday only as it is celebrated by nonadherents, the government would be refusing to acknowledge the plain fact, and the historical reality, that many of its citizens celebrate the religious aspects of the holiday as well.  There is no suggestion here that the government's power to coerce has been used to further Christianity or Judaism, or that the city or the county contributed money to further any one faith or intended to use the creche or the menorah to proselytize.  Thus, the creche and menorah are purely passive symbols of religious holidays, and their use is permissible under Lynch, supra.  If Marsh, supra, allows Congress and the state legislatures to begin each day with a state-sponsored prayer offered by a government-employed chaplain, a menorah or creche, displayed in the limited context of the holiday season, cannot be invalid.  The facts that, unlike the creche in Lynch, the menorah and creche at issue were both located on government property and were not surrounded by secular holiday paraphernalia are irrelevant, since the displays present no realistic danger of moving the government down the forbidden road toward an establishment of religion.  Pp.  492 U. S. 663-667.

			"|"County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union,
Greater Pittsburgh Chapter
No. 87-2050
Argued February 22, 1989
Decided July 3, 1989*
492 U.S. 573

Syllabus 
This litigation concerns the constitutionality of two recurring holiday displays located on public property in downtown Pittsburgh.  The first, a creche depicting the Christian nativity scene, was placed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, which is the ""main,"" ""most beautiful,"" and ""most public"" part of the courthouse.  The creche was donated by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic group, and bore a sign to that effect.  Its manger had at its crest an angel bearing a banner proclaiming ""Gloria in Excelsis Deo,"" meaning ""Glory to God in the Highest.""  The second of the holiday displays in question was an 18-foot Chanukah menorah or candelabrum, which was placed just outside the City-County Building next to the city's 45-foot decorated Christmas tree.  At the foot of the tree was a sign bearing the mayor's name and containing text declaring the city's ""salute to liberty.""  The menorah is owned by Chabad, a Jewish group, but is stored, erected, and removed each year by the city.  Respondents, the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and seven local residents, filed suit seeking permanently to enjoin the county from displaying the creche and the city from displaying the menorah on the ground that the displays violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to state governments by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court denied relief, relying on Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, which held that a city's inclusion of a creche in its annual Christmas display in a private park did not violate the Establishment Clause.  The Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing Lynch v. Donnelly and holding that the creche and the menorah in the present case must be understood as an impermissible governmental endorsement of Christianity and Judaism under Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602. 
Page 492 U. S. 574

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded.
842 F.2d 655, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III-A, IV, and V, concluding that:
1. Under Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. at  403 U. S. 612, a ""practice which touches upon religion, if it is to be permissible under the Establishment Clause,"" must not, inter alia, ""advance [or] inhibit religion in its principal or primary effect.""  Although, in refining the definition of governmental action that unconstitutionally ""advances"" religion, the Court's subsequent decisions have variously spoken in terms of ""endorsement,"" ""favoritism,"" ""preference,"" or ""promotion,"" the essential principle remains the same:  the Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from ""making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community.""  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. at  465 U. S. 687 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).  Pp.  492 U. S. 589-594.
2. When viewed in its overall context, the creche display violates the Establishment Clause.  The creche angel's words endorse a patently Christian message:  Glory to God for the birth of Jesus Christ.  Moreover, in contrast to Lynch, nothing in the creche's setting detracts from that message.  Although the government may acknowledge Christmas as a cultural phenomenon, it may not observe it as a Christian holy day by suggesting that people praise God for the birth of Jesus.  Pp.  492 U. S. 598-602.
3. JUSTICE KENNEDY's reasons for permitting the creche on the Grand Staircase and his condemnation of the Court's reasons for deciding otherwise are unpersuasive.  Pp.  492 U. S. 602-613.
(a) History cannot legitimate practices like the creche display that demonstrate the government's allegiance to a particular sect or creed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 602-605.
(b) The question whether a particular practice would constitute governmental proselytization is much the same as the endorsement inquiry, except to the extent the proselytization test requires an ""obvious"" allegiance between the government and the favored sect.  This Court's decisions, however, impose no such burden on demonstrating that the government has favored a particular sect or creed, but, to the contrary, have required strict scrutiny of practices suggesting a denominational preference.  E.g., Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228,  456 U. S. 246.  Pp.  492 U. S. 605-609.
(c) The Constitution mandates that the government remain secular, rather than affiliating itself with religious beliefs or institutions, precisely in order to avoid discriminating against citizens on the basis of their religious faiths.  Thus, the claim that prohibiting government from celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday discriminates against Christians 
Page 492 U. S. 575
 in favor of nonadherents must fail, since it contradicts the fundamental premise of the Establishment Clause itself.  In contrast, confining the government's own Christmas celebration to the holiday's secular aspects does not favor the religious beliefs of non-Christians over those of Christians, but simply permits the government to acknowledge the holiday without expressing an impermissible allegiance to Christian beliefs.  Pp.  492 U. S. 610-613.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III-B that the concurring and dissenting opinions in Lynch v. Donnelly set forth the proper analytical framework for determining whether the government's display of objects having religious significance improperly advances religion.  465 U.S. at  465 U. S. 687-694 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id. at  465 U. S. 694-726 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).  Pp.  492 U. S. 594-597.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concluded in Part VI that the menorah display does not have the prohibited effect of endorsing religion, given its ""particular physical setting.""  Its combined display with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty does not impermissibly endorse both the Christian and Jewish faiths, but simply recognizes that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter holiday season, which has attained a secular status in our society.  The widely accepted view of the Christmas tree as the preeminent secular symbol of the Christmas season emphasizes this point.  The tree, moreover, by virtue of its size and central position in the display, is clearly the predominant element, and the placement of the menorah beside it is readily understood as simply a recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of celebrating the season.  The absence of a more secular alternative to the menorah negates the inference of endorsement.  Similarly, the presence of the mayor's sign confirms that, in the particular context, the government's association with a religious symbol does not represent sponsorship of religious beliefs, but simply a recognition of cultural diversity.  Given all these considerations, it is not sufficiently likely that a reasonable observer would view the combined display as an endorsement or disapproval of his individual religious choices.  Pp.  492 U. S. 613-621.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR also concluded that the city's display of a menorah, together with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, does not violate the Establishment Clause.  The Christmas tree, whatever its origins, is widely viewed today as a secular symbol of the Christmas holiday.  Although there may be certain secular aspects to Chanukah, it is primarily a religious holiday, and the menorah its central religious symbol and ritual object.  By including the menorah with the tree, however, and with the sign saluting liberty, the city conveyed a message of pluralism and freedom of belief during the holiday season, which, in this particular physical setting, could not be interpreted by a reasonable

 observer as an endorsement of Judaism or Christianity or disapproval of alternative beliefs.  Pp.  492 U. S. 632-637.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that both the menorah display and the creche display are permissible under the Establishment Clause.  Pp.  492 U. S. 655-667.
(a) The test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612 -- which prohibits the ""principal or primary effect"" of a challenged governmental practice from either advancing or inhibiting religion -- when applied with the proper sensitivity to our traditions and case law, supports the conclusion that both the creche and the menorah are permissible displays in the context of the holiday season.  The requirement of neutrality inherent in the Lemon formulation does not require a relentless extirpation of all contact between government and religion.  Government policies of accommodation, acknowledgment, and support for religion are an accepted part of our political and cultural heritage, and the Establishment Clause permits government some latitude in recognizing the central role of religion in society.

Thus, this Court's decisions disclose two principles limiting the government's ability to recognize and accommodate religion:  it may not coerce anyone to support or participate in any religion or its exercise; and it may not, in the guise of avoiding hostility or callous indifference, give direct benefits to a religion in such a degree that it, in fact, establishes a state religion or tends to do so.  In other words, the government may not place its weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion.  On the other hand, where the government's act of recognition or accommodation is passive and symbolic, any intangible benefit to religion is unlikely to present a realistic risk of establishment.  To determine whether there exists an establishment, or a tendency toward one, reference must be made to the other types of church-state contacts that have existed unchallenged throughout our history or that have been found permissible in our case law.  For example, Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, upheld a city's holiday display of a creche, and Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, held that a State's practice of employing a legislative chaplain was permissible.  Pp.  492 U. S. 655-663.
(b) In permitting the displays of the menorah and the creche, the city and county sought merely to ""celebrate the season,"" and to acknowledge the historical background and the religious as well as secular nature of the Chanukah and Christmas holidays.

No. 88-6801
Decided July 3, 1989
492 U.S. 680

Syllabus 
Under Texas law, an individual may not be sentenced to death unless the State proves that there is a probability that he would commit future acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  Following petitioner Powell's arrest for capital murder, a state trial court ordered that a psychiatric examination be conducted to determine his competency to stand trial and sanity at the time of the offenses.  Neither he nor his counsel was notified that he would be examined on the issue of future dangerousness, and he was not informed of his right to remain silent.  He was convicted.  At his sentencing hearing, the doctors who had examined him testified on the issue of future dangerousness, and he was sentenced to death.  The Court of Appeals declined to vacate the sentence, holding that, by introducing psychiatric testimony in support of an insanity defense, Powell had waived his Fifth and Sixth Amendment right to object to the State's use of the testimony, inter alia, to satisfy its burden of proving future dangerousness.
Held:  The evidence of future dangerousness was taken in deprivation of Powell's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel.  Under Estelle v. Smith, 451 U. S. 454, and Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249, once a defendant is formally charged, the right to counsel precludes a psychiatric examination concerning future dangerousness without notice to counsel.  The lower court's holding that Powell waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination provides no basis for concluding that he waived this separate Sixth Amendment right, and the court erred in conflating the two Amendments' analyses.
Certiorari granted; 767 S.W.2d 75, reversed.

|492 u.s. 408|"Brendale v. Confederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation
No. 87-1622
Argued January 10, 1989
Decided June 29, 1989*
492 U.S. 408

Syllabus 
The treaty between the United States and the Yakima Indian Nation (Yakima Nation or Tribe) provided that the Tribe would retain its reservation for its ""exclusive use and benefit,"" and that ""no white man [shall] be permitted to reside upon the said reservation without [the Tribe's] permission.""  Much of the reservation is located in Yakima County, Washington.  Roughly 80 of the reservation land is held in trust by the United States for the Tribe or its individual members, and the remaining 20 is owned in fee by Indian or non-Indian owners.  Most of the fee land is found in three towns, and the rest is scattered throughout the reservation in a ""checkerboard"" pattern.  The reservation is divided into two parts:  a ""closed area,"" which is so named because it has been closed to the general public, and an ""open area,"" which is not so restricted.  Only a small portion of the closed area consists of fee land, while almost half of the open area is fee land.  The Tribe's zoning ordinance applies to all lands within the reservation, including fee lands owned by Indians or non-Indians, while the county's zoning ordinance applies to all lands within its boundaries, except for Indian trust lands.  Petitioners Brendale and Wilkinson (hereinafter petitioners), who own land in the closed and open areas respectively, filed applications with the Yakima County Planning Department to develop their lands in ways not permitted by the Tribe's ordinance but permitted by the county ordinance.  The department issued declarations to both petitioners which, in effect, authorized their developments, and the Tribe appealed the declarations to the county board of commissioners on the ground, inter alia, that the county had no zoning authority over the land in question.  After the board concluded that the appeals were properly before it and issued decisions, the Tribe filed separate actions in District Court challenging the proposed developments and seeking declaratory judgments that the Tribe had exclusive 
Page 492 U. S. 409
 authority to zone the properties at issue and injunctions barring any county action inconsistent with the Tribe's ordinance.  The court held that the Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over the Brendale property but lacked authority over the Wilkinson property, concluding that Brendale's proposed development, but not Wilkinson's, posed a threat to the Tribe's political integrity, economic security, and health and welfare, and therefore was impermissible under Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544.  The court also determined that the county was preempted from exercising concurrent zoning authority over closed area lands because its interests in regulating those lands were minimal, while the Tribe's were substantial.  The Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and affirmed as to the Brendale property but reversed as to the Wilkinson property.  In upholding the Tribe's zoning authority, the court concluded that, because fee land is located throughout the reservation in a checkerboard pattern, denying the Tribe its right under its local governmental police power to zone fee land would destroy its capacity to engage in comprehensive planning.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
828 F.2d 529:  No. 87-1622, affirmed; Nos. 87-1697 and 87-1711, reversed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, announced the judgment of the Court in Nos. 87-1697 and 87-1711, concluding that:
1. The Tribe does not have authority to zone fee lands owned by nonmembers within the reservation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 421-433.
(a) Any regulatory power the Tribe might have under its treaty with the United States cannot apply to lands held in fee by non-Indians.  Montana, 450 U.S. at  450 U. S. 559.  The Tribe no longer retains the ""exclusive use and benefit"" of such lands within the meaning of the treaty, since the Indian General Allotment Act allotted significant portions of the reservation, including the lands at issue, to individual members of the Tribe, and those lands subsequently passed, through sale or inheritance, to nonmembers such as petitioners.  The Tribe's treaty rights must be read in light of those subsequent alienations, it being unlikely that Congress intended to subject non-Indian purchasers to tribal jurisdiction when an avowed purpose of the allotment policy was to destroy tribal government.  Id. at  450 U. S. 560, n. 9,  450 U. S. 561.  The fact that the Allotment Act was repudiated in 1934 by the Indian Reorganization Act is irrelevant, since the latter Act did not restore exclusive use of the lands in question to the Tribe.  Id. at  450 U. S. 560, n. 9. Pp.   492 U. S. 422-425.
(b) Nor does the Tribe derive authority from its inherent sovereignty to impose its zoning ordinance on petitioners' lands.  Such sovereignty generally extends only to what is necessary to protect tribal self-government

 or to control internal relations, and is divested to the extent it is inconsistent with a tribe's dependent status -- i.e., to the extent it involves the tribe's external relations with nonmembers -- unless there has been an express congressional delegation of tribal power to the contrary.  Montana, supra, at  450 U. S. 564.  Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U. S. 134,  447 U. S. 153; and United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,  435 U. S. 326, reconciled.  There is no contention here that Congress has expressly delegated to the Tribe the power to zone the fee lands of nonmembers.  Pp.  492 U. S. 425-428.
(c) Although Montana, supra, at  450 U. S. 666, recognized, as an exception to its general principle, that a tribe ""may"" retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the tribe's political integrity, economic security, or health and welfare, that exception does not create tribal authority to zone reservation lands.  The fact that the exception is prefaced by the word ""may"" indicates that a tribe's authority need not extend to all conduct having the specified effects, but, instead, depends on the circumstances.  A literal application of the exception would make little sense in the present circumstances.  To hold that the Tribe has authority to zone fee land when the activity on that land has the specified effects on Indian properties would mean that the authority would last only so long as the threatened use continued, would revert to the county when that use ceased, and, conceivably, could switch back and forth depending on what uses the county permitted, thereby engendering uncertainty that would further neither the Tribe's nor the county's interests, and would be chaotic for landowners.  Accordingly, Montana should be understood to generally prohibit tribes from regulating the use of fee lands by way of tribal ordinance or actions in the tribal courts, but to recognize, in the special circumstances of checkerboard ownership of reservation lands, a protectible tribal interest under federal law, defined in terms of a demonstrably serious impact by the challenged uses that imperils tribal political integrity, economic security, or health and welfare.  Since the Supremacy Clause requires state and local governments, including the county's zoning authorities, to recognize and respect that interest in the course of their activities, the Tribe should have argued in the zoning proceedings, not that the county was without zoning authority over reservation fee land, but that its tribal interests were imperiled.  The District Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Tribe's suit, but, given that the county has jurisdiction to zone reservation fee lands, could enjoin county action only if the county failed to respect the Tribe's federal law rights.  Pp.  492 U. S. 428-432.
2. In light of the District Court's findings that the county's exercise of zoning power over the Wilkinson property would have no direct effect on 
Page 492 U. S. 411
 the Tribe and would not threaten its political integrity, economic security, or health and welfare, the judgment in No. 87-1697 and 87-1711 must be reversed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 432-433.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, announced the judgment of the Court in No. 87-1622 and concurred in the judgment in Nos. 87-1697 and 87-1711, concluding that:
1. The Tribe's power to exclude nonmembers from its reservation -- which derived from its aboriginal sovereignty and the express provisions of its treaty with the United States -- necessarily includes the lesser power to regulate land use in the interest of protecting the tribal community.  Although, at one time, the Tribe's power to exclude was virtually absolute, the General Allotment Act (Dawes Act) in some respects diminished tribal authority by providing for the allotment of reservation lands in severalty to resident Indians, who were eventually free to sell to nonmembers.  While the Indian Reorganization Act repudiated that allotment policy, large portions of reservation lands were conveyed to nonmembers in the interim.  To the extent that large portions of reservation land were sold in fee, such that the Tribe could no longer determine the region's essential character by setting conditions on entry to those parcels, the Tribe's legitimate interest in land use regulation was also diminished.  Although it is inconceivable that Congress would have intended that the sale of a few lots would divest the Tribe of the power to determine the character of the region, it is equally improbable that Congress envisioned that the Tribe would retain its interest in regulating the use of vast ranges of land sold in fee to nonmembers who lack any voice in setting tribal policy.  Thus, the resolution of these cases depends on the extent to which the Tribe's virtually absolute power to exclude has been either diminished by statute or voluntarily surrendered by the Tribe itself with respect to the relevant areas of the reservation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 433-437
2. The Tribe has the power to zone the Brendale property, which is in the reservation's closed area.  Although the presence of logging operations, the construction of Bureau of Indian Affairs roads, and the transfer of ownership of a relatively insignificant amount of land in that area unquestionably have diminished the Tribe's power to exclude non-Indians from the area, this does not justify the conclusion that the Tribe has surrendered its historic right to regulate land use there.  To the contrary, by maintaining the power to exclude nonmembers from entering all but a small portion of that area, the Tribe has preserved the power to define the area's essential character, and has, in fact, exercised that power through its zoning ordinance.  Moreover, the Tribe has authority to prevent the few individuals who own portions of the closed area in fee from undermining its general plan to preserve the area's 
Page 492 U. S. 412
 unique character by developing their isolated parcels without regard to an otherwise common scheme.  It seems necessary to a reasonable operation of the allotment process that Congress could not possibly have intended in enacting the Dawes Act that tribes would lose control over the character of their reservations upon the sale of a few, relatively small parcels of lands.  Cf. Superintendent of Washington State Penitentiary, 368 U. S. 351,  368 U. S. 356; Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U. S. 481,  412 U. S. 497.  Rather, the tribes' power to zone is like an equitable servitude in that the burden of complying with the zoning rules runs with the land without regard to how a particular estate is transferred.  Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, does not require a different result, since, unlike the tribal regulation considered in that case, the Yakima Nation's zoning rule is neutrally applied to Indians and non-Indians alike, is necessary to protect the welfare of the Tribe, and does not interfere with any significant state or county interest.  Pp.  492 U. S. 438-444.
3. The Tribe lacks authority to zone the Wilkinson property, which is in the reservation's open area.  Given that about half of the open area land is owned by nonmembers, the Tribe no longer possesses the power to determine the basic character of that area, and allowing a nonmember to use his lands in a manner that might not be approved by the Tribe does not upset an otherwise coherent scheme of land use.  Moreover, it is unlikely that Congress intended to give the Tribe the power to determine the character of an area that is predominately owned and populated by nonmembers, who represent 80% of the population, yet lack a voice in tribal governance.  Furthermore, to the extent the open area has lost its character as an exclusive tribal resource, and has become, as a practical matter, an integrated portion of the county that is not economically or culturally delimited by reservation boundaries, the Tribe has lost any claim to an interest analogous to an equitable servitude.  Thus, the Tribe's power to zone the open area has become outmoded.  Pp.  492 U. S. 444-447.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL,  concurred in the judgment in No. 87-1622, concluding that an Indian tribe's power to zone reservation lands, once it chooses to exercise that power, is exclusive.  Thus, the county lacks authority to zone the Yakima Nation's reservation lands, including fee lands, in both the open and closed areas.  Pp.  492 U. S. 448-468.
(a) Under all of the Court's decisions dealing with the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes, including Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, tribes retain the inherent authority to exercise civil jurisdiction over non-Indian activities on reservation lands, including the power to zone fee lands, where those non-Indian activities implicate significant tribal interests.  Moreover, this Court's decisions and common sense  
Page 492 U. S. 413
 compel a finding that a tribe has zoning authority over all the lands within it reservation, and not just those in ""closed"" areas.  Pp.  492 U. S. 449-465.
(b) Although the States have concurrent authority to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indian activities on reservation lands in some circumstances, this authority is preempted if its exercise would do violence to the right of either sovereign.  Concurrent zoning jurisdiction, by its very nature, is unworkable, since it has the practical effect of nullifying the efforts of both sovereigns to establish comprehensive plans in every instance where the two establish different permissible land uses for the same tract.  Pp.  492 U. S. 465-468.

			"|"Brendale v. Confederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation
No. 87-1622
Argued January 10, 1989
Decided June 29, 1989*
492 U.S. 408

Syllabus 
The treaty between the United States and the Yakima Indian Nation (Yakima Nation or Tribe) provided that the Tribe would retain its reservation for its ""exclusive use and benefit,"" and that ""no white man [shall] be permitted to reside upon the said reservation without [the Tribe's] permission.""  Much of the reservation is located in Yakima County, Washington.  Roughly 80 of the reservation land is held in trust by the United States for the Tribe or its individual members, and the remaining 20 is owned in fee by Indian or non-Indian owners.  Most of the fee land is found in three towns, and the rest is scattered throughout the reservation in a ""checkerboard"" pattern.  The reservation is divided into two parts:  a ""closed area,"" which is so named because it has been closed to the general public, and an ""open area,"" which is not so restricted.  Only a small portion of the closed area consists of fee land, while almost half of the open area is fee land.  The Tribe's zoning ordinance applies to all lands within the reservation, including fee lands owned by Indians or non-Indians, while the county's zoning ordinance applies to all lands within its boundaries, except for Indian trust lands.  Petitioners Brendale and Wilkinson (hereinafter petitioners), who own land in the closed and open areas respectively, filed applications with the Yakima County Planning Department to develop their lands in ways not permitted by the Tribe's ordinance but permitted by the county ordinance.  The department issued declarations to both petitioners which, in effect, authorized their developments, and the Tribe appealed the declarations to the county board of commissioners on the ground, inter alia, that the county had no zoning authority over the land in question.  After the board concluded that the appeals were properly before it and issued decisions, the Tribe filed separate actions in District Court challenging the proposed developments and seeking declaratory judgments that the Tribe had exclusive 
Page 492 U. S. 409
 authority to zone the properties at issue and injunctions barring any county action inconsistent with the Tribe's ordinance.  The court held that the Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over the Brendale property but lacked authority over the Wilkinson property, concluding that Brendale's proposed development, but not Wilkinson's, posed a threat to the Tribe's political integrity, economic security, and health and welfare, and therefore was impermissible under Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544.  The court also determined that the county was preempted from exercising concurrent zoning authority over closed area lands because its interests in regulating those lands were minimal, while the Tribe's were substantial.  The Court of Appeals consolidated the cases and affirmed as to the Brendale property but reversed as to the Wilkinson property.  In upholding the Tribe's zoning authority, the court concluded that, because fee land is located throughout the reservation in a checkerboard pattern, denying the Tribe its right under its local governmental police power to zone fee land would destroy its capacity to engage in comprehensive planning.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
828 F.2d 529:  No. 87-1622, affirmed; Nos. 87-1697 and 87-1711, reversed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, announced the judgment of the Court in Nos. 87-1697 and 87-1711, concluding that:
1. The Tribe does not have authority to zone fee lands owned by nonmembers within the reservation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 421-433.
(a) Any regulatory power the Tribe might have under its treaty with the United States cannot apply to lands held in fee by non-Indians.  Montana, 450 U.S. at  450 U. S. 559.  The Tribe no longer retains the ""exclusive use and benefit"" of such lands within the meaning of the treaty, since the Indian General Allotment Act allotted significant portions of the reservation, including the lands at issue, to individual members of the Tribe, and those lands subsequently passed, through sale or inheritance, to nonmembers such as petitioners.  The Tribe's treaty rights must be read in light of those subsequent alienations, it being unlikely that Congress intended to subject non-Indian purchasers to tribal jurisdiction when an avowed purpose of the allotment policy was to destroy tribal government.  Id. at  450 U. S. 560, n. 9,  450 U. S. 561.  The fact that the Allotment Act was repudiated in 1934 by the Indian Reorganization Act is irrelevant, since the latter Act did not restore exclusive use of the lands in question to the Tribe.  Id. at  450 U. S. 560, n. 9. Pp.   492 U. S. 422-425.
(b) Nor does the Tribe derive authority from its inherent sovereignty to impose its zoning ordinance on petitioners' lands.  Such sovereignty generally extends only to what is necessary to protect tribal self-government

 or to control internal relations, and is divested to the extent it is inconsistent with a tribe's dependent status -- i.e., to the extent it involves the tribe's external relations with nonmembers -- unless there has been an express congressional delegation of tribal power to the contrary.  Montana, supra, at  450 U. S. 564.  Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U. S. 134,  447 U. S. 153; and United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,  435 U. S. 326, reconciled.  There is no contention here that Congress has expressly delegated to the Tribe the power to zone the fee lands of nonmembers.  Pp.  492 U. S. 425-428.
(c) Although Montana, supra, at  450 U. S. 666, recognized, as an exception to its general principle, that a tribe ""may"" retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the tribe's political integrity, economic security, or health and welfare, that exception does not create tribal authority to zone reservation lands.  The fact that the exception is prefaced by the word ""may"" indicates that a tribe's authority need not extend to all conduct having the specified effects, but, instead, depends on the circumstances.  A literal application of the exception would make little sense in the present circumstances.  To hold that the Tribe has authority to zone fee land when the activity on that land has the specified effects on Indian properties would mean that the authority would last only so long as the threatened use continued, would revert to the county when that use ceased, and, conceivably, could switch back and forth depending on what uses the county permitted, thereby engendering uncertainty that would further neither the Tribe's nor the county's interests, and would be chaotic for landowners.

2. In light of the District Court's findings that the county's exercise of zoning power over the Wilkinson property would have no direct effect on 
Page 492 U. S. 411
 the Tribe and would not threaten its political integrity, economic security, or health and welfare, the judgment in No. 87-1697 and 87-1711 must be reversed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 432-433.

Decided June 29, 1989
492 U.S. 469

Syllabus 
Resolution 66-156 of the State University of New York (SUNY) prohibits private commercial enterprises from operating in SUNY facilities.  After the resolution was applied by campus police to bar American Future Systems, Inc. (AFS), from demonstrating and selling its housewares at a party hosted in a student dormitory, respondent Fox and other students sued for a declaratory judgment that such action violated the First Amendment.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the resolution but, after a trial, found for SUNY on the ground that its dormitories did not constitute a public forum for purposes of commercial activity, and that the restrictions on speech were reasonable in light of the dormitories' purpose.  Viewing the challenged application of the resolution as a restriction on commercial speech, and therefore applying the test articulated in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, 447 U. S. 557, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was unclear whether the resolution directly advanced the State's asserted interests and whether, if it did, it was the least restrictive means to that end.  The court therefore reversed and remanded to the trial court.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the District Court to apply a least restrictive means test to Resolution 66-156.  Pp.  492 U. S. 473-481.
(a) The AFS parties the students seek to hold propose a commercial transaction, and therefore constitute commercial speech.  Although they also touch upon other subjects, such as how to be financially responsible and run an efficient home, this does not render them noncommercial in their entirety on the theory that fully protected, educational speech and commercial speech are ""inextricably intertwined.""  Riley v. National Federation of Blind of North Carolina, Inc., 487 U. S. 781, distinguished.  Pp.  492 U. S. 473-475
(b) Although Central Hudson and other decisions have occasionally contained statements suggesting that government restrictions on commercial speech must constitute the least restrictive means of achieving the governmental interests asserted, those decisions have never required that the restriction be absolutely the least severe that will 
Page 492 U. S. 470
 achieve the desired end.  Rather, the decisions require only a reasonable ""fit"" between the government's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.  See, e.g., Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328,  478 U. S. 341; In re R. M.J., 455 U. S. 191,  455 U. S. 203.  So long as the means are narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective, it is for governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may be employed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 475-481.
2. Respondents' overbreadth claim -- which is based on the assertion that Resolution 66-156 impermissibly prohibits their fully protected, noncommercial speech -- is not ripe for resolution in this Court.  Pp.  492 U. S. 481-486.
(a) Although overbreadth analysis does not normally apply to commercial speech, Resolution 66-156 must be deemed to reach some noncommercial speech in light of evidence that it prohibits for-profit job counseling, tutoring, legal advice, and medical consultation in students' dormitory rooms.  While such conduct consists of speech for profit, it does not satisfy the definition of commercial speech, since it does not propose a commercial transaction.  Pp.  492 U. S. 481-482.
(b) The overbreadth doctrine was designed as a departure from traditional rules of standing, enabling persons who are themselves unharmed by a statute to challenge it facially on the ground that it may be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.  Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601,  413 U. S. 610,  413 U. S. 613.  Respondents' invocation of the doctrine is unusual because the asserted extensions of Resolution 66-156 beyond commercial speech that are the basis for their challenge are not hypothetical applications to third parties, but applications to respondents themselves, which were part of the subject of the complaint and the testimony adduced at trial.  Nevertheless, there is no reason why the doctrine cannot be invoked in this situation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 482-484.
(c) However, an as-applied challenge should ordinarily be decided before an overbreadth claim, for reasons relating both to the proper functioning of courts and to their efficiency.  Here, neither of the courts below ever considered respondents' as-applied challenge under the proper legal standards, nor apparently even recognized that the case involves both commercial and noncommercial speech.  On remand, the question whether Resolution 66-156's alleged substantial overbreadth makes it unenforceable should be addressed only if it is first determined that its application to speech in either category is valid.  Pp.  492 U. S. 484-486.

No. 87-2013
Argued February 22, 1989
Decided June 29, 1989
492 U.S. 469

Syllabus 
Resolution 66-156 of the State University of New York (SUNY) prohibits private commercial enterprises from operating in SUNY facilities.  After the resolution was applied by campus police to bar American Future Systems, Inc. (AFS), from demonstrating and selling its housewares at a party hosted in a student dormitory, respondent Fox and other students sued for a declaratory judgment that such action violated the First Amendment.  The District Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the resolution but, after a trial, found for SUNY on the ground that its dormitories did not constitute a public forum for purposes of commercial activity, and that the restrictions on speech were reasonable in light of the dormitories' purpose.  Viewing the challenged application of the resolution as a restriction on commercial speech, and therefore applying the test articulated in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, 447 U. S. 557, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was unclear whether the resolution directly advanced the State's asserted interests and whether, if it did, it was the least restrictive means to that end.  The court therefore reversed and remanded to the trial court.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the District Court to apply a least restrictive means test to Resolution 66-156.  Pp.  492 U. S. 473-481.
(a) The AFS parties the students seek to hold propose a commercial transaction, and therefore constitute commercial speech.  Although they also touch upon other subjects, such as how to be financially responsible and run an efficient home, this does not render them noncommercial in their entirety on the theory that fully protected, educational speech and commercial speech are ""inextricably intertwined.""  Riley v. National Federation of Blind of North Carolina, Inc., 487 U. S. 781, distinguished.  Pp.  492 U. S. 473-475
(b) Although Central Hudson and other decisions have occasionally contained statements suggesting that government restrictions on commercial speech must constitute the least restrictive means of achieving the governmental interests asserted, those decisions have never required that the restriction be absolutely the least severe that will 
Page 492 U. S. 470
 achieve the desired end.  Rather, the decisions require only a reasonable ""fit"" between the government's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.  See, e.g., Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328,  478 U. S. 341; In re R. M.J., 455 U. S. 191,  455 U. S. 203.  So long as the means are narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective, it is for governmental decisionmakers to judge what manner of regulation may be employed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 475-481.
2. Respondents' overbreadth claim -- which is based on the assertion that Resolution 66-156 impermissibly prohibits their fully protected, noncommercial speech -- is not ripe for resolution in this Court.  Pp.  492 U. S. 481-486.
(a) Although overbreadth analysis does not normally apply to commercial speech, Resolution 66-156 must be deemed to reach some noncommercial speech in light of evidence that it prohibits for-profit job counseling, tutoring, legal advice, and medical consultation in students' dormitory rooms.  While such conduct consists of speech for profit, it does not satisfy the definition of commercial speech, since it does not propose a commercial transaction.  Pp.  492 U. S. 481-482.
(b) The overbreadth doctrine was designed as a departure from traditional rules of standing, enabling persons who are themselves unharmed by a statute to challenge it facially on the ground that it may be applied unconstitutionally to others, in situations not before the Court.  Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601,  413 U. S. 610,  413 U. S. 613.  Respondents' invocation of the doctrine is unusual because the asserted extensions of Resolution 66-156 beyond commercial speech that are the basis for their challenge are not hypothetical applications to third parties, but applications to respondents themselves, which were part of the subject of the complaint and the testimony adduced at trial.  Nevertheless, there is no reason why the doctrine cannot be invoked in this situation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 482-484.
(c) However, an as-applied challenge should ordinarily be decided before an overbreadth claim, for reasons relating both to the proper functioning of courts and to their efficiency.  Here, neither of the courts below ever considered respondents' as-applied challenge under the proper legal standards, nor apparently even recognized that the case involves both commercial and noncommercial speech.  On remand, the question whether Resolution 66-156's alleged substantial overbreadth makes it unenforceable should be addressed only if it is first determined that its application to speech in either category is valid.  Pp.  492 U. S. 484-486.

Syllabus 
Respondent, when first questioned by Indiana police in connection with a stabbing, made an exculpatory statement after being read and signing a waiver form that provided, inter alia, that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed for him ""if and when you go to court.""  However, 29 hours later, he was interviewed again, signed a different waiver form, confessed to the stabbing, and led officers to a site where they recovered relevant physical evidence.  Over respondent's objection, his two statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  After the Indiana Supreme Court upheld his conviction for attempted murder, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court claiming, among other things, that his confession was inadmissible because the first waiver form did not comply with the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  The District Court denied the petition, holding that the record clearly manifested adherence to Miranda.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the advice that counsel will be appointed ""if and when you go to court"" was constitutionally defective, because it denied the indigent accused a clear and unequivocal warning of the right to appointed counsel before interrogation and linked that right to a future event.
Held:  Informing a suspect that an attorney would be appointed for him ""if and when you go to court"" does not render Miranda warnings inadequate.  Pp.  492 U. S. 200-205.
(a) Miranda warnings need not be given in the exact form described in Miranda, but simply must reasonably convey to a suspect his rights.  The initial warnings given to respondent -- that he had a right to remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him in court, that he had the right to speak to an attorney before and during questioning, even if he could not afford to hire one, that he had the right to stop answering questions at any time until he talked to a lawyer, and that the police could not provide him with a lawyer, but one would be appointed ""if and when you go to court"" -- touched all of the bases required by Miranda.  Pp.  492 U. S. 201-203.
(b) The Court of Appeals misapprehended the effect of the ""if and when you go to court"" language.  This instruction accurately reflects Indiana's 
Page 492 U. S. 196
 procedure for appointment of counsel, which does not occur until a defendant's first court appearance, and it anticipates a suspect's question as to when he will obtain counsel.  Pp.  492 U. S. 203-204.
(c) Miranda does not require that attorneys be producible on call, but only that the suspect be informed of his right to an attorney and to appointed counsel, and that, if the police cannot provide appointed counsel, they will not question him until he waives, as respondent did, his right to counsel.  P.  492 U. S. 204.
(d) Respondent's reliance on California v. Prysock, 453 U. S. 355 -- which held that Miranda warnings would not be sufficient ""if the reference to the right to appointed counsel was linked [to a] future point in time after police interrogation"" -- is misplaced, since Prysock involved warnings that did not apprise the accused of his right to have an attorney present if he chose to answer questions.  However, of the eight sentences in respondent's first warning, one described his right to counsel ""before [the police] ask[ed] [him] questions,"" while another stated his right ""to stop answering at any time until [he] talk[ed] to a lawyer.""

492 U.S. 229

Syllabus 
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968, which is Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (OCCA), imposes criminal and civil liability upon persons who engage in certain ""prohibited activities,"" each of which is defined to include, as a necessary element, proof of a ""pattern of racketeering activity,""  1962.  ""Racketeering activity"" means ""any act or threat involving"" specified state law crimes, any ""act"" indictable under specified federal statutes, and certain federal ""offenses.""  1961(1).  A ""pattern"" requires ""at least two acts of racketeering activity"" within a 10-year period.   1961(5).  Petitioners, customers of respondent Northwestern Bell, filed a civil action in the District Court against Northwestern Bell and other respondents, including members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) -- which is responsible for determining Northwestern Bell's rates -- seeking an injunction and treble damages.  They raised four separate claims under  1962(a), (b), (c), and (d), based on factual allegations that, between 1980 and 1986, Northwestern Bell made various cash and in-kind payments to MPUC members, and thereby influenced them to approve rates for the company in excess of a fair and reasonable amount.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, on the ground that each of the fraudulent acts alleged was ""committed in furtherance of a single scheme to influence MPUC commissioners,"" rather than multiple illegal schemes.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, confirming that under its precedent, a single scheme is insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.
Held:
1. In order to prove a pattern of racketeering activity, a plaintiff or prosecutor must show at least two racketeering predicates that are related and that amount to, or threaten the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.  Proof of neither relationship nor continuity requires a showing that the racketeering predicates were committed in furtherance of multiple criminal schemes.  Pp.  492 U. S. 236-249.
(a) Section 1961(5) states that at least two racketeering predicates committed within a 10-year period are necessary to establish a RICO 
Page 492 U. S. 230
 pattern, but implies that two acts may not be sufficient.  Section 1961(5) thus assumes that there is something to a pattern beyond merely the number of predicates involved.  In normal usage, the word ""pattern"" would also be taken to require not simply a multiplicity of predicates, but rather predicates arranged or ordered by reason of the relationship they bear to each other or to some external organizing principle.  The text of RICO fails to identify the forms of relationship or external principles to be used to determine whether predicates fall into a pattern.  RICO's legislative history, however, establishes that Congress intended that to prove a ""pattern of racketeering activity,"" a plaintiff or prosecutor must show both ""relationship"" and ""continuity"" -- that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they either constitute or threaten long-term criminal activity.  Pp.  492 U. S. 237-239.
(b) Relationship and continuity are two distinct requirements, though their proof will often overlap.  RICO's notion of relationship is no more constrained than that used in Title X of OCCA, under which
""criminal conduct forms a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.""
18 U.S.C.  3575(e).  Continuity of racketeering activity likewise may be demonstrated in a variety of ways.  Continuity is centrally a temporal concept, and may be either closed- or open-ended.  A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.  Otherwise, it must be shown that the predicates establish a threat of long-term racketeering activity -- for example, because the predicates themselves involve a distinct threat of such activity; because they are part of the regular way of doing business for an ongoing entity such as a criminal association or legitimate business; or because they are a regular means of conducting or participating in an ongoing RICO enterprise.  Although proof of multiple criminal schemes may be relevant to this inquiry into continuity, it is not the only way to show continuity.  Adopting the Court of Appeals' multiple scheme test would bring a rigidity to the methods of proving a pattern not present in the idea of ""continuity"" itself, and it would introduce a concept -- the ""scheme"" -- that does not appear in RICO's language or legislative history.  Pp.  492 U. S. 239-243.
(c) Neither RICO's language nor its legislative.history supports a rule that a defendant's racketeering activities form a pattern only if they are characteristic of organized crime.  No such restriction appears in RICO's text.  Nor is there any language suggesting that RICO's scope should be limited to acts of an association, rather than an individual acting alone.  Moreover, Congress' approach in RICO can be contrasted with 
Page 492 U. S. 231
 its decision to enact explicit limitations to organized crime in other statutes.  E.g., Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,  601(b).  The argument that RICO's broad language should be read restrictively to be congruous with RICO's purpose to eradicate organized crime is rejected:  the legislative history shows Congress had no such restriction in mind.  Pp.  492 U. S. 243-249.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the District Court's dismissal of petitioners' complaint for failure to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate a ""pattern of racketeering activity.""  Consistent with the allegations in their complaint, petitioners may be able to prove that the multiple predicates alleged satisfy the requirements of continuity and relationship, and hence satisfy RICO's pattern of racketeering element.  Pp.  492 U. S. 249-250.

No. 88-556
Argued April 18, 1989
Decided June 26, 1989
492 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Respondents Joseph Kelly and Kelco Disposal, Inc., filed suit against petitioners (collectively BFI) in Federal District Court, charging BFI with antitrust violations and with interfering with Kelco's contractual relations in violation of Vermont tort law.  A jury found BFI liable on both counts, and awarded Kelco, in addition to $51,146 in compensatory damages, $6 million in punitive damages on the state law claim.  Denying BFI's post-trial motions, the District Court upheld the jury's punitive damages award.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to both liability and damages, holding that, even if the Eighth Amendment were applicable, the punitive damages awarded were not so disproportionate as to be constitutionally excessive.
Held:
1. The Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to punitive damages awards in cases between private parties; it does not constrain such an award when the government neither has prosecuted the action nor has any right to recover a share of the damages awarded.  Pp.  492 U. S. 262-276.
(a) The primary concern which drove the Framers of the Eighth Amendment was the potential for governmental abuse of ""prosecutorial"" power, not concern with the extent or purposes of civil damages.  Nothing in English history suggests that the Excessive Fines Clause of the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the direct ancestor of the Eighth Amendment, was intended to apply to damages awarded in disputes between private parties.  Pp.  492 U. S. 264-268.
(b) The history of the use and abuse in England of amercements, including the fact that Magna Carta placed limits on the Crown's use of excessive amercements, is no basis for concluding that the Excessive Fines Clause limits a civil jury's ability to award punitive damages.  Magna Carta was aimed at putting limits on the excesses of royal power, purposes which are clearly inapposite in a case where a private party receives exemplary damages from another party and the government has no share in the recovery.  Any overlap between civil and criminal procedure at the time of Magna Carta is insignificant when all indications are that English courts never have understood Magna Carta's amercements clauses to be relevant to private damages of any kind.  Pp.  492 U. S. 268-273. 
Page 492 U. S. 258

(c) The language of the Excessive Fines Clause and the nature of our constitutional framework make it clear that the Eighth Amendment places limits on the steps a government may take against an individual.  The fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis of courts and serve to advance governmental interests in punishment and deterrence is insufficient to support applying the Excessive Fines Clause in a case between private parties.  Here, the government of Vermont has not taken a positive step to punish, as it does in the criminal context, nor used the civil courts to extract large payments or forfeiture for the purpose of raising revenue or disabling some individual.  Pp.  492 U. S. 273-276.
2. Because BFI failed to raise before either the District Court or the Court of Appeals the question whether the punitive damages award was excessive under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court will not consider the effect of due process on the award.

			"|"Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.
No. 88-556
Argued April 18, 1989
Decided June 26, 1989
492 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Respondents Joseph Kelly and Kelco Disposal, Inc., filed suit against petitioners (collectively BFI) in Federal District Court, charging BFI with antitrust violations and with interfering with Kelco's contractual relations in violation of Vermont tort law.  A jury found BFI liable on both counts, and awarded Kelco, in addition to $51,146 in compensatory damages, $6 million in punitive damages on the state law claim.  Denying BFI's post-trial motions, the District Court upheld the jury's punitive damages award.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to both liability and damages, holding that, even if the Eighth Amendment were applicable, the punitive damages awarded were not so disproportionate as to be constitutionally excessive.
Held:
1. The Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment does not apply to punitive damages awards in cases between private parties; it does not constrain such an award when the government neither has prosecuted the action nor has any right to recover a share of the damages awarded.  Pp.  492 U. S. 262-276.
(a) The primary concern which drove the Framers of the Eighth Amendment was the potential for governmental abuse of ""prosecutorial"" power, not concern with the extent or purposes of civil damages.  Nothing in English history suggests that the Excessive Fines Clause of the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the direct ancestor of the Eighth Amendment, was intended to apply to damages awarded in disputes between private parties.  Pp.  492 U. S. 264-268.
(b) The history of the use and abuse in England of amercements, including the fact that Magna Carta placed limits on the Crown's use of excessive amercements, is no basis for concluding that the Excessive Fines Clause limits a civil jury's ability to award punitive damages.  Magna Carta was aimed at putting limits on the excesses of royal power, purposes which are clearly inapposite in a case where a private party receives exemplary damages from another party and the government has no share in the recovery.  Any overlap between civil and criminal procedure at the time of Magna Carta is insignificant when all indications are that English courts never have understood Magna Carta's amercements clauses to be relevant to private damages of any kind.  Pp.  492 U. S. 268-273. 
Page 492 U. S. 258

(c) The language of the Excessive Fines Clause and the nature of our constitutional framework make it clear that the Eighth Amendment places limits on the steps a government may take against an individual.  The fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis of courts and serve to advance governmental interests in punishment and deterrence is insufficient to support applying the Excessive Fines Clause in a case between private parties.  Here, the government of Vermont has not taken a positive step to punish, as it does in the criminal context, nor used the civil courts to extract large payments or forfeiture for the purpose of raising revenue or disabling some individual.  Pp.  492 U. S. 273-276.
2. Because BFI failed to raise before either the District Court or the Court of Appeals the question whether the punitive damages award was excessive under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court will not consider the effect of due process on the award.  Pp.  492 U. S. 276-277.
3. Federal common law does not provide a basis for disturbing the jury's punitive damages award.  In performing the limited function of a federal appellate court, this Court perceives no federal common law standard, or compelling federal policy, that convinces the Court it should not accord considerable deference to a district court's decision not to order a new trial.  The District Court in this case properly instructed the jury on Vermont law and applied the proper state law standard in considering whether the verdict was excessive, and the Court of Appeals correctly held that the District Court did not abuse its discretion.

Syllabus 
Petitioner was charged with capital murder in Texas state court.  He was found competent to stand trial, although a psychologist testified that he was mildly to moderately retarded and had the mental age of a 6 1/2-year-old.  At the guilt-innocence phase of the trial, petitioner raised an insanity defense and presented psychiatric testimony that he suffered from a combination of organic brain damage and moderate retardation which resulted in poor impulse control and an inability to learn from experience.  His evidence also indicated that he had been abused as a child.  The State introduced testimony that petitioner was legally sane, but had an antisocial personality.  The jury rejected petitioner's insanity defense and found him guilty of capital murder.  At the penalty phase of the trial, the sentencing jury was instructed to consider all the evidence introduced at trial in answering the following ""special issues"":  (1) whether petitioner's conduct was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death would result; (2) whether there was a probability that he would be a continuing threat to society; and (3) whether the killing was unreasonable in response to any provocation by the victim.  The trial court rejected petitioner's request for jury instructions defining the terms in the special issues and authorizing a grant of mercy based upon the existence of mitigating circumstances.  The jury answered ""yes"" to each special issue, and, as required by Texas law, the court therefore sentenced petitioner to death.  A ""no"" answer to any of the special issues would have required a sentence of life imprisonment.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contentions that his death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment first, because the jury was not adequately instructed to consider all of his mitigating evidence and because the special issues' terms were not defined in such a way that the jury could consider and give effect to that evidence in answering them; and, second, because it is cruel and unusual punishment to execute a mentally retarded person with petitioner's mental ability.  After this Court denied certiorari on direct review, the Federal District Court and the Court of Appeals upheld petitioner's death sentence in habeas corpus proceedings.  Although it denied him relief, the Court of Appeals nevertheless found considerable merit in petitioner's claim that 
Page 492 U. S. 303
 his mitigating evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse could not be given effect by the jury, under the instructions given, in answering the special issues.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.
832 F. 2d 915, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, III, IV-A, and IV-B, concluding that:
1. Granting petitioner relief on his claim that, when mitigating evidence of mental retardation and an abused childhood is presented, Texas juries must, upon request, be given instructions that allow them to give effect to that mitigating evidence in determining whether to impose the death penalty, would not create a ""new rule"" which, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288,  489 U. S. 301, may not generally be applied or announced in cases on collateral review.  Pp.  492 U. S. 313-319.
(a) The Teague rule of nonretroactivity and its two exceptions are applicable in the capital sentencing context.  A criminal judgment includes the sentence imposed, and collateral challenges to sentences foster delay and undermine the finality concerns underlying Teague's rule of nonretroactivity.  Pp.  492 U. S. 313-314.
(b) Under Teague, a case announces a ""new rule"" when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government, or if the result is not dictated by precedent which existed at the time the defendant's conviction became final.  Id. at  489 U. S. 301.  Here, since Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, were decided before petitioner's conviction became final when this Court denied his certiorari petition on direct review, he is entitled to the benefit of those decisions under Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314.  The rule that petitioner seeks does not impose a new obligation on Texas, because Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, upheld the Texas death penalty statute on the basis of assurances that the special issues would be interpreted broadly enough to permit the jury to consider all of the relevant mitigating evidence a defendant might present in imposing sentence.  Moreover, the rule that petitioner seeks in this case is dictated by Eddings and Lockett, which established that a State cannot, consistent with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, prevent the sentencer from considering and giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant's background or character or to the circumstances of the offense that mitigates against imposing the death penalty.  Pp.  492 U. S. 314-319.
2. The absence of instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to petitioner's mitigating evidence of mental retardation and abused background by declining to impose the death penalty 
Page 492 U. S. 304
 compels the conclusion that the jury was not provided with a vehicle for expressing its ""reasoned moral response"" to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision, as is required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments under Lockett, Eddings, and subsequent decisions.  Those decisions are based on the principle that punishment must be directly related to the defendant's personal culpability, and that a defendant who commits crimes attributable to a disadvantaged background or emotional and mental problems may be less culpable than one who has no such excuse.  Here, although petitioner was permitted to introduce and argue the significance of his mitigating evidence to the jury, the jury instructions did not permit the jury to give effect to that evidence in answering the three special issues.  As to the first such issue, without a special instruction defining ""deliberately"" in a way that would clearly direct the jury to fully consider petitioner's mitigating evidence as it bears on his moral culpability, a juror who believed that that evidence made imposition of the death penalty unwarranted would be unable to give effect to that conclusion if the juror also believed that petitioner committed the crime ""deliberately.""  Nor did the second special issue provide a vehicle for the jury to give mitigating effect to petitioner's evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse; to the contrary, the evidence concerning his inability to learn from his mistakes by virtue of his mental retardation actually suggests that he will be dangerous in the future.  Although such evidence may lessen his blameworthiness, it made an affirmative answer to the second issue more likely.  Furthermore, a juror who believed that petitioner lacked the moral culpability to be sentenced to death could not express that view in answering the third special issue if the juror also believed that his conduct was not a reasonable response to provocation by the victim.  There is no merit to the State's contention that to instruct the jury that it could decline to impose the death penalty based on petitioner's mitigating evidence would allow it the sort of unbridled discretion prohibited by Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238.  As Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, made clear, so long as the class of murderers subject to capital punishment is narrowed, there is no constitutional infirmity in a procedure that allows a jury to recommend mercy based on the mitigating evidence introduced by a defendant.  Furthermore, because the punishment imposed should be directly related to the personal culpability of the defendant, the sentencer must be allowed to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant's background, character, and crime.  Full consideration of such mitigating evidence enhances the reliability of the jury's sentencing decision.  Pp.  492 U. S. 319-328. 
Page 492 U. S. 305

3. The Eighth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the execution of mentally retarded capital murderers of petitioner's reasoning ability.  Pp.  492 U. S. 328-335.
(a) Although granting petitioner relief on this issue would create a ""new rule"" within the meaning of Teague, supra, that rule would fall within the first exception to Teague's general rule of nonretroactivity.  That exception applies not only to new rules that place certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe.  It also applies to new rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.  Cf., e.g., Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399,  477 U. S. 410.  Pp.  492 U. S. 329-330.
(b) The Eighth Amendment's categorical prohibition upon the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment applies to practices condemned by the common law at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted, as well as to punishments which offend our society's evolving standards of decency as expressed in objective evidence of legislative enactments and the conduct of sentencing juries.  Since the common law prohibited the punishment of ""idiots"" -- which term was generally used to describe persons totally lacking in reason, understanding, or the ability to distinguish between good and evil -- it may indeed be ""cruel and unusual punishment"" to execute persons who are profoundly or severely retarded and wholly lacking in the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of their actions.  Such persons, however, are not likely to be convicted or face the prospect of punishment today, since the modern insanity defense generally includes ""mental defect"" as part of the legal definition of insanity, and since Ford v. Wainwright, supra, prohibits the execution of persons who are unaware of their punishment and why they must suffer it.  Moreover, petitioner is not such a person, since the jury (1) found him competent to stand trial, and therefore to have a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings; and (2) rejected his insanity defense, thereby reflecting the conclusion that he knew his conduct was wrong and was capable of conforming it to the requirements of law.  Nor is there sufficient objective evidence today of a national consensus against executing mentally retarded capital murderers, since petitioner has cited only one state statute that explicitly bans that practice, and has offered no evidence of the general behavior of juries in this regard.  Opinion surveys indicating strong public opposition to such executions do not establish a societal consensus, absent some legislative reflection of the sentiment expressed therein.  Pp.  492 U. S. 330-335.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded in Part IV-C that, on the present record, it cannot be said that executing capital murderers who are mentally retarded violates the Eighth Amendment's proportionality requirement.  
Page 492 U. S. 306
 To be sure, retardation has long been regarded as a factor that may diminish culpability, and, in its most severe form, may result in complete exculpation.  Moreover, most States with death penalty statutes that list mitigating factors include reduced mental capacity as a mitigating circumstance, and this Court holds today that the sentencing body must be allowed to consider retardation in making the individualized determination whether the death penalty is appropriate.  Mentally retarded persons, however, are individuals whose abilities and behavioral deficits can vary greatly depending on the degree of their retardation, their life experience, and the ameliorative effects of education and habilitation.  On the present record, it cannot be said that all mentally retarded people of petitioner's ability -- by virtue of their mental retardation alone, and apart from any individualized consideration of their personal responsibility -- inevitably lack the cognitive, volitional, and moral capacity to act with the degree of culpability associated with the death penalty.  Moreover, the concept of ""mental age"" is an insufficient basis for a categorical Eighth Amendment rule, since it is imprecise, does not adequately account for individuals' varying experiences and abilities, ceases to change after a person reaches the chronological age of 15 or 16, and could have a disempowering effect if applied to retarded persons in other areas of the law, such as the opportunity to enter contracts or to marry.  Pp.  492 U. S. 335-340.

Petitioner in No. 87-5765 was approximately 17 years and 4 months old at the time he committed murder in Kentucky.  A juvenile court, after conducting hearings, transferred him for trial as an adult under a state statute permitting such action as to offenders who are either charged with a Class A felony or capital crime or who are over the age of 16 and charged with a felony.  Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting petitioner's contention that he had a constitutional right to treatment in the juvenile justice system, and declaring that his age and the possibility that he might be rehabilitated were mitigating factors properly left to the jury.  Petitioner in No. 87-6026, who was approximately 16 years and 6 months old when he committed murder in Missouri, was certified for trial as an adult under a state statute permitting such action against individuals between 14 and 17 years old who have committed felonies.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting his contention that the sentence violated the Eighth Amendment.
Held:  The judgments are affirmed.
No. 87-5765, 734 S.W.2d 781, affirmed; No. 87-6026, 736 S.W.2d 409, affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and IV-A, concluding that the imposition of capital punishment on an individual for a crime committed at 16 or 17 years of age does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.  492 U. S. 365-374.
(a) Whether a particular punishment violates the Eighth Amendment depends on whether it constitutes one of ""those modes or acts of punishment . . . considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted,"" Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399,  477 U. S. 405, or is contrary to the ""evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,"" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86,  356 U. S. 101.  Petitioners have not alleged that their sentences would have been considered cruel and unusual in the 18th century, and could not support such a contention, since, at that 
Page 492 U. S. 362
 time, the common law set the rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit felonies (which were punishable by death) at the age of 14.  In accordance with this common law tradition, at least 281 offenders under 18, and 126 under 17, have been executed in this country.  Pp.  492 U. S. 368-370.
(b) In determining whether a punishment violates evolving standards of decency, this Court looks not to its own subjective conceptions, but, rather, to the conceptions of modern American society as reflected by objective evidence.  E.g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,  433 U. S. 592.  The primary and most reliable evidence of national consensus -- the pattern of federal and state laws -- fails to meet petitioner's heavy burden of proving a settled consensus against the execution of 16- and 17-year-old offenders.  Of the 37 States that permit capital punishment, 15 decline to impose it on 16-year-olds and 12 on 17-year-olds.  This does not establish the degree of national agreement this Court has previously thought sufficient to label a punishment cruel and unusual.  See Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137,  481 U. S. 154.  Pp.  492 U. S. 370-373.
(c) Nor is there support for petitioners' argument that a demonstrable reluctance of juries to impose, and prosecutors to seek, capital sentences for 16- and 17-year-olds establishes a societal consensus that such sentences are inappropriate.  Statistics showing that a far smaller number of offenders under 18 than over 18 have been sentenced to death reflect in part the fact that a far smaller percentage of capital crimes is committed by persons in the younger age group.  Beyond that, it is likely that the very considerations that induce petitioners to believe death should never be imposed on such young offenders cause prosecutors and juries to believe it should rarely be imposed, so that the statistics are no proof of a categorical aversion.  Pp.  492 U. S. 373-374.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Parts IV-B and V that:
1. There is no relevance to the state laws cited by petitioners which set 18 or more as the legal age for engaging in various activities, ranging from driving to drinking alcoholic beverages to voting.  Those laws operate in gross, and do not conduct individualized maturity tests for each driver, drinker, or voter; an age appropriate in the vast majority of cases must therefore be selected.  In the realm of capital punishment, however, individualized consideration is a constitutional requirement.  Twenty-nine States, including Kentucky and Missouri, have codified this requirement in laws specifically designating age as a mitigating factor that capital sentencers must be permitted to consider.  Moreover, the determinations required by transfer statutes such as Kentucky's and Missouri's to certify a juvenile for trial as an adult ensure individualized consideration of the maturity and moral responsibility of 16- and 17-year-olds before they are even held to stand trial as adults.  It is those particularized laws, rather than the generalized driving, drinking, and voting 
Page 492 U. S. 363
 laws, that display society's views on the age at which no youthful offender should be held responsible.  Pp.  492 U. S. 374-377.
2. The indicia of national consensus offered by petitioner other than state and federal statutes and the behavior of prosecutors and juries cannot establish constitutional standards.  Public opinion polls, the views of interest groups, and the positions of professional associations are too uncertain a foundation for constitutional law.  Also insufficient is socioscientific or ethicoscientific evidence tending to show that capital punishment fails to deter 16- and 17-year-olds because they have a less highly developed fear of death, and fails to exact just retribution because juveniles, being less mature and responsible, are less morally blameworthy.  The audience for such arguments is not this Court, but the citizenry.  Although several of the Court's cases have engaged in so-called ""proportionality"" analysis -- which examines whether there is a disproportion between the punishment imposed and the defendant's blameworthiness, and whether a punishment makes any measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment -- those decisions have never invalidated a punishment on that basis alone, but have done so only when there was also objective evidence of state laws or jury determinations establishing a societal consensus against the penalty.  Pp.  492 U. S. 377-380.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, although agreeing that no national consensus presently forbids the imposition of capital punishment on 16- or 17-year-old murderers, concluded that this Court has a constitutional obligation to conduct proportionality analysis, see, e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh, ante at  492 U. S. 335-340, and should consider age-based statutory classifications that are relevant to that analysis.  Pp.  492 U. S. 380-382.

|492 u.s. 1|"Murray v. Giarratano
No. 88-411
Argued March 22, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989
492 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondents, a class of indigent Virginia death row inmates who do not have counsel to pursue postconviction proceedings, brought a suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in the District Court against various state officials, alleging that the Constitution required that they be provided with counsel at the State's expense for the purpose of pursuing collateral proceedings related to their convictions and sentences.  The District Court concluded that respondents should receive greater assistance than that outlined in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817 -- which held that a prisoner's ""right of access"" to the courts required a State to furnish access to adequate law libraries or other legal aid so the prisoners might' prepare petitions for judicial relief -- since death row inmates have a limited amount of time to prepare petitions, since their cases are unusually complex, and since the shadow of impending execution interferes with their ability to do legal work.  It found that Virginia's efforts -- access to a law library or lawbooks, the availability of ""unit attorneys,"" and appointment of counsel after a petition is filed -- did not afford prisoners meaningful access to the courts because they did not guarantee the prisoners continuous assistance of counsel.  Thus, it ordered Virginia to develop a program for the appointment of counsel, upon request, to indigent death row inmates wishing to pursue habeas corpus in state court, but, in light of Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, not in federal court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It viewed the lower court's special ""considerations"" 
Page 492 U. S. 2
 relating to death row inmates as findings of fact which were not clearly erroneous.  It reasoned that the case was not controlled by Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 -- which held that neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor the equal protection guarantee of ""meaningful access"" required the State to appoint counsel for indigent prisoners seeking postconviction relief -- since Finley was not a ""meaningful access"" case, since it did not address the rule enunciated in Bounds, and since it did not involve the death penalty.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
847 F.2d 1118, reversed and remanded.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Due Process Clause requires States to appoint counsel for indigent death row inmates seeking state postconviction relief.  Pp.  492 U. S. 7-13.
(a) This Court's decisions require the conclusion that the rule of Pennsylvania v. Finley should apply no differently in capital cases than in noncapital cases.  See, e.g., Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527.  State collateral proceedings are not constitutionally required as an adjunct to the state criminal proceeding, and serve a different and more limited purpose than either the trial or appeal.  Eighth Amendment safeguards imposed at the trial stage -- where the court and jury hear testimony, receive evidence, and decide the question of guilt and punishment -- are sufficient to assure the reliability of the process by which the death penalty is imposed.  Pp.  492 U. S. 7-10.
(b) There is no inconsistency whatever between the holdings in Bounds and Finley.  The right of access at issue in Bounds rests on a constitutional theory considered in Finley.  Extending Bounds would partially overrule the subsequently decided Finley and would' reject a categorical rule -- the usual tack taken in right to counsel cases -- for the adoption of a case-by-case determination based on ""factual"" findings, which, under a ""clearly erroneous"" standard, could result in different constitutional rules being applied in different States.  Pp.  492 U. S. 10-13.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that Virginia's scheme for securing representation for indigent death row inmates does not violate the Constitution.  Although Virginia's procedures are not as far-reaching and effective as those available in other States, no Virginia death row inmates have been unable to obtain counsel to represent them in postconviction proceedings, and Virginia's prison system is staffed by institutional lawyers to assist inmates in such matters.  Bounds' meaningful access requirement can be satisfied in various ways, and state legislatures and prison administrators must be 
Page 492 U. S. 3
 given ""wide discretion"" to select appropriate solutions from a range of complex options.  Pp.  492 U. S. 14-15.

Although Virginia's procedures are not as far-reaching and effective as those available in other States, no Virginia death row inmates have been unable to obtain counsel to represent them in postconviction proceedings, and Virginia's prison system is staffed by institutional lawyers to assist inmates in such matters.

Syllabus 
Respondent, the bankruptcy trustee for a corporation undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization, filed suit in the District Court against petitioners, seeking to avoid allegedly fraudulent monetary transfers to them by the bankrupt corporation's predecessor and to recover damages, costs, expenses, and interest.  The court referred the proceedings to the Bankruptcy Court.  Shortly after the Colombian Government nationalized petitioner Granfinanciera, S. A., petitioners requested a jury trial.  The Bankruptcy Judge denied the request, deeming a suit to recover a fraudulent transfer a ""core action"" which, under his understanding of English common law, ""was a nonjury issue.""  The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's judgment for respondent, without discussing petitioners' jury trial request.  The Court of Appeals also affirmed, ruling, inter alia, that the Seventh Amendment supplied no right to a jury trial, because fraudulent conveyance actions are equitable in nature, even when a plaintiff seeks only monetary relief; because bankruptcy proceedings themselves are inherently equitable in nature; and because Congress has displaced any right to a jury trial by designating, in 28 U.S.C.  157(b)(2)(H), fraudulent conveyance actions as ""core proceedings"" triable by bankruptcy judges sitting without juries.
Held:
1. This Court will not address respondent's contention that the judgment below should be affirmed as to petitioner Granfinanciera because it was a commercial instrumentality of the Colombian Government when it made its request for a jury trial, and was therefore not entitled to such a trial under the Seventh Amendment or applicable statutory provisions.  This difficult question was neither raised below nor adequately briefed and argued here, and this is not an ""exceptional case"" as to which the Court will consider arguments not raised below.  Moreover, petitioners' claim is uncontradicted that an affirmance on the ground respondent now urges would enlarge respondent's rights under the judgment below and decrease those of Granfinanciera.  Pp.  492 U. S. 38-40. 
Page 492 U. S. 34

2. Provided that Congress has not permissibly assigned resolution of the claim to a non-Article III adjudicative body that does not use a jury as factfinder, the Seventh Amendment entitles a person who has not submitted a claim against a bankruptcy estate to a jury trial when sued by the bankruptcy trustee to recover an allegedly fraudulent monetary transfer.  Pp.  492 U. S. 40-49.
(a) Since this Court's decisions, early English cases, and scholarly authority all demonstrate that respondent would have had to bring his action at law in 18th-century England, and that a court of equity would not have adjudicated it, it must be concluded preliminarily that the action is a ""Sui[t] at common law"" for which a jury trial is required by the Seventh Amendment.  Pp.  492 U. S. 43-47.
(b) More importantly, the nature of the relief respondent seeks -- the recovery of money payments of ascertained and definite amounts -- conclusively demonstrates that his cause of action should be characterized as legal, rather than equitable, such that petitioners are prima facie entitled to a jury trial under the Amendment.  Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., 287 U. S. 92.  Pp.  492 U. S. 47-49.
3. The Seventh Amendment entitles petitioners to their requested jury trial notwithstanding  157(b)(2)(H)'s designation of fraudulent conveyance actions as ""core proceedings"" which non-Article III bankruptcy judges may adjudicate.  Pp.  492 U. S. 49-65.
(a) Although the Seventh Amendment does not prohibit Congress from assigning resolution of a statutory claim that is legal in nature to a non-Article III tribunal that does not use a jury as a factfinder so long as the claim asserts a ""public right,"" Congress lacks the power to strip parties who are contesting matters of private right of their constitutional right to a jury trial.  See, e.g., Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 430 U. S. 442; Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50.  For these purposes, a ""public right"" is not limited to a matter arising between the Government and others, but extends to a seemingly ""private"" right that is closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program that Congress has power to enact.  Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U. S. 568,  473 U. S. 586,  473 U. S. 593-594.  Pp.  492 U. S. 51-55.
(b) A bankruptcy trustee's right to recover a fraudulent conveyance is more accurately characterized as a private, rather than a public, right.  Although the plurality in Northern Pipeline Construction Co., supra, at  458 U. S. 71, noted that the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations in bankruptcy may well be a ""public right,"" it also emphasized that state law causes of action for breach of contract are paradigmatic private rights, even when asserted by an insolvent corporation in the midst of Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings.  Trustees' fraudulent conveyance actions 
Page 492 U. S. 35
 are quintessentially common law suits that more nearly resemble state law contract claims by a bankrupt corporation to augment the bankruptcy estate than they do creditors' claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res.  This analysis is confirmed by Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323,  382 U. S. 327-328, which must be read to hold that a creditor's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on a bankruptcy trustee's preference claim depends upon whether the creditor submitted a claim against the estate.  Since petitioners here have not filed such claims, respondent's suit is neither part of the claims adjudication process nor integral to the restructuring of debtor-creditor relations.  Congress therefore cannot divest petitioners of their Seventh Amendment right merely by relabeling a preexisting, common law cause of action to which that right attaches and assigning it to a specialized court of equity, particularly where there is no evidence that Congress considered the constitutional implications of its designation of all fraudulent conveyance actions as core proceedings.  Pp.  492 U. S. 55-61.
(c) Permitting jury trials in fraudulent conveyance actions will not significantly impair the functioning of the legislative scheme.  It cannot seriously be argued that allowing such actions in a trustee's suit against a person who has not entered a claim against the estate would ""go far to dismantle the statutory scheme,"" as that phrase was used in Atlas Roofing, supra, at  430 U. S. 454, n. 11, since Atlas plainly assumed that such claims carried with them a right to a jury trial.  In addition, it cannot easily be said that a jury would be incompatible with bankruptcy proceedings, since Congress has expressly provided for jury trials in certain other actions arising out of bankruptcy litigation.  The claim that juries may serve usefully as checks only on life-tenured judges' decisions overlooks the potential for juries to exercise beneficial restraint on the decisions of fixed-term judges, who may be beholden to Congress or the Executive.  Moreover, although providing jury trials in some fraudulent conveyance actions might impede swift resolution of bankruptcy proceedings and increase the expense of Chapter 11 reorganizations, these considerations are insufficient to overcome the Seventh Amendment's clear command.

No. 88-412
Argued April 19, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989
492 U.S. 96

Syllabus 
Section 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that, ""notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity,"" any provision of the Code that contains ""creditor,' `entity,' or `governmental unit' applies to governmental units,""  106(c)(1); and that ""a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds governmental units,""  106(c)(2).  Petitioner Hoffman, the bankruptcy trustee in two unrelated Chapter 7 proceedings, filed separate adversarial proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court.  One was a ""turnover"" proceeding under  542(b) against respondent Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance to recover Medicaid payments owed for services rendered by a bankrupt convalescence home.  The other, filed against respondent Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, sought under  547(b) to avoid the payment of state taxes, interest, and penalties as a preference, and to recover an amount already paid.  Respondents moved to dismiss both actions as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the motions on the ground that Congress, in enacting  106(c), had abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from actions under  542(b) and 547(b), which contain the ""trigger"" words enumerated in  106(c)(1), and that Congress had authority to do so under the Bankruptcy Clause of the Constitution.  The state respondents appealed to the District Court, and respondent United States intervened.  The District Court reversed without reaching the issue of congressional authority.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that  106(c)'s plain language abrogates sovereign immunity only to the extent necessary to determine a State's rights in the debtor's estate, and does not abrogate such immunity from recovery of an avoided preferential transfer of money or from a turnover proceeding.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
850 F.2d 50, affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that, in enacting  106(c), Congress did not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Congress has not made an intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the provision's language.  The narrow scope of the waivers of sovereign immunity 
Page 492 U. S. 97
 as to certain particular claims in  106(a) and (b) make it unlikely that Congress adopted in  106(c) a broad abrogation of immunity making States subject to all provisions of the Code containing any of the trigger words.  If it did,  106(c) would apply to over 100 Code provisions.  Section 106(c)(2), joined to subsection (c)(1) by the conjunction ""and,"" narrows the type of relief to which the section applies, since, unlike  106(a) and (b), it does not provide an express authorization for monetary recovery from the States.  Thus, a State that files no proof of claim would be bound, like other creditors, by a discharge of debts, including unpaid taxes, but would not be subject to monetary recovery.  Under this construction, the language ""notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity"" waives the immunity of the Federal Government, so that it is bound by the Bankruptcy Court's determination of issues even when it did not appear and subject itself to such court's jurisdiction.  In contrast, under petitioner's argument that the sections containing the trigger words supply the authorization for monetary recovery,  106(c) would have exactly the same effect if subsection (c)(2) had been omitted.  This Court is not persuaded that the use of the word ""determine"" in the Code's jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C.  157(b)(1), is to the contrary.  That provision authorizes bankruptcy judges to determine ""cases"" and ""proceedings,"" not issues, and to ""enter appropriate orders and judgments,"" not merely to bind governmental units by their determinations.  Petitioner's reliance on  106(c)'s legislative history and the policies underlying the Bankruptcy Code is also misplaced, since they are not based on the text of the statute, and thus cannot be used to determine whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.  492 U. S. 100-104.
JUSTICE SCALIA, although concluding that petitioner's actions are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, would affirm the Court. of Appeals' judgment on the ground that Congress had no power to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.  It makes no sense to affirm the constitutional principle that the judicial power of the United States does not extend to a suit directly against a State by one of its citizens unless the State itself consents to be sued, and to hold, at the same time, that Congress can override the principle by statute in the exercise of its Article I powers.

Federal Communications Commission
No. 88-515
Argued April 19, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989*
492 U.S. 115

Syllabus 
Section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, bans indecent as well as obscene interstate commercial telephone messages, commonly known as ""dial-a-porn.""  Under its predecessor provision -- which sought to restrict minors' access to dial-a-porn -- the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after lengthy court proceedings, had promulgated regulations laying out means by which dial-a-porn sponsors could screen out underaged callers.  Sable Communications of California, which offers sexually oriented prerecorded telephone messages to callers both in and outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area, brought suit in the District Court, claiming that  223(b)'s obscenity and indecency provisions were unconstitutional, chiefly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking an injunction enjoining the FCC and the Justice Department from initiating any criminal investigation or prosecution, civil action, or administrative proceeding under the statute and a declaratory judgment.  The court denied Sable's request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ban on obscene telephone messages, rejecting the argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it created a national standard of obscenity.  However, it issued the injunction with regard to the indecent speech provision, holding that the provision was overbroad and unconstitutional because it was not narrowly drawn to achieve the legitimate state interest of protecting children from exposure to indecent dial-a-porn messages.
Held:
1. Section 223(b) does not unconstitutionally prohibit the interstate transmission of obscene commercial telephone messages.  The protection of the First Amendment does not extend to obscene speech.  In addition,  223(b) does not contravene the ""contemporary community standards"" requirement of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, since it no more establishes a ""national standard"" of obscenity than do federal statutes prohibiting the mailing of obscene materials or the broadcasting of 
Page 492 U. S. 116
 obscene messages.  There is no constitutional barrier under Miller to prohibiting communications that are obscene in some communities under local standards even though they are not obscene in others.  Sable which has the burden of complying with the prohibition, is free to tailor its messages, on a selective basis, to the communities it chooses to serve.  Pp.  492 U. S. 124-126.
2.

			"|"Sable Communications of California v.
Federal Communications Commission
No. 88-515
Argued April 19, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989*
492 U.S. 115

Syllabus 
Section 223(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, bans indecent as well as obscene interstate commercial telephone messages, commonly known as ""dial-a-porn.""  Under its predecessor provision -- which sought to restrict minors' access to dial-a-porn -- the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after lengthy court proceedings, had promulgated regulations laying out means by which dial-a-porn sponsors could screen out underaged callers.  Sable Communications of California, which offers sexually oriented prerecorded telephone messages to callers both in and outside the Los Angeles metropolitan area, brought suit in the District Court, claiming that  223(b)'s obscenity and indecency provisions were unconstitutional, chiefly under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and seeking an injunction enjoining the FCC and the Justice Department from initiating any criminal investigation or prosecution, civil action, or administrative proceeding under the statute and a declaratory judgment.  The court denied Sable's request for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ban on obscene telephone messages, rejecting the argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it created a national standard of obscenity.  However, it issued the injunction with regard to the indecent speech provision, holding that the provision was overbroad and unconstitutional because it was not narrowly drawn to achieve the legitimate state interest of protecting children from exposure to indecent dial-a-porn messages.
Held:
1. Section 223(b) does not unconstitutionally prohibit the interstate transmission of obscene commercial telephone messages.  The protection of the First Amendment does not extend to obscene speech.  In addition,  223(b) does not contravene the ""contemporary community standards"" requirement of Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, since it no more establishes a ""national standard"" of obscenity than do federal statutes prohibiting the mailing of obscene materials or the broadcasting of 
Page 492 U. S. 116
 obscene messages.  There is no constitutional barrier under Miller to prohibiting communications that are obscene in some communities under local standards even though they are not obscene in others.  Sable which has the burden of complying with the prohibition, is free to tailor its messages, on a selective basis, to the communities it chooses to serve.  Pp.  492 U. S. 124-126.
2. Section 223(b)'s ban on indecent telephone messages violates the First Amendment, since the statute's denial of adult access to such messages far exceeds that which is necessary to serve the compelling interest of preventing minors from being exposed to the messages.  FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, an emphatically narrow ruling giving the FCC power to regulate an indecent radio broadcast, is readily distinguishable from this case.

No. 88-782
Argued April 24, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989
492 U.S. 136

Syllabus 
The Tax Division of the Department of Justice (Department) represents the Federal Government in nearly all civil tax cases in the district courts, the courts of appeals, and the Claims Court, and receives copies of all opinions and orders issued by those courts in such cases.  Respondent publishes a weekly magazine containing summaries of recent federal court tax decisions, supplemented by full texts of those decisions in microfiche form.  Respondent also publishes a daily electronic database that includes summaries and full texts of recent federal court tax decisions.  After the Department denied its request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to make available all district court tax opinions and final orders received by the Tax Division in a certain period, respondent appealed administratively.  While the appeal was pending, respondent agreed to withdraw its request in return for access to the Tax Division's weekly log of federal court tax cases.  Eventually, however, respondent became frustrated with the process of obtaining copies of decisions from district court clerks and initiated a series of new FOIA requests for copies of all district court opinions and final orders identified in the Tax Division's weekly logs.  The Department denied these requests and, on administrative appeal, sustained the denial.  Respondent then filed suit in District Court seeking to compel the Department to provide it with access to district court decisions received by the Tax Division.  The District Court granted the Department's motion to dismiss the complaint, holding that 5 U.S.C.  552(a)(4)(B), which confers jurisdiction in district courts when ""agency records"" have been ""improperly withheld,"" had not been satisfied.  The court reasoned that the decisions sought had not been ""improperly withheld"" because they were already available from their primary source, the district courts.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the decisions were ""improperly withheld"" and were ""agency records"" for purposes of the FOIA.
Held:  The FOIA requires the Department to make available copies of district court decisions it receives in the course of litigating tax cases.  Pp.  492 U. S. 142-155.
(a) The requested district court decisions are ""agency records.""  The Department obtained those documents from the district courts, and was in control of the documents when the requests were made.  Pp.  492 U. S. 143-148. 
Page 492 U. S. 137

(b) When the Department refused to comply with respondent's requests, it ""withheld"" the district court decisions for purposes of  552(a)(4)(B), notwithstanding that the decisions were publicly available from the original source as soon as they were issued.  Pp.  492 U. S. 148-150.
(c) The district court decisions were ""improperly"" withheld despite their public availability at the original source, since they did not fall within any of the enumerated exemptions to the FOIA's disclosure requirements.  While under  552(a)(3) an agency need not make available materials that have already been disclosed under  552(a)(1) and (a)(2), these latter subsections are limited to situations in which the requested materials have been previously published or made available by the agency itself.  That disclosure of district court decisions may be partially governed by other statutes, in particular 28 U.S.C.  1914, and by rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States, does not entitle the Department to claim that the requested district court decisions were not ""improperly"" withheld, since Congress has enacted no provision authorizing an agency to refuse to disclose materials whose disclosure is mandated by another statute.  Moreover, the decision in GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 445 U. S. 375, that agency records enjoined from disclosure by a district court were not ""improperly"" withheld even though they did not fall within any of the enumerated exemptions, was not meant to be an invitation to courts in every case to engage in balancing, based on public availability and other factors, to determine whether there has been an unjustified denial of information.  The FOIA invests courts with neither the authority nor the tools to make such determinations.  Pp.  492 U. S. 150-155.

No. 88-389
Argued March 28, 1989
Decided June 23, 1989
492 U.S. 158

Syllabus 
The Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio (PERS), established by statute in 1933, provides retirement benefits for state and local government employees.  Benefits are payable based on age and service or, for persons under the age of 60 at retirement, on disability.  The disability retirees age requirement has remained unchanged since 1959.  However, in 1976, PERS was amended to provide that disability payments could not constitute less than 30% of the retiree's final average salary.  No corresponding floor applies to age-and-service payments.  Individuals continue to receive the type of benefit they retired on throughout retirement, regardless of age.  In 1985, appellee, who had been employed by a county agency since 1978, retired at age 61 because of her health.  Despite her medical condition, she was ineligible for disability retirement benefits because of her age.  Her monthly age-and-service benefits amount to approximately one-half of the amount she would have received on disability retirement.  She filed a charge against PERS with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and then filed suit in the District Court, claiming that PERS' refusal to grant her disability benefits application violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).  The court granted summary judgment in her favor, finding that PERS' retirement scheme was discriminatory on its face, in that it denied benefits to certain employees on account of age.  It rejected PERS' reliance on  4(f)(2) of the ADEA, which exempts from the Act's prohibitions certain actions taken in observance of
""the terms of . . . any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of [the Act].""
Rather, the court, relying on the EEOC's interpretive regulations, held that plans qualify for the  4(f)(2) exemption only if age-related reductions in benefits are justified by the increased cost of providing those benefits to older employees, which was not the case here.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that the exemption is available only to plans that can provide such cost justifications or establish a substantial business purpose.  The court rejected PERS' reliance on United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann, 434 U. S. 192, which, in upholding an age-based mandatory retirement plan, ruled that plans 
Page 492 U. S. 159
 adopted prior to the ADEA's enactment need not be justified by any business purpose, and defined ""subterfuge"" to mean ""a scheme, plan, strategem, or artifice of evasion.""  Instead, the court concluded that Congress had expressly repudiated McMann when it amended the ADEA in 1978 by adding a clause forbidding age-based mandatory retirement to the end of  4(f)(2).
Held:  Section 4(f)(2) exempts all provisions of bona fide employee benefit plans from the purview of the ADEA, unless the plan is a subterfuge for discrimination in the non-fringe-benefit aspects of the employment relationship, and summary judgment for appellee was therefore inappropriate.  Pp.  492 U. S. 165-182.
(a) An employee benefit plan adopted prior to the ADEA's enactment cannot be a subterfuge.  While the 1978 amendment to the ADEA changed the specific result in McMann, it did not change the controlling, general language of the statute.  Since Congress did not add a definition of ""subterfuge"" or modify  4(f)(2)'s language in any way other than by adding the new last phrase, there is no reason to depart from McMann's holding that ""subterfuge"" should be given its ordinary meaning.  However, this reaffirmation of McMann does not insulate the specific plan provision being attacked -- the 30% floor -- from challenge, since it was not added to the plan until 1976, after the ADEA became applicable to PERS.  Pp.  492 U. S. 165-169.
(b) Section 4(f)(2) does not protect age-based distinctions in employee benefit plans only when justified by the increased costs of benefits for older workers.  Thus, 29 CFR 1625.10, which recites such a definition, is invalid.  No such requirement can be found in the statute itself.  Moreover, 1625.10's definition is not entitled to deference, since the term ""subterfuge,"" as interpreted in McMann, includes a subjective intent element which 1625.10's objective requirement fails to acknowledge; since the regulation, contrary to the EEOC's suggestion, was not adopted contemporaneously with the ADEA's enactment, and since appellee's reliance on the ADEA's legislative history and the 1978 amendment is misplaced.  The cost-justification rule also is not supported by the argument that the statutory phrase that ""any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan"" is intended to limit  4(f)(2)'s protection to those plans which have a cost justification for all age-based differentials in benefits.  The statutory language, on its face, appears to be nothing more than a listing of the general types of plans that fall within the ""employee benefit plan"" category, rather than an exclusive listing.  Nor is it apparent that the specified plans were intentionally selected because the costs to employers of the benefits provided by these plans tend to increase with age.  In addition, the regulatory 
Page 492 U. S. 160
 definition of an employee benefit plan does not support the proffered interpretation.  Pp.  492 U. S. 169-175.
(c) Both the statute and the legislative history support a construction of  4(f)(2) that exempts the provisions of a bona fide benefit plan from the purview of the ADEA so long as the plan is not a method of discriminating in other, non-fringe-benefit aspects of the employment relationship.  Thus, a post-Act plan cannot be a subterfuge to evade the ADEA's purpose of banning arbitrary age discrimination unless it discriminates in a manner forbidden by the Act's substantive provisions.  If the ADEA's substantive prohibitions were read to encompass employee benefit plans, any employee benefit plan that, by its terms, mandated the discrimination allowed under  4(f)(2) would be facially irreconcilable with the purposes of the Act, a result Congress could not have intended.  Pp.  492 U. S. 175-180.
(d) An employee seeking to challenge an employee benefit plan provision as a subterfuge bears the burden of proving that the discriminatory plan provision actually was intended to serve the purpose of discriminating in some non-fringe-benefit aspect of the employment relationship.  Section 4(f)(2) redefines the elements of the plaintiff's prima facie case, since it is not so much a defense to an age discrimination charge as it is a description of the type of employer conduct that is prohibited in the employee benefit plan context.  This interpretation is consistent with this Court's longstanding interpretation of the analogous provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Summary judgment for appellee was inappropriate, because she failed to meet her burden of proof on this issue.  On remand, the District Court should give appellee an opportunity to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Pp.  492 U. S. 181-182.

Syllabus 
Respondent, who allegedly directed a large-scale heroin distribution enterprise, was indicted for alleged violations of racketeering laws, creation of a continuing criminal enterprise, and tax and firearm offenses.  The indictment also alleged that respondent had accumulated three specified assets as a result of his narcotics trafficking, which were subject to forfeiture under the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984, 21 U.S.C.  853.  After the indictment was unsealed, the District Court granted the Government's ex parte motion under  853(e)(1)(A) for a restraining order freezing the assets pending trial.  Respondent, raising various statutory arguments and claiming that the order interfered with his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice, moved to vacate the order to permit him to use frozen assets to retain an attorney.  He also sought a declaration that if the assets were used to pay attorney's fees,  853(c)'s third-party transfer provision would not be used to reclaim such payments if respondent was convicted and his assets forfeited.  The District Court denied the motion.  However, the Court of Appeals ultimately ordered that the restraining order be modified to permit the restrained assets to be used to pay attorney's fees.
Held:
1. There is no exemption from  853's forfeiture or pretrial restraining order provisions for assets that a defendant wishes to use to retain an attorney.  Pp.  491 U. S. 606-614.
(a) Section 853's language is plain and unambiguous.  Congress could not have chosen stronger words to express its intent that forfeiture be mandatory than  853(a)'s language that upon conviction a person ""shall forfeit . . . any property"" and that the sentencing court ""shall order"" a forfeiture.  Likewise, the statute provides a broad definition of property which does not even hint at the idea that assets used for attorney's fees are not included.  Every Court of Appeals that has finally passed on this argument has agreed with this view.  Neither the Act's legislative history nor legislators' post-enactment statements support respondent's argument that an exception should be created because the statute does not expressly include property to be used for attorney's fees, or because Congress simply did not consider the prospect that forfeiture 
Page 491 U. S. 601
 would reach such property.  To the contrary, in the Victims of Crime Act -- which requires forfeiture of a convicted defendant's collateral profits derived from his crimes and which was enacted simultaneously with the statute in question -- Congress adopted expressly the precise exemption from forfeiture which respondent is seeking to have implied in  853.  Moreover, respondent's admonition that courts should construe statutes to avoid decision as to their constitutionality is not license for the judiciary to rewrite statutory language.  Pp.  491 U. S. 606-611.
(b) Respondent's reading of  853(e)(1)(A) -- which provides that a district court ""may enter a restraining order or injunction . . . or take any other action to preserve the availability of property . . . for forfeiture"" -- misapprehends the nature of  853 by giving a district court equitable discretion to determine whether to exempt assets from pretrial restraint and by concluding that, if such assets are used for attorney's fees, they may not subsequently be seized for forfeiture to the Government under  853(c).  Section 853(e)(1)(A) plainly is aimed at implementing  853(a)'s commands, and cannot sensibly be construed to give the district court discretion to permit the dissipation of the very property it requires be forfeited upon conviction, since this would nullify  853(a)'s strong language, as well as  853(c)'s powerful ""relation-back"" provision.  Pp.  491 U. S. 611-614.
2. The restraining order did not violate respondent's right to counsel of choice as protected by the Sixth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  For the reasons stated in Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, post p.  491 U. S. 617, neither the Fifth nor the Sixth Amendment requires Congress to permit a defendant to use assets adjudged to be forfeitable to pay the defendant's legal fees.  Moreover, a defendant's assets may be frozen before conviction based on a finding of probable cause to believe the assets are forfeitable.  See, e.g., United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555; Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663.  Indeed, concluding that the Government could not restrain such property would be odd considering that, under appropriate circumstances, the Government may restrain persons accused of a serious offense on a probable cause finding.  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739.  Pp.  491 U. S. 614-616.

No. 87-1729
Argued March 21, 1989
Decided June 22, 1989
491 U.S. 617

Syllabus 
Christopher Reckmeyer was charged with running a massive drug importation and distribution scheme alleged to be a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) in violation of 21 U.S.C.  848.  Relying on a portion of the CCE statute that authorizes forfeiture to the Government of property acquired as a result of drug law violations,  853, the indictment sought forfeiture of specified assets in Reckmeyer's possession.  The District Court, acting pursuant to  853(e)(1)(A), entered a restraining order forbidding Reckmeyer from transferring any of the potentially forfeitable assets.  Nonetheless, he transferred $25,000 to petitioner, a law firm, for preindictment legal services.  Petitioner continued to represent Reckmeyer after his indictment.  Reckmeyer moved to modify the District Court's order to permit him to use some of the restrained assets to pay petitioner's fees and to exempt such assets from postconviction forfeiture.  However, before the court ruled on his motion, Reckmeyer entered a plea agreement with the Government in which, inter alia, he agreed to forfeit all of the specified assets.  The court then denied Reckmeyer's motion and, subsequently, entered an order forfeiting virtually all of his assets to the Government.  Petitioner -- arguing that assets used to pay an attorney are exempt from forfeiture under  853 and, if they are not, that the statute's failure to provide such an exemption renders it unconstitutional -- filed a petition under  853(n) seeking an adjudication of its third-party interest in the forfeited assets.  The District Court granted the relief sought.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the statute acknowledged no exception to its forfeiture requirement, and that the statutory scheme is constitutional.
Held:
1. For the reasons stated in United States v. Monsanto, ante, at  491 U. S. 611-614, whatever discretion  853(e) does provide district court judges to refuse to issue pretrial restraining orders on potentially forfeitable assets, it does not grant them equitable discretion to allow a defendant to withhold assets to pay bona fide attorney's fees.  Nor does the exercise of judges'  853(e) discretion ""immunize"" nonrestrained assets used for attorney's fees from subsequent forfeiture under  853(c), which provides for recapture of forfeitable assets transferred to third parties.  Pp.  491 U. S. 622-623. 
Page 491 U. S. 618

2. The forfeiture statute does not impermissibly burden a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to retain counsel of his choice.  A defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to spend another person's money for services rendered by an attorney, even if those funds are the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney of his choice.  Such money, though in his possession, is not rightfully his.  Petitioner's contention that, since the Government's claim to forfeitable assets rests on a penal statute that is merely a mechanism for preventing fraudulent conveyances of the assets, and is not a device for determining true title to property, the burden the statute places on a defendant's rights greatly outweighs the Government's interest in forfeiture is unsound.  Section 853(c) reflects the application of the long-recognized and lawful practice of vesting title to any forfeitable assets in the hands of the Government at the time of the criminal act giving rise to forfeiture.  Moreover, there is a strong governmental interest in obtaining full recovery of the assets, since the assets are deposited in a fund that supports law enforcement efforts, since the statute allows property to be recovered by its rightful owners, and since a major purpose behind forfeiture provisions such as the CCE's is to lessen the economic power of organized crime and drug enterprises, including the use of such power to retain private counsel.  Pp.  491 U. S. 624-633.
3. The forfeiture statute does not upset the balance of power between the Government and the accused in a manner contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Constitution does not forbid the imposition of an otherwise permissible criminal sanction, such as forfeiture, merely because, in some cases, prosecutors may abuse the processes available to them.  Such due process claims are cognizable only in specific cases of prosecutorial misconduct, which has not been alleged here.  Pp.  491 U. S. 633-635.
837 F.2d 637, affirmed.

491 U.S. 657

Syllabus 
Respondent was the unsuccessful challenger for the position of Municipal Judge of Hamilton, Ohio, in an election conducted on November 8, 1983.  A local newspaper, the Journal News, published by petitioner supported the reelection of the incumbent.  A little over a month before the election, the incumbent's Director of Court Services resigned and was arrested on bribery charges, and a grand jury investigation of those charges was in progress on November 1, 1983.  On that day, the Journal News ran a front-page story quoting a grand jury witness (Thompson) as stating that respondent had used ""dirty tricks"" and offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida ""in appreciation"" for their help in the investigation.  Respondent filed a diversity action against petitioner for libel in Federal District Court, alleging that the story was false, had damaged his personal and professional reputation, and had been published with actual malice.  After listening to six days of testimony and three taped interviews -- one conducted by respondent and two by Journal News reporters -- and reviewing the contents of 56 exhibits, the jury was given instructions defining the elements of public figure libel and directed to answer three special verdicts.  It found by a preponderance of the evidence that the story in question was defamatory and false, and by clear and convincing proof that the story was published with actual malice, and awarded respondent $5,000 in compensatory damages and $195,000 in punitive damages.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It separately considered the evidence supporting each of the jury's special verdicts, concluding that neither the finding that the story was defamatory nor the finding that it was false was clearly erroneous.  In considering the actual malice issue, but without attempting to make an independent evaluation of the credibility of conflicting oral testimony concerning the subsidiary facts underlying the jury's finding of actual malice, the court identified 11 subsidiary facts that the jury ""could have"" found, and held that such findings would not have been clearly erroneous, and, based on its independent review, that, when considered cumulatively, they provided clear and convincing evidence of actual malice. 
Page 491 U. S. 658

Held:
1. A showing of
""highly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers""
cannot alone support a verdict in favor of a public figure plaintiff in a libel action.  Rather, such a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the false and defamatory material with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge of falsity or with a reckless disregard for the truth.  Although there is language in the Court of Appeals' opinion suggesting that it applied the less severe professional standards rule, when read as a whole, it is clear that this language is merely supportive of the court's ultimate conclusion that the Journal News acted with actual malice.  Pp.  491 U. S. 663-668.
2. A reviewing court in a public figure libel case must ""exercise independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity"" to ensure that the verdict is consistent with the constitutional standard set out in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, and subsequent decisions.  See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485.  Based on this Court's review of the entire record, the Court of Appeals properly held that the evidence did in fact support a finding of actual malice, but it should have taken a somewhat different approach in reaching that result.  While the jury may have found each of the 11 subsidiary facts, the case should have been decided on a less speculative ground.  Given the trial court's instructions, the jury's answers to the three special interrogatories, and an understanding of those facts not in dispute, it is evident that the jury must have rejected (1) the testimony of petitioner's witnesses that Thompson's sister, the most important witness to the bribery charges against the Director of Court Services, was not contacted simply because respondent failed to place her in touch with the newspaper; (2) the testimony of the editorial director of the Journal News that he did not listen to the taped interviews simply because he thought that they would provide him with no new information; and (3) the testimony of Journal News employees who asserted that they believed Thompson's allegations were substantially true.  When those findings are considered alongside the undisputed evidence, the conclusion that the newspaper acted with actual malice inextricably follows.  The evidence in the record in this case, when reviewed in its entirety, is ""unmistakably"" sufficient to support a finding of actual malice.  Pp.  491 U. S. 685-693.

No. 87-2084
Argued March 28, 1989
Decided June 22, 1989
491 U.S. 701

Syllabus 
Petitioner Jett, a white male, was employed by respondent Dallas Independent School District (DISD) as a teacher, athletic director, and head football coach at a predominantly black high school.  After repeated clashes with the school's Principal Todd, a black man, over school policies and Jett's handling of the school's football program, Todd recommended that Jett be relieved of his duties as athletic director and coach.  The DISD's Superintendent Wright affirmed Todd's recommendation and reassigned Jett to a teaching position in another school, where he had no coaching duties.  Alleging, inter alia, that Todd's recommendation was racially motivated, and that the DISD, acting through Todd and Wright, had discriminated against him on the basis of race in violation of 42 U.S.C.  1981 and 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause, Jett brought this action in the District Court, which upheld a jury verdict in his favor on all counts.  The Court of Appeals reversed in part and remanded, finding, among other things, that the District Court's jury instructions as to the DISD's liability under  1983 were deficient, since (1) they did not make clear that, under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, such liability could be predicated on the actions of Todd or Wright only if those officials had been delegated policymaking authority or acted pursuant to a well settled custom that represented official policy; and (2) even if Wright could be considered a policymaker for purposes of the transfer of personnel, the jury made no finding that his decision to transfer Jett was either improperly motivated or consciously indifferent to the improper motivations of Todd.  The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court's conclusion that the DISD's  1981 liability for Todd's actions could be predicated on a respondeat superior theory, noting that Monell had held that Congress did not intend that municipalities be subject to vicarious liability under  1983 for the federal constitutional or statutory violations of their employees, and declaring that to impose such liability for only certain wrongs based on  1981 apparently would contravene the congressional intent behind  1983. 
Page 491 U. S. 702

Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part, and the case is remanded.  798 F.2d 748 and 837 F.2d 1244, affirmed in part and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III, and IV, concluding that:
1. A municipality may not be held liable for its employees' violations of  1981 under a respondeat superior theory.  The express ""action at law"" provided by  1983 for the ""deprivation of . . . rights secured by the Constitution and laws"" provides the exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by  1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor.  Cf., e.g., Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820, where the Court, in holding that  717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitutes the exclusive remedy for racial discrimination in federal employment despite the possibility of an implied damages remedy under  1981, invoked the general principle that a precisely drawn, detailed statute preempts more general remedies.  Monell, supra, specifically held that a municipality cannot be liable under  1983 on a respondeat superior theory, while the Courts of Appeals in post-Monell decisions have unanimously rejected the contention, analogous to petitioner's argument here, that that theory is available against municipalities under a Bivens-type action implied directly from the Fourteenth Amendment.  Given this Court's repeated recognition that the Fourteenth Amendment was largely intended to embody and expand the protections of  1981's statutory predecessor as against state actors, this Court declines petitioner's invitation to imply a damages remedy broader than  1983 from  1981's declaration of rights.  Creation of such a remedy would allow  1983's carefully crafted remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading.  Nor can a respondeat superior standard be implied from 42 U.S.C.  1988, since, although that statute does authorize district courts in civil rights actions to look to the common law if federal remedies are deficient, the statute specifically withdraws that authority where, as here, the common law remedy is inconsistent with federal law; i.e., with  1983.  See Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693,  411 U. S. 706,  411 U. S. 710, n. 27.  Thus, to prevail against the DISD, petitioner must show that the violation of his  1981 ""right to make contracts"" was caused by a custom or policy within the meaning of Monell and subsequent cases.  Pp.  491 U. S. 731-736.
2. These cases are remanded to the Court of Appeals to determine whether, in light of the principles enunciated in Monell, supra, and clarified in Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469, and St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, Superintendent Wright possessed final policymaking authority under Texas law in the area of employee transfers, and if so, whether a new trial is required to determine the DISD's responsibility for the actions of Principal Todd in light of this determination.  Although the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the District Court's 
Page 491 U. S. 703
 jury instructions constituted manifest error, the case was tried before Pembaur and Praprotnik were decided, and the Court of Appeals issued its decision before Praprotnik.  Pp.  491 U. S. 736-738.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Part II that the text and legislative history of both the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the precursors of  1981 and 1983, respectively, demonstrate that  1981 does not provide an independent federal damages remedy for racial discrimination by local governmental entities; rather, Congress intended that the explicit remedial provisions of  1983 control in the context of  1981 damages actions against state actors.
(a) The legislative history of the 1866 Act, which was originally enacted to implement the Thirteenth Amendment, demonstrates that that Act neither provided an express damages remedy for violation of its provisions nor created any original federal jurisdiction which could support such a remedy against state actors, and that the Act's penal section -- the only provision explicitly directed at state officials -- was designed to punish only the official committing a violation and not the municipality itself.  Two congressional actions subsequent to the passage of the 1866 Act -- the submission of the Fourteenth Amendment to the States for ratification, which Amendment was based upon, and widely viewed as ""constitutionalizing,"" that Act's protections, and the reenactment of that Act's substance in the Enforcement Act of 1870, a Fourteenth Amendment statute -- further evidence the relationship between  1981 and 1983 and demonstrate that  1981 is both a Thirteenth and a Fourteenth Amendment statute.  Pp.  491 U. S. 713-722.
(b) The text and legislative history of the 1871 Act, which was expressly enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, establish that:  (1) unlike any portion of the 1866 Act, that statute explicitly exposed state and local officials to liability for damages in a newly created ""action at law"" for deprivation of constitutional rights; (2) the Act expanded federal jurisdiction by explicitly providing original jurisdiction in the federal courts for prosecution of such actions; and (3) the provision of the Act which is now  1983 was explicitly modeled on the penal provision of the 1866 Act, and was intended to amend and enhance the protections of that provision by providing a parallel civil remedy for the same violations.  Thus, Jett's contention that the 1866 Act had already created a broader federal damages remedy against state actors is unpersuasive.  Moreover, the fact that Congress rejected the Sherman amendment to the 1871 Act -- which specifically proposed the imposition of vicarious liability on municipal governments for injuries caused by mob violence directed at the enjoyment or exercise of federal civil rights -- demonstrates an awareness of, and a desire to comply with, the then-reigning constitutional 
Page 491 U. S. 704
 doctrine of ""dual sovereignty,"" which indicated that Congress did not have the power to assign the duty to enforce federal law to state instrumentalities by making them liable for the constitutional violations of others.  Given this constitutional background, Jett's contention that the 1866 Act had already silently created a form of vicarious liability against municipal governments is historically untenable.  Furthermore, the addition, in 1874, of the phrase ""and laws"" to the remedial provision of what is now  1983 indicates an intent that the guarantees contained in what is now  1981 were to be enforced against state actors through  1983's express damages remedy.  Pp.  491 U. S. 722-731.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the respondeat superior question is properly decided solely on the rudimentary principles of construction that the specific -- here,  1983, which precludes liability on that basis for the precise category of offense at issue -- governs the general -- here,  1981 -- and that, where the text permits, statutes dealing with similar subjects should be interpreted harmoniously.  Pp.  491 U. S. 738-739.

491 U.S. 754

Syllabus 
After protracted litigation, respondents, a class of female flight attendants alleging that Trans World Airlines' policy of dismissing flight attendants who became mothers constituted sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, entered into a settlement agreement with TWA in which the airline agreed, inter alia, to credit class members with full company and union ""competitive"" seniority.  At this point, petitioner, the collective bargaining agent for TWA flight attendants, intervened in the lawsuit on behalf of incumbent flight attendants who would be adversely affected by the conferral of the seniority, challenging the settlement agreement on the grounds that (1) the court lacked jurisdiction to award equitable relief to one of the subclasses of respondents, and (2) the terms of the settlement would violate the existing collective bargaining agreement.  After this challenge was rejected, respondents petitioned the District Court for an award of attorney's fees against petitioner under  706(k) of the Act.  The court awarded fees against petitioner, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  District courts may award Title VII attorney's fees against those who are not charged with Title VII violations but intervene to protect their own rights only where the intervention is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Assessing fees against blameless intervenors is not essential to  706(k)'s central purpose of providing victims of wrongful discrimination an incentive to file suit.  The prospect of uncompensated fees in litigation against such persons exists in any event, since they may choose to attack the decree collaterally instead of intervening -- an undesirable result that the rule respondents urge would foster.

||"Ward v. Rock Against Racism
No. 88-226
Argued February 27, 1989
Decided June 22, 1989
491 U.S. 781

Syllabus 
Respondent Rock Against Racism (RAR), furnishing its own sound equipment and technicians, has sponsored yearly programs of rock music at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in New York City's Central Park.  The city received numerous complaints about excessive noise at RAR's concerts from users of the nearby Sheep Meadow, an area designated by the city for passive recreation, from other users of the park, and from residents of areas adjacent to the park.  Moreover, when the city shut off the power after RAR ignored repeated requests to lower the volume at one of its concerts, the audience became abusive and disruptive.  The city also experienced problems at bandshell events put on by other sponsors, who, due to their use of inadequate sound equipment or sound technicians unskilled at mixing sound for the bandshell area, were unable to provide sufficient amplification levels, resulting in disappointed or unruly audiences.  Rejecting various other solutions to the excessive noise and inadequate amplification problems, the city adopted a Use Guideline for the bandshell which specified that the city would furnish high quality sound equipment and retain an independent, experienced sound technician for all performances.  After the city implemented this guideline, RAR amended a preexisting District Court complaint against the city to seek damages and a declaratory judgment striking down the guideline as facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The court upheld the guideline, finding, inter alia, that performers who had used the city's sound system and technician had been uniformly pleased; that, although the city's technician ultimately controlled both sound volume and mix, the city's practice was to give the sponsor autonomy as to mix and to confer with him before turning the volume down; and that the city's amplification system was sufficient for RAR's needs.  Applying this Court's three-part test for judging the constitutionality of governmental regulation of the time, place, and manner of protected speech, the court found the guideline valid.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that such regulations' method and extent must be the least intrusive upon the freedom of expression as is reasonably necessary to achieve the regulations' purpose, finding that there were various less restrictive means by which the city could control excessive volume without also intruding on RAR's ability to control sound mix. 
Page 491 U. S. 782

Held:  The city's sound-amplification guideline is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of protected speech.  Pp.  491 U. S. 790-803.
(a) The guideline is content-neutral, since it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.  The city's principal justification -- the desire to control noise in order to retain the sedate character of the Sheep Meadow and other areas of the park and to avoid intrusion into residential areas -- has nothing to do with content.  The city's other justification, its interest in ensuring sound quality, does not render the guideline content-based as an attempt to impose subjective standards of acceptable sound mix on performers, since the city has expressly disavowed any such intent, and requires its technician to defer to the sponsor's wishes as to mix.  On the record below, the city's sound quality concern extends only to the clearly content-neutral goals of ensuring adequate amplification and avoiding volume problems associated with inadequate mix.  There is no merit to RAR's argument that the guideline is nonetheless invalid on its face because it places unbridled discretion in the hands of city enforcement officials.  Even granting the doubtful proposition that this claim falls within the narrow class of permissible facial challenges to allegedly unconstrained grants of regulatory authority, the claim nevertheless fails, since the guideline's own terms in effect forbid officials purposely to select an inadequate system or to vary sound quality or volume based on the performer's message.  Moreover, the city has applied a narrowing construction to the guideline by requiring officials to defer to sponsors on sound quality and confer with them as to volume problems, and by mandating that amplification be sufficient for the sound to reach all concert-ground listeners.  Pp.  491 U. S. 791-796.
(b) The guideline is narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests.  That the city has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from unwelcome and excessive noise, even in a traditional public forum such as the park, cannot be doubted.  Moreover, it has a substantial interest in ensuring the sufficiency of sound amplification at bandshell events in order to allow citizens to enjoy the benefits of the park, in light of the evidence that inadequate amplification had resulted in the inability of some audiences to hear performances.  The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the city to prove that the guideline was the least intrusive means of furthering these legitimate interests, since a ""less-restrictive-alternative analysis"" has never been -- and is here, again, specifically rejected as -- a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place, or manner regulation.  See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288,  468 U. S. 293; Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641.

The city also could reasonably have determined that, overall, its interest in ensuring that sound amplification was sufficient to reach all concert-ground listeners would be served less effectively without the guideline than with it, since, by providing competent technicians and adequate equipment, the city eliminated inadequate amplification problems that plagued some performers in the past.

(c) The guideline leaves open ample alternative channels of communication, since it does not attempt to ban any particular manner or type of expression at a given place and time.  Rather, it continues to permit expressive activity in the bandshell, and has no effect on the quantity or content of that expression beyond regulating the extent of amplification.  That the city's volume limitations may reduce to some degree the potential audience for RAR's speech is of no consequence, since there has been no showing that the remaining avenues of communication are inadequate.

			"|"Ward v. Rock Against Racism
No. 88-226
Argued February 27, 1989
Decided June 22, 1989
491 U.S. 781

Syllabus 
Respondent Rock Against Racism (RAR), furnishing its own sound equipment and technicians, has sponsored yearly programs of rock music at the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell in New York City's Central Park.  The city received numerous complaints about excessive noise at RAR's concerts from users of the nearby Sheep Meadow, an area designated by the city for passive recreation, from other users of the park, and from residents of areas adjacent to the park.  Moreover, when the city shut off the power after RAR ignored repeated requests to lower the volume at one of its concerts, the audience became abusive and disruptive.  The city also experienced problems at bandshell events put on by other sponsors, who, due to their use of inadequate sound equipment or sound technicians unskilled at mixing sound for the bandshell area, were unable to provide sufficient amplification levels, resulting in disappointed or unruly audiences.  Rejecting various other solutions to the excessive noise and inadequate amplification problems, the city adopted a Use Guideline for the bandshell which specified that the city would furnish high quality sound equipment and retain an independent, experienced sound technician for all performances.  After the city implemented this guideline, RAR amended a preexisting District Court complaint against the city to seek damages and a declaratory judgment striking down the guideline as facially invalid under the First Amendment.  The court upheld the guideline, finding, inter alia, that performers who had used the city's sound system and technician had been uniformly pleased; that, although the city's technician ultimately controlled both sound volume and mix, the city's practice was to give the sponsor autonomy as to mix and to confer with him before turning the volume down; and that the city's amplification system was sufficient for RAR's needs.  Applying this Court's three-part test for judging the constitutionality of governmental regulation of the time, place, and manner of protected speech, the court found the guideline valid.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that such regulations' method and extent must be the least intrusive upon the freedom of expression as is reasonably necessary to achieve the regulations' purpose, finding that there were various less restrictive means by which the city could control excessive volume without also intruding on RAR's ability to control sound mix. 
Page 491 U. S. 782

Held:  The city's sound-amplification guideline is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of protected speech.  Pp.  491 U. S. 790-803.
(a) The guideline is content-neutral, since it is justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.  The city's principal justification -- the desire to control noise in order to retain the sedate character of the Sheep Meadow and other areas of the park and to avoid intrusion into residential areas -- has nothing to do with content.  The city's other justification, its interest in ensuring sound quality, does not render the guideline content-based as an attempt to impose subjective standards of acceptable sound mix on performers, since the city has expressly disavowed any such intent, and requires its technician to defer to the sponsor's wishes as to mix.  On the record below, the city's sound quality concern extends only to the clearly content-neutral goals of ensuring adequate amplification and avoiding volume problems associated with inadequate mix.  There is no merit to RAR's argument that the guideline is nonetheless invalid on its face because it places unbridled discretion in the hands of city enforcement officials.  Even granting the doubtful proposition that this claim falls within the narrow class of permissible facial challenges to allegedly unconstrained grants of regulatory authority, the claim nevertheless fails, since the guideline's own terms in effect forbid officials purposely to select an inadequate system or to vary sound quality or volume based on the performer's message.  Moreover, the city has applied a narrowing construction to the guideline by requiring officials to defer to sponsors on sound quality and confer with them as to volume problems, and by mandating that amplification be sufficient for the sound to reach all concert-ground listeners.  Pp.  491 U. S. 791-796.
(b) The guideline is narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests.  That the city has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from unwelcome and excessive noise, even in a traditional public forum such as the park, cannot be doubted.  Moreover, it has a substantial interest in ensuring the sufficiency of sound amplification at bandshell events in order to allow citizens to enjoy the benefits of the park, in light of the evidence that inadequate amplification had resulted in the inability of some audiences to hear performances.  The Court of Appeals erred in requiring the city to prove that the guideline was the least intrusive means of furthering these legitimate interests, since a ""less-restrictive-alternative analysis"" has never been -- and is here, again, specifically rejected as -- a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place, or manner regulation.  See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288,  468 U. S. 293; Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641.  The requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial governmental interest that would be 
Page 491 U. S. 783
 achieved less effectively absent the regulation, and the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve that interest.  If these standards are met, courts should defer to the government's reasonable determination.  Here, the city's substantial interest in limiting sound volume is served in a direct and effective way by the requirement that its technician control the mixing board.  Absent this requirement, the city's interest would have been served less well, as is evidenced by the excessive noise complaints generated by RAR's past concerts.  The city also could reasonably have determined that, overall, its interest in ensuring that sound amplification was sufficient to reach all concert-ground listeners would be served less effectively without the guideline than with it, since, by providing competent technicians and adequate equipment, the city eliminated inadequate amplification problems that plagued some performers in the past.  Furthermore, in the absence of evidence that the guideline had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability of performers to achieve the quality of sound they desired, there is no merit to RAR's contention that the guideline is substantially broader than necessary to achieve the city's legitimate ends.  Pp.  491 U. S. 796-802.
(c) The guideline leaves open ample alternative channels of communication, since it does not attempt to ban any particular manner or type of expression at a given place and time.

No. 88-155
Argued March 21, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 397

Syllabus 
During the 1984 Republican National Convention, respondent Johnson participated in a political demonstration to protest the policies of the Reagan administration and some Dallas-based corporations.  After a march through the city streets, Johnson burned an American flag while protesters chanted.  No one was physically injured or threatened with injury, although several witnesses were seriously offended by the flag burning.  Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object in violation of a Texas statute, and a state court of appeals affirmed.  However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that the State, consistent with the First Amendment, could not punish Johnson for burning the flag in these circumstances.  The court first found that Johnson's burning of the flag was expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.  The court concluded that the State could not criminally sanction flag desecration in order to preserve the flag as a symbol of national unity.  It also held that the statute did not meet the State's goal of preventing breaches of the peace, since it was not drawn narrowly enough to encompass only those flag burnings that would likely result in a serious disturbance, and since the flag burning in this case did not threaten such a reaction.  Further, it stressed that another Texas statute prohibited breaches of the peace and could be used to prevent disturbances without punishing this flag desecration.
Held:  Johnson's conviction for flag desecration is inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.  491 U. S. 402-420.
(a) Under the circumstances, Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment.  The State conceded that the conduct was expressive.  Occurring as it did at the end of a demonstration coinciding with the Republican National Convention, the expressive, overtly political nature of the conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent.  Pp.  491 U. S. 402-406.
(b) Texas has not asserted an interest in support of Johnson's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression and would therefore permit application of the test set forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, whereby an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct.  An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record.  Expression may not be prohibited 
Page 491 U. S. 398
 on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.  Johnson's expression of dissatisfaction with the Federal Government's policies also does not fall within the class of ""fighting words"" likely to be seen as a direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs.  This Court's holding does not forbid a State to prevent ""imminent lawless action"" and, in fact, Texas has a law specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace.  Texas' interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity is related to expression in this case and, thus, falls outside the O'Brien test.  Pp.  491 U. S. 406-410.
(c) The latter interest does not justify Johnson's conviction.  The restriction on Johnson's political expression is content based, since the Texas statute is not aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but is designed to protect it from intentional and knowing abuse that causes serious offense to others.  It is therefore subject to ""the most exacting scrutiny.""  Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312.  The Government may not prohibit the verbal or nonverbal expression of an idea merely because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable, even where our flag is involved.  Nor may a State foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expressive conduct relating to it, since the Government may not permit designated symbols to be used to communicate a limited set of messages.  Moreover, this Court will not create an exception to these principles protected by the First Amendment for the American flag alone.  Pp.  491 U. S. 410-422.

No. 88-429
Argued April 17, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 440

Syllabus 
To aid the President in fulfilling his constitutional duty to appoint federal judges, the Department of Justice regularly seeks advice from the Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association (ABA) regarding potential nominees for judgeships.  The ABA Committee's investigations, reports, and votes on potential nominees are kept confidential, although its rating of a particular candidate is made public if he or she is in fact nominated.  Appellant Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) filed suit against the Justice Department after the ABA Committee refused WLF's request for the names of potential nominees it was considering and for its reports and minutes of its meetings.  The action was brought under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which, among other things, defines an ""advisory committee"" as any group ""established or utilized"" by the President or an agency to give advice on public questions, and requires a covered group to file a charter, afford notice of its meetings, open those meetings to the public, and make its minutes, records, and reports available to the public.  Joined by appellant Public Citizen, WLF asked the District Court to declare the Committee an ""advisory group"" subject to FACA's requirements and to enjoin the Department from utilizing the ABA Committee until it complied with those requirements.  The court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Department's use of the ABA Committee is subject to FACA's strictures, but ruling that applying FACA to the ABA Committee would unconstitutionally infringe on the President's Article II power to nominate federal judges and violate the doctrine of separation of powers.
Held:
1. Appellants have standing to bring this suit.  The refusal to permit them to scrutinize the ABA Committee's activities to the extent FACA allows constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing, and the fact that other groups or citizens might make the same complaint as appellants does not lessen that injury.  Moreover, although the statute's 
Page 491 U. S. 441
 disclosure exemptions might bar public access to many of the meetings appellants seek to attend and many of the documents they wish to view, the exemptions probably would not deny access to all meetings and documents, particularly discussions and documents regarding the ABA Committee's overall functioning, and would not excuse the ABA Committee's noncompliance with FACA's other provisions, such as those requiring a covered organization to file a charter and give notice of its meetings.  Thus, appellants may gain significant and genuine relief if they prevail in their suit, and such potential gains are sufficient to give them standing.  Pp.  491 U. S. 448-451.
2. FACA does not apply to the Justice Department's solicitation of the ABA Committee's views on prospective judicial nominees.  Pp.  491 U. S. 451-467.
(a) Whether the ABA Committee is an ""advisory committee"" under FACA depends upon whether it is ""utilized"" by the President or the Department within the statute's meaning.  Read unqualifiedly, that verb would extend FACA's coverage to the ABA Committee.  However, since FACA was enacted to cure specific ills -- particularly the wasteful expenditure of public funds for worthless committee meetings and biased proposals by special interest groups -- it is unlikely that Congress intended the statute to cover every formal and informal consultation between the President or an Executive agency and a group rendering advice.  When the literal reading of a statutory term compels an odd result, this Court searches beyond the bare text for other evidence of congressional intent.  Pp.  491 U. S. 451-455.
(b) Although the question is a close one, a careful review of the regulatory scheme prior to FACA's enactment and that statute's legislative history strongly suggests that Congress did not intend that the term ""utilized"" apply to the Justice Department's use of the ABA Committee.  FACA's regulatory predecessor, Executive Order No. 11007, applied to advisory committees formed by a governmental unit, and to those not so formed when ""being utilized by [the Government] in the same manner as a Government-formed . . . committee.""  That the ABA Committee was never deemed to be ""utilized"" in the relevant sense is evidenced by the fact that no President operating under the Order or any Justice Department official ever applied the Order to the ABA Committee, despite its highly visible role in advising the Department as to potential nominees.  That is not surprising, since the ABA Committee -- which was formed privately, rather than at the Government's prompting, to assist the President in performing a constitutionally specified function, and which receives no federal funds and is not amenable to the strict management by agency officials envisaged by the Order -- cannot easily be said to have been ""utilized"" in the same manner as a Government-formed committee.  Moreover, FACA adopted many of the Order's provisions, and there is 
Page 491 U. S. 442
 considerable evidence in the statute's legislative history that Congress sought only to achieve compliance with FACA's more stringent requirements by advisory committees already covered by the Order and by Presidential advisory committees, and that the statute's ""or utilized"" phrase was intended to clarify that FACA applies to committees ""established . . . by"" the Government in a generous sense of that term, encompassing groups formed indirectly by quasi-public organizations ""for"" public agencies as well as ""by"" such agencies themselves.  Read in this way, the word ""utilized"" does not describe the Justice Department's use of the ABA Committee.  Pp.  491 U. S. 455-465.
(c) Construing FACA to apply to the Justice Department's consultations with the ABA Committee would present formidable constitutional difficulties.  Where, as here, a plausible alternative construction exists that will allow the Court to avoid such problems, the Court will adopt that construction.  See, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.

Railway Labor Executives' Association
No. 87-1589
Argued March 29, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
Faced with heavy losses, petitioner Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Co. (P&LE) agreed to sell its assets to P&LE Rail Co., Inc. (Railco), a newly formed subsidiary of another railroad.  Railco intended to operate the railroad as P&LE had except that it would not assume P&LE's various collective bargaining contracts, and would need only 250 of the 750 employees then working for P&LE.  P&LE rejected the assertion of the unions representing its employees that the proposed sale could not be implemented until P&LE complied with the Railway Labor Act (RLA) provisions prohibiting carriers from changing rates of pay, rules, or working conditions embodied in agreements, 45 U.S.C.  152 Seventh, unless they first give at least 30 days' written notice of, and proceed to bargain over, the intended agreement change,  156.  Section 156 also requires that the working conditions in question remain in status quo until the controversy is resolved.  Most of the unions then filed  156 notices proposing extensive changes in existing agreements to ameliorate the proposed sale's adverse impact on employees.  P&LE again refused to bargain, asserting that the sale was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), which requires that noncarriers such as Railco seeking to acquire a rail line first obtain the ICC's approval, 49 U.S.C.  10901.  Respondent Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) filed suit on behalf of the unions in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to P&LE's RLA obligations and an injunction against the sale pending completion of RLA bargaining.  The unions then went on strike, and the District Court denied P&LE's request for a restraining order on the ground that the Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLGA) prohibited it from enjoining a work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute.  Subsequently, Railco filed an application for exemption from  10901's requirements pursuant to the ICC's Ex Parte No. 392 Class Exemption (Ex Parte 392), which provides abbreviated procedures 
Page 491 U. S. 491
 for seeking approval for acquisitions by noncarriers of an operating railroad or its assets, and the ICC allowed the exemption to become effective on the date required by Ex Parte 392.   Although  10901 and Ex Parte 392 allow the ICC to require the acquiring company to provide protection for railroad employees affected by a sale, none of the unions requested protective provisions.  The District Court then granted P&LE's reapplication for an order restraining the strike, ruling that the ICC's approval of the sale negated any duty that P&LE had to bargain over the sale's effects on its employees, and that the NLGA did not forbid issuance of an injunction under such circumstances.  However, the Court of Appeals summarily reversed, holding that the ICA did not require accommodation of the NLGA's restrictions on the District Court's powers, and remanding for a determination whether the sale or strike violated the RLA.  The District Court then held that, although P&LE did not have a duty to bargain over its decision to sell, the RLA required it to bargain over the sale's effects on its employees, and that  156's status quo provision required that P&LE's RLA bargaining obligations be satisfied before the sale could be consummated despite the ICC's approval of the transaction.  The court therefore granted RLEA's request for an injunction against the sale, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  This Court then granted P&LE's petitions for certiorari challenging, in No. 87-1888, the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the injunction against the sale and seeking, in No. 87-1589, reversal of the Court of Appeals' judgment setting aside the strike injunction.
Held:
1. The RLA did not require or authorize an injunction against the sale of P&LE's assets to Railco.  Pp.  491 U. S. 502-512.
(a) The RLA did not require P&LE itself to give notice of its decision to sell and thereafter to bargain about the effects of the sale.  Section 156 requires those actions only when the carrier is proposing a ""change in agreements.""  In holding that the loss of jobs resulting from the proposed sale clearly would require such a ""change,"" the Court of Appeals did not point out how the sale would alter any specific provision of any agreement; did not suggest that any such agreement dealt with the possibility of a sale, sought to confer any rights on employees in the event of a sale, or guaranteed that jobs would be available indefinitely; and did not explain how P&LE's decision to remove itself from the railroad business and terminate its position as a railroad employer would violate or require changing any agreement.  Nor did the court purport to find an implied agreement that P&LE would not go out of business, would not sell its assets, or would protect its employees from the adverse consequences of a sale.  Pp.  491 U. S. 503-504. 
Page 491 U. S. 492

(b) Although the unions'  156 notices may have proposed far-reaching changes in the existing agreements, the giving of those notices did not obligate P&LE to maintain the status quo and to postpone its sale to Railco beyond the time the sale was approved by the ICC and was scheduled to be consummated.  Detroit & Toledo Shore Line Railroad Co. v. Transportation Union, 396 U. S. 142 -- which held that, when a rail union files a  156 notice, the status quo provision forbids the railroad to make any change in preexisting ""objective working conditions"" even if those conditions are not contained in express or implied agreements -- does not control here, primarily because that case did not involve a carrier's decision to quit the railroad business, sell its assets, and cease to be a railroad employer.  Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., 380 U. S. 263, established that the decision to close down a business entirely is so much a management prerogative that only an unmistakable expression of congressional intent will require a ruling to the contrary.  The RLA contains no expression of intent to render an employer's decision to go out of business and consequently to reduce to zero the number of available jobs a change in the conditions of employment forbidden by  156's status quo provision.  Where, as here, the collective bargaining agreement is silent concerning the sale of a railroad's assets and the railroad has proceeded in accordance with the ICA to obtain the ICC's approval of the sale, a union cannot delay the immediate consummation of the sale by filing a  156 notice.  This construction of the RLA satisfies the Court's obligation to avoid conflicts between overlapping statutory regimes, since it maintains the ICC's plenary authority over rail acquisitions by noncarriers.  In contrast, enjoining the sale's consummation based on the unions'  156 notices would likely result in the sale's cancellation and the frustration of Congress' intent through ICA amendments to deregulate the rail industry and to assist small rail lines with financial problems.  Pp.  491 U. S. 504-511
(c) However, P&LE did have a limited duty to bargain in response to the unions'  156 notices.  Its decision to sell, as such, was not a bargainable subject.  Nevertheless, to the extent that it could satisfy the unions' proposals for changes, it was required to bargain about the effects that the sale would or might have upon its employees.  That obligation ceased on the date for closing the sale after the Ex Parte 392 exemption became effective.  P.  491 U. S. 512
2. The record is insufficient to allow this Court to determine whether the Court of Appeals correctly set aside the injunction against the strike.  Although the NLGA's general limitation on district courts' power to issue injunctions in labor disputes must give way when necessary to enforce a duty specifically imposed by another statute, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the ICA creates no such duty.  While  10901 
Page 491 U. S. 493
 does authorize the ICC to impose labor protective provisions and gives unions the right to seek such protection and the right to judicial review if dissatisfied, no applicable ICA provision requires unions to participate in ICC proceedings or to seek protection rather than striking.  Furthermore, labor protection provisions run against the acquiring railroad rather than the seller, and nothing in the ICA relieved P&LE of its duty to bargain with the unions until its transaction was completed or empowered the ICC to intrude into the relationship between P&LE and the unions.  However, the NLGA's limitation on injunctions must also be accommodated to the specific provisions of the RLA, such that district courts have jurisdiction and power to issue injunctive orders against strikes violative of those provisions.  Since neither of the lower courts ever ruled on whether the RLA creates a duty not to strike while its dispute resolution mechanisms are underway, the matter must be resolved on remand.  Pp.  491 U. S. 513-515.

|491 u.s. 524|"Florida Star v. B.J.F.
No. 87-329
Argued March 21, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 524

Syllabus 
Appellant, The Florida Star, is a newspaper which publishes a ""Police Reports"" section containing brief articles describing local criminal incidents under police investigation.  After appellee B.J.F. reported to the Sheriff's Department (Department) that she had been robbed and sexually assaulted, the Department prepared a report, which identified B.J.F. by her full name, and placed it in the Department's pressroom.  The Department does not restrict access to the room or to the reports available there.  A Star reporter-trainee sent to the pressroom copied the police report verbatim, including B.J.F.'s full name.  Consequently, her name was included in a ""Police Reports"" story in the paper, in violation of the Star's internal policy.  Florida Stat.  794.03 makes it unlawful to ""print, publish, or broadcast . . . in any instrument of mass communication"" the name of the victim of a sexual offense.  B.J.F. filed suit in a Florida court alleging, inter alia, that the Star had negligently violated  794.03.  The trial court denied the Star's motion to dismiss, which claimed, among other things, that imposing civil sanctions on the newspaper pursuant to  794.03 violated the First Amendment.  However, it granted B.J.F.'s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence, finding the Star per se negligent based on its violation of  794.03.  The jury then awarded B.J.F. both compensatory and punitive damages.  The verdict was upheld on appeal.
Held:  Imposing damages on the Star for publishing B.J.F.'s name violates the First Amendment.  Pp.  491 U. S. 530-541.
(a) The sensitivity and significance of the interests presented in clashes between First Amendment and privacy rights counsels the Court to rely on limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case, rather than to accept invitations to hold broadly that truthful publication may never be punished consistent with the First Amendment or that publication of a rape victim's name never enjoys constitutional protection.  One such principle is that,
""if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance, then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order.""
Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U. S. 97,  443 U. S. 103.  
Page 491 U. S. 525
 Applied to the instant case, the Daily Mail principle commands reversal.  Pp.  491 U. S. 530-536.
(b) The Star ""lawfully obtain[ed] truthful information.""  The actual news article was accurate, and the Star lawfully obtained B.J.F.'s name from the government.  The fact that state officials are not required to disclose such reports or that the Sheriff's Department apparently failed to fulfill its  794.03 obligation not to cause or allow B.J.F.'s name to be published does not make it unlawful for the Star to have received the information, and Florida has taken no steps to proscribe such receipt.  The government has ample means to safeguard the information that are less drastic than punishing truthful publication.  Furthermore, it is clear that the news article generally, as opposed to the specific identity contained in it, involved ""a matter of public significance"":  the commission, and investigation, of a violent crime that had been reported to authorities.  Pp.  491 U. S. 536-537.
(c) Imposing liability on the Star does not serve ""a need to further a state interest of the highest order.""  Although the interests in protecting the privacy and safety of sexual assault victims and in encouraging them to report offenses without fear of exposure are highly significant, imposing liability on the Star in this case is too precipitous a means of advancing those interests.  Since the Star obtained the information because the Sheriff's Department failed to abide by  794.03's policy, the imposition of damages can hardly be said to be a narrowly tailored means of safeguarding anonymity.  Self-censorship is especially likely to result from imposition of liability when a newspaper gains access to the information from a government news release.  Moreover, the negligence per se standard adopted by the courts below does not permit case-by-case findings that the disclosure was one a reasonable person would find offensive, and does not have a scienter requirement of any kind.  In addition,  794.03's facial underinclusiveness -- which prohibits publication only by an ""instrument of mass communication"" and does not prohibit the spread of victims' names by other means -- raises serious doubts about whether Florida is serving the interests specified by B.J.F.  A State must demonstrate its commitment to the extraordinary measure of punishing truthful publication in the name of privacy by applying its prohibition evenhandedly to both the small-time disseminator and the media giant.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as part of its investigation of the tax returns of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology (the Church), filed in the Federal District Court a petition to enforce a summons it had served upon the Clerk of the Los Angeles County Superior Court demanding that he produce documents, including two tapes, in his possession in conjunction with a pending suit.  The Church and Mary Sue Hubbard, intervenors in the state court action and respondents here, intervened to oppose production of the materials.  They claimed, inter alia, that the IRS was not seeking the materials in good faith, and that the attorney-client privilege barred the tapes' disclosure.  The IRS argued, among other things, that the tapes fell within the exception to the attorney-client privilege for communications in furtherance of future illegal conduct -- the so-called ""crime-fraud"" exception -- and urged the District Court to listen to the tapes in making its privilege determination.  In addition, the IRS submitted a declaration by a special agent which had included partial tape transcripts the IRS lawfully had obtained.  The court rejected respondents' bad-faith claim and ordered production of five of the requested documents, but it conditioned its enforcement order by placing restrictions upon IRS dissemination of the documents.  The court also ruled that the tapes need not be produced, since they contained privileged attorney-client communications to which, the quoted excerpts revealed, the crime-fraud exception did not apply.  The court rejected the request that it listen to the tapes, on the ground that that request had been abandoned in favor of using the agent's declaration as the basis for determining the privilege question.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conditional enforcement order.  As to the privilege issue, it agreed with respondents that the District Court would have been without power to grant the IRS' demand for in camera review of the tapes because the Government's evidence of crime or fraud must come from sources independent of the attorney-client communications on the tapes.  Reviewing the independent evidence (a review that excluded the partial transcripts), the court affirmed the District Court's determination as to the inapplicability of the crime-fraud exception.

Held:
1. Insofar as it upheld the District Court's conditional enforcement order, the Court of Appeals' judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.  P.  491 U. S. 561.
2. In appropriate circumstances, in camera review of allegedly privileged attorney-client communications may be used to determine whether the communications fall within the crime-fraud exception.  Pp.  491 U. S. 562-575.
(a) Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a), which provides that a court is bound by the rules of evidence with respect to privileges when determining the existence of a privilege, does not prohibit the use of in camera review.  Pp.  491 U. S. 565-570.
(b) However, before a district court may engage in in camera review at the request of the party opposing the privilege, that party must present evidence sufficient to support a reasonable belief that such review may reveal evidence that establishes the exception's applicability.  Once this threshold showing is made, the decision whether to engage in in camera review rests in the sound discretion of the court.  Pp.  491 U. S. 570-572.
(c) The party opposing the privilege may use any relevant nonprivileged evidence, lawfully obtained, to meet the threshold showing, even if its evidence is not ""independent"" of the contested communications as the Court of Appeals uses that term.  Pp.  491 U. S. 573-574.
(d) On remand, the Court of Appeals should consider whether the District Court's refusal to listen to the tapes in toto was justified by the manner in which the IRS presented and preserved its in camera review request.  If its demand was properly preserved, that court, or the District Court on remand, should determine whether the IRS has presented a sufficient evidentiary basis for in camera review and whether it is appropriate for the District Court, in its discretion, to grant the request.

No. 88-40
Argued March 20, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 554

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as part of its investigation of the tax returns of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology (the Church), filed in the Federal District Court a petition to enforce a summons it had served upon the Clerk of the Los Angeles County Superior Court demanding that he produce documents, including two tapes, in his possession in conjunction with a pending suit.  The Church and Mary Sue Hubbard, intervenors in the state court action and respondents here, intervened to oppose production of the materials.  They claimed, inter alia, that the IRS was not seeking the materials in good faith, and that the attorney-client privilege barred the tapes' disclosure.  The IRS argued, among other things, that the tapes fell within the exception to the attorney-client privilege for communications in furtherance of future illegal conduct -- the so-called ""crime-fraud"" exception -- and urged the District Court to listen to the tapes in making its privilege determination.  In addition, the IRS submitted a declaration by a special agent which had included partial tape transcripts the IRS lawfully had obtained.  The court rejected respondents' bad-faith claim and ordered production of five of the requested documents, but it conditioned its enforcement order by placing restrictions upon IRS dissemination of the documents.  The court also ruled that the tapes need not be produced, since they contained privileged attorney-client communications to which, the quoted excerpts revealed, the crime-fraud exception did not apply.

|491 u.s. 576|"Massachusetts v. Oakes
No. 87-1651
Argued January 17, 1989
Decided June 21, 1989
491 U.S. 576

Syllabus 
In 1984, respondent Oakes took color photographs of his partially nude and physically mature 14-year-old stepdaughter, L.S.  He was indicted, tried, and convicted of violating a Massachusetts statute ( 29A) prohibiting adults from posing or exhibiting minors ""in a state of nudity"" for purposes of visual representation or reproduction in any publication, motion picture, photograph, or picture.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reversed the conviction.  After holding that Oakes' posing of L.S. was speech for First Amendment purposes, the court struck down the statute as substantially overbroad under the First Amendment without addressing whether  29A could be constitutionally applied to Oakes.  It concluded that  29A criminalized conduct that virtually every person would regard as lawful, such as the taking of family photographs of nude infants.  Subsequently,  29A was amended to add a ""lascivious intent"" requirement to the ""nudity"" portion of the statute and to eliminate exemptions contained in the prior version.
Held:  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
401 Mass. 602, 518 N.E.2d 836, vacated and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHlTE, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that:
1. As a practical matter, the intervening amendment of the statute moots the overbreadth question in this case.  Thus, overbreadth analysis is inappropriate under Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809.  The overbreadth doctrine -- an exception to the general rule that a person to whom a statute may be constitutionally applied can no longer challenge the statute on the ground that it may be unconstitutionally applied to others -- is designed to prevent the chilling of protected expression, which the former version of  29A cannot do, since it has been repealed.  That overbreadth was discussed and rejected as a mode of analysis in Bigelow -- where there was no need to comment on that issue, since the defendant's conviction was reversed on the narrower and alternative ground that the statute was unconstitutional as applied -- is evidence that the application of Bigelow does not depend on whether other questions presented will be answered adversely to the defendant.  It is not constitutionally offensive to decline to reach Oakes' challenge, since an overbroad statute is not void ab initio, but merely voidable.  Since the special 
Page 491 U. S. 577
 concern that animates the overbreadth doctrine is no longer present, the doctrine's benefits need not be extended to a defendant whose conduct is not protected.  Moreover, the amendment of a state statute pending appeal to eliminate overbreadth is not different, in terms of applying the new law to past conduct, from a state appellate court adopting a limiting construction of a statute to cure overbreadth.  This Court has long held in the latter situation that the statute, as construed, may be applied to conduct occurring before the limiting construction.  Pp.  491 U. S. 581-594.
2. Since the sole issue before this Court has become moot, and a live dispute remains as to whether the former version of  29A can constitutionally be applied to Oakes, this case is remanded for a determination of that remaining live issue.  Pp.  491 U. S. 584-585.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that the subsequent amendment of  29A to eliminate the basis for the overbreadth challenge does not eliminate the overbreadth defense.  The overbreadth doctrine serves to protect constitutionally legitimate speech not only after an offending statute is enacted, but also when a legislature is contemplating what sort of statute to enact.  If no conviction of constitutionally proscribable conduct would be lost, so long as the offending statute was narrowed before the final appeal, legislatures would have significantly reduced incentive to stay within constitutional bounds in the first place.  Moreover, while this Court has the power to adopt a rule of law which says that the defendant's acts were lawful because the statute that sought to prohibit them was overbroad and therefore invalid, it does not have the power to pursue the policy underlying that rule by conditioning the defendant's criminal liability on whether, by the time his last appeal is exhausted, letting him challenge the statute might serve to eliminate any First Amendment ""chill.""  Pp.  491 U. S. 585-588.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, also concluded that the case should be remanded for the court below to dispose of the as-applied challenge, since the statute is not impermissibly overbroad.  The scope of this statute has already been validated except as to nonpornographic depictions, New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, and has been narrowed further by statutory exemptions, and any possibly unconstitutional application of it -- for example, to artistic depictions not otherwise exempt or to family photographs -- is insubstantial judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.  Pp.  491 U. S. 588-590.
O'CONNOR, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE and KENNEDY, JJ., joined.  SCALIA, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, in which BLACKMUN, J., joined, and in which BRENNAN,

Syllabus 
In this major school desegregation litigation in Kansas City, Missouri, in which various desegregation remedies were granted against the State of Missouri and other defendants, the plaintiff class was represented by a Kansas City lawyer (Benson) and by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF).  Benson and the LDF requested attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C.  1988), which provides with respect to such litigation that the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, ""a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""  In calculating the hourly rates for Benson's, his associates', and the LDF attorneys' fees, the District Court took account of delay in payment by using current market rates, rather than those applicable at the time the services were rendered.  Both Benson and the LDF employed numerous paralegals, law clerks, and recent law graduates, and the court awarded fees for their work based on market rates, again using current, rather than historic rates, in order to compensate for the delay in payment.
Held:
1. The Eleventh Amendment does not prohibit enhancement of a fee award under  1988 against a State to compensate for delay in payment.  That Amendment has no application to an award of attorney's fees, ancillary to a grant of prospective relief, against a State, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, and it follows that the same is true for the calculation of the amount of the fee.  An adjustment for delay in payment is an appropriate factor in determining what constitutes a reasonable attorney's fee under 
Page 491 U. S. 275
  1988.  Pp.  491 U. S. 278-284.
2. The District Court correctly compensated the work of paralegals, law clerks, and recent law graduates at the market rates for their services, rather than at their cost to the attorneys.  Clearly, ""a reasonable attorney's fee,"" as used in  1988, cannot have been meant to compensate only work performed personally by members of the Bar.  Rather, that term must refer to a reasonable fee for an attorney's work product, and thus must take into account the work not only of attorneys, but also the work of paralegals and the like.  A reasonable attorney's fee under  1988 is one calculated on the basis of rates and practices prevailing in the relevant market and one that grants the successful civil rights plaintiff a ""fully compensatory fee,"" comparable to what ""is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee-paying client.""  In this case, where the practice in the relevant market is to bill the work of paralegals separately, the District Court's decision to award separate compensation for paralegals, law clerks, and recent law graduates at prevailing market rates was fully in accord with  1988.  Pp.  491 U. S. 284-289.

Since its formation in 1976, petitioner Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has required its employees to undergo physical examinations periodically and upon return from leave.

No. 88-449
Argued March 28, 1989
Decided June 19, 1989
491 U.S. 324

Syllabus 
A Connecticut statute requires out-of-state shippers of beer to affirm that their posted prices for products sold to Connecticut wholesalers are, as of the moment of posting, no higher than the prices at which those products are sold in the bordering States of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.  Appellees, a brewers' trade association and major producers and importers of beer, filed suit against state officials in the District Court challenging the statute under the Commerce Clause.  The court upheld the statute on the basis of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute violated the Commerce Clause by controlling the prices at which out-of-state shippers could sell beer in other States, and that appellants' argument that the statute was a proper exercise of the State's regulatory authority under the Twenty-first Amendment was foreclosed by Brown-Forman. Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573.
Held:  Connecticut's beer price affirmation statute violates the Commerce Clause.   491 U. S.  335-343.
(a) The statute has the impermissible practical effect of controlling commercial activity wholly outside Connecticut.  By virtue of its interaction with the regulatory schemes of the border States, the statute requires out-of-state shippers to take account of their Connecticut prices in setting their border-state prices and restricts their ability to offer promotional and volume discounts in the border States, thereby depriving them of whatever competitive advantages they may possess based on the local market conditions in those States.  Moreover, the short-circuiting of normal pricing decisions based on local conditions would be carried to a national scale if and when a significant group of States enacted contemporaneous affirmation statutes similar to Connecticut's that linked instate prices to the lowest price in any State in the country.  It is precisely such results that the Commerce Clause was meant to preclude.  Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 579,  476 U. S. 581-583; cf. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69,  481 U. S. 88-89.  Pp.  491 U. S. 335-340. 
Page 491 U. S. 325

(b) The statute, on its face, also violates the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce, since it applies only to brewers and shippers engaged in interstate commerce, and not to those engaged solely in Connecticut sales, and since it is not justified by a valid purpose unrelated to economic protectionism.  Pp.  491 U. S. 340-341.
(c) Appellants' reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment as authorizing the statute regardless of its effect on interstate commerce is foreclosed by Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 585, which explicitly held that that Amendment does not immunize state laws from Commerce Clause attack where, as here, their practical effect is to regulate liquor sales in other States.  Pp.  491 U. S. 341-342.
(d) Appellants' reliance on Seagram, supra, to validate the statute is also foreclosed by Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 581-584, and n. 6, which strictly limited Seagram's scope and removed the underpinnings of its Commerce Clause analysis.  To the extent that it held that retrospective affirmation statutes do not facially violate the Commerce Clause, Seagram is no longer good law, since such statutes, like other affirmation statutes, have the inherent practical extraterritorial effect of regulating liquor prices in other States.

Council of the City of New Orleans
No. 88-348
Argued April 25, 1989
Decided June 19, 1989
491 U.S. 350

Syllabus 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allocated the cost of the Grand Gulf 1 nuclear reactor among several jointly owned companies, including petitioner New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI), that had agreed to finance the reactor's construction and operation.  NOPSI, which provides retail electrical service to New Orleans, then sought from respondent New Orleans City Council (Council), the local ratemaking body, a rate increase to cover the increase in its wholesale rates resulting from FERC's allocation of Grand Gulf costs.  Although deferring to FERC's implicit finding that NOPSI's decision to participate in the Grand Gulf venture was reasonable, the Council determined that the costs incurred thereby should not be completely reimbursed through a rate increase because NOPSI's management was negligent in failing, after the risks of nuclear power became apparent, to diversify its supply portfolio by selling a portion of its Grand Gulf power.  NOPSI filed a petition in state court for review of the Council's final rate order.  In parallel federal proceedings in the District Court, NOPSI sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the Council's order was preempted by federal law under Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953, which held that, for purpose of setting intrastate retail rates, a State may not differ from FERC's allocations of wholesale power by imposing its own judgment of what would be just and reasonable.  The District Court concluded that it should abstain from deciding the suit under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315, and Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court erred in abstaining from exercising jurisdiction.  Pp.  491 U. S. 358-373.
(a) The Burford abstention doctrine -- under which federal equity courts must decline to interfere with complex state regulatory schemes in cases involving (1) difficult state law questions bearing on policy problems of substantial public import, or (2) efforts to establish a coherent state policy regarding a matter of substantial public concern -- is not applicable.  This case does not involve a state law claim, nor even an assertion that NOPSI's federal claims are in any way entangled in a skein of state law that must be unraveled before the federal case can 
Page 491 U. S. 351
 proceed.  Because NOPSI's facial preemption claim may be resolved without venturing beyond the four corners of the Council's rate order, federal adjudication of the claim would not unduly intrude into state governmental process or undermine the State's ability to maintain desired uniformity in the treatment of essentially local problems.  Although NOPSI's alternative claim -- that the rate order's nominal emphasis on NOPSI's failure to diversify its power supply was merely a cover for the determination that the original Grand Gulf investment was itself unwise -- cannot be resolved on the face of the order, resolution of that claim does not demand significant familiarity with, and will not disrupt state resolution of, distinctively local facts or policies, since wholesale electricity is not bought and sold within a predominantly local market.  Pp.  491 U. S. 360-364.
(b) Nor is abstention appropriate under Younger, which held that, absent extraordinary circumstances, traditional equity concerns and principles of comity require federal courts to refrain from enjoining pending state criminal prosecutions.  This Court has expanded Younger abstention beyond criminal proceedings, and even beyond proceedings in courts, but never to proceedings that are not ""judicial in nature.""  The Council proceedings at issue here are not judicial in nature, since ratemaking, which establishes a rule for the future, is essentially a legislative act.  See, e.g., Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210,  211 U. S. 226-227.  Nor can the proceedings in this case be considered a unitary and still-to-be-completed legislative process by virtue of the ongoing state court review proceedings.  There is no contention here that the Louisiana courts' review involves anything other than a judicial act -- that is, the declaration of NOPSI's rights vis-a-vis the Council on present or past facts under existing law.  NOPSI's preemption claim was therefore ripe for federal review when the Council completed the legislative action by entering its final order.  Pp.  491 U. S. 364-373.

No. 88-420
Argued April 26, 1989
Decided June 19, 1989
491 U.S. 376

Syllabus 
Respondent Thomas was convicted of both attempted robbery and first-degree felony murder arising out of the same incident, and was sentenced to consecutive terms of 15 years for the attempted robbery and life imprisonment for the felony murder, with the 15-year sentence to run first.  This conviction was affirmed on appeal.  While Thomas' motion for postconviction relief was pending in Missouri trial court, the Governor commuted his 15-year sentence to time served.  After the Missouri Supreme Court, in unrelated cases, held that the state legislature had not intended to allow separate punishments for both felony murder and the underlying felony, the trial court vacated the attempted robbery conviction and the corresponding sentence.  The court left the felony murder conviction in place, but credited the time served under the attempted robbery conviction against the life sentence.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order and rejected Thomas' argument that, since he had completed his commuted sentence, his continued confinement under the longer sentence violated the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple sentences for the same offense.  Thomas then sought a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court.  The court denied relief, ruling that Thomas had not suffered a double jeopardy violation because he had not been subjected to a greater punishment than intended by the legislature.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, under this Court's decisions in Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, and In re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50, once Thomas had satisfied one of the two sentences that could have been imposed by law, he could not be required to serve the other.  It held further that Morris v. Mathews, 475 U. S. 237 -- which held that an unlawful conviction of felony murder and the underlying felony could be remedied by resentencing on a lesser included offense of nonfelony murder -- was inapposite, since the prisoner in that case had not completed either of his sentences.
Held:  The state court remedy fully vindicated Thomas' double jeopardy rights.  In the multiple punishments context, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.  Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359,  459 U. S. 366.  As a result of the state trial court's ruling, Thomas now stands convicted of felony murder alone, and his confinement under 
Page 491 U. S. 377
 the single sentence imposed for that crime with credit for time already served is not double jeopardy.  Thomas' reliance on Lange, supra, and Bradley, supra, is misplaced.  Both cases involved alternative punishments that were prescribed by the legislature for a single criminal act, whereas the issue here involves separate sentences imposed for what the sentencing court thought to be separately punishable offenses, one far more serious than the other.  Bradley also involved alternative sentences of two different types, fine and imprisonment.  While it would not have been possible to ""credit"" a fine against time in prison, crediting time served under one sentence against the term of another has long been an accepted practice.  Moreover, in a true alternative sentences case, it is difficult to say that the legislature intended one punishment over the other, for the legislature viewed each alternative as appropriate for some cases.  Here, however, the legislature plainly intended that the person who committed murder during a felony would be convicted of felony murder or separately of the felony and nonfelony murder.  It did not intend that an attempted robbery conviction would suffice as an alternative sanction for murder.  Extension of Bradley beyond its facts would also lead to anomalous results since, had Thomas been sentenced to life imprisonment first, he would not have had a double jeopardy claim; and since he concedes that the unlawful imposition of concurrent sentences can be cured by vacating the shorter of the two even where it has been completed.  Sentencing is not a game where a wrong move by a judge means immunity for the prisoner.  Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160, 166-167.   491 U. S.  380-387.

No. 87-1241
Argued October 31, 1988
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent's predecessors operated a coal gasification plant, which produced coal tar as a byproduct, along a creek in Pennsylyania.  Shortly after acquiring easements in the property along the creek, and while excavating to control flooding, the State struck a large deposit of coal tar which began to seep into the creek.  Finding the tar to be a hazardous substance, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the site the Nation's first Superfund site, and the State and the Federal Government together cleaned up the area.  The Government reimbursed the State for cleanup costs and sued respondent to recoup those costs under  104 and 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.  9604 and 9606, claiming that respondent was liable because it and its predecessors had deposited the tar in the ground.  Respondent filed a third-party complaint against the State, asserting, inter alia, that it was liable as an ""owner and operator"" of the site under  107(a) of CERCLA.  The District Court dismissed this complaint on the ground that the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding no clear expression of intent to hold States liable in monetary damages under CERCLA.  However, after this Court vacated that decision and remanded for reconsideration in light of subsequent amendments to CERCLA made by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Court of Appeals held that the statute's amended language clearly rendered States liable for 
Page 491 U. S. 2
 monetary damages, and that Congress had the power to do so under the Commerce Clause.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded.
832 F.2d 1343, affirmed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that CERCLA, as amended by SARA, clearly expresses an intent to hold States liable in damages in federal court.   491 U. S.  7-13.
(a) The statute's plain language authorizes such suits.  Section 101(21)'s express inclusion of States within its definition of ""persons,"" and  101(20)(D)'s plain statement that state and local governments are to be considered ""owners or operators"" in all but very narrow circumstances, together establish that Congress intended that States be liable for cleanup costs under  107 along with everyone else responsible for creating hazardous waste sites.  The fact that  101(20)(D) uses language virtually identical to  120(a)(1)'s waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity is highly significant, demonstrating that Congress must have intended to override the States' immunity from suit.  This conclusion is not contradicted by  101(20)(D)'s exclusion of States from the category of ""owners and operators"" when they acquire ownership or control of a site involuntarily by virtue of their function as sovereign, by  107(d)(2)'s general exemption of States from liability for actions taken during cleanup of contamination generated by other persons' facilities, or by 42 U.S.C.  9659(a)(1)'s express reservation of States' Eleventh Amendment rights in citizen suits, since those provisions would be unnecessary unless suits against States were otherwise permitted by the statute.   491 U. S.  7-10.
(b) Pennsylyania's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.  If accepted, the contention that CERCLA creates state liability only to the Federal Government would render meaningless the  101(20)(D) language making States liable ""to the same extent . . . as any nongovernmental entity, including liability for [damages],"" since no explicit authorization is necessary before the Federal Government may sue a State for damages.  Moreover,  101(20)(D) obviously explains and qualifies the entire definition of ""owner or operator,"" and does not, as Pennsylyania suggests, render States liable only if they acquire property involuntarily and then contribute to contamination there.  Nor can it be decisive that  101(20)(D) mentions local governments, which do not enjoy immunity, in the same breath as States, since it was natural for Congress to discuss governmental entities together.  Pp.  491 U. S. 11-13.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Part III that Congress has 
Page 491 U. S. 3
 the authority to render States liable for money damages in federal court when legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  491 U. S. 13-23.
(a) This Court's decisions indicate that Congress has the authority to override States' immunity when legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause.  See, e.g., Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184; Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279.  This conclusion is confirmed by a consideration of the special nature of the plenary power conferred by the Clause, which expands federal power by taking power away from the States.  Cf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445,  427 U. S. 454-456; Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346.  Pp.  491 U. S. 14-19.
(b) By giving Congress plenary authority to regulate commerce, the States relinquished their immunity where Congress finds it necessary, in exercising this authority, to render them liable.  Since the commerce power can displace State regulation, a conclusion that Congress may not create a damages remedy against the States would sometimes mean that no one could do so.  Indeed, this Court has recognized that the general problem of environmental harm is often not susceptible to a local solution.  See Illinois v. Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91; Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617.  Moreover, in many situations, it is only money damages that will effectuate Congress' legitimate Commerce Clause objectives.  Here, for example, after failing to solve the hazardous substances problem through preventive measures, Congress chose to extend liability to everyone potentially responsible for contamination, and, because of the enormous costs of cleanups and the finite nature of Government resources, sought to encourage private parties to help out by allowing them to recover for their own cleanup efforts.  There is no merit to Pennsylyania's contention that the allowance of damages suits by private citizens against unconsenting States impermissibly expands the jurisdiction of federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III, since, by ratifying the Constitution containing the Commerce Clause, the States consented to suits against them based on congressionally created causes of action.  Cf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra.  Pp.  491 U. S. 19-23.
JUSTICE WHITE agreed with the plurality's conclusion that Congress has the authority under Article I to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity, but disagreed with the reasoning supporting that conclusion.  P.  491 U. S. 57.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ., joined.

Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent's predecessors operated a coal gasification plant, which produced coal tar as a byproduct, along a creek in Pennsylyania.  Shortly after acquiring easements in the property along the creek, and while excavating to control flooding, the State struck a large deposit of coal tar which began to seep into the creek.  Finding the tar to be a hazardous substance, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the site the Nation's first Superfund site, and the State and the Federal Government together cleaned up the area.  The Government reimbursed the State for cleanup costs and sued respondent to recoup those costs under  104 and 106 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.  9604 and 9606, claiming that respondent was liable because it and its predecessors had deposited the tar in the ground.  Respondent filed a third-party complaint against the State, asserting, inter alia, that it was liable as an ""owner and operator"" of the site under  107(a) of CERCLA.  The District Court dismissed this complaint on the ground that the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity barred the suit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding no clear expression of intent to hold States liable in monetary damages under CERCLA.  However, after this Court vacated that decision and remanded for reconsideration in light of subsequent amendments to CERCLA made by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), the Court of Appeals held that the statute's amended language clearly rendered States liable for

 Carl S. DELLMUTH, Acting Secretary of Education of Pennsylvania, Petitionerv. Russell A. MUTH, Jr., et al.No. 87-1855. 
 Argued Feb. 28, 1989.Decided June 15, 1989.
 
 Syllabus 
 The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA)-which enacts a comprehensive scheme to assure that handicapped children may achieve a free public education appropriate for their needs-provides, inter alia, that parents may challenge the appropriateness of their child's "" individualized education program"" (IEP) in an administrative hearing with subsequent judicial review. Respondent Muth (hereinafter respondent) requested a hearing to contest the local school district's IEP for his son Alex, who is handicapped within the meaning of the EHA. Before the hearing was convened, respondent enrolled Alex in a private school. Alex's IEP then was revised and declared appropriate by the hearing examiner, and that decision was affirmed by Pennsylvania's secretary of education more than one year after the original hearing. While the administrative proceedings were under way, respondent brought suit in the Federal District Court against the school district and the secretary challenging the appropriateness of the IEP and the validity of the administrative proceedings and seeking, among other things, reimbursement for Alex's private-school tuition and attorney's fees. The court found that, while the revised IEP was appropriate, procedural flaws had delayed the administrative process and that, since the EHA had abrogated the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, the school district and the Commonwealth were jointly and severally liable for reimbursement of Alex's tuition and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
 Held: The EHA does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and, thus, the Amendment bars respondent's attempt to collect tuition reimbursement from Pennsylvania. Pp. 227-232. 
 (a) Congress may abrogate the States' immunity only by making its intention ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242, 3147, 87 L. Ed.2d 171. Pp. 227-228. 
 (b) Respondent's nontextual arguments-that abrogation is necessary to meet the EHA's goals and that amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, though not retroactively applicable to respondent's suit, evince a previous intention to abrogate immunity from EHA suits-have no bearing on the abrogation analysis since congressional intent must be unmistakably 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 224
 clear in the statute's language. Although nontextual evidence might have some weight under a normal exercise in statutory construction, it is generally irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment. The argument that application of the Atascadero standard is unfair in this case because Congress could not have foreseen that application is premised on an unrealistic view of the legislative process. It is unlikely that the 94th Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest. Pp. 228-230. 
 (c) The EHA provisions relied on by the Court of Appeals-the preamble's statement of purpose, the 1986 amendments dealing with attorney's fees, and the authorization for judicial review-do not address abrogation even in oblique terms. The statutory structure-which, unlike the Atascadero statute, makes frequent references to States-lends force only to a permissible inference that States are logical defendants and is not an unequivocal declaration of congressional intent to abrogate. Pp. 231-232. 
 83 F.2d 113, (CA3 1988) reversed and remanded.

 Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. 
 The question before us is whether the Education of the Handicapped Act abrogates the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts. 
 I  
 The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V.), enacts a comprehensive scheme to assure that handicapped children may receive a free public education appropriate to their needs. To achieve these ends, the Act mandates certain procedural requirements for participating state and local educational agencies. In particular, the Act guarantees to parents the right to participate in the development of an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for their handicapped child, and to challenge the appropriateness of their child's IEP in an administrative hearing with subsequent judicial review. See 20 U.S.C. 1415 (1982 ed. and Supp. V); School Committee of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 359, 361, 1998 (1985). 
 Alex Muth, the son of respondent Russell Muth (hereinafter respondent ), is a bright child, but one handicapped within the meaning of the EHA by a language learning disability and associated emotional problems. Alex was enrolled in public school in the Central Bucks School District of Pennsylvania from 1980 to 1983. In the summer of 1983, respondent requested a statutory administrative hearing to challenge the district's IEP for Alex. In September, shortly before the hearing convened, respondent enrolled Alex in a private school for learning disabled children for the coming school year. 
 The hearing examiner found that Alex's original IEP was inappropriate and made a number of recommendations. Both respondent and the school district then appealed the decision to the secretary of education, as provided under Pennsylvania law, see 22 Pa.Code 13.32(24) (1988). The secretary remanded the case to the hearing examiner with in- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 226
 structions to the school district to revise Alex's IEP (1988). After the district did so, the hearing examiner issued a decision declaring the revised IEP appropriate, and the secretary affirmed that decision on October 24, 1984, more than a year after the original due process hearing. 
 While the administrative proceedings were underway, respondent brought this suit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the school district and the state secretary of education, whose successor is petitioner here. As amended, respondent's complaint alleged that the district's IEP for Alex was inappropriate and that the Commonwealth's administrative proceedings had violated the procedural requirements of the EHA in two respects: the assignment of review to the secretary, an allegedly partial officer; and the delays occasioned by the secretary's remand to the hearing examiner. Respondent requested declaratory and injunctive relief, reimbursement for Alex's private-school tuition in 1983- 1984, and attorney's fees. 
 The District Court found various procedural infirmities in Pennsylvania's administrative scheme and entered summary judgment on respondent's procedural claims. The court held a hearing to resolve the remaining issues in the case and to determine the proper remedy for the procedural violations. The court concluded that, while the district's proposed IEP for 1983-1984 had been appropriate within the meaning of the EHA, respondent was entitle to reimbursement for Alex's tuition that year because the procedural flaws had delayed the administrative process. The District Court further determined that the school district and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were jointly and severally liable, agreeing with respondent that the EHA abrogated Pennsylvania's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit. The court also awarded attorney's fees, assessed jointly and severally against the school district and the Commonwealth. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. Muth v. Central Bucks School Dist., 839 F.2d 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 227
 113 (1988). Most pertinent for this case, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the reimbursement award against the Commonwealth. The court concluded that "" the text of EHA and its legislative history leave no doubt that Congress intended to abrogate the 11th amendment immunity of the states."" Id., at 128. 
 To resolve a conflict among the Circuits, we granted certiorari, sub nom. Gilhool v. Muth, 488 U.S. 815 (1988), on the question whether the EHA abrogates the States' sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Compare David D. v. Dartmouth School Committee, 775 F.2d 411 (CA1 1985) (finding abrogation), with Gary A. v. New Trier High School Dist. No. 203, 796 F.2d 940 (CA7 1986); Doe v. Maher, 793 F.2d 1470 (CA9 1986); and Miener v. Missouri, 673 F.2d 969 ( CA8 1982) (finding no abrogation). We now reverse. 
 II  
 We have recognized that Congress, acting in the exercise of its enforcement authority under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,1 may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456, 2671 (1976). We have stressed, however, that abrogation of sovereign immunity upsets ""the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,"" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238, 3145 (1985), placing a considerable strain on "" '[t]he principles of federalism that inform Eleventh Amendment doctrine,' "" Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S. Ct. 900, 907-908 (1984), quoting Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691, 2573-2574 (1978). To temper Congress' acknowledged powers of 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 228
 abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment's role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test: ""Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero, supra, 473 U.S., at 242. 
 In concluding that the EHA contains the requisite clear statement of congressional intent, the Court of Appeals rested principally on three textual provisions. The court first cited the Act's preamble, which states Congress' finding that ""it is in the national interest that the Federal government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the education needs of handicapped children in order to assure equal protection of the law."" 20 U.S.C. 1400(b)(9). Second, and most important for the Court of Appeals, was the Act's judicial review provision, which permits parties aggrieved by the administrative process to ""bring a civil action . . . in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United Stat without regard to the amount in controversy."" 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2). Finally, the Court of Appeals pointed to a 1986 amendment to the EHA, which states that the Act's provision for a reduction of attorney's fees shall not apply ""if the court finds that the State or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was a violation of this section."" 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(4)(G) (1982 ed., Supp. V ). In the view of the Court of Appeals, this amendment represented an express statement of Congress' understanding that States can be parties in civil actions brought under the EHA. 
 Respondent supplements these points with some nontextual arguments. Most notably, respondent argues that abrogation is ""necessary . . . to achieve the EHA's goals,"" Brief for Respondent Muth 37; and that the 1986 amendments to another statute, the Rehabilitation Act, 100 Stat. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 229
 1845, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7 (1982 ed., Supp. IV), expressly abrogate state immunity from suits brought under the EHA, Brief for Respondent Muth 30. In connection with the latter argument, respondent recognizes that the Rehabilitation Act amendments expressly apply only to ""violations that occur in whole or in part after October 21, 1986."" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7(b) ( 1982 ed., Supp. IV). Respondent contends, however, that ""[a]lthough the amendment became effective after Muth initially filed suit, . . . the overwhelming support for the amendment shows that it reflects Congress' intent in originally enacting the EHA [in 1975]."" Brief for Respondent Muth 32, n. 48.2 
 We turn first to respondent's nontextual arguments, because they are the easier to dismiss. It is far from certain that the EHA cannot function if the States retain immunity, or that the 1986 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act are a useful guide to congressional intent in 1975. Indeed, the language of the 1986 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act appears to cut against respondent. Without intending in any way to prejudge the Rehabilitation Act amendments, we note that a comparison of the language in the amendments with the language of the EHA serves only to underscore the difference in the two statutes, and the absence of any clear statement of abrogation in the EHA. The amendments to the Rehabilitation Act read in pertinent part: 
 ""A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of [several enumerated provisions] or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 230
 Federal financial assistance."" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). 
 When measured against such explicit consideration of abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment, the EHA's treatment of the question appears ambiguous at best. 
 More importantly, however, respondent's contentions are beside the point. Our opinion in Atascadero should have left no doubt that we will conclude Congress intended to abrogate sovereign immunity only if its intention is ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 242. Lest Atascadero be thought to contain any ambiguity, we reaffirm today that in this area of the law, evidence of congressional intent must be both unequivocal and textual. Respondent's evidence is neither. In particular, we reject the approach of the Court of Appeals, according to which, ""[w]hile the text of the federal legislation must bear evidence of such an intention, the legislative history may still be used as a reso rce in determining whether Congress' intention to lift the bar has been made sufficiently manifest."" 839 F.2d, at 128. Legislative history generally will be irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment. If Congress' intention is ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,"" recourse to legislative history will be unnecessary; if Congress' intention is not unmistakably clear, recourse to legislative history will be futile, because by definition the rule of Atascadero will not be met. 
 The gist of Justice BRENNAN's argument appears to be that application of the governing law in Atascadero is unfair in this case. The dissent complains that we ""resor[t] to an interpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated only with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball."" Post, at 241. This complaint appears to be premised on an unrealistic and cynical view of the legislative process. We find it difficult to believe that the 94th Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, decided it 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 231
 would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest. Rather, the salient point in our view is that it cannot be said with perfect confidence that Congress in fact intended in 1975 to abrogate sovereign immunity, and imperfect confidence will not suffice given the special constitutional concerns in this area. Cf. Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 373-374, 1168-1169 (1974) ( federal statute will not be construed to preclude judicial review of constitutional challenges absent clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent). 
 We now turn our attention to the proper focus of an inquiry into congressional abrogation of sovereign immunity, the language of the statute. We cannot agree that the textual provisions on which the Court of Appeals relied, or any other provisions of the EHA, demonstrate with unmistakable clarity that Congress intended to abrogate the States' immunity from suit. The EHA makes no reference whatsoever to either the Eleventh Amendment or the States' sovereign immunity. Cf. supra, at 228. Nor does any provision cited by the Court of Appeals address abrogation in even oblique terms, much less with the clarity Atascadero requires. The general statement of legislative purpose in the Act's preamble simply has nothing to do with the States' sovereign immunity. The 1986 amendment to the EHA deals only with attorney's fees, and does not alter or speak to what parties are subject to suit. Respondent conceded as much at oral argument, acknowledging that ""the 1986 EHA Amendments . . . are not directly relevant [here] because they concerned only attorney's fees."" Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. Finally, 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2), the centerpiece of the Court of Appeals' textual analysis, provides judicial review for aggrieved parties, but in no way intimates that the States' sovereign immunity is abrogated. As we made plain in Atascadero: ""A general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment."" 473 U.S., at 246, 105 S. Ct., at 3149. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 232
 At its core, respondent's attempt to distinguish this case from Atascadero appears to reduce to the proposition that the EHA ""is replete with references to the states,"" whereas in ""Atascadero . . . the statutory language at issue did not include mention of states."" Brief for Respondent Muth 32-33. We recognize that the EHA's frequent reference to the States, and its delineation of the States' important role in securing an appropriate education for handicapped children, make the States, along with local agencies, logical defendants in suits alleging violations of the EHA. This statutory structure lends force to the inference that the States were intended to be subject to damages actions for violations of the EHA. But such a permissible inference, whatever ts logical force, would remain just that: a permissible inference. It would not be the unequivocal declaration which, we reaffirm today, is necessary before we will determine that Congress intended to exercise its powers of abrogation. 
 III  
 We hold that the statutory language of the EHA does not evince an unmistakably clear intention to abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit. [Footnote 3] The Eleventh Amendment bars respondent's attempt to collect tuition reimbursement from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
 It is so ordered. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 233
 
 Justice SCALIA, concurring. 
 I join the opinion of the Court, with the understanding that its reasoning does not preclude congressional elimination of sovereign immunity in statutory text that clearly subjects States to suit for monetary damages, though without explicit reference to state sovereign immunity or the Eleventh Amendment. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting. 
 I respectfully dissent from the Court's holding that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is immune from suit in the federal courts for violations of the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. ( 1982 ed. and Supp. V). For reasons I have set out elsewhere, see Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U.S. 468, 509-511, 2964-2966 (1987) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting ); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 258-302, 3155-3178 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would accept respondent Muth's invitation to overrule Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), as that case has been interpreted in this Court's recent decisions. Even if I did not hold that view, I would nevertheless affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on the ground that Congress in the EHA abrogated state immunity. 
 I  
 Applying the standard method for ascertaining congressional intent, I conclude, with the Court of Appeals, that ""[t]he text of EHA and its legislative history leave no doubt that Congress intended to abrogate the 11th amendment immunity of the states."" Muth v. Central Bucks School Dist., 839 F.2d 113, 128 (CA3 1988). 
 The EHA imposes substantial obligations on the States, as well as on local education authorities, as might be expected in an Act authorizing federal financial aid ""to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all handicapped chil- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 234
 dren."" 20 U.S.C. 1400(c). To be eligible for federal assistance, a State must develop a plan for the education of all handicapped children and establish the procedural safeguards mandated in 1415. 1412(2), ( 5). It is the state educational agency that is ""responsible for assuring that the requirements of [EHA Subchapter II, dealing with federal assistance for education of handicapped children] are carried out and that all educational programs for handicapped children within the State, including all such programs administered by any other State or local agency, [are] under the general supervision of the persons responsible for educational programs for handicapped children in the State educational agency."" 1412(6). See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1010, 3467, 82 L.Ed 2d 746 (1984) (""The responsibility for providing the required education remains on the States""); Board of Education of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 182-183, 3038-3039 (1982). 
 In accord with this overarching responsibility placed upon the States, the EHA contemplates that in a number of situations where a local education authority cannot or will not provide appropriate educational services to the handicapped, the State will do so directly. See 20 U.S.C . 1411(c)(4)(A)(ii) (State to assure provision of services where local authority barred from receiving federal funds because it has failed to submit a proper application); 1414(d) (State ""to provide special education and related services directly to handicapped children residing in the area served by [a] local educational agency"" that is unable or unwilling to establish or maintain programs, or to be merged with other local agencies to enable it to do so, or that has ""handicapped children who can best be served by a regional or State center""). And in any event, where a local education authority would be entitled to less than $7,500 in EHA funding for a fiscal year, the State may not distribute the funds, but must use the funds itself to ensure provision of appropriate services. 1411(c)(4)(A)(i), 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 235
 (c)(4)(B). Moreover, a State may choose to administer up to 25 percent of its federal funding itself, rather than distributing these funds to local education authorities, and use such funds to provide direct services to the handicapped. 1411(c)(1), (c)(2). 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 236
 to be the only proper defendant in a federal action to enforce EHA rights. 1
 This solely textually based interpretation of the EHA is supported by the statute's legislative history. Senator Williams, a primary author of the EHA, explained to Congress that, under the Act, 
 In addition, he emphasized that ""any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in the due process hearing o[r] the State educational agency review of such hearing shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the original complaint,"" id., at 37416 ( emphasis added), that is, with respect to the administrative complaint, which of course may allege EHA violations by the State. [Footnote 2] The text and legisla- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 237
 tive history of the EHA thus make it unmistakably clear that Congress there intended to abrogate state immunity from suit. 
 II  
 The Court does not seem to disagree with this analysis of actual congressional intent. Even without benefit of reference to the legislative history that confirms the obvious interpretation of the text and makes Congress' purpose undeniably clear-history spurned by the Court because it has devised in this case a novel rule that ""[l]egislative history generally will be irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment,"" ante, at 230-the Court is able to 
 Nevertheless, although Congress did intend to abrogate the States' immunity from suit, the Court refuses to give effect to this intention because it was not, in the Court's view, ""unequivocal and textual."" Ante, at 230. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 238
 I dispute the Court's conclusion that the text of the EHA is equivocal. To my mind, immunity is ""unequivocally"" textually abrogated when state amenability to suit is the logical inference from the language and structure of the text. Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1360-1361 (1974) (a clear declaration of a State's consent to suit in federal court does not require "" 'express language,' "" but may be found in "" 'overwhelming implications from the text [that] leave no room for any other reasonable construction,' "" quoting Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171, 464 (1909)). The Court reaches the conclusion it does only because it requires more than an unequivocal text. In doing so, the Court is far removed from any real concern to discern a ""clear and manifest"" statement of congressional intent, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 1152 (1947), which is all that the Court has otherwise looked for when inquiring into the meaning of congressional action, even ""[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance,"" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 523 (1971). 
 Were the Court in fact concerned with Congress' intent it could not have adopted the strict drafting regulations it devises today, ruling out resort to legislative history and apparently also barring inferential reasoning from text and structure. The Court's justification for such a rule is that abrogation of immunity ""upsets 'the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,' . . . placing considerable strain on '[t]he principles of federalism that inform Eleventh Amendment doctrine,' "" and that a ""stringent test"" is necessary ""[t]o temper Congress' acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment's role as an essential component of our constitutional structure."" Ante, at 227-228. I maintain that the Court makes one very basic error here, for ""[t]here simply is no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity."" Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 259 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). But quite apart from that, the Court has never explained 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 239
 why it is that the constitutional principle it has created should require a novel approach to ascertaining congressional intent. As I said in Atascadero, ""special rules of statutory drafting are not justified (nor are they justifiable) as efforts to determine the genuine intent of Congress; no reason has been advanced why ordinary canons of statutory construction would be inadequate to ascertain the intent of Congress."" Id., at 254. I entirely fail to see, for example, why the "" clear and manifest purpose of Congress"" to pre-empt under Article VI ""the historic police powers of the States,"" Rice, supra, at 230, may be found in so many and various ways, while the Court in the Eleventh Amendment context insists on setting up ever-tighter drafting regulations that Congress must have followed (though Congress could not have been aware of such requirements when it acted) in order to abrogate immunity. A genuine concern to identify Congress' purpose would lead the Court to consider both the logical inferences to be drawn from the text and structure of the EHA, cf. Edelman v. Jordan, supra, at 673-1361, and the statute's legislative history, see Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 283-285, 93 S. Ct. 1614, 1617-1618 (1973) (examining legislative history in order to determine whether Congress abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity), in deciding whether Congress intended to subject States to suit in federal court. 
 Though the special and strict drafting regulations the Court has now foisted on Congr are unjustifiable, still worse is the Court's retroactive application of these new rules. It would be one thing to tell Congress how in the future the Court will measure Congress' intent. That at least would ensure that Congress and this Court were operating under the same rules at the same time. But it makes no sense whatsoever to test congressional intent using a set of interpretative rules that Congress could not conceivably have foreseen at the time it acted-rules altogether different from, and much more stringent than, those with which Congress, reasonably relying upon this Court's opinions, believed itself 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 240
 to be working. See Atascadero, supra, at 255, n. 7- 3154, n. 7 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). The effect of retroactively applying the Court's peculiar rule will be to override congressional intent to abrogate immunity, though such intent was absolutely clear under principles of statutory interpretation established at the time of enactment. Retroactive application of new drafting regulations in such circumstances is simply unprincipled. Cf. Welch, 483 U.S., at 496, 107 S. Ct., at 2958 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ( where Congress has enacted statutes based on an assumption reasonably derived from our cases, ""[e]ven if we were now to find that assumption to have been wrong, we could not, in reason, interpret the statutes as though the assumption never existed""). 
 Congress has already had cause to complain of the Court's changing its interpretative rules in midcourse. After the Court held in Atascadero that 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, contained no ""unmistakable language"" abrogating Eleventh Amendment immunity, 473 U.S ., at 243, Congress in 1986 enacted an amendment to the Act providing: 
 ""A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of [enumerated provisions of the Rehabilitation Act] or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance."" 42 U. S.C. 2000d-7(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). 
 Congress enacted this provision, the Senate Conference Report tells us, because ""[t]he Supreme Court's decision [in Atascadero] misinterpreted congressional intent. Such a gap in Section 504 coverage was never intended. It would be inequitable for Section 504 to mandate state compliance with its provisions and yet deny litigants the right to enforce their rights in Federal courts when State or State agency actions are in issue."" S.Conf.Rep. No. 99-388, pp. 27-28 (1986). See also 132 Cong.Rec. 28623 (1986) (amendment 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 241
 ""eliminate[s] the court-made barrier to effectuating congressional intent that the holding in the Atascadero case so unwisely has raised"") (Sen. Cranston, a principal author of 504 of the 1973 Act). Had the Court followed the usual rules for determining legislative intent, as Congress in 1973 had every reason to expect it would, the Court could not have fallen into this error. See Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 248-252-3152 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (examining the text, structure, and legislative history of 504 to conclude that Congress intended that the States be amenable to suit in federal court). 
 It is perfectly clear that again today the Court ignores Congress' actual intent to abrogate state immunity-an intent that is even plainer here than in the case of 504, which lacked the EHA's frequent reference to the obligations of States-instead resorting to an interpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated only with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball. When 1415 was enacted in its present form in 1975, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 39 L. Ed.2d 662 (1974), and Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, supra, established that this Court would consider legislative history and ake inferences from text and structure in determining whether Congress intended to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. Indeed, in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 342-345, 1145-1147d 358 (1979), the Court evidently remained of the view that legislative history might be taken into account. Cf. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 693-694, 2574-2575 (1978). And later still, in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 907 (1984), the Court still was requiring only "" an unequivocal expression of congressional intent,"" and citing cases in support-Edelman and Quern-that discuss legislative history in assessing whether Congress intended to abrogate immunity. Obviously, there was no rule in 1975 of the sort the Court has devised in this case, and I fail to understand what theory it is that justifies 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 242
 the Court now gauging the 94th Congress' intent by using such a rule. 3 

 III  
 Though I would hold that Pennsylvania is not immune from suit in federal court for breaches of its obligations under the EHA, I find it unnecessary to go on to consider the second question upon which certiorari was granted: whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that Pennsylvania's secretary of education is precluded from deciding special education administrative appeals under 1415(c) because he is an employee of the Commonwealth. There was an alternative ground for the Court of Appeals' judgment against Pennsylvania-that because of the secretary's remand to a hearing officer following respondent's administrative appeal, respondent was deprived of the timely ""final"" judgment to which he was entitled under 20 U.S.C. 1415(e) and 34 CFR 300.512 (1988). 839 F.2d, at 124-125. Petitioner's predecessor did not seek review of the Court of Appeals' decision on this alternative ground, which appears adequate to support the judgment below, and no purpose would be served by our considering whether the secretary's participation in the appeal was a violation of the EHA's procedural requirements. I would thus affirm the judgment below. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 243
 
 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 I join Justice BRENNAN's opinion because he correctly ascertains the unmistakable intent of Congress to subject state agencies to liability for tuition-reimbursement awards under the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2). See also School Committee of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 359 (1985). Indeed, as Justice BRENNAN convincingly demonstrates, this statute passes even the stringent test set forth in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985). It is only by resorting to a stricter standard yet that the Court is able to reach the result that it does here. Because the Court never should have started down this road, it certainly should not take today's additional step. 

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting. 
 While I join Justice BRENNAN's dissent, I adhere to my v ew that a "" statute cannot amend the Constitution."" Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 24, 2286 (1989) (concurring opinion). Because this case deals with the judicially created doctrine of sovereign immunity rather than the real Eleventh Amendment's limitation on federal judicial power, the congressional decision to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts must prevail. 
Footnote 1 Petitioner concedes that the EHA was enacted pursuant to Congress' authority under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that Congress has the power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment with respect to the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 244-245, n. 4, 3148-3149, n. 4 (1985). We decide the case on these assumptions. 
 
Footnote 2 Respondent also offers us another avenue to affirm the result below, which is to overrule the longstanding holding of Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), that an unconsenting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens. We decline this most recent invitation to overrule our opinion in Hans. 
 
Footnote 3 Our grant of certiorari also embraced the question whether the EHA precluded petitioner from hearing administrative appeals. Since we conclude that the Commonwealth is not subject to suit under the EHA, and since the school district did not petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision, we have no occasion to reach this question. 
 After oral argument, respondent filed a motion to remand this suit to the District Court for consolidation with another related action. In light of our disposition today, respondent's motion is denied. 
 
[Footnote 1] Moreover, it is not even clear that in those situations where the State is the only proper defendant, an action could always be brought against the State even in state court; for in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66, 2308-2310 ( 1989), the Court seems to suggest that the very same rule of interpretation it applies here to decide whether Eleventh Amendment immunity is abrogated is also to be used to determi e whether a federal statute requires a State to allow itself to be sued in state court. See id., at 76 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). If the EHA does not guarantee that the State can be sued somewhere, then our previous statements that the statute provides enforceable rights are a mockery. 
[Footnote 2] The view that Congress believed it had abrogated state immunity in the EHA is confirmed by the legislative history of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1985. Congress complained that ""[c] ongressional intent was ignored by the U.S. Supreme Court when . . . it handed down its decision in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984),"" where the Court held that "" 'the EHA repealed the availability of sections 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973] and 1983 [of Title 42] to individuals seeking a free appropriate public education,' "" so that such litigants could no longer obtain attorney's fees. H.R.Rep. No. 99-296, p. 4 (1985) (quoting Smith supra, at 1030-3478) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). To correct this error, Congress enacted an amendment, codified at 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)( 4) (1982 ed., Supp. V), providing for the award of attorney's fees under the EHA. The statement in the House Report on this amendment that ""[i]n some actions or proceedings in which the parents or guardian prevail, more than one local or State agency may be named as a respondent,"" and that in such cases, ""it is expected that the court will apportion the award of attorneys' fees and other expense based on the relative culpability of the agencies,"" H.R.Rep. No. 99-296, at 6, clearly demonstrates a belief that Congress had abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity in the EHA. 
 
[Footnote 3] I can only express amazement at the Court's statement that ""a comparison of the language in the [Rehabilitation Act] amendments with the language the EHA serves only to underscore the difference in the two statutes,"" ante, at 229, as if the omission from the EHA of the Rehabilitation Act amendments' provision that ""[a] State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment"" actually tells us something about Congress' intent when it enacted the EHA. The 1986 amendment was a response to Atascadero, tailored to overrule a decision that had misinterpreted Congress' intent in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to abrogate state immunity. If Congress' reaction to Atascadero tells us anything, it is that Congress prior to that decision believed it could effectively express its intent to abrogate immunity without resorting to the degree of textual clarity the Court demands in this case.

 Carl S. DELLMUTH, Acting Secretary of Education of Pennsylvania, Petitionerv. Russell A. MUTH, Jr., et al.No. 87-1855. 
 Argued Feb. 28, 1989.Decided June 15, 1989.
 
 Syllabus 
 The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA)-which enacts a comprehensive scheme to assure that handicapped children may achieve a free public education appropriate for their needs-provides, inter alia, that parents may challenge the appropriateness of their child's "" individualized education program"" (IEP) in an administrative hearing with subsequent judicial review. Respondent Muth (hereinafter respondent) requested a hearing to contest the local school district's IEP for his son Alex, who is handicapped within the meaning of the EHA. Before the hearing was convened, respondent enrolled Alex in a private school. Alex's IEP then was revised and declared appropriate by the hearing examiner, and that decision was affirmed by Pennsylvania's secretary of education more than one year after the original hearing. While the administrative proceedings were under way, respondent brought suit in the Federal District Court against the school district and the secretary challenging the appropriateness of the IEP and the validity of the administrative proceedings and seeking, among other things, reimbursement for Alex's private-school tuition and attorney's fees. The court found that, while the revised IEP was appropriate, procedural flaws had delayed the administrative process and that, since the EHA had abrogated the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, the school district and the Commonwealth were jointly and severally liable for reimbursement of Alex's tuition and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
 Held: The EHA does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and, thus, the Amendment bars respondent's attempt to collect tuition reimbursement from Pennsylvania. Pp. 227-232. 
 (a) Congress may abrogate the States' immunity only by making its intention ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 242, 3147, 87 L. Ed.2d 171. Pp. 227-228. 
 (b) Respondent's nontextual arguments-that abrogation is necessary to meet the EHA's goals and that amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, though not retroactively applicable to respondent's suit, evince a previous intention to abrogate immunity from EHA suits-have no bearing on the abrogation analysis since congressional intent must be unmistakably 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 224
 clear in the statute's language. Although nontextual evidence might have some weight under a normal exercise in statutory construction, it is generally irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment. The argument that application of the Atascadero standard is unfair in this case because Congress could not have foreseen that application is premised on an unrealistic view of the legislative process. It is unlikely that the 94th Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest. Pp. 228-230. 
 (c) The EHA provisions relied on by the Court of Appeals-the preamble's statement of purpose, the 1986 amendments dealing with attorney's fees, and the authorization for judicial review-do not address abrogation even in oblique terms. The statutory structure-which, unlike the Atascadero statute, makes frequent references to States-lends force only to a permissible inference that States are logical defendants and is not an unequivocal declaration of congressional intent to abrogate. Pp. 231-232.

 Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court. 
 The question before us is whether the Education of the Handicapped Act abrogates the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts. 
 I  
 The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. V.), enacts a comprehensive scheme to assure that handicapped children may receive a free public education appropriate to their needs. To achieve these ends, the Act mandates certain procedural requirements for participating state and local educational agencies. In particular, the Act guarantees to parents the right to participate in the development of an ""individualized education program"" (IEP) for their handicapped child, and to challenge the appropriateness of their child's IEP in an administrative hearing with subsequent judicial review. See 20 U.S.C. 1415 (1982 ed. and Supp. V); School Committee of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 359, 361, 1998 (1985). 
 Alex Muth, the son of respondent Russell Muth (hereinafter respondent ), is a bright child, but one handicapped within the meaning of the EHA by a language learning disability and associated emotional problems. Alex was enrolled in public school in the Central Bucks School District of Pennsylvania from 1980 to 1983. In the summer of 1983, respondent requested a statutory administrative hearing to challenge the district's IEP for Alex. In September, shortly before the hearing convened, respondent enrolled Alex in a private school for learning disabled children for the coming school year. 
 The hearing examiner found that Alex's original IEP was inappropriate and made a number of recommendations. Both respondent and the school district then appealed the decision to the secretary of education, as provided under Pennsylvania law, see 22 Pa.Code 13.32(24) (1988). The secretary remanded the case to the hearing examiner with in- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 226
 structions to the school district to revise Alex's IEP (1988). After the district did so, the hearing examiner issued a decision declaring the revised IEP appropriate, and the secretary affirmed that decision on October 24, 1984, more than a year after the original due process hearing. 
 While the administrative proceedings were underway, respondent brought this suit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the school district and the state secretary of education, whose successor is petitioner here. As amended, respondent's complaint alleged that the district's IEP for Alex was inappropriate and that the Commonwealth's administrative proceedings had violated the procedural requirements of the EHA in two respects: the assignment of review to the secretary, an allegedly partial officer; and the delays occasioned by the secretary's remand to the hearing examiner. Respondent requested declaratory and injunctive relief, reimbursement for Alex's private-school tuition in 1983- 1984, and attorney's fees. 
 The District Court found various procedural infirmities in Pennsylvania's administrative scheme and entered summary judgment on respondent's procedural claims. The court held a hearing to resolve the remaining issues in the case and to determine the proper remedy for the procedural violations. The court concluded that, while the district's proposed IEP for 1983-1984 had been appropriate within the meaning of the EHA, respondent was entitle to reimbursement for Alex's tuition that year because the procedural flaws had delayed the administrative process. The District Court further determined that the school district and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were jointly and severally liable, agreeing with respondent that the EHA abrogated Pennsylvania's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit. The court also awarded attorney's fees, assessed jointly and severally against the school district and the Commonwealth. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. Muth v. Central Bucks School Dist., 839 F.2d 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 227
 113 (1988). Most pertinent for this case, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the reimbursement award against the Commonwealth. The court concluded that "" the text of EHA and its legislative history leave no doubt that Congress intended to abrogate the 11th amendment immunity of the states."" Id., at 128. 
 To resolve a conflict among the Circuits, we granted certiorari, sub nom. Gilhool v. Muth, 488 U.S. 815 (1988), on the question whether the EHA abrogates the States' sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. Compare David D. v. Dartmouth School Committee, 775 F.2d 411 (CA1 1985) (finding abrogation), with Gary A. v. New Trier High School Dist. No. 203, 796 F.2d 940 (CA7 1986); Doe v. Maher, 793 F.2d 1470 (CA9 1986); and Miener v. Missouri, 673 F.2d 969 ( CA8 1982) (finding no abrogation). We now reverse. 
 II  
 We have recognized that Congress, acting in the exercise of its enforcement authority under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,1 may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456, 2671 (1976). We have stressed, however, that abrogation of sovereign immunity upsets ""the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,"" Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238, 3145 (1985), placing a considerable strain on "" '[t]he principles of federalism that inform Eleventh Amendment doctrine,' "" Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S. Ct. 900, 907-908 (1984), quoting Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 691, 2573-2574 (1978). To temper Congress' acknowledged powers of 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 228
 abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment's role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test: ""Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero, supra, 473 U.S., at 242. 
 In concluding that the EHA contains the requisite clear statement of congressional intent, the Court of Appeals rested principally on three textual provisions. The court first cited the Act's preamble, which states Congress' finding that ""it is in the national interest that the Federal government assist State and local efforts to provide programs to meet the education needs of handicapped children in order to assure equal protection of the law."" 20 U.S.C. 1400(b)(9). Second, and most important for the Court of Appeals, was the Act's judicial review provision, which permits parties aggrieved by the administrative process to ""bring a civil action . . . in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United Stat without regard to the amount in controversy."" 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2). Finally, the Court of Appeals pointed to a 1986 amendment to the EHA, which states that the Act's provision for a reduction of attorney's fees shall not apply ""if the court finds that the State or local educational agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or there was a violation of this section."" 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(4)(G) (1982 ed., Supp. V ). In the view of the Court of Appeals, this amendment represented an express statement of Congress' understanding that States can be parties in civil actions brought under the EHA. 
 Respondent supplements these points with some nontextual arguments. Most notably, respondent argues that abrogation is ""necessary . . . to achieve the EHA's goals,"" Brief for Respondent Muth 37; and that the 1986 amendments to another statute, the Rehabilitation Act, 100 Stat. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 229
 1845, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7 (1982 ed., Supp. IV), expressly abrogate state immunity from suits brought under the EHA, Brief for Respondent Muth 30. In connection with the latter argument, respondent recognizes that the Rehabilitation Act amendments expressly apply only to ""violations that occur in whole or in part after October 21, 1986."" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7(b) ( 1982 ed., Supp. IV). Respondent contends, however, that ""[a]lthough the amendment became effective after Muth initially filed suit, . . . the overwhelming support for the amendment shows that it reflects Congress' intent in originally enacting the EHA [in 1975]."" Brief for Respondent Muth 32, n. 48.2 
 We turn first to respondent's nontextual arguments, because they are the easier to dismiss. It is far from certain that the EHA cannot function if the States retain immunity, or that the 1986 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act are a useful guide to congressional intent in 1975. Indeed, the language of the 1986 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act appears to cut against respondent. Without intending in any way to prejudge the Rehabilitation Act amendments, we note that a comparison of the language in the amendments with the language of the EHA serves only to underscore the difference in the two statutes, and the absence of any clear statement of abrogation in the EHA. The amendments to the Rehabilitation Act read in pertinent part: 
 ""A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of [several enumerated provisions] or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 230
 Federal financial assistance."" 42 U.S.C. 2000d-7(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). 
 When measured against such explicit consideration of abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment, the EHA's treatment of the question appears ambiguous at best. 
 More importantly, however, respondent's contentions are beside the point. Our opinion in Atascadero should have left no doubt that we will conclude Congress intended to abrogate sovereign immunity only if its intention is ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."" Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 242. Lest Atascadero be thought to contain any ambiguity, we reaffirm today that in this area of the law, evidence of congressional intent must be both unequivocal and textual. Respondent's evidence is neither. In particular, we reject the approach of the Court of Appeals, according to which, ""[w]hile the text of the federal legislation must bear evidence of such an intention, the legislative history may still be used as a reso rce in determining whether Congress' intention to lift the bar has been made sufficiently manifest."" 839 F.2d, at 128. Legislative history generally will be irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment. If Congress' intention is ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,"" recourse to legislative history will be unnecessary; if Congress' intention is not unmistakably clear, recourse to legislative history will be futile, because by definition the rule of Atascadero will not be met. 
 The gist of Justice BRENNAN's argument appears to be that application of the governing law in Atascadero is unfair in this case. The dissent complains that we ""resor[t] to an interpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated only with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball."" Post, at 241. This complaint appears to be premised on an unrealistic and cynical view of the legislative process. We find it difficult to believe that the 94th Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, decided it 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 231
 would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest. Rather, the salient point in our view is that it cannot be said with perfect confidence that Congress in fact intended in 1975 to abrogate sovereign immunity, and imperfect confidence will not suffice given the special constitutional concerns in this area. Cf. Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 373-374, 1168-1169 (1974) ( federal statute will not be construed to preclude judicial review of constitutional challenges absent clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent). 
 We now turn our attention to the proper focus of an inquiry into congressional abrogation of sovereign immunity, the language of the statute. We cannot agree that the textual provisions on which the Court of Appeals relied, or any other provisions of the EHA, demonstrate with unmistakable clarity that Congress intended to abrogate the States' immunity from suit. The EHA makes no reference whatsoever to either the Eleventh Amendment or the States' sovereign immunity. Cf. supra, at 228. Nor does any provision cited by the Court of Appeals address abrogation in even oblique terms, much less with the clarity Atascadero requires. The general statement of legislative purpose in the Act's preamble simply has nothing to do with the States' sovereign immunity. The 1986 amendment to the EHA deals only with attorney's fees, and does not alter or speak to what parties are subject to suit. Respondent conceded as much at oral argument, acknowledging that ""the 1986 EHA Amendments . . . are not directly relevant [here] because they concerned only attorney's fees."" Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. Finally, 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2), the centerpiece of the Court of Appeals' textual analysis, provides judicial review for aggrieved parties, but in no way intimates that the States' sovereign immunity is abrogated. As we made plain in Atascadero: ""A general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment."" 473 U.S., at 246, 105 S. Ct., at 3149. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 232
 At its core, respondent's attempt to distinguish this case from Atascadero appears to reduce to the proposition that the EHA ""is replete with references to the states,"" whereas in ""Atascadero . . . the statutory language at issue did not include mention of states."" Brief for Respondent Muth 32-33. We recognize that the EHA's frequent reference to the States, and its delineation of the States' important role in securing an appropriate education for handicapped children, make the States, along with local agencies, logical defendants in suits alleging violations of the EHA. This statutory structure lends force to the inference that the States were intended to be subject to damages actions for violations of the EHA. But such a permissible inference, whatever ts logical force, would remain just that: a permissible inference. It would not be the unequivocal declaration which, we reaffirm today, is necessary before we will determine that Congress intended to exercise its powers of abrogation. 
 III  
 We hold that the statutory language of the EHA does not evince an unmistakably clear intention to abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit. [Footnote 3] The Eleventh Amendment bars respondent's attempt to collect tuition reimbursement from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
 It is so ordered. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 233
 
 Justice SCALIA, concurring. 
 I join the opinion of the Court, with the understanding that its reasoning does not preclude congressional elimination of sovereign immunity in statutory text that clearly subjects States to suit for monetary damages, though without explicit reference to state sovereign immunity or the Eleventh Amendment. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting. 
 I respectfully dissent from the Court's holding that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is immune from suit in the federal courts for violations of the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq. ( 1982 ed. and Supp. V). For reasons I have set out elsewhere, see Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U.S. 468, 509-511, 2964-2966 (1987) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting ); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 258-302, 3155-3178 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I would accept respondent Muth's invitation to overrule Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), as that case has been interpreted in this Court's recent decisions. Even if I did not hold that view, I would nevertheless affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on the ground that Congress in the EHA abrogated state immunity. 
 I  
 Applying the standard method for ascertaining congressional intent, I conclude, with the Court of Appeals, that ""[t]he text of EHA and its legislative history leave no doubt that Congress intended to abrogate the 11th amendment immunity of the states."" Muth v. Central Bucks School Dist., 839 F.2d 113, 128 (CA3 1988). 
 The EHA imposes substantial obligations on the States, as well as on local education authorities, as might be expected in an Act authorizing federal financial aid ""to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all handicapped chil- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 234
 dren."" 20 U.S.C. 1400(c). To be eligible for federal assistance, a State must develop a plan for the education of all handicapped children and establish the procedural safeguards mandated in 1415. 1412(2), ( 5). It is the state educational agency that is ""responsible for assuring that the requirements of [EHA Subchapter II, dealing with federal assistance for education of handicapped children] are carried out and that all educational programs for handicapped children within the State, including all such programs administered by any other State or local agency, [are] under the general supervision of the persons responsible for educational programs for handicapped children in the State educational agency."" 1412(6). See Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 1010, 3467, 82 L.Ed 2d 746 (1984) (""The responsibility for providing the required education remains on the States""); Board of Education of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 182-183, 3038-3039 (1982). 
 In accord with this overarching responsibility placed upon the States, the EHA contemplates that in a number of situations where a local education authority cannot or will not provide appropriate educational services to the handicapped, the State will do so directly. See 20 U.S.C . 1411(c)(4)(A)(ii) (State to assure provision of services where local authority barred from receiving federal funds because it has failed to submit a proper application); 1414(d) (State ""to provide special education and related services directly to handicapped children residing in the area served by [a] local educational agency"" that is unable or unwilling to establish or maintain programs, or to be merged with other local agencies to enable it to do so, or that has ""handicapped children who can best be served by a regional or State center""). And in any event, where a local education authority would be entitled to less than $7,500 in EHA funding for a fiscal year, the State may not distribute the funds, but must use the funds itself to ensure provision of appropriate services. 1411(c)(4)(A)(i), 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 235
 (c)(4)(B). Moreover, a State may choose to administer up to 25 percent of its federal funding itself, rather than distributing these funds to local education authorities, and use such funds to provide direct services to the handicapped. 1411(c)(1), (c)(2). 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 236
 to be the only proper defendant in a federal action to enforce EHA rights. 1
 This solely textually based interpretation of the EHA is supported by the statute's legislative history. Senator Williams, a primary author of the EHA, explained to Congress that, under the Act, 
 In addition, he emphasized that ""any party aggrieved by the findings and decision rendered in the due process hearing o[r] the State educational agency review of such hearing shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the original complaint,"" id., at 37416 ( emphasis added), that is, with respect to the administrative complaint, which of course may allege EHA violations by the State. [Footnote 2] The text and legisla- 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 237
 tive history of the EHA thus make it unmistakably clear that Congress there intended to abrogate state immunity from suit. 
 II  
 The Court does not seem to disagree with this analysis of actual congressional intent. Even without benefit of reference to the legislative history that confirms the obvious interpretation of the text and makes Congress' purpose undeniably clear-history spurned by the Court because it has devised in this case a novel rule that ""[l]egislative history generally will be irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment,"" ante, at 230-the Court is able to 
 Nevertheless, although Congress did intend to abrogate the States' immunity from suit, the Court refuses to give effect to this intention because it was not, in the Court's view, ""unequivocal and textual."" Ante, at 230. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 238
 I dispute the Court's conclusion that the text of the EHA is equivocal. To my mind, immunity is ""unequivocally"" textually abrogated when state amenability to suit is the logical inference from the language and structure of the text. Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1360-1361 (1974) (a clear declaration of a State's consent to suit in federal court does not require "" 'express language,' "" but may be found in "" 'overwhelming implications from the text [that] leave no room for any other reasonable construction,' "" quoting Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171, 464 (1909)). The Court reaches the conclusion it does only because it requires more than an unequivocal text. In doing so, the Court is far removed from any real concern to discern a ""clear and manifest"" statement of congressional intent, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230, 1152 (1947), which is all that the Court has otherwise looked for when inquiring into the meaning of congressional action, even ""[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance,"" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 523 (1971). 
 Were the Court in fact concerned with Congress' intent it could not have adopted the strict drafting regulations it devises today, ruling out resort to legislative history and apparently also barring inferential reasoning from text and structure. The Court's justification for such a rule is that abrogation of immunity ""upsets 'the fundamental constitutional balance between the Federal Government and the States,' . . . placing considerable strain on '[t]he principles of federalism that inform Eleventh Amendment doctrine,' "" and that a ""stringent test"" is necessary ""[t]o temper Congress' acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment's role as an essential component of our constitutional structure."" Ante, at 227-228. I maintain that the Court makes one very basic error here, for ""[t]here simply is no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity."" Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 259 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). But quite apart from that, the Court has never explained 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 239
 why it is that the constitutional principle it has created should require a novel approach to ascertaining congressional intent. As I said in Atascadero, ""special rules of statutory drafting are not justified (nor are they justifiable) as efforts to determine the genuine intent of Congress; no reason has been advanced why ordinary canons of statutory construction would be inadequate to ascertain the intent of Congress."" Id., at 254. I entirely fail to see, for example, why the "" clear and manifest purpose of Congress"" to pre-empt under Article VI ""the historic police powers of the States,"" Rice, supra, at 230, may be found in so many and various ways, while the Court in the Eleventh Amendment context insists on setting up ever-tighter drafting regulations that Congress must have followed (though Congress could not have been aware of such requirements when it acted) in order to abrogate immunity. A genuine concern to identify Congress' purpose would lead the Court to consider both the logical inferences to be drawn from the text and structure of the EHA, cf. Edelman v. Jordan, supra, at 673-1361, and the statute's legislative history, see Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 283-285, 93 S. Ct. 1614, 1617-1618 (1973) (examining legislative history in order to determine whether Congress abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity), in deciding whether Congress intended to subject States to suit in federal court. 
 Though the special and strict drafting regulations the Court has now foisted on Congr are unjustifiable, still worse is the Court's retroactive application of these new rules. It would be one thing to tell Congress how in the future the Court will measure Congress' intent. That at least would ensure that Congress and this Court were operating under the same rules at the same time. But it makes no sense whatsoever to test congressional intent using a set of interpretative rules that Congress could not conceivably have foreseen at the time it acted-rules altogether different from, and much more stringent than, those with which Congress, reasonably relying upon this Court's opinions, believed itself 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 240
 to be working. See Atascadero, supra, at 255, n. 7- 3154, n. 7 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). The effect of retroactively applying the Court's peculiar rule will be to override congressional intent to abrogate immunity, though such intent was absolutely clear under principles of statutory interpretation established at the time of enactment. Retroactive application of new drafting regulations in such circumstances is simply unprincipled. Cf. Welch, 483 U.S., at 496, 107 S. Ct., at 2958 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ( where Congress has enacted statutes based on an assumption reasonably derived from our cases, ""[e]ven if we were now to find that assumption to have been wrong, we could not, in reason, interpret the statutes as though the assumption never existed""). 
 Congress has already had cause to complain of the Court's changing its interpretative rules in midcourse. After the Court held in Atascadero that 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, contained no ""unmistakable language"" abrogating Eleventh Amendment immunity, 473 U.S ., at 243, Congress in 1986 enacted an amendment to the Act providing: 
 ""A State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of [enumerated provisions of the Rehabilitation Act] or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance."" 42 U. S.C. 2000d-7(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV). 
 Congress enacted this provision, the Senate Conference Report tells us, because ""[t]he Supreme Court's decision [in Atascadero] misinterpreted congressional intent. Such a gap in Section 504 coverage was never intended. It would be inequitable for Section 504 to mandate state compliance with its provisions and yet deny litigants the right to enforce their rights in Federal courts when State or State agency actions are in issue."" S.Conf.Rep. No. 99-388, pp. 27-28 (1986). See also 132 Cong.Rec. 28623 (1986) (amendment 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 241
 ""eliminate[s] the court-made barrier to effectuating congressional intent that the holding in the Atascadero case so unwisely has raised"") (Sen. Cranston, a principal author of 504 of the 1973 Act). Had the Court followed the usual rules for determining legislative intent, as Congress in 1973 had every reason to expect it would, the Court could not have fallen into this error. See Atascadero, 473 U.S., at 248-252-3152 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (examining the text, structure, and legislative history of 504 to conclude that Congress intended that the States be amenable to suit in federal court). 
 It is perfectly clear that again today the Court ignores Congress' actual intent to abrogate state immunity-an intent that is even plainer here than in the case of 504, which lacked the EHA's frequent reference to the obligations of States-instead resorting to an interpretative standard that Congress could have anticipated only with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball. When 1415 was enacted in its present form in 1975, Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 39 L. Ed.2d 662 (1974), and Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, supra, established that this Court would consider legislative history and ake inferences from text and structure in determining whether Congress intended to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. Indeed, in Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 342-345, 1145-1147d 358 (1979), the Court evidently remained of the view that legislative history might be taken into account. Cf. Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 693-694, 2574-2575 (1978). And later still, in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 907 (1984), the Court still was requiring only "" an unequivocal expression of congressional intent,"" and citing cases in support-Edelman and Quern-that discuss legislative history in assessing whether Congress intended to abrogate immunity. Obviously, there was no rule in 1975 of the sort the Court has devised in this case, and I fail to understand what theory it is that justifies 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 242
 the Court now gauging the 94th Congress' intent by using such a rule. 3 

 III  
 Though I would hold that Pennsylvania is not immune from suit in federal court for breaches of its obligations under the EHA, I find it unnecessary to go on to consider the second question upon which certiorari was granted: whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that Pennsylvania's secretary of education is precluded from deciding special education administrative appeals under 1415(c) because he is an employee of the Commonwealth. There was an alternative ground for the Court of Appeals' judgment against Pennsylvania-that because of the secretary's remand to a hearing officer following respondent's administrative appeal, respondent was deprived of the timely ""final"" judgment to which he was entitled under 20 U.S.C. 1415(e) and 34 CFR 300.512 (1988). 839 F.2d, at 124-125. Petitioner's predecessor did not seek review of the Court of Appeals' decision on this alternative ground, which appears adequate to support the judgment below, and no purpose would be served by our considering whether the secretary's participation in the appeal was a violation of the EHA's procedural requirements. I would thus affirm the judgment below. 
Page 491 U.S. 22 , 243
 
 Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting. 
 I join Justice BRENNAN's opinion because he correctly ascertains the unmistakable intent of Congress to subject state agencies to liability for tuition-reimbursement awards under the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(2). See also School Committee of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 359 (1985). Indeed, as Justice BRENNAN convincingly demonstrates, this statute passes even the stringent test set forth in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985). It is only by resorting to a stricter standard yet that the Court is able to reach the result that it does here. Because the Court never should have started down this road, it certainly should not take today's additional step. 

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting. 
 While I join Justice BRENNAN's dissent, I adhere to my v ew that a "" statute cannot amend the Constitution."" Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 24, 2286 (1989) (concurring opinion). Because this case deals with the judicially created doctrine of sovereign immunity rather than the real Eleventh Amendment's limitation on federal judicial power, the congressional decision to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts must prevail. 
Footnote 1 Petitioner concedes that the EHA was enacted pursuant to Congress' authority under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that Congress has the power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment with respect to the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-15; see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 244-245, n. 4, 3148-3149, n. 4 (1985). We decide the case on these assumptions. 
 
Footnote 2 Respondent also offers us another avenue to affirm the result below, which is to overrule the longstanding holding of Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), that an unconsenting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens. We decline this most recent invitation to overrule our opinion in Hans. 
 
Footnote 3 Our grant of certiorari also embraced the question whether the EHA precluded petitioner from hearing administrative appeals. Since we conclude that the Commonwealth is not subject to suit under the EHA, and since the school district did not petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision, we have no occasion to reach this question. 
 After oral argument, respondent filed a motion to remand this suit to the District Court for consolidation with another related action. In light of our disposition today, respondent's motion is denied. 
 
[Footnote 1] Moreover, it is not even clear that in those situations where the State is the only proper defendant, an action could always be brought against the State even in state court; for in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66, 2308-2310 ( 1989), the Court seems to suggest that the very same rule of interpretation it applies here to decide whether Eleventh Amendment immunity is abrogated is also to be used to determi e whether a federal statute requires a State to allow itself to be sued in state court. See id., at 76 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). If the EHA does not guarantee that the State can be sued somewhere, then our previous statements that the statute provides enforceable rights are a mockery. 
[Footnote 2] The view that Congress believed it had abrogated state immunity in the EHA is confirmed by the legislative history of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1985. Congress complained that ""[c] ongressional intent was ignored by the U.S. Supreme Court when . . . it handed down its decision in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984),"" where the Court held that "" 'the EHA repealed the availability of sections 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973] and 1983 [of Title 42] to individuals seeking a free appropriate public education,' "" so that such litigants could no longer obtain attorney's fees. H.R.Rep. No. 99-296, p. 4 (1985) (quoting Smith supra, at 1030-3478) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). To correct this error, Congress enacted an amendment, codified at 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)( 4) (1982 ed., Supp. V), providing for the award of attorney's fees under the EHA. The statement in the House Report on this amendment that ""[i]n some actions or proceedings in which the parents or guardian prevail, more than one local or State agency may be named as a respondent,"" and that in such cases, ""it is expected that the court will apportion the award of attorneys' fees and other expense based on the relative culpability of the agencies,"" H.R.Rep. No. 99-296, at 6, clearly demonstrates a belief that Congress had abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity in the EHA. 
 
[Footnote 3] I can only express amazement at the Court's statement that ""a comparison of the language in the [Rehabilitation Act] amendments with the language the EHA serves only to underscore the difference in the two statutes,"" ante, at 229, as if the omission from the EHA of the Rehabilitation Act amendments' provision that ""[a] State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment"" actually tells us something about Congress' intent when it enacted the EHA. The 1986 amendment was a response to Atascadero, tailored to overrule a decision that had misinterpreted Congress' intent in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to abrogate state immunity. If Congress' reaction to Atascadero tells us anything, it is that Congress prior to that decision believed it could effectively express its intent to abrogate immunity without resorting to the degree of textual clarity the Court demands in this case.

No. 87-1207
Argued December 5, 1988
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 58

Syllabus 
Petitioner filed Michigan state court suits under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging that respondents, the Department of State Police and the Director of State Police in his official capacity, had denied him a promotion for an improper reason.  The state court judge ruled for petitioner, finding that both respondents were ""persons"" under  1983, which provides that any person who deprives an individual of his or her constitutional rights under color of state law shall be liable to that individual.  However, the State Court of Appeals vacated the judgment against the Department, holding that a State is not a person under  1983, and remanded the case for a determination of the Director's possible immunity.  The State Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, agreeing that the State is not a person under  1983, but holding that a State official acting in his or her official capacity also is not such a person.
Held:  Neither States nor state officials acting in their official capacities are ""persons"" within meaning of  1983.   491 U. S.  62-71.
(a) That a State is not a person under  1983 is supported by the statute's language, congressional purpose, and legislative history.  In common usage, the term ""person"" does not include a State.  This usage is particularly applicable where it is claimed that Congress has subjected the States to liability to which they had not been subject before.  Reading  1983 to include States would be a decidedly awkward way of expressing such a congressional intent.  The statute's language also falls short of satisfying the ordinary rule of statutory construction that Congress must make its intention to alter the constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government unmistakably clear in a statute's language.  Moreover, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is one of the well established common law immunities and defenses that Congress did not intend to override in enacting  1983.  Cf. Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247; Railroad Co. v. Tennessee, 101 U. S. 337.  The ""Dictionary Act"" provision that a ""person"" includes ""bodies politic and corporate"" fails to evidence such an intent.  This Court's ruling in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658 -- which held that a municipality is a person under  1983 -- is not to the contrary, since States are protected by the Eleventh Amendment, while municipalities are not.   491 U. S.  63-70. 
Page 491 U. S. 59

(b) A suit against state officials in their official capacities is not a suit against the officials, but rather is a suit against the officials' offices and, thus is no different from a suit against the State itself.   491 U. S.  70-71.

Syllabus 
Article VI,  30, of the Missouri Constitution (hereafter  30) provides that the governments of the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County may be reorganized by a vote of the electorate upon a plan of reorganization drafted by a ""board of freeholders.""  The State Circuit Court interpreted ""freeholder"" as not entailing a condition of property ownership and, with only a tentative discussion of the Equal Protection Clause, entered a declaratory judgment that  30 is valid both on its face and as applied to the present board of freeholders.  The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed, but relied exclusively on its interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause and held that that Clause had no relevancy, because the board does not exercise general governmental powers.
Held:

2. The Missouri Supreme Court's ruling that the Equal Protection Clause had no relevancy to the case because the board of freeholders exercises no general governmental power reflects a significant misreading of this Court's precedents.

No. 87-746
Argued October 11, 1988
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 110

Syllabus 
In May, 1981, appellant Victoria D. was born to Carole D., who was married to, and resided with, appellee Gerald D. in California.  Although Gerald was listed as father on the birth certificate and has always claimed Victoria as his daughter, blood tests showed a 98.07% probability that appellant Michael H., with whom Carole had had an adulterous affair, was Victoria's father.  During Victoria's first three years, she and her mother resided at times with Michael, who held her out as his own, at times with another man, and at times with Gerald, with whom they have lived since June, 1984.  In November, 1982, Michael filed a filiation action in California Superior Court to establish his paternity and right to visitation.  Victoria, through her court-appointed guardian ad litem, filed a cross-complaint asserting that she was entitled to maintain filial relationships with both Michael and Gerald.  The court ultimately granted Gerald summary judgment on the ground that there were no triable issues of fact as to paternity under Cal.Evid. Code  621, which provides that a child born to a married woman living with her husband, who is neither impotent nor sterile, is presumed to be a child of the marriage, and that this presumption may be rebutted only by the husband or wife, and then only in limited circumstances.  Moreover, the court denied Michael's and Victoria's motions for visitation pending appeal under Cal.Civ. Code  4601, which provides that a court may, in its discretion, grant ""reasonable visitation rights . . . to any . . . person having an interest in the [child's] welfare.""  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, rejecting Michael's procedural and substantive due process challenges to  621 as well as Victoria's due process and equal protection claims.  The court also rejected Victoria's assertion of a right to continued visitation with Michael under  4601, on the ground that California law denies visitation against the wishes of the mother to a putative father who has been prevented by  621 from establishing his paternity.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
191 Cal. App. 3d 995, 236 Cal.Rptr. 810, affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and in part by JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that: 
Page 491 U. S. 111

1. The  621 presumption does not infringe upon the due process rights of a man wishing to establish his paternity of a child born to the wife of another man.  Pp.  491 U. S. 118-130.
(a) Michael's contention that procedural due process requires that he be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate his paternity in an evidentiary hearing fundamentally misconceives the nature of  621.  Although phrased in terms of a presumption,  621 expresses and implements a substantive rule of law declaring it to be generally irrelevant for paternity purposes whether a child conceived during, and born into, an existing marriage was begotten by someone other than the husband and had a prior relationship with him, based on the state legislature's determination, as a matter of overriding social policy, that the husband should be held responsible for the child and that the integrity and privacy of the family unit should not be impugned.  Because Michael's complaint is that the statute categorically denies all men in his circumstances an opportunity to establish their paternity, his challenge is not accurately viewed as procedural.  Pp.  491 U. S. 119-121.
(b) There is no merit to Michael's substantive due process claim that he has a constitutionally protected ""liberty"" interest in the parental relationship he has established with Victoria, and that protection of Gerald's and Carole's marital union is an insufficient state interest to support termination of that relationship.  Michael has failed to meet his burden of proving that his claimed ""liberty"" interest is one so deeply imbedded within society's traditions as to be a fundamental right.  Not only has he failed to demonstrate that the interest he seeks to vindicate has traditionally been accorded protection by society, but the common law presumption of legitimacy, and even modern statutory and decisional law, demonstrate that society has historically protected, and continues to protect, the marital family against the sort of claim Michael asserts.   491 U. S.  121-130.
2. The  621 presumption does not infringe upon any constitutional right of a child to maintain a relationship with her natural father.  Victoria's assertion that she has a due process right to maintain filial relationships with both Michael and Gerald is, at best, the obverse of Michael's claim and fails for the same reasons.  Nor is there any merit to her claim that her equal protection rights have been violated because, unlike her mother and presumed father, she had no opportunity to rebut the presumption of her legitimacy, since the State's decision to treat her differently from her parents pursues the legitimate end of preventing the disruption of an otherwise peaceful union by the rational means of 
Page 491 U. S. 112
 not allowing anyone but the husband or wife to contest legitimacy.  Pp.  491 U. S. 130-132.
JUSTICE STEVENS, although concluding that a natural father might have a constitutionally protected interest in his relationship with a child whose mother was married to, and cohabiting with, another man at the time of the child's conception and birth, also concluded that the California statutory scheme, as applied in this case, is consistent with the Due Process Clause, since it did not deprive Michael of a fair opportunity to prove that he is an ""other person having an interest in the welfare of the child"" to whom ""reasonable visitation rights"" may be awarded in the trial judge's discretion under  4601.  The plurality's interpretation of  621 as creating an absolute bar to such a determination is not only an unnatural reading of the statute's plain language, but is also not consistent with the reading given by the courts below and California courts in other cases, all of which, after deciding that the  621 presumption barred a natural father from proving paternity, have nevertheless gone on to consider the separate question whether it would be proper to allow the natural father visitation as an ""other person"" based on the best interests of the child in the circumstances of the particular case.  Here, where the record shows that, after its shaky start, the marriage between Carole and Gerald developed a stability that now provides Victoria with a loving and harmonious family home, there was nothing fundamentally unfair in the trial judge's exercise of his discretion to allow the mother to decide whether the child's best interests would be served by allowing the natural father visitation privileges.  Pp.  491 U. S. 132-136.

No. 87-107
Argued February 29, 1988
Reargued October 12, 1988
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 164

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a black woman, was employed by respondent credit union as a teller and file coordinator for 10 years until she was laid off.  Thereafter, she brought this action in District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1981, alleging that respondent had harassed her, failed to promote her to accounting clerk, and then discharged her, all because of her race.  The District Court determined that a claim for racial harassment is not actionable under  1981, and declined to submit that part of the case to the jury.  The court instructed the jury, inter alia, that, in order to prevail on her promotion discrimination claim, petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than the white employee who allegedly had received the promotion.  The jury found for respondent on this claim, as well as on petitioner's discriminatory discharge claim.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent.
Held:
1. This Court will not overrule its decision in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, that  1981 prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts.  Stare decisis compels the Court to adhere to that interpretation, absent some ""special justification"" not to do so.  The burden borne by a party advocating the abandonment of an established precedent is greater where the Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction, which, unlike constitutional interpretation, may be altered by Congress.  Here, no special justification has been shown for overruling Runyon, which has not been undermined by subsequent changes or development in the law, has not proved to be unworkable, and does not pose an obstacle to the realization of objectives embodied in other statutes, particularly Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Furthermore, Runyon is entirely consistent with society's deep commitment to the eradication of race-based discrimination.  Pp.  491 U. S. 171-175.
2. Racial harassment relating to the conditions of employment is not actionable under  1981, which provides that ""[a]ll persons . . . shall have the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens,"" because that provision does not apply to conduct which 
Page 491 U. S. 165
 occurs after the formation of a contract and which does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations.  Pp.  491 U. S. 175-185.
(a) Since  1981 is restricted in its scope to forbidding racial discrimination in the ""mak[ing] and enforce[ment]"" of contracts, it cannot be construed as a general proscription of discrimination in all aspects of contract relations.  It provides no relief where an alleged discriminatory act does not involve the impairment of one of the specified rights.  The ""right . . . to make . . . contracts"" extends only to the formation of a contract, such that  1981's prohibition encompasses the discriminatory refusal to enter into a contract with someone, as well as the offer to make a contract only on discriminatory terms.  That right does not extend to conduct by the employer after the contract relation has been established, including breach of the contract's terms or the imposition of discriminatory working conditions.  The ""right . . . to . . . enforce contracts"" embraces only protection of a judicial or nonjudicial legal process, and of a right of access to that process, that will address and resolve contract law claims without regard to race.  It does not extend beyond conduct by an employer which impairs an employee's ability to enforce through legal process his or her established contract rights.  Pp.  491 U. S. 176-178.
(b) Thus, petitioner's racial harassment claim is not actionable under  1981.  With the possible exception of her claim that respondent's refusal to promote her was discriminatory, none of the conduct which she alleges -- that her supervisor periodically stared at her for minutes at a time, gave her more work than white employees, assigned her to demeaning tasks not given to white employees, subjected her to a racial slur, and singled her out for criticism, and that she was not afforded training for higher level jobs and was denied wage increases -- involves either a refusal to make a contract with her or her ability to enforce her established contract rights.  Rather, the conduct alleged is post-formation conduct by the employer relating to the terms and conditions of continuing employment, which is actionable only under the more expansive reach of Title VII.  Interpreting  1981 to cover post-formation conduct unrelated to an employee's right to enforce her contract is not only inconsistent with the statute's limitations, but also would undermine Title VII's detailed procedures for the administrative conciliation and resolution of claims, since  1981 requires no administrative review or opportunity for conciliation.  Pp.  491 U. S. 178-182.
(c) There is no merit to the contention that  1981's ""same right"" phrase must be interpreted to incorporate state contract law, such that racial harassment in the conditions of employment is actionable when, and only when, it amounts to a breach of contract under state law.  That theory contradicts Runyon by assuming that  1981's prohibitions are limited to state law protections.  Moreover, racial harassment amounting 
Page 491 U. S. 166
 to breach of contract, like racial harassment alone, impairs neither the right to make, nor the right to enforce, a contract.  In addition, the theory would unjustifiably federalize all state law breach of contract claims where racial animus is alleged, since  1981 covers all types of contracts.  Also without merit is the argument that  1981 should be interpreted to reach racial harassment that is sufficiently ""severe or pervasive"" as effectively to belie any claim that the contract was entered into in a racially neutral manner.  Although racial harassment may be used as evidence that a divergence in the explicit terms of particular contracts is explained by racial animus, the amorphous and manipulable ""severe or pervasive"" standard cannot be used to transform a nonactionable challenge to employment conditions into a viable challenge to the employer's refusal to contract.  Pp.  491 U. S. 182-185.
3. The District Court erred when it instructed the jury that petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than the white employee who allegedly received the accounting clerk promotion.  Pp.  491 U. S. 185-188.
(a) Discriminatory promotion claims are actionable under  1981 only where the promotion rises to the level of an opportunity for a new and distinct relation between the employer and the employee.  Here, respondent has never argued that petitioner's promotion claim is not cognizable under  1981.  Pp.  491 U. S. 185-186.
(b) The Title VII disparate treatment framework of proof applies to claims of racial discrimination under  1981.  Thus, to make out a prima facie case, petitioner need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she applied for and was qualified for an available position, that she was rejected, and that the employer then either continued to seek applicants for the position or, as is alleged here, filled the position with a white employee.  The establishment of a prima facie case creates an inference of discrimination which the employer may rebut by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action.  Here, respondent did so by presenting evidence that it promoted the white applicant because she was better qualified for the job.  Thereafter, however, petitioner should have had the opportunity to demonstrate that respondent's proffered reasons for its decision were not its true reasons.  There are a variety of types of evidence that an employee can introduce to show that an employer's stated reasons are pretextual, and the plaintiff may not be limited to presenting evidence of a certain type.  Thus, the District Court erred in instructing the jury that petitioner could carry her burden of persuasion only by showing that she was, in fact, better qualified than the person who got the job.  Pp.  491 U. S. 186-188.

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a black woman, was employed by respondent credit union as a teller and file coordinator for 10 years until she was laid off.  Thereafter, she brought this action in District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1981, alleging that respondent had harassed her, failed to promote her to accounting clerk, and then discharged her, all because of her race.  The District Court determined that a claim for racial harassment is not actionable under  1981, and declined to submit that part of the case to the jury.  The court instructed the jury, inter alia, that, in order to prevail on her promotion discrimination claim, petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than the white employee who allegedly had received the promotion.  The jury found for respondent on this claim, as well as on petitioner's discriminatory discharge claim.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent.

Syllabus 
The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA) -- which enacts a comprehensive scheme to assure that handicapped children may achieve a free public education appropriate for their needs -- provides, inter alia, that parents may challenge the appropriateness of their child's ""individualized education program"" (IEP) in an administrative hearing with subsequent judicial review.  Respondent Muth (hereinafter respondent) requested a hearing to contest the local school district's IEP for his son Alex, who is handicapped within the meaning of the EHA.  Before the hearing was convened, respondent enrolled Alex in a private school.  Alex's IEP then was revised and declared appropriate by the hearing examiner, and that decision was affirmed by Pennsylvania's secretary of education more than one year after the original hearing.  While the administrative proceedings were underway, respondent brought suit in the Federal District Court against the school district and the secretary challenging the appropriateness of the IEP and the validity of the administrative proceedings and seeking, among other things, reimbursement for Alex's private school tuition and attorney's fees.  The court found that, while the revised IEP was appropriate, procedural flaws had delayed the administrative process and that, since the EHA had abrogated the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, the school district and the Commonwealth were jointly and severally liable for reimbursement of Alex's tuition and attorney's fees.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The EHA does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and, thus, the Amendment bars respondent's attempt to collect tuition reimbursement from Pennsylvania.  Pp.  491 U. S. 227-232.

(b) Respondent's nontextual arguments -- that abrogation is necessary to meet the EHA's goals and that amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, though not retroactively applicable to respondent's suit, evince a previous intention to abrogate immunity from EHA suits -- have no bearing on the abrogation analysis, since congressional intent must be unmistakably clear in the statute's language.  Although nontextual evidence might have some weight under a normal exercise in statutory construction, it is generally irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.  The argument that application of the Atascadero standard is unfair in this case because Congress could not have foreseen that application is premised on an unrealistic view of the legislative process.  It is unlikely that the Ninety-fourth Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest.  Pp.  491 U. S. 228-230.
(c) The EHA provisions relied on by the Court of Appeals -- the preamble's statement of purpose, the 1986 amendments dealing with attorney's fees, and the authorization for judicial review -- do not address abrogation even in oblique terms.  The statutory structure -- which, unlike the Atascadero statute, makes frequent references to States -- lends force only to a permissible inference that States are logical defendants, and is not an unequivocal declaration of congressional intent to abrogate.

No. 88-396
Argued April 18, 1989
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 244

Syllabus 
Insurance companies commonly enter into reinsurance agreements, whereby the reinsurer pays the primary insurer, or ""ceding company,"" an up-front fee -- a ""ceding commission"" -- and agrees to assume the ceding company's liabilities on the reinsured policies in return for the future income generated from the policies and their associated reserve accounts.  Under an ""assumption"" reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer steps into the ceding company's shoes, becoming directly liable to the policyholders and receiving all premiums directly.  In contrast, under an indemnity reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer assumes no direct liability, instead reimbursing the ceding company for a specified percentage of the claims and expenses attributable to the risks that have been insured and receiving a like percentage of the premiums generated by the insurance of those risks.  In 1975 and 1976, petitioner entered into four indemnity reinsurance agreements on life insurance policies written by Transport Life Insurance Company, the ceding company, agreeing to pay Transport ceding commissions.  Sections 801-820 of the Internal Revenue Code -- which relate to life insurance companies -- do not specifically address the tax treatment of indemnity reinsurance ceding commissions.  On its income tax returns for the years in question, petitioner claimed deductions for the full amount of the commissions.  Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions on the ground that the commissions had to be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the reinsurance agreements, a 7-year period, but the Tax Court reversed.  The Court of Appeals, in turn, reversed, holding that ceding commissions are not currently deductible.  It reasoned that, since they represent payments to acquire an asset within an income producing life that extends substantially beyond one year, the payments must be amortized over the estimated life of the asset.
Held:  Ceding commissions paid under an indemnity reinsurance agreement must be amortized over the anticipated life of the agreement.  Pp.  491 U. S. 249-260.
(a) Such commissions represent an investment in the future income stream from the reinsured policies and, as such, should be treated in the same manner as commissions involved in assumption reinsurance, which 
Page 491 U. S. 245
 must be capitalized and amortized.  See 26 CFR  1.817-4(d).  This analogy is appropriate, since none of the differences between indemnity and assumption reinsurance goes to the function and purpose of ceding commissions.  Whether the reinsurer assumes direct liability to the policyholder in no way alters the commissions' economic role.  Less compelling is petitioner's analogy to agents' commissions incurred by a life insurance company in issuing directly written insurance, which are currently deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under  809(d)(2).  The agent's commission in a direct insurance setting is an administrative expense -- akin to a salary and other sales expenses of writing new policies -- to remunerate a third party who helps facilitate the sale, whereas the payment in the reinsurance setting is for the asset sold by the ceding company, rather than for services.  Even accepting that petitioner's analogy were true, this would not undermine the basic character of ceding commissions as capital expenditures, but would, at most, prove that Congress decided to carve out an exception for agents' commissions, notwithstanding their arguable character as capital expenses.  This Court will not extend such an exception to other capital expenditures where Congress has not so provided.  Pp.  491 U. S. 249-253.
(b) No Code provision requires that the commissions in question be currently deductible.  They are not ordinary and necessary business expenses under  809(d)(12).  Nor does  818(a) -- which requires life insurance companies to compute their taxes in accordance with the accounting procedures of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for preparing an annual statement, except when such procedures would be inconsistent with accrual accounting rules -- authorize current deduction even though NAIC prescribes such treatment of ceding commissions.  NAIC's practice is inconsistent with accrual accounting rules, which require that capital expenditures be amortized.  Moreover, petitioner's reading of  818(a) is unduly expansive, since it is inconceivable that Congress intended to delegate to the insurance industry the core policy determination whether an expense is a capital outlay or a business expense.  Ceding commissions also are not ""return premiums, and premiums and other consideration arising out of reinsurance ceded,"" which  809(c)(1) permits a company to exclude from the gross premiums included in its tax base, thereby reducing its taxable income.  Such commissions -- which are up-front, one-time payments to secure a share in a future income stream and bear no resemblance to premiums -- fall well outside  809(c)(1)'s intended purpose, which is to except from the general definition of premium income a small, residual category of payments that resemble premiums but, because they in fact never really accrued to the company that nominally receives them, do not fairly represent income to the recipient.  Petitioner's reading of  809(c)(1) is 
Page 491 U. S. 246
 highly implausible, since it is unlikely that Congress would have subsumed a major deduction within the fine details of its definition of premium income, rather than including it with the other deductions discussed in  809(d).  Pp.  491 U. S. 253-260.

In 1975 and 1976, petitioner entered into four indemnity reinsurance agreements on life insurance policies written by Transport Life Insurance Company, the ceding company, agreeing to pay Transport ceding commissions.  Sections 801-820 of the Internal Revenue Code -- which relate to life insurance companies -- do not specifically address the tax treatment of indemnity reinsurance ceding commissions.  On its income tax returns for the years in question, petitioner claimed deductions for the full amount of the commissions.  Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions on the ground that the commissions had to be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the reinsurance agreements, a 7-year period, but the Tax Court reversed.  The Court of Appeals, in turn, reversed, holding that ceding commissions are not currently deductible.  It reasoned that, since they represent payments to acquire an asset within an income producing life that extends substantially beyond one year, the payments must be amortized over the estimated life of the asset.
Held:  Ceding commissions paid under an indemnity reinsurance agreement must be amortized over the anticipated life of the agreement.  Pp.  491 U. S. 249-260.
(a) Such commissions represent an investment in the future income stream from the reinsured policies and, as such, should be treated in the same manner as commissions involved in assumption reinsurance, which 
Page 491 U. S. 245
 must be capitalized and amortized.  See 26 CFR  1.817-4(d).  This analogy is appropriate, since none of the differences between indemnity and assumption reinsurance goes to the function and purpose of ceding commissions.  Whether the reinsurer assumes direct liability to the policyholder in no way alters the commissions' economic role.  Less compelling is petitioner's analogy to agents' commissions incurred by a life insurance company in issuing directly written insurance, which are currently deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under  809(d)(2).  The agent's commission in a direct insurance setting is an administrative expense -- akin to a salary and other sales expenses of writing new policies -- to remunerate a third party who helps facilitate the sale, whereas the payment in the reinsurance setting is for the asset sold by the ceding company, rather than for services.  Even accepting that petitioner's analogy were true, this would not undermine the basic character of ceding commissions as capital expenditures, but would, at most, prove that Congress decided to carve out an exception for agents' commissions, notwithstanding their arguable character as capital expenses.  This Court will not extend such an exception to other capital expenditures where Congress has not so provided.  Pp.  491 U. S. 249-253.
(b) No Code provision requires that the commissions in question be currently deductible.  They are not ordinary and necessary business expenses under  809(d)(12).  Nor does  818(a) -- which requires life insurance companies to compute their taxes in accordance with the accounting procedures of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for preparing an annual statement, except when such procedures would be inconsistent with accrual accounting rules -- authorize current deduction even though NAIC prescribes such treatment of ceding commissions.  NAIC's practice is inconsistent with accrual accounting rules, which require that capital expenditures be amortized.  Moreover, petitioner's reading of  818(a) is unduly expansive, since it is inconceivable that Congress intended to delegate to the insurance industry the core policy determination whether an expense is a capital outlay or a business expense.  Ceding commissions also are not ""return premiums, and premiums and other consideration arising out of reinsurance ceded,"" which  809(c)(1) permits a company to exclude from the gross premiums included in its tax base, thereby reducing its taxable income.  Such commissions -- which are up-front, one-time payments to secure a share in a future income stream and bear no resemblance to premiums -- fall well outside  809(c)(1)'s intended purpose, which is to except from the general definition of premium income a small, residual category of payments that resemble premiums but, because they in fact never really accrued to the company that nominally receives them, do not fairly represent income to the recipient.  Petitioner's reading of  809(c)(1) is 
Page 491 U. S. 246
 highly implausible, since it is unlikely that Congress would have subsumed a major deduction within the fine details of its definition of premium income, rather than including it with the other deductions discussed in  809(d).  Pp.  491 U. S. 253-260.

No. 87-6997
Argued April 26, 1989
Decided June 15, 1989
491 U.S. 263

Syllabus 
Appellant Carella was convicted by a California jury of grand theft for failure to return a rented car.  At his trial, the judge instructed the jury that a person ""shall be presumed to have embezzled"" a vehicle if it is not returned within 5 days of the rental agreement's expiration date, and that ""intent to commit theft by fraud is presumed"" from failure to return the property within 20 days of demand.  The Appellate Department held these presumptions valid, even though the prosecution acknowledged that the instructions imposed conclusive presumptions as to core elements of the crime in violation of the Due Process Clause.
Held:  The jury instructions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The instructions were mandatory, since they could have been understood by reasonable jurors to require them to find the presumed facts if the State proved certain predicate facts.  Thus, they directly foreclosed independent jury consideration of whether the facts proved established certain elements of the offenses with which Carella was charged, and relieved the State of its burden, under In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, of proving by evidence every essential element of Carella's crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The determination whether the error was harmless is for the lower court to make in the first instance.
Reversed and remanded.

Syllabus 
Black individuals and a branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People brought actions in Federal District Court against the city of Birmingham, Alabama, and the Jefferson County Personnel Board (Board), alleging that the defendants had engaged in racially discriminatory hiring and promotion practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal law.  Consent decrees were eventually entered that included goals for hiring blacks as firefighters and for promoting them.  Respondent white firefighters subsequently brought suit in the District Court against the city and the Board, alleging that, because of their race, they were being denied promotions in favor of less qualified blacks in violation of federal law.  They argued that the city and the Board were making promotion decisions on the basis of race in reliance on the consent decrees, and that those decisions constituted impermissible racial discrimination.  After trial, the District Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.  It held that respondents were precluded from challenging employment decisions taken pursuant to the consent decrees, even though they had not been parties to the proceedings in which the decrees were entered.  The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the ""impermissible collateral attack"" doctrine that immunizes parties to a consent decree from discrimination charges by nonparties for actions taken pursuant to the decree.
Held:  Respondents are not precluded from challenging the employment decisions taken pursuant to the consent decrees.  Pp.  490 U. S. 761-769.
(a) ""[O]ne is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.""  Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32,  311 U. S. 40.  Pp.  490 U. S. 761-762.
(b) Under ordinary application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party seeking a judgment binding on another cannot obligate that person to intervene; he must be joined.  Rule 24, governing intervention, is cast in permissive terms.  Rule 19(a) provides for mandatory

Joinder as a party, rather than knowledge of a lawsuit and an opportunity to intervene, is the method by which potential parties are subjected to the jurisdiction of the court and bound by a judgment or decree.  The linchpin of the ""impermissible collateral attack"" doctrine -- the attribution of preclusive effect to a failure to intervene -- is inconsistent with Rules 19 and 24.  Pp.  490 U. S. 763-765.
(c) Neither Penn-Central Merger and N & W Inclusion Cases, 389 U. S. 486, nor Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U. S. 102, is authority for precluding respondents from challenging the actions taken under the consent decrees.  Pp.  490 U. S. 765-766.
(d) Even if there were some merit to the argument that the need to join affected parties would be burdensome and ultimately discouraging to civil rights litigation, acceptance of that argument would require a rewriting, rather than an interpretation of, the relevant Federal Rules.  In any event, the difficulties in identifying those who would be adversely affected by a decree arise from the nature of the relief sought, and not because of any choice between mandatory intervention and joinder.  Plaintiffs who seek the aid of courts to alter employment policies, or the employer who might be subject to conflicting decrees, are best able to bear the burden of designating those who would be adversely affected if plaintiffs prevail.  The alternative urged here does not eliminate the need for, or difficulty of, identifying persons who should be included in a lawsuit.  It merely shifts that responsibility to less able shoulders.

A voluntary settlement in the form of a consent decree between one group of employees and their employer cannot possibly ""settle,"" voluntarily or otherwise, the conflicting claims of another group of employees who do not join in the agreement.

No. 88-333

490 U.S. 794

Syllabus 
An Alabama grand jury indicted respondent for burglary, rape, and sodomy, all related to a single assault.  He agreed to plead guilty to the burglary and rape charges in exchange for the State's agreement to dismiss the sodomy charge.  The trial judge granted the State's motion to dismiss the sodomy charge, accepted respondent's guilty plea, and sentenced him to concurrent terms of 30 years' imprisonment on each conviction.  Later, respondent succeeded in having his guilty plea vacated and went to trial on the three original charges before the same trial judge.  The jury found him guilty on all three counts.  This time, the judge imposed a term of life imprisonment for the burglary conviction, plus a concurrent term of life imprisonment on the sodomy conviction and a consecutive term of 150 years' imprisonment on the rape conviction.  The judge explained that he was imposing a harsher sentence than that imposed following the guilty plea because the evidence presented at trial, of which he had been unaware at the time sentence was imposed on the guilty plea, convinced him that the original sentence had been too lenient.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the convictions and the life sentence for burglary and sodomy, but remanded the rape conviction for resentencing.  The Alabama Supreme Court granted respondent's request for review of the burglary sentence and reversed and remanded, holding that the increased sentence created a presumption of vindictiveness similar to that set forth in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711.
Held:  The Pearce presumption of vindictiveness does not apply when a sentence imposed after trial is greater than that previously imposed after a guilty plea.  Simpson v. Rice, decided with North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, overruled.  Pp.  490 U. S. 798-803.
(a) Application of that presumption is limited to circumstances in which there is a ""reasonable likelihood"" that an unexplained increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.  Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the defendant has the burden of proving actual vindictiveness without aid of a presumption.  Pp.  490 U. S. 798-800.
(b) In cases like the present one, where the relevant sentencing information available to the judge after a guilty plea will usually be considerably less than that available after a trial, and where leniency that 
Page 490 U. S. 795
 may have been shown in response to a guilty plea is no longer appropriate, there are enough justifications for a heavier second sentence that it cannot be said to be more likely than not that the judge who imposes such a sentence is motivated by vindictiveness.  Pp.  490 U. S. 800-803.

Title 28 U.S.C.  1332 confers diversity jurisdiction in the district courts when a citizen of one State sues both aliens and citizens of a State different from the plaintiff's,  1332(a)(3), and when a citizen of a State sues aliens only,  1332(a)(2).  Petitioner, an Illinois corporation, invoking jurisdiction under  1332(a)(3), brought a state law contract action in the District Court against a Venezuelan corporation and, as joint and several guarantors of royalty payments due under the agreement, four Venezuelan citizens and one Bettison, a United States citizen domiciled in Venezuela.  After several years of litigation, the District Court, inter alia, granted partial summary judgment for the guarantors.  A Court of Appeals panel found that Bettison's status as a United States citizen not domiciled within a State destroyed  1332(a)(3) jurisdiction, but granted petitioner's motion to dismiss him from the suit, thereby producing complete diversity under  1332(a)(2).  The court then decided the merits.  The Court of Appeals en banc reversed, concluding that neither 28 U.S.C.  1653 -- which provides that ""[d]efective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended . . . in the trial or appellate courts"" -- nor Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 -- which provides that a court may add or drop parties at any stage of the action on such terms as are just -- empowers appellate courts to dismiss a dispensable party who spoils statutory diversity jurisdiction.  However, recognizing that Rule 21 permits district courts to drop dispensable nondiverse parties, the court remanded the case to the District Court for a determination whether it would be prudent to drop Bettison from the litigation.
Held:  A court of appeals has the authority to grant a motion to dismiss a dispensable nondiverse party, and need not remand the case to the district court for dismissal in that court's discretion.  Pp.  490 U. S. 830-838.
(a) Since  1653 speaks of amending jurisdictional allegations, it would apply if petitioner had made an incorrect statement about jurisdiction that actually existed, but it does not apply where, as here, there are defects in the jurisdictional facts themselves.  This interpretation is consistent with  1653's legislative history and the language of its predecessor statute, as well as the view of every Court of Appeals that has considered  1653's scope.  Pp.  490 U. S. 830-832. 
Page 490 U. S. 827

(b) Virtually every modern Court of Appeals faced with this issue has concluded that it has the authority to dismiss a dispensable nondiverse party by virtue of Rule 21.  Furthermore, this Court has exercised similar authority both under Rule 21, see Mullaney v. Anderson, 342 U. S. 415, and prior to the enactment of the Federal Rules.  See Carneal v. Banks, 10 Wheat. 181.  Other early appellate courts relied for their authority to dismiss a nondiverse party on  32 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 or on the courts' own inherent powers.  This Court declines to disturb that deeply rooted understanding of appellate power, particularly when requiring dismissal of the suit after years of litigation would impose unnecessary and wasteful burdens on the parties, judges, and other litigants awaiting judicial attention.  Here, the practicalities weigh heavily in favor of the decision to dismiss Bettison since, if the suit were dismissed, petitioner would be compelled to refile in the District Court against the diverse parties and proceed to a preordained judgment merely for the sake of a hypertechnical jurisdictional purity.  Although an appellate court should exercise its authority sparingly, carefully considering whether dismissal of the nondiverse party will prejudice any of the other parties and remanding to the district court when appropriate, this Court declines to erect a per se rule that the district court must first make such a determination in every case.  Here, none of the parties will be harmed by Bettison's dismissal, since his presence did not provide petitioner with a tactical advantage; since he was not indispensable to the suit; and since any possible prejudice to him personally was eliminated when the Court of Appeals panel terminated the litigation against him with prejudice.

490 U.S. 844

Syllabus 
In holding that a Bankruptcy Court's injunction against petitioner Board of Equalization's assessment of a state sales tax upon the proceeds of a trustee's liquidation sale of inventory also barred the collection of a use tax from the purchaser's lessees, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that it had wrongly decided California State Board of Equalization v. Goggin, 245 F.2d 44 (Goggin II).  There, the court had held (1) that a tax on liquidation sales places a burden on the federal function of the bankruptcy court and violates principles of intergovernmental tax immunity, and (2) that 28 U.S.C.  960 -- which specifically authorizes the States to impose taxes on a bankruptcy trustee's business operations -- sets forth the sole area in which the States can impose a tax of any type, and negates by implication their power to tax bankruptcy liquidations.
Held:  Neither the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity nor  960 proscribes the imposition of a sales or use tax on a bankruptcy liquidation sale.  Pp.  490 U. S. 847-854.
(a) Under this Court's recent decisions, the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine prohibits the States from directly taxing the United States, or an agency or instrumentality so closely related to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned, but permits States to tax private parties with whom the United States does business, even though the financial burden falls on the Government, as long as the tax does not discriminate against the United States or those with whom it deals.  Thus, whatever immunity the bankrupt estate once enjoyed from a tax on its operations has long since eroded.  Such a tax does not discriminate against bankruptcy trustees or those with whom they deal, since a purchaser at a judicial sale is only required to pay the same tax that he would have been bound to pay had he purchased from anyone else.  Nor is the bankruptcy trustee so closely connected to the Federal Government that the two cannot be viewed as separate entities.  The trustee is the representative of the debtor's estate, not an arm of the Government, and the tax is an administrative expense of the debtor, not of the Government.  
Page 490 U. S. 845
 There is no material distinction between those municipal and state withholding and property taxes on the bankruptcy trustee which have been upheld, see Otte v. United States, 419 U. S. 43,  419 U. S. 52-54; Swarts v. Hammer, 194 U. S. 441,  194 U. S. 444, and the tax on the liquidation sale presented here.  Pp.  490 U. S. 848-850.
(b) The Goggin II court's reading of  960 is contrary to this Court's general approach to claims that the States' power to tax has been preempted, to the plain meaning and legislative history of the statutory provision, and to the structure of the Bankruptcy Code.  Section 960 is not a clear expression of an exemption from state taxation.  Rather, it evinces Congress' intention that a State be permitted to tax a bankruptcy estate notwithstanding any intergovernmental tax immunity objection that might be interposed, and that, as a matter of federal law, a business in receivership, or being conducted under court order, should be subject to the same tax liability as the owner had he been in possession of, and operating, the enterprise.

Syllabus 
A Magistrate assigned by the District Judge conducted the voir dire examination and jury selection for petitioners' trial on multiple felony counts.  The judge overruled petitioners' objections to the assignment of the Magistrate.  The judge offered to review any of the Magistrate's rulings de novo, but petitioners registered no specific challenge to the selection of any juror.  After petitioners were convicted and sentenced, they contended on appeal that the Magistrate had no power to conduct the voir dire examination and jury selection, but made no specific claim of prejudice.  The Court of Appeals affirmed their convictions, noting that the Federal Magistrates Act permits district courts to assign magistrates certain described powers and duties, as well as ""such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.""  The court held that Congress intended this additional duties clause to be construed broadly enough to include jury selection by magistrates, adding that such a designation does not violate Article III or the Due Process Clause.
Held:
1. Presiding at the selection of a jury in a felony trial without the defendant's consent is not one of the ""additional duties"" that the Act permits courts to assign to magistrates.  Pp.  490 U. S. 863-876.
(a) Read literally and without reference to its statutory context, the additional duties clause encompasses any assignment that is not explicitly prohibited by statute or by the Constitution.  It is the Court's settled policy, however, to avoid an interpretation of a federal statute that engenders constitutional issues if a reasonable alternative interpretation poses no constitutional question.  Thus it is appropriate to examine the Act's overall structure and purpose to determine whether any ""additional duties"" assigned to a magistrate bear some reasonable relation to the other duties that, because they are specifically enumerated in the Act, define the attributes of the magistrate's office.  See, e.g., Mathews v. Weber, 423 U. S. 261.  Pp.  490 U. S. 863-865.
(b) The Act's structure and legislative history demonstrate a congressional intent to limit a magistrate's range of duties in criminal cases 
Page 490 U. S. 859
 to:  performing certain pretrial and post-trial functions, subject to one of two levels of judicial review depending on the scope and significance of the magistrate's decision; and conducting bench and jury trials on misdemeanor charges, but only upon special assignment by, and subject to the review of, the district court, and only with the consent of the parties.  Pp.  490 U. S. 865-871.
(c) The absence of a specific reference in the Act or its legislative history to jury selection in felony trials demonstrates that Congress did not intend the additional duties clause to embrace this function.  Voir dire in a felony case is a critical stage of the trial.  However, the Act's carefully defined grant of authority to magistrates to conduct trials of minor criminal cases must be construed as an explicit withholding of the authority to preside at felony trials.  Even assuming that Congress did not consider voir dire to be part of the trial, it is unlikely that it intended to allow a magistrate to conduct jury selection as an ""additional duty"" not subject to the procedural guidance or judicial review applicable to pretrial matters.  In any event, it is doubtful that a district judge could review the jury selection function meaningfully, since no transcript can recapture the atmosphere of the voir dire.  Pp.  490 U. S. 871-876.
2. There is no merit to the Government's argument that any error was harmless because petitioners allege no specific prejudice as a result of the Magistrate's conducting the voir dire.  Harmless error analysis does not apply in a felony case in which, despite the defendant's objection and without any meaningful review by a district judge, an officer exceeds his jurisdiction by selecting a jury.

Syllabus 
After a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denied respondent's application for Social Security disability benefits, she brought an action for judicial review in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  The court affirmed the denial, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the Secretary had not followed her own regulations in making the disability determination, vacated the Secretary's decision, and instructed the District Court to remand the case to the Secretary for reconsideration.  On remand, respondent was represented by counsel in proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  After the Social Security Appeals Council adopted the ALJ's recommended decision that respondent was disabled and instructed the Secretary to pay her benefits, the District Court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss the judicial review action on the ground that respondent had obtained all the relief prayed for.  The court retained jurisdiction over the action for the limited purpose of considering any petition for attorney's fees.  Respondent then filed such a petition under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C.  2412(d) (1982 ed., Supp. V), but the District Court denied the petition on the ground that the Secretary's position in the initial denial of benefits was ""substantially justified"" within the meaning of the EAJA.  The Court of Appeals disagreed for the reasons stated in its previous decision in the case and reversed, concluding that an award of fees was proper under the EAJA.  The court held that the award could include attorney's fees for work done at the administrative level after the cause was remanded to the Secretary by the District Court, rejecting the Secretary's argument that provisions of 5 U.S.C.  504(a) (1982 ed., Supp. V) limited a court's power to award such fees for administrative proceedings to those situations ""in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel.""  While recognizing that the Secretary was not so represented in the remand proceedings, the court found that the proceedings on remand were ""adversarial"" because the Secretary had taken an adversarial position in the judicial review proceedings prior to the remand.
Held:  It is within a federal court's power under the EAJA to award a Social Security claimant attorney's fees for representation provided during 
Page 490 U. S. 878
 administrative proceedings held pursuant to a district court order remanding the action to the Secretary.  Pp.  490 U. S. 883-893.
(a) An award of fees is proper in cases such as the present under  2412(d)(1)(A), which provides for such an award to a
""prevailing party . . . in any civil action . . . for judicial review of agency action . . . in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the [Government's] position . . . was substantially justified.""
Where, as here, a court's  405(g) remand to the Secretary for further proceedings does not necessarily dictate the receipt of benefits, the claimant will not normally attain ""prevailing party"" status until after the result of the administrative proceedings is known.  Cf. Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754; Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782.  Furthermore, the EAJA requires that a fee application be filed ""within thirty days of final judgment,""  2412(d)(1)(B), but often, as in this case, there will be no ""final judgment"" in a claimant's ""civil action . . . for . . . review"" until the successful completion of the remand proceedings before the Secretary.  Moreover, the remanding court continues to retain ""jurisdiction of that action"" within the meaning of  2412(d)(1)(A), and may exercise that jurisdiction to determine if its legal instructions on remand have been followed.  Where administrative proceedings are intimately tied to the resolution of the judicial action and are necessary to the attainment of the results Congress sought to promote by providing for fees, they should be considered part of the action for which fees may be awarded.  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council, 478 U. S. 546; New York Gas Light Club, Inc. v. Carey, 447 U. S. 54.  Thus, the EAJA, read in light of its purpose of diminishing the deterrent effect of the cost of seeking review of agency action, permits a court, in its discretion, to award fees for services performed on remand before the Secretary if the court finds that the Secretary's position on judicial review was not ""substantially justified.""  Pp.  490 U. S. 883-890.
(b) The Secretary's interrelated challenges to this interpretation -- (1) that the plain meaning of ""civil action"" excludes any proceedings outside a court of law, and (2) that a court may never award fees for time spent in nonadversarial proceedings before the Secretary because the EAJA,  2412(d)(3), already empowers a court to award fees for representation before an agency to a prevailing party in a judicial action ""to the same extent authorized in [5 U.S.C.  504]"" -- are rejected.  Even though Social Security benefit proceedings are not ""adversarial"" under  504, they are so intimately connected with the judicial proceedings as to be considered part of the ""civil action.""  Section 2412(d)(3) does not necessarily speak to, let alone preclude, such a reading, since, on its face, the provision says nothing about the power of a court to award fees for representation 
Page 490 U. S. 879
 in a nonadversarial adjudication wholly ancillary to a ""civil action.""  Pp.  490 U. S. 890-892.

			"|"Sullivan v. Hudson
No. 88-616
Argued April 17, 1989
Decided June 12, 1989
490 U.S. 877

Syllabus 
After a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denied respondent's application for Social Security disability benefits, she brought an action for judicial review in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  405(g).  The court affirmed the denial, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the Secretary had not followed her own regulations in making the disability determination, vacated the Secretary's decision, and instructed the District Court to remand the case to the Secretary for reconsideration.  On remand, respondent was represented by counsel in proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  After the Social Security Appeals Council adopted the ALJ's recommended decision that respondent was disabled and instructed the Secretary to pay her benefits, the District Court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss the judicial review action on the ground that respondent had obtained all the relief prayed for.  The court retained jurisdiction over the action for the limited purpose of considering any petition for attorney's fees.  Respondent then filed such a petition under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C.  2412(d) (1982 ed., Supp. V), but the District Court denied the petition on the ground that the Secretary's position in the initial denial of benefits was ""substantially justified"" within the meaning of the EAJA.  The Court of Appeals disagreed for the reasons stated in its previous decision in the case and reversed, concluding that an award of fees was proper under the EAJA.  The court held that the award could include attorney's fees for work done at the administrative level after the cause was remanded to the Secretary by the District Court, rejecting the Secretary's argument that provisions of 5 U.S.C.  504(a) (1982 ed., Supp. V) limited a court's power to award such fees for administrative proceedings to those situations ""in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel.""  While recognizing that the Secretary was not so represented in the remand proceedings, the court found that the proceedings on remand were ""adversarial"" because the Secretary had taken an adversarial position in the judicial review proceedings prior to the remand.
Held:  It is within a federal court's power under the EAJA to award a Social Security claimant attorney's fees for representation provided during 
Page 490 U. S. 878
 administrative proceedings held pursuant to a district court order remanding the action to the Secretary.  Pp.  490 U. S. 883-893.
(a) An award of fees is proper in cases such as the present under  2412(d)(1)(A), which provides for such an award to a
""prevailing party . . . in any civil action . . . for judicial review of agency action . . . in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the [Government's] position . . . was substantially justified.""
Where, as here, a court's  405(g) remand to the Secretary for further proceedings does not necessarily dictate the receipt of benefits, the claimant will not normally attain ""prevailing party"" status until after the result of the administrative proceedings is known.  Cf. Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754; Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782.  Furthermore, the EAJA requires that a fee application be filed ""within thirty days of final judgment,""  2412(d)(1)(B), but often, as in this case, there will be no ""final judgment"" in a claimant's ""civil action . . . for . . . review"" until the successful completion of the remand proceedings before the Secretary.  Moreover, the remanding court continues to retain ""jurisdiction of that action"" within the meaning of  2412(d)(1)(A), and may exercise that jurisdiction to determine if its legal instructions on remand have been followed.  Where administrative proceedings are intimately tied to the resolution of the judicial action and are necessary to the attainment of the results Congress sought to promote by providing for fees, they should be considered part of the action for which fees may be awarded.  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council, 478 U. S. 546; New York Gas Light Club, Inc. v. Carey, 447 U. S. 54.  Thus, the EAJA, read in light of its purpose of diminishing the deterrent effect of the cost of seeking review of agency action, permits a court, in its discretion, to award fees for services performed on remand before the Secretary if the court finds that the Secretary's position on judicial review was not ""substantially justified.""  Pp.  490 U. S. 883-890.
(b) The Secretary's interrelated challenges to this interpretation -- (1) that the plain meaning of ""civil action"" excludes any proceedings outside a court of law, and (2) that a court may never award fees for time spent in nonadversarial proceedings before the Secretary because the EAJA,  2412(d)(3), already empowers a court to award fees for representation before an agency to a prevailing party in a judicial action ""to the same extent authorized in [5 U.S.C.  504]"" -- are rejected.  Even though Social Security benefit proceedings are not ""adversarial"" under  504, they are so intimately connected with the judicial proceedings as to be considered part of the ""civil action.""  Section 2412(d)(3) does not necessarily speak to, let alone preclude, such a reading, since, on its face, the provision says nothing about the power of a court to award fees for representation 
Page 490 U. S. 879
 in a nonadversarial adjudication wholly ancillary to a ""civil action.""  Pp.  490 U. S. 890-892.

No. 87-1428
Argued March 20, 1989

490 U.S. 900

Syllabus 
Before 1979, collective bargaining agreements between respondents AT&T Technologies, Inc., and Local 1942, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, had determined a worker's seniority on the basis of years of plantwide service, and plantwide seniority was transferable upon promotion to a more skilled ""tester"" position.  A new agreement executed in 1979 changed this by making seniority in tester jobs dependent upon the amount of time spent as a tester.  In 1982, petitioners -- women employees who were promoted to tester positions between 1978 and 1980 -- received demotions that they would not have sustained had the former seniority system remained in place.  They filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1983, and, after receiving right-to-sue letters, filed the present action in the District Court, alleging that respondents had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by adopting the new seniority system with the purpose and effect of protecting incumbent testers -- jobs traditionally dominated by men -- from female employees who had greater plantwide seniority and who were becoming testers in increasing numbers.  The court granted summary judgment for respondents on the ground that the charges had not been filed within the required period ""after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,""  706(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(e), and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Under  703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(h), the operation of a seniority system having a disparate impact on men and women is not unlawful unless discriminatory intent is proved.  E.g., Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273,  456 U. S. 289; American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U. S. 63,  456 U. S. 65,  456 U. S. 69; Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U. S. 63,  432 U. S. 82.  It is not disputed that the seniority system at issue is facially nondiscriminatory (treats similarly situated employees alike) and is nondiscriminatorily applied.  Its alleged invalidity rests on the claim that intentional discrimination produced the unfavorable change in petitioners' contractual seniority rights when respondents adopted the new system in 1979.  The limitations period under  706(e) therefore commenced at that point.  Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250; United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553.  This rule strikes a balance

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 12, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Petitioner Christy is a herder who grazed his sheep on leased land near Glacier National Park. Between July 1 and July 9, 1982, grizzly bears from the park killed 20 of Christy's sheep. Requests for assistance from park rangers yielded no results, and efforts to frighten away the bears were unsuccessful. On July 9, when two grizzlies emerged from the forest and approached Christy's sheep, he shot and killed a bear. Grizzlies, however, are an ""endangered species""; Christy's killing of the bear thus violated the Endangered Species Act, which makes it unlawful to "" harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect"" grizzlies and other animals protected by the statute. 16 U.S.C. 
Page 490 U.S. 1114 , 1115
 1538(a)(1), 1532(19). Christy was consequently assessed a $2,500 penalty for shooting the bear. 
 Christy then filed this action in District Court, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Act against herders like himself, and resisting payment of the $2,500 penalty. Christy claimed, inter alia, that his actions in defense of his livestock were protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; alternatively, Christy contended that the Act resulted in an uncompensated ""taking"" of his property. Both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit rejected these claims, and this petition ensued. 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari to consider Christy's constitutional claims. Christy's claim of a constitutional right to defend his property is not insubstantial. The right to defend one's property has long been recognized at common law, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 138-140, and is deeply rooted in the legal traditions of this country, see, e.g., Beard v. United States, 158 U.S. 550, 555, 15 S. Ct. 962, 963 (1895). Having the freedom to take actions necessary to protect one's property may well be a liberty ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,"" Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503, 1938 (1977) (opinion of Powell, J .), and, therefore, entitled to the substantive protection of the Due Process Clause. In any event, Christy's claim to such protection presents an interesting and important question-the proper resolution of which is not altogether clear-that merits plenary review. 
 Even more substantial is Christy's claim that the Endangered Species Act operates as a governmental authorization of a ""taking"" of his property ; leaving him uncompensated for this taking violates the Fifth Amendment, Christy contends. There can be little doubt that if a federal statute authorized park rangers to come around at night and take Christy's livestock to feed the bears, such a governmental action would constituted a ""taking."" The Court of Appeals below, and the federal parties in their submission here, distinguish such a case from this one, by noting that the United States ""does not 'own' the wild animals it protects, nor does the government control the conduct of such animals."" Christy v. Hodel, 857 F.2d 1324, 1335 (CA9 1988); see Brief of the Respondents in Opposition. 
 Perhaps not; but the Government does make it unlawful for Christy to "" harass, harm, [or] pursue"" such animals when they come to take his property-and perhaps a Government edict bar- [490 U.S. 1114 , 1116]

|490 u.s. 642|"Ward's Cove Packing Co., Inc. v. Antonio
No. 87-1387
Argued January 18, 1989
Decided June 5, 1989
490 U.S. 642

Syllabus 
Jobs at petitioners' Alaskan salmon canneries are of two general types:  unskilled ""cannery jobs"" on the cannery lines, which are filled predominantly by nonwhites; and ""noncannery jobs,"" most of which are classified as skilled positions and filled predominantly with white workers, and virtually all of which pay more than cannery positions.  Respondents, a class of nonwhite cannery workers at petitioners' facilities, filed suit in the District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging, inter alia, that various of petitioners' hiring/promotion practices were responsible for the workforce's racial stratification and had denied them employment as noncannery workers on the basis of race.  The District Court rejected respondents' claims, finding, among other things, that nonwhite workers were overrepresented in cannery jobs because many of those jobs were filled under a hiring hall agreement with a predominantly nonwhite union.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed in pertinent part, holding, inter alia, that respondents had made out a prima facie case of disparate impact in hiring for both skilled and unskilled noncannery jobs, relying solely on respondents' statistics showing a high percentage of nonwhite workers in cannery jobs and a low percentage of such workers in noncannery positions.  The court also concluded that, once a plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the challenged practice's business necessity.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a prima facie disparate impact case.  Rather, the proper comparison is generally between the racial composition of the at-issue jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market.  Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U. S. 299,  433 U. S. 308.  With respect to the skilled noncannery jobs at issue, the cannery workforce in no way reflected the pool of job applicants or the qualified labor force population.  Petitioners' selection methods or employment practices cannot be said to have had a disparate impact on nonwhites if 
Page 490 U. S. 643
 the absence of minorities holding such skilled jobs reflects a dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants for reasons that are not petitioners' fault.  With respect to the unskilled noncannery jobs, as long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified nonwhites from applying, the employer's selection mechanism probably does not have a disparate impact on minorities if the percentage of selected nonwhite applicants is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified nonwhite applicants.  Where this is the case, the percentage of nonwhite workers found in other positions in the employer's labor force is irrelevant to a prima facie statistical disparate impact case.  Moreover, isolating the cannery workers as the potential labor force for unskilled noncannery jobs is both too broad -- because the majority of cannery workers did not seek noncannery jobs -- and too narrow -- because there are many qualified persons in the relevant labor market who are not cannery workers.  Under the Court of Appeals' method of comparison, any employer having a racially imbalanced segment of its workforce could be haled into court and made to undertake the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the business necessity of its selection methods.  For many employers, the only practicable option would be the adoption of racial quotas, which has been rejected by this Court and by Congress in drafting Title VII.  The Court of Appeals' theory is also flawed because, if minorities are overrepresented in cannery jobs by virtue of petitioners' having contracted with a predominantly nonwhite union to fill those positions, as the District Court found, petitioners could eliminate respondents' prima facie case simply by ceasing to use the union, without making any change whatsoever in their hiring practices for the noncannery positions at issue.  Pp.  490 U. S. 650-655.
2. On remand for a determination whether the record will support a prima facie disparate impact case on some basis other than the racial disparity between cannery and noncannery workers, a mere showing that nonwhites are underrepresented in the at-issue jobs in a manner that is acceptable under the standards set forth herein will not alone suffice.  Rather, the courts below must also require, as part of respondents' prima facie case, a demonstration that the statistical disparity complained of is the result of one or more of the employment practices respondents are attacking here, specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites.  This specific causation requirement is not unduly burdensome, since liberal discovery rules give plaintiffs broad access to employers' records, and since employers falling within the scope of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures must maintain records disclosing the impact of tests and selection procedures 
Page 490 U. S. 644
 on employment opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic group.  Pp.  490 U. S. 656-658.
3. If, on remand, respondents establish a prima facie disparate impact case with respect to any of petitioners' practices, the burden of producing evidence of a legitimate business justification for those practices will shift to petitioners, but the burden of persuasion will remain with respondents at all times.  This rule conforms with the usual method for allocating persuasion and production burdens in the federal courts and with the rule in disparate treatment cases that the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer's assertion that the adverse employment practice was based solely on a legitimate, neutral consideration.

To the extent that some of this Court's decisions speak of an employer's ""burden of proof"" with respect to the business justification defense, they should be understood to mean an employer's burden of production, not persuasion.  Even if respondents cannot persuade the trier of fact on the business necessity question, they may still prevail by coming forward with alternatives that reduce the disparate impact of petitioners' current practices, provided such alternatives are equally effective in achieving petitioners' legitimate employment goals in light of the alternatives' costs and other burdens.

No. 87-1387
Argued January 18, 1989
Decided June 5, 1989
490 U.S. 642

Syllabus 
Jobs at petitioners' Alaskan salmon canneries are of two general types:  unskilled ""cannery jobs"" on the cannery lines, which are filled predominantly by nonwhites; and ""noncannery jobs,"" most of which are classified as skilled positions and filled predominantly with white workers, and virtually all of which pay more than cannery positions.  Respondents, a class of nonwhite cannery workers at petitioners' facilities, filed suit in the District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging, inter alia, that various of petitioners' hiring/promotion practices were responsible for the workforce's racial stratification and had denied them employment as noncannery workers on the basis of race.  The District Court rejected respondents' claims, finding, among other things, that nonwhite workers were overrepresented in cannery jobs because many of those jobs were filled under a hiring hall agreement with a predominantly nonwhite union.  The Court of Appeals ultimately reversed in pertinent part, holding, inter alia, that respondents had made out a prima facie case of disparate impact in hiring for both skilled and unskilled noncannery jobs, relying solely on respondents' statistics showing a high percentage of nonwhite workers in cannery jobs and a low percentage of such workers in noncannery positions.  The court also concluded that, once a plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer to prove the challenged practice's business necessity.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a prima facie disparate impact case.  Rather, the proper comparison is generally between the racial composition of the at-issue jobs and the racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor market.  Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U. S. 299,  433 U. S. 308.  With respect to the skilled noncannery jobs at issue, the cannery workforce in no way reflected the pool of job applicants or the qualified labor force population.  Petitioners' selection methods or employment practices cannot be said to have had a disparate impact on nonwhites if 
Page 490 U. S. 643
 the absence of minorities holding such skilled jobs reflects a dearth of qualified nonwhite applicants for reasons that are not petitioners' fault.  With respect to the unskilled noncannery jobs, as long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified nonwhites from applying, the employer's selection mechanism probably does not have a disparate impact on minorities if the percentage of selected nonwhite applicants is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified nonwhite applicants.  Where this is the case, the percentage of nonwhite workers found in other positions in the employer's labor force is irrelevant to a prima facie statistical disparate impact case.  Moreover, isolating the cannery workers as the potential labor force for unskilled noncannery jobs is both too broad -- because the majority of cannery workers did not seek noncannery jobs -- and too narrow -- because there are many qualified persons in the relevant labor market who are not cannery workers.  Under the Court of Appeals' method of comparison, any employer having a racially imbalanced segment of its workforce could be haled into court and made to undertake the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the business necessity of its selection methods.  For many employers, the only practicable option would be the adoption of racial quotas, which has been rejected by this Court and by Congress in drafting Title VII.  The Court of Appeals' theory is also flawed because, if minorities are overrepresented in cannery jobs by virtue of petitioners' having contracted with a predominantly nonwhite union to fill those positions, as the District Court found, petitioners could eliminate respondents' prima facie case simply by ceasing to use the union, without making any change whatsoever in their hiring practices for the noncannery positions at issue.  Pp.  490 U. S. 650-655.
2. On remand for a determination whether the record will support a prima facie disparate impact case on some basis other than the racial disparity between cannery and noncannery workers, a mere showing that nonwhites are underrepresented in the at-issue jobs in a manner that is acceptable under the standards set forth herein will not alone suffice.  Rather, the courts below must also require, as part of respondents' prima facie case, a demonstration that the statistical disparity complained of is the result of one or more of the employment practices respondents are attacking here, specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites.  This specific causation requirement is not unduly burdensome, since liberal discovery rules give plaintiffs broad access to employers' records, and since employers falling within the scope of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures must maintain records disclosing the impact of tests and selection procedures 
Page 490 U. S. 644
 on employment opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic group.  Pp.  490 U. S. 656-658.
3. If, on remand, respondents establish a prima facie disparate impact case with respect to any of petitioners' practices, the burden of producing evidence of a legitimate business justification for those practices will shift to petitioners, but the burden of persuasion will remain with respondents at all times.  This rule conforms with the usual method for allocating persuasion and production burdens in the federal courts and with the rule in disparate treatment cases that the plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer's assertion that the adverse employment practice was based solely on a legitimate, neutral consideration.  See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248,  450 U. S. 256-258.  To the extent that some of this Court's decisions speak of an employer's ""burden of proof"" with respect to the business justification defense, they should be understood to mean an employer's burden of production, not persuasion.  Even if respondents cannot persuade the trier of fact on the business necessity question, they may still prevail by coming forward with alternatives that reduce the disparate impact of petitioners' current practices, provided such alternatives are equally effective in achieving petitioners' legitimate employment goals in light of the alternatives' costs and other burdens.

No. 87-963
Argued November 28, 1988

490 U.S. 680

Syllabus 
The Church of Scientology (Church) provides ""auditing"" sessions designed to increase members' spiritual awareness and training courses at which participants study the tenets of the faith and seek to attain the qualifications necessary to conduct auditing sessions.  Pursuant to a central tenet known as the ""doctrine of exchange,"" the Church has set forth schedules of mandatory fixed prices for auditing and training sessions which vary according to a session's length and level of sophistication, and which are paid to branch churches.  Under  170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, petitioners each sought to deduct such payments on their federal income tax returns as a ""charitable contribution,"" which is defined as a ""contribution or gift"" to eligible donees.  After respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner or IRS) disallowed these deductions on the ground that the payments were not ""charitable contributions,"" petitioners sought review in the Tax Court.  That court upheld the Commissioner's decisions and rejected petitioners' constitutional challenges based on the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.  The Courts of Appeals affirmed on petitioners' separate appeals.
Held:  Payments made to the Church's branch churches for auditing and training services are not deductible charitable contributions under  170.  Pp.  490 U. S. 689-703.
(a) Petitioners' payments are not ""contribution[s] or gift[s]"" within the meaning of  170.  The legislative history of the ""contribution or gift"" limitation reveals that Congress intended to differentiate between unrequited payments to qualified recipients, which are deductible, and payments made to such recipients with some expectation of a quid pro quo in terms of goods or services, which are not deductible.  To ascertain whether a given payment was made with such an expectation, the external features of the transaction in question must be examined.  Here, external features strongly suggest a quid pro quo exchange of petitioners' 
Page 490 U. S. 681
 money for auditing and training sessions, since the Church established fixed prices for such sessions in each branch church; calibrated particular prices to sessions of particular lengths and sophistication levels; returned a refund if services went unperformed; distributed ""account cards"" for monitoring prepaid, but as-yet-unclaimed, services; and categorically barred the provision of free sessions.  Petitioners' argument that a quid pro quo analysis is inappropriate when a payment to a church either generates purely religious benefits or guarantees access to a religious service is unpersuasive, since, by its terms,  170 makes no special preference for such payments, and its legislative history offers no indication that this omission was an oversight.  Moreover, petitioners' deductibility proposal would expand the charitable contribution deduction far beyond what Congress has provided to include numerous forms of payments that otherwise are not, or might not be, deductible.  Furthermore, the proposal might raise problems of entanglement between church and state, since the IRS and reviewing courts would be forced to differentiate ""religious"" benefits or services from ""secular"" ones.  Pp.  490 U. S. 689-694.
(b) Disallowance of petitioners'  170 deductions does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Petitioners' argument that  170 creates an unconstitutional denominational preference by according disproportionately harsh tax status to those religions that raise funds by imposing fixed costs for participation in certain religious practices is unpersuasive.  Section 170 passes constitutional muster, since it does not facially differentiate among religious sects, but applies to all religious entities, and since it satisfies the requisite three-pronged inquiry under the Clause.  First, the section is neutral both in design and purpose, there being no allegation that it was born of animus to religion in general or to Scientology in particular.  Second, its primary effect -- encouraging gifts to charitable entities, including but not limited to religious organizations -- does not advance religion, there being no allegation that it involves direct governmental action endorsing religion or a particular religious practice.  Its primary secular effect is not rendered unconstitutional merely because it happens to harmonize with the tenets of religions that raise funds by soliciting unilateral donations.  Third, the section threatens no excessive entanglement between church and state.  Although the IRS must ascertain the prices of a religious institution's services, the regularity with which such payments are waived, and other pertinent information about the transaction, this is merely routine regulatory interaction that does not involve the type of inquiries into religious doctrine, delegation of state power, or detailed monitoring and close administrative contact that would violate the nonentanglement command.  Nor does the application of  170 require the Government to place a monetary 
Page 490 U. S. 682
 value on particular religious benefits.  Petitioners' claim to the contrary raises no need for valuation, since they have alleged only that their payments are fully exempt from a quid pro quo analysis -- not that some portion of those payments is deductible because it exceeds the value of the acquired service.  In any event, the need to ascertain what portion of a payment was a purchase and what portion was a contribution does not ineluctably create entanglement problems, since the IRS has eschewed benefit-focused valuation in cases where the economic value of a good or service is elusive, and has instead employed a valuation method which inquires into the cost (if any) to the donee of providing the good or service.  This method involves merely administrative inquiries that, as a general matter, bear no resemblance to the kind of governmental surveillance that poses an intolerable risk of entanglement.  Pp.  490 U. S. 695-698.
(c) Disallowance of petitioners'  170 deductions does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  Although it is doubtful that, as petitioners allege, the disallowance imposes a substantial burden on the central practice of Scientology by deterring adherents from engaging in auditing and training sessions and by interfering with their observance of the doctrine of exchange, United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252,  455 U. S. 260, establishes that even a substantial burden is justified by the broad public interest in maintaining a sound tax system, free of myriad exceptions flowing from a wide variety of religious beliefs.  That this case involves federal income taxes, rather than the Social Security taxes considered in Lee, is of no consequence.  Also of no consequence is the fact that the Code already contains some deductions and exemptions, since the guiding principle is that a tax must be uniformly applicable to all, except as Congress provides explicitly otherwise.  Id. at  455 U. S. 261.  Indeed, the Government's interest in avoiding an exemption is more powerful here than in Lee, in the sense that the claimed exemption there stemmed from a specific doctrinal obligation not to pay taxes, whereas there is no limitation to petitioners' argument that they are entitled to an exemption because an incrementally larger tax burden interferes with their religious activities.  Pp.  490 U. S. 698-700.
(d) Petitioners' assertion that disallowing their claimed deductions conflicts with the IRS' longstanding practice of permitting taxpayers to deduct payments to other religious institutions in connection with certain religious practices must be rejected in the absence of any specific evidence about the nature or structure of such other transactions.  In the absence of those facts, this Court cannot appraise accurately whether IRS revenue rulings allowing deductions for particular religious payments correctly applied a quid pro quo analysis to the practices in question, and cannot discern whether those rulings contain any unifying 
Page 490 U. S. 683
 principle that would embrace auditing and training session payments.  Pp.  490 U. S. 700-703.
819 F.2d 1212 and 822 F.2d 844, affirmed.

490 U.S. 714

Syllabus 
Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees certain nonforfeitable benefits provided by qualified defined benefit pension plans.  When an employer voluntarily terminates a single-employer defined benefit plan, all accrued benefits automatically vest, notwithstanding the plan's particular vesting provisions.  Plan assets are then distributed to participants in accordance with a six-category allocation scheme set forth in  4044(a), which requires that  plan administrators first distribute nonforfeitable benefits guaranteed by the PBGC,  4044 (a)(1-4); then ""all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan,""  4044 (a)(5); and finally ""all other benefits under the plan.""   4044(a)(6).  Any remaining funds may be recouped by the employer.   4044(d)(1)(A).  Respondents, five employees of the Lynchburg Foundry Company (Foundry), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Mead Corp. (Mead), were covered by the Mead Industrial Salaried Retirement Plan (Plan), a single-employer defined benefit plan funded entirely by the employer.  Plan benefits included normal retirement benefits payable at age 65, early retirement benefits payable at age 55 but reduced for each year by which retirement preceded normal retirement age, and unreduced early retirement benefits available to participants who had 30 or more years of service and elected to retire after age 62.  When Mead sold Foundry and terminated the Plan, it paid unreduced early retirement benefits only to those who had met both the age and years of service requirements for such benefits.  Respondents -- all under age 62 -- received pay equal to the present value of the normal retirement benefit to which they would have been entitled had they retired at age 65, a sum less than the present value of unreduced early retirement payments.  After distribution, Mead recouped nearly $11 million in plan assets.  Respondents filed a suit in Virginia state court, which was later removed to the Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that the failure to pay the present value of the unreduced early retirement benefits violated ERISA.  The District Court granted Mead summary judgment, concluding that, since early retirement benefits are not ""accrued benefits"" under ERISA, respondents were not entitled to any additional sums under the Plan, and that the remaining fund assets could revert to Mead.  
Page 490 U. S. 715
 The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, before plan assets may revert to an employer,  4044(a)(6) requires payment of early retirement benefits to plan participants even if those benefits were not accrued at the time of termination.
Held:
1. Upon termination of a defined benefit plan,  4044(a) does not require a plan administrator to pay plan participants unreduced early retirement benefits provided under the plan before residual assets may revert to an employer.  Section 4044(a)(6) does not create benefit entitlements, but simply provides for the orderly distribution of plan assets required by ERISA's provisions.  Pp.  490 U. S. 721-725.
(a) Neither  4044(a)'s plain language nor its legislative history in any way indicates an intent to confer a right upon plan participants to recover benefits not provided for elsewhere.  Contrary to respondents' argument -- that contingent unreduced early retirement benefits, even if unaccrued, are benefits ""under the plan"" under category 6 and must be distributed before an employer can recoup residual assets -- the ""under the plan"" language refers only to allocation of benefits provided by the terms of the terminated plan.  That  4044(a) is a distribution mechanism is also illustrated by ERISA's structure, since it is inconceivable that Title IV -- which simply provides for insurance for benefits generated elsewhere -- was designed to modify the carefully crafted provisions of Title I, which determine the employee's right to benefits.  The PBGC, whose views are accepted in light of ERISA's language and legislative history, as well as the IRS and the Labor Department, agrees that category 6 is limited to benefits created elsewhere.  Pp. Pp.  490 U. S. 721-724.
(b) Respondents are also mistaken in their alternative statutory argument that, because all accrued benefits vest upon plan termination, they are nonforfeitable benefits falling within category 5, and, thus, category 6 would serve no purpose if it did not cover forfeitable benefits such as those at issue.  The PBGC has consistently maintained that, for the purposes of  4044(a) allocation, the characterization of benefits as forfeitable or nonforfeitable depends upon their status before plan termination.  Respondents' contrary interpretation cannot be squared with the plain meaning of the statute, since including both forfeitable and nonforfeitable benefits in category 5 would contravene the clear directive of the allocation scheme to give priority to nonforfeitable benefits.  Pp.  490 U. S. 724-725.
2. On remand for a determination whether respondents are entitled to damages based on either of their two alternative grounds for concluding that ERISA requires payment of unreduced early retirement benefits before surplus assets revert to the employer -- that unreduced early retirement benefits may qualify as ""accrued benefits"" under ERISA, 
Page 490 U. S. 716
 and that such benefits may be ""liabilities"" within the meaning of  4044(d)(1)(A) -- the Court of Appeals should consider the views of the PBGC and the IRS.  Pp.  490 U. S. 725-726.

Respondents -- all under age 62 -- received pay equal to the present value of the normal retirement benefit to which they would have been entitled had they retired at age 65, a sum less than the present value of unreduced early retirement payments.  After distribution, Mead recouped nearly $11 million in plan assets.  Respondents filed a suit in Virginia state court, which was later removed to the Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that the failure to pay the present value of the unreduced early retirement benefits violated ERISA.  The District Court granted Mead summary judgment, concluding that, since early retirement benefits are not ""accrued benefits"" under ERISA, respondents were not entitled to any additional sums under the Plan, and that the remaining fund assets could revert to Mead.  
Page 490 U. S. 715
 The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, before plan assets may revert to an employer,  4044(a)(6) requires payment of early retirement benefits to plan participants even if those benefits were not accrued at the time of termination.
Held:
1. Upon termination of a defined benefit plan,  4044(a) does not require a plan administrator to pay plan participants unreduced early retirement benefits provided under the plan before residual assets may revert to an employer.  Section 4044(a)(6) does not create benefit entitlements, but simply provides for the orderly distribution of plan assets required by ERISA's provisions.  Pp.  490 U. S. 721-725.
(a) Neither  4044(a)'s plain language nor its legislative history in any way indicates an intent to confer a right upon plan participants to recover benefits not provided for elsewhere.  Contrary to respondents' argument -- that contingent unreduced early retirement benefits, even if unaccrued, are benefits ""under the plan"" under category 6 and must be distributed before an employer can recoup residual assets -- the ""under the plan"" language refers only to allocation of benefits provided by the terms of the terminated plan.  That  4044(a) is a distribution mechanism is also illustrated by ERISA's structure, since it is inconceivable that Title IV -- which simply provides for insurance for benefits generated elsewhere -- was designed to modify the carefully crafted provisions of Title I, which determine the employee's right to benefits.  The PBGC, whose views are accepted in light of ERISA's language and legislative history, as well as the IRS and the Labor Department, agrees that category 6 is limited to benefits created elsewhere.  Pp. Pp.  490 U. S. 721-724.
(b) Respondents are also mistaken in their alternative statutory argument that, because all accrued benefits vest upon plan termination, they are nonforfeitable benefits falling within category 5, and, thus, category 6 would serve no purpose if it did not cover forfeitable benefits such as those at issue.  The PBGC has consistently maintained that, for the purposes of  4044(a) allocation, the characterization of benefits as forfeitable or nonforfeitable depends upon their status before plan termination.  Respondents' contrary interpretation cannot be squared with the plain meaning of the statute, since including both forfeitable and nonforfeitable benefits in category 5 would contravene the clear directive of the allocation scheme to give priority to nonforfeitable benefits.  Pp.  490 U. S. 724-725.
2. On remand for a determination whether respondents are entitled to damages based on either of their two alternative grounds for concluding that ERISA requires payment of unreduced early retirement benefits before surplus assets revert to the employer -- that unreduced early retirement benefits may qualify as ""accrued benefits"" under ERISA, 
Page 490 U. S. 716
 and that such benefits may be ""liabilities"" within the meaning of  4044(d)(1)(A) -- the Court of Appeals should consider the views of the PBGC and the IRS.  Pp.  490 U. S. 725-726.

490 U.S. 730

Syllabus 
In the fall of 1985, petitioners -- the Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV), a Washington, D.C. organization dedicated to eliminating homelessness, and one of its trustees -- entered into an oral agreement with respondent Reid, a sculptor, to produce a statue dramatizing the plight of the homeless for display at a 1985 Christmas pageant in Washington.  While Reid worked on the statue in his Baltimore, Md. studio, CCNV members visited him on a number of occasions to check on his progress and to coordinate CCNV's construction of the sculpture's base in accordance with the parties' agreement.  Reid accepted most of CCNV's suggestions and directions as to the sculpture's configuration and appearance.  After the completed work was delivered to Washington, CCNV paid Reid the final installment of the agreed-upon price, joined the sculpture to its base, and displayed it.  The parties, who had never discussed copyright in the sculpture, then filed competing copyright registration certificates.  The District Court ruled for CCNV in its subsequent suit seeking, inter alia, a determination of copyright ownership, holding that the statue was a ""work made for hire"" as defined in the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C.  101, and was therefore owned exclusively by CCNV under  201(b), which vests copyright ownership of works for hire in the employer or other person for whom the work is prepared, unless there is a written agreement to the contrary.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the sculpture was not a ""work made for hire"" under the first subsection of the  101 definition (hereinafter  101(1)), since it was not ""prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment"" in light of Reid's status as an independent contractor under agency law.  The court also ruled that the statue did not satisfy the second subsection of the  101 definition (hereinafter  101(2)), since sculpture is not one of the nine categories of ""specially ordered or commissioned"" works enumerated therein, and the parties had not agreed in writing that the sculpture would be a work for hire.  However, the court remanded for a determination whether the statue was jointly authored by CCNV and Reid, such that they were co-owners of the copyright under  201(a). 
Page 490 U. S. 731

Held:
1. To determine whether a work is a ""work made for hire"" within the  101 definition, a court should first apply general common law of agency principles to ascertain whether the work was prepared by an employee or an independent contractor, and, depending upon the outcome, should then apply either  101(1) or  101(2).  Although the Act nowhere defines ""employee,"" ""employment,"" or related terms, it must be inferred that Congress meant them in their settled, common law sense, since nothing in the text of the work for hire provisions indicates that those terms are used to describe anything other than the conventional relation of employer and employee.  On the contrary, Congress' intent to incorporate agency law definitions is suggested by  101(1)'s use of the term ""scope of employment,"" a widely used agency law term of art.  Moreover, the general common law of agency must be relied on, rather than the law of any particular State, since the Act is expressly intended to create a federal law of uniform, nationwide application by broadly preempting state statutory and common law copyright regulation.  Petitioners' argument that a work is ""prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment"" whenever the hiring party retains the right to control, or actually controls, the work is inconsistent with the language and legislative history of the work for hire provisions, and would distort the provisions' structure, which views works by employees and commissioned works by independent contractors as mutually exclusive entities.  Pp.  490 U. S. 737-751.
2. The sculpture in question is not a ""work made for hire"" within the meaning of  101.  Reid was an independent contractor, rather than a  101(1) ""employee,"" since, although CCNV members directed enough of the work to ensure that the statue met their specifications, all other relevant circumstances weigh heavily against finding an employment relationship.  Reid engages in a skilled occupation; supplied his own tools; worked in Baltimore without daily supervision from Washington; was retained for a relatively short period of time; had absolute freedom to decide when and how long to work in order to meet his deadline; and had total discretion in hiring and paying assistants.  Moreover, CCNV had no right to assign additional projects to Reid; paid him in a manner in which independent contractors are often compensated; did not engage regularly in the business of creating sculpture or, in fact, in any business; and did not pay payroll or Social Security taxes, provide any employee benefits, or contribute to unemployment insurance or workers' compensation funds.  Furthermore, as petitioners concede, the work in question does not satisfy the terms of  101(2).  Pp.  490 U. S. 751-753.

490 U.S. 581

Syllabus 
In direct response to McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210, which held that federal law as it then existed completely preempted the application of state community property law to military retirement pay, Congress enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (Act), 10 U.S.C.  1408 (1982 ed. and Supp. V), which authorizes state courts to treat as community property ""disposable retired or retainer pay,""  1408(c)(1), specifically defining such pay to exclude, inter alia, any military retirement pay waived in order for the retiree to receive veterans' disability benefits,  1408(a)(4)(B).  The Act also creates a mechanism whereby the Federal Government will make direct community property payments of up to 50% of disposable retired or retainer pay to certain former spouses who present state court orders granting such pay.  A pre-McCarty property settlement agreement between appellant and appellee, who were divorced in a county Superior Court in California, a community property State, provided that appellant would pay appellee 50 percent of his total military retirement pay, including that portion of such pay which he had waived in order to receive military disability benefits.  After the Act's passage, the Superior Court denied appellant's request to modify the divorce decree by removing the provision requiring him to share his total retirement pay with appellee.  The State Court of Appeal affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the Act precluded the lower court from treating as community property the military retirement pay appellant had waived to receive disability benefits.  In so holding, the court relied on a State Supreme Court decision which reasoned that the Act did not limit a state court's ability to treat total military retirement pay as community property and to enforce a former spouse's rights to such pay through remedies other than direct Federal Government payments.
Held:  The Act does not grant state courts the power to treat as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay waived by the retiree in order to receive veterans' disability benefits.  In light of  1408(a)(4)(B)'s limiting language as to such waived pay, the Act's plain and precise language establishes that  1408(c)(1) grants state courts the authority to treat only disposable retired pay, not total retired pay, as community property.  Appellee's argument that the Act has no preemptive 
Page 490 U. S. 582
 effect of its own, and must be read as a garnishment statute designed solely to limit when the Federal Government will make direct payments to a former spouse, and that, accordingly,  1408(a)(4)(B) defines ""disposable retired or retainer pay"" only because payments under the statutory direct payment mechanism are limited to amounts defined by that term, is flawed for two reasons.  First, the argument completely ignores the fact that  1408(c)(1) also uses the quoted phrase to limit specifically and plainly the extent to which state courts may treat military retirement pay as community property.  Second, each of  1408(c)'s other subsections imposes new substantive limits on state courts' power to divide military retirement pay, and it is unlikely that all of the section, except for  1408(c)(1), was intended to preempt state law.  Thus, the garnishment argument misplaces its reliance on the fact that the Act's saving clause expressly contemplates that a retiree will be liable for ""other payments"" in excess of those made under the direct payment mechanism, since that clause is more plausibly interpreted as serving the limited purpose of defeating any inference that the mechanism displaced state courts' authority to divide and garnish property not covered by the mechanism.  Appellee's contention that giving effect to the plain and precise statutory language would thwart the Act's obvious purposes of rejecting McCarty and restoring to state courts their pre-McCarty authority is not supported by the legislative history, which, read as a whole, indicates that Congress intended both to create new benefits for former spouses and to place on state courts limits designed to protect military retirees.

No. 87-1661
Argued February 27, 1989

490 U.S. 605

Syllabus 
Among other things, the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910 granted Arizona certain lands, excluding mineral lands, in trust for the support of public schools, and, in  28, provided that granted lands cannot be sold or leased except upon compliance with certain conditions regarding advertising, bidding, and appraisal.  Arizona incorporated these conditions into Article 10 of its Constitution.  After this Court held the original mineral land exclusion inapplicable to lands not known to be mineral at the time of the grant, Wyoming v. United States, 255 U. S. 489, Congress passed the Jones Act in 1927, extending the terms of the original grant to encompass all mineral lands.  The Enabling Act was also amended in 1936 and 1951 to clarify the procedures for leasing granted lands for specific purposes.  The latter amendment expressly extinguished the  28 restrictions on leases of granted lands for the development of hydrocarbon substances.  Arizona's own law governing mineral leases on state lands does not require that the lands be advertised, appraised, or leased for their full appraised value.  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann.  27-234(B).  Respondents, individual taxpayers and a state teachers association, brought a state court suit against the State Land Department and others, seeking a declaration that  27-234(B) is void on the ground that it does not comply with the provisions of  28 or  10 of the Arizona Constitution and requesting appropriate injunctive relief.  Petitioners, mineral lessees of state school lands, intervened as defendants.  The trial court upheld the statute.  The State Supreme Court reversed, ruling that  27-234(B) is ""unconstitutional and invalid as it pertains to nonhydrocarbon mineral leases,"" and remanded the case for the trial court, inter alia, to enter a judgment declaring  27-234(B) invalid and to consider what further relief might be appropriate.
Held: The judgment is affirmed.
155 Ariz. 484, 747 P.2d 1183, affirmed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B-2, II-C, III, and IV, concluding that:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the decision below.  PP.  490 U. S. 610-612,  490 U. S. 617-633.
(a) The Arizona Supreme Court issued a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1257, despite the fact that it remanded the case for the trial court to determine appropriate further relief.  On remand, 
Page 490 U. S. 606
 the trial court does not have before it any federal question whether past or current leases are valid, since respondents, on appeal, withdrew their request for an accounting and payment of sums due under past leases.  In addition, the trial court's further actions cannot affect the State Supreme Court's ruling that  27-234(B) is invalid.  Thus, the judgment below comes within two of the exceptions to the finality requirement set out in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,  420 U. S. 479,  420 U. S. 480:  (1) the federal issue is conclusive and the outcome of further proceedings is preordained, and (2) the federal questions that could come to this Court have been adjudicated by the state court, and the remaining issues will not give rise to any further federal question.  Pp.  490 U. S. 611-612.
(b) When a state court has issued a judgment interpreting federal law in a case in which the plaintiffs in the original action lacked standing to sue under the principles governing the federal courts, this Court may exercise its jurisdiction on certiorari if the state court judgment causes direct, specific, and concrete injury to the parties who petition for this Court's review, as long as the requisites of an Article III case or controversy are also met.  Here, petitioners possess standing to invoke federal court authority, since they have alleged that the decision below poses a serious and immediate threat to their leases' continuing validity, that such injury can be traced to the state court's erroneous interpretation of federal statutes, and that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision in this Court.  Moreover, the requisites of a case or controversy are met, since the parties remain adverse, and the judgment below altered tangible legal rights.  It would be inappropriate for this Court to vacate the judgment below on the ground that respondents lacked federal standing when they brought suit initially, and to remand for appropriate proceedings, since such a course would render nugatory the state proceedings and have the effect of imposing federal standing requirements on the state courts whenever they adjudicate federal law issues, whereas established traditions and this Court's decisions recognize that state courts are not bound by Article III, and yet have it within both their power and proper role to render binding judgments on federal law issues, subject only to review by this Court.  It would also be inappropriate for this Court simply to order dismissal, leaving petitioners free to bring a declaratory judgment action in federal court raising the same claims, since such a disposition would be likely to defeat the normal preclusive effects of the state court's judgment on the ground that that court's conclusions about federal law were not subject to any federal review.  Such a course would also represent an unnecessary partial inroad on the Rooker-Feldman doctrine's construction of  1257 as barring direct review in lower federal courts of a decision reached by the highest state court, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 
Page 490 U. S. 607
 U.S. 462; Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, particularly since petitioners have already presented this Court with a case or controversy justiciable under federal standards.  Pp.  490 U. S. 617-624.
(c) The decision below is not based on an adequate and independent state ground that would defeat review of the federal issue by this Court.  Although the state court's opinion mentioned the State Constitution several times and directed the trial court to declare  27-234(B) ""unconstitutional,"" its discussion focused solely on the federal statutes, without ever mentioning the State Constitution apart from the Enabling Act.  Moreover, the state court explicitly considered itself bound by this Court's decisions to adopt the plaintiffs' construction, and described Article 10 of the State Constitution as simply a ""rescript"" of  28 of the Enabling Act.  Thus, the opinion's references to the State Constitution merely reflect a holding which rests on the state court's interpretation of federal law, and do not divorce the state constitutional issue from the federal law questions.  Pp.  490 U. S. 624-625.
2. Section 27-234(B) is invalid as to nonhydrocarbon mineral leases, since the sale or lease of mineral lands granted to Arizona under the federal statutes must substantially conform to the mandatory requirements set out in the Enabling Act.  Pp.  490 U. S. 625-633.
(a) The grant of all lands under the Enabling Act is conditioned, by the statute's clear and express language, upon the specific requirements for leasing or selling those lands.  Petitioners' reliance on Neel v. Barker, 27 N.M. 605, 204 P. 205, for the proposition that, since mineral lands were originally exempt from the 1910 grant, the Enabling Act's provisions do not apply to lands later determined to be mineral in nature, is flawed in two respects.  First, Neel did not take into account this Court's decision in Wyoming v. United States, supra, that unknown mineral lands were within the grant.  Second, since those lands were within the 1910 grant, they could not be regarded as unburdened by its mandatory conditions.  Pp.  490 U. S. 627-628.
(b) The lands granted under the Jones Act are also subject to the Enabling Act conditions.  To read that Act's  1(a) language -- which declares that the grant of mineral lands thereunder ""shall be of the same effect as prior grants"" of nonmineral lands -- as only assuring that title to the lands passed and vested in the same manner and with the same validity as titles under the Enabling Act would render the language redundant, since the statute subsequently directly addresses the vesting of titles.  Instead, that language achieved Congress' objective of extending the 1910 grant to mineral lands and confirming their title to the States.  Similarly,  1(b) -- which states that, though mineral lands may be sold, the rights to mine and remove the minerals themselves may only be leased ""as the State legislature may direct"" -- is not blanket authority for 
Page 490 U. S. 608
 States to lease minerals on whatever terms they wish, as long as the leases' proceeds go to the schools.  Rather, it authorizes the States to regulate the methods by which mineral leases are made, and to specify necessary or desirable additional terms, as long as the leases comply with the Enabling Act's dispositional requirements.  Pp.  490 U. S. 628-631.
(c) The 1936 and 1951 amendments to the Enabling Act confirm that Congress never removed the original conditions contained in the Act.  In the amendments, Congress reiterated the formulation that lands could be leased for certain purposes as the state legislature ""may direct"" and as it ""may prescribe.""  The 1936 Amendment did not alter the application of  28 to ""all lands,"" and the 1951 Amendment, because it expressly extinguished the  28 restrictions as to hydrocarbon leases, but not as to other mineral leases, tends to confirm that the original restrictions remain in force as to nonhydrocarbon leases.  Pp.  490 U. S. 631-633.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEVENS, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part II-B-1 that the suit would have been dismissed at the outset if federal standing-to-sue rules were to apply, since neither respondent taxpayers nor respondent teachers association, the original plaintiffs, would have satisfied the requirements for bringing suit in federal court.  Respondent taxpayers' assertion that  27-234(B) has ""deprived the school trust funds of millions of dollars, thereby resulting in unnecessarily higher taxes,"" and respondent association's allegations that the section ""imposes an adverse economic impact"" on its members and that teachers have a special interest in the quality of education in the State, do not assert the kind of particular, direct, and concrete personal injury that is necessary to confer standing to sue in federal courts.  Pp.  490 U. S. 612-617.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, agreeing that the question whether the state court plaintiffs had Article III standing is irrelevant when it is the defendants below who invoke the federal courts' authority, concluded that it was unnecessary to reach the question of the standing of the plaintiffs below.  Pp.  490 U. S. 633-634.

No. 87-1661
Argued February 27, 1989
Decided May 30, 1989

Syllabus 
Among other things, the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910 granted Arizona certain lands, excluding mineral lands, in trust for the support of public schools, and, in  28, provided that granted lands cannot be sold or leased except upon compliance with certain conditions regarding advertising, bidding, and appraisal.  Arizona incorporated these conditions into Article 10 of its Constitution.  After this Court held the original mineral land exclusion inapplicable to lands not known to be mineral at the time of the grant, Wyoming v. United States, 255 U. S. 489, Congress passed the Jones Act in 1927, extending the terms of the original grant to encompass all mineral lands.  The Enabling Act was also amended in 1936 and 1951 to clarify the procedures for leasing granted lands for specific purposes.  The latter amendment expressly extinguished the  28 restrictions on leases of granted lands for the development of hydrocarbon substances.  Arizona's own law governing mineral leases on state lands does not require that the lands be advertised, appraised, or leased for their full appraised value.  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann.  27-234(B).  Respondents, individual taxpayers and a state teachers association, brought a state court suit against the State Land Department and others, seeking a declaration that  27-234(B) is void on the ground that it does not comply with the provisions of  28 or  10 of the Arizona Constitution and requesting appropriate injunctive relief.  Petitioners, mineral lessees of state school lands, intervened as defendants.  The trial court upheld the statute.  The State Supreme Court reversed, ruling that  27-234(B) is ""unconstitutional and invalid as it pertains to nonhydrocarbon mineral leases,"" and remanded the case for the trial court, inter alia, to enter a judgment declaring  27-234(B) invalid and to consider what further relief might be appropriate.
Held: The judgment is affirmed.
155 Ariz. 484, 747 P.2d 1183, affirmed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B-2, II-C, III, and IV, concluding that:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the decision below.  PP.  490 U. S. 610-612,  490 U. S. 617-633.
(a) The Arizona Supreme Court issued a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.  1257, despite the fact that it remanded the case for the trial court to determine appropriate further relief.  On remand, 
Page 490 U. S. 606
 the trial court does not have before it any federal question whether past or current leases are valid, since respondents, on appeal, withdrew their request for an accounting and payment of sums due under past leases.  In addition, the trial court's further actions cannot affect the State Supreme Court's ruling that  27-234(B) is invalid.  Thus, the judgment below comes within two of the exceptions to the finality requirement set out in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,  420 U. S. 479,  420 U. S. 480:  (1) the federal issue is conclusive and the outcome of further proceedings is preordained, and (2) the federal questions that could come to this Court have been adjudicated by the state court, and the remaining issues will not give rise to any further federal question.  Pp.  490 U. S. 611-612.
(b) When a state court has issued a judgment interpreting federal law in a case in which the plaintiffs in the original action lacked standing to sue under the principles governing the federal courts, this Court may exercise its jurisdiction on certiorari if the state court judgment causes direct, specific, and concrete injury to the parties who petition for this Court's review, as long as the requisites of an Article III case or controversy are also met.

Moreover, the requisites of a case or controversy are met, since the parties remain adverse, and the judgment below altered tangible legal rights.  It would be inappropriate for this Court to vacate the judgment below on the ground that respondents lacked federal standing when they brought suit initially, and to remand for appropriate proceedings, since such a course would render nugatory the state proceedings and have the effect of imposing federal standing requirements on the state courts whenever they adjudicate federal law issues, whereas established traditions and this Court's decisions recognize that state courts are not bound by Article III, and yet have it within both their power and proper role to render binding judgments on federal law issues, subject only to review by this Court.  It would also be inappropriate for this Court simply to order dismissal, leaving petitioners free to bring a declaratory judgment action in federal court raising the same claims, since such a disposition would be likely to defeat the normal preclusive effects of the state court's judgment on the ground that that court's conclusions about federal law were not subject to any federal review.  Such a course would also represent an unnecessary partial inroad on the Rooker-Feldman doctrine's construction of  1257 as barring direct review in lower federal courts of a decision reached by the highest state court, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.

No. 88-6066
Decided May 30, 1989
490 U.S. 638

Syllabus 
Petitioner Hildwin was convicted of first-degree murder by a Florida jury.  Since this crime is punishable by death or life imprisonment, state law requires that a separate sentencing proceeding be conducted, in which a jury makes an advisory recommendation but the court makes the ultimate decision whether to impose a death sentence, which it may impose after finding at least one aggravating factor.  The court must make written findings to support its imposition of a death sentence.  In Hildwin's case, the jury rendered a unanimous advisory sentence of death, and the judge imposed the death sentence, finding four aggravating circumstances and nothing in mitigation.  The State Supreme Court affirmed the sentence, rejecting Hildwin's argument that the sentencing scheme violates the Sixth Amendment because it permits the imposition of death without a specific finding by the jury that sufficient aggravating circumstances exist to qualify the defendant for capital punishment.
Held: The Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the death sentence be made by a jury.  Since the Court has held that the Amendment permits a judge to impose a death sentence when the jury recommends life imprisonment, Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, it follows that the Amendment does not forbid the judge to make written findings authorizing the imposition of a death sentence when the jury unanimously makes such a recommendation.  There is no Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing, even where the sentence turns upon specific aggravating circumstances.  McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79.  The existence of an aggravating factor is not an element of the offense, but is a sentencing factor that comes into play only after a defendant has been found guilty.

Syllabus 
Respondents -- passengers and representatives of the estates of passengers on a cruise ship hijacked by terrorists -- filed suit in the District Court against petitioner, the ship's owner, to recover damages for personal injuries and for the wrongful death of one passenger.  Before trial, petitioner moved to dismiss the actions, citing the forum-selection clause printed on each passenger ticket, which purported to obligate passengers to institute any suit in connection with the contract in Italy and to renounce the right to sue elsewhere.  The District Court denied the motions, holding that the ticket did not give passengers reasonable notice that they were waiving the opportunity to sue in a domestic forum.  The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal on the ground that the District Court's dismissal orders were interlocutory, and not appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291, holding that the orders did not fall within the exception to the rule of nonappealability carved out by the collateral order doctrine.
Held:  An interlocutory order denying a defendant's motion to dismiss a damages action on the basis of a contractual forum-selection clause is not immediately appealable under  1291.  Such an order is not final in the usual sense, for it does not end the litigation on the merits but, on the contrary, ensures that the litigation will continue.  Nor does the order fall within the narrow exception to the normal application of the final judgment rule known as the collateral order doctrine, for the order is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.  The right to be sued only in a particular forum, as compared to the right to avoid suit altogether, although not perfectly secured by an appeal after final judgment, is sufficiently vindicable at that stage and is not essentially destroyed if vindication is postponed until trial is completed.  Moreover, the costs associated with unnecessary litigation, should it eventually be decided that the District Court erred in trying the case, do not warrant allowing an immediate appeal of a pretrial order.  That there may be a policy favoring enforcement of foreign forum-selection clauses goes to the merits of petitioner's claim that its ticket agreement requires that suit be filed in Italy and that the agreement should be enforced by the federal courts, but does not affect the appealability of a prejudgment

490 U.S. 504

Syllabus 
In petitioner Green's product liability action against respondent Bock, the manufacturer of a machine that injured Green, Bock impeached Green's testimony by eliciting admissions that he had previously been convicted of burglary and a related felony.  After the jury returned a verdict for Bock, Green argued on appeal that the District Court had erred by denying his pretrial motion to exclude the impeaching evidence.  The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the District Court's ruling, following Circuit precedent established in Diggs v. Lyons, 741 F.2d 577.  Diggs held, inter alia, that Rule 609(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- which specifies that evidence that a witness has been convicted of a felony ""shall"" be admitted for the purpose of attacking the witness' credibility ""only if"" the court determines that the probativeness of the evidence outweighs its prejudice ""to the defendant"" -- mandates admission for impeachment purposes of a civil plaintiff's prior felony convictions, and that the Rule's specific command forecloses the judicial exercise of discretion under Rule 403, which authorizes the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
Held:  Rule 609(a)(1) requires a judge to permit impeachment of a civil witness with evidence of prior felony convictions regardless of ensuant unfair prejudice to the witness or the party offering the testimony.  Thus, the District Court did not err in allowing the jury to learn through impeaching cross-examination that Green was a convicted felon.  Pp.  490 U. S. 509-527.
(a) The Rule's text is ambiguous with respect to its applicability in civil cases.  By using the restrictive phrase ""to the defendant,"" the Rule's plain language appears not only to command the weighing of prejudice to a civil defendant, but also to compel the automatic admissibility of prior felony conviction evidence detrimental to a civil plaintiff.  An interpretation that would deny a civil plaintiff the same right to impeach an adversary's testimony that it grants a civil defendant is unacceptable; therefore, the Rule cannot mean what it says as far as civil trials are concerned.  Pp.  490 U. S. 509-511.
(b) The history leading to enactment of the Rule as law establishes that Congress intended that only the accused in a criminal case should be

			"|"Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co.
No. 87-1816
Argued January 18, 1989
Decided May 22, 1989
490 U.S. 504

Syllabus 
In petitioner Green's product liability action against respondent Bock, the manufacturer of a machine that injured Green, Bock impeached Green's testimony by eliciting admissions that he had previously been convicted of burglary and a related felony.  After the jury returned a verdict for Bock, Green argued on appeal that the District Court had erred by denying his pretrial motion to exclude the impeaching evidence.  The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the District Court's ruling, following Circuit precedent established in Diggs v. Lyons, 741 F.2d 577.  Diggs held, inter alia, that Rule 609(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- which specifies that evidence that a witness has been convicted of a felony ""shall"" be admitted for the purpose of attacking the witness' credibility ""only if"" the court determines that the probativeness of the evidence outweighs its prejudice ""to the defendant"" -- mandates admission for impeachment purposes of a civil plaintiff's prior felony convictions, and that the Rule's specific command forecloses the judicial exercise of discretion under Rule 403, which authorizes the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
Held:  Rule 609(a)(1) requires a judge to permit impeachment of a civil witness with evidence of prior felony convictions regardless of ensuant unfair prejudice to the witness or the party offering the testimony.  Thus, the District Court did not err in allowing the jury to learn through impeaching cross-examination that Green was a convicted felon.  Pp.  490 U. S. 509-527.
(a) The Rule's text is ambiguous with respect to its applicability in civil cases.  By using the restrictive phrase ""to the defendant,"" the Rule's plain language appears not only to command the weighing of prejudice to a civil defendant, but also to compel the automatic admissibility of prior felony conviction evidence detrimental to a civil plaintiff.  An interpretation that would deny a civil plaintiff the same right to impeach an adversary's testimony that it grants a civil defendant is unacceptable; therefore, the Rule cannot mean what it says as far as civil trials are concerned.  Pp.  490 U. S. 509-511.
(b) The history leading to enactment of the Rule as law establishes that Congress intended that only the accused in a criminal case should be

 protected from unfair prejudice by the balancing requirement set out in Rule 609(a)(1).  Pp.  490 U. S. 511-524.

490 U.S. 536

Syllabus 
In 1986, petitioner, who is incarcerated in a Michigan state prison, filed a pro se complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983 alleging that prison authorities had deprived him of his federal constitutional rights during 1980 and 1981.  The Federal District Court sua sponte dismissed the complaint because it had been filed after the expiration of Michigan's 3-year statutory limitations period for personal injury actions, which is applicable in federal civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C.  1988 and this Court's decisions.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, refusing to apply a Michigan statute that suspends limitations periods for persons under a legal disability, including prisoners, until one year after the disability has been removed.
Held:  A federal court applying a state statute of limitations to an inmate's federal civil rights action should give effect to the State's provision tolling the limitations period for prisoners.  The Court of Appeals' ruling to the contrary conflicts with Board of Regents, University of New York v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, which held that limitations periods in  1983 suits are to be determined by reference to the appropriate state statute of limitations and the coordinate tolling rules, as long as the state law would not defeat the goals of the federal law at issue.  The Michigan tolling statute is consistent with  1983's remedial purpose, since some inmates may be loathe to sue adversaries to whose daily supervision and control they remain subject, and even those who do file suit may not have a fair opportunity to establish the validity of their allegations while they are confined.  Pp.  490 U. S. 538-544.

Syllabus 
Petitioner's decedents were killed when their plane struck electric power lines on its approach to a city-run airfield in San Diego.  She filed the present action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.  1346(b), claiming that the Federal Aviation Administration had been negligent in its operation and maintenance of runway lights and in its performance of air traffic control functions.  Petitioner subsequently moved to amend her complaint to add state tort law claims against both the city and the utility company that maintained the power lines.  The District Court granted the motion and asserted ""pendent"" jurisdiction under Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715, concluding that ""judicial economy and efficiency"" favored trying the actions together, and that the claims arose ""from a common nucleus of operative facts.""  The Court of Appeals reversed on interlocutory appeal, categorically rejecting pendent-party jurisdiction under the FTCA.
Held:  The text of the FTCA -- which provides in pertinent part that the federal district courts shall have jurisdiction over ""civil actions on claims against the United States"" -- defines jurisdiction in a manner that does not reach defendants other than the United States.  This Court's decision in Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1, made explicit the nontransferability of Gibbs to the context of pendent party jurisdiction.  Aldinger, Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291, and Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, establish that a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties, even if consideration of the additional claims would promote ""judicial economy and efficiency,"" and all of the claims ""derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.""  Nor do the circumstances here suffice to establish ""ancillary"" jurisdiction.  The unavailability of jurisdiction over the additional claims is unaltered by the exclusivity of federal jurisdiction under the FTCA, even though that may sometimes require separate suits in state and federal court.  Finally, the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, which changed the relevant language of the FTCA from ""any claim against the United States"" to its present form, does not suggest an affirmative grant of pendent party jurisdiction, but is more naturally understood as a stylistic

No. 87-6571
Argued February 21, 1989
Decided May 15, 1989
490 U.S. 386

Syllabus 
Petitioner Graham, a diabetic, asked his friend, Berry, to drive him to a convenience store to purchase orange juice to counteract the onset of an insulin reaction.  Upon entering the store and seeing the number of people ahead of him, Graham hurried out and asked Berry to drive him to a friend's house instead.  Respondent Connor, a city police officer, became suspicious after seeing Graham hastily enter and leave the store, followed Berry's car, and made an investigative stop, ordering the pair to wait while he found out what had happened in the store.  Respondent backup police officers arrived on the scene, handcuffed Graham, and ignored or rebuffed attempts to explain and treat Graham's condition.  During the encounter, Graham sustained multiple injuries.  He was released when Conner learned that nothing had happened in the store.  Graham filed suit in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against respondents, alleging that they had used excessive force in making the stop, in violation of ""rights secured to him under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C.  1983.""  The District Court granted respondents' motion for a directed verdict at the close of Graham's evidence, applying a four-factor test for determining when excessive use of force gives rise to a  1983 cause of action, which inquires, inter alia, whether the force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain and restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.  Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, endorsing this test as generally applicable to all claims of constitutionally excessive force brought against government officials, rejecting Graham's argument that it was error to require him to prove that the allegedly excessive force was applied maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, and holding that a reasonable jury applying the Johnson v. Glick test to his evidence could not find that the force applied was constitutionally excessive.
Held:  All claims that law enforcement officials have used excessive force -- deadly or not -- in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other ""seizure"" of a free citizen are properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's ""objective reasonableness"" standard, rather than under a substantive due process standard.  Pp.  490 U. S. 392-399.
(a) The notion that all excessive force claims brought under  1983 are governed by a single generic standard is rejected.  Instead, courts must identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed by the challenged application of force, and then judge the claim by reference to the specific constitutional standard which governs that right.  Pp.  490 U. S. 393-394.
(b) Claims that law enforcement officials have used excessive force in the course of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other ""seizure"" of a free citizen are most properly characterized as invoking the protections of the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right ""to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable seizures,"" and must be judged by reference to the Fourth Amendment's ""reasonableness"" standard.  Pp.  490 U. S. 394-395.
(c) The Fourth Amendment ""reasonableness"" inquiry is whether the officers' actions are ""objectively reasonable"" in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.  The ""reasonableness"" of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.  Pp.  490 U. S. 396-397.
(d) The Johnson v. Glick test applied by the courts below is incompatible with a proper Fourth Amendment analysis.  The suggestion that the test's ""malicious and sadistic"" inquiry is merely another way of describing conduct that is objectively unreasonable under the circumstances is rejected.  Also rejected is the conclusion that, because individual officers' subjective motivations are of central importance in deciding whether force used against a convicted prisoner violates the Eighth Amendment, it cannot be reversible error to inquire into them in deciding whether force used against a suspect or arrestee violates the Fourth Amendment.  The Eighth Amendment terms ""cruel"" and ""punishment"" clearly suggest some inquiry into subjective state of mind, whereas the Fourth Amendment term ""unreasonable"" does not.  Moreover, the less protective Eighth Amendment standard applies only after the State has complied with the constitutional guarantees traditionally associated with criminal prosecutions.  Pp.  490 U.

No. 87-1344
Argued November 8, 1988
Decided May 15, 1989
490 U.S. 401

Syllabus 
Federal Bureau of Prisons regulations generally permit prisoners to receive publications from the ""outside,"" but authorize wardens, pursuant to specified criteria, to reject an incoming publication if it is found ""to be detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.""  Wardens may not reject a publication ""solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social[,] sexual, or . . . unpopular or repugnant,"" or establish an excluded list of publications, but must review each issue of a subscription separately.  Respondents, a class of inmates and certain publishers, filed suit in the District Court, claiming that the regulations, both on their face and as applied to 46 specifically excluded publications, violated their First Amendment rights under the standard set forth in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396.  The District Court refrained from adopting the Martinez standard in favor of an approach more deferential to the judgment of prison authorities, and upheld the regulations without addressing the propriety of the 46 exclusions.  The Court of Appeals, however, utilized the Martinez standard, found the regulations wanting, and remanded the case for an individualized determination on the constitutionality of the 46 exclusions.
Held:
1. Regulations such as those at issue that affect the sending of publications to prisoners must be analyzed under the standard set forth in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78,  482 U. S. 89, and are therefore ""valid if [they are] reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.""  Prison officials are due considerable deference in regulating the delicate balance between prison order and security and the legitimate demands of ""outsiders"" who seek to enter the prison environment.  The less deferential standard of Martinez -- whereby prison regulations authorizing mail censorship must be ""generally necessary"" to protect one or more legitimate governmental interests -- is limited to regulations concerning outgoing personal correspondence 
Page 490 U. S. 402
 from prisoners, regulations which are not centrally concerned with the maintenance of prison order and security.  Moreover, Martinez is overruled to the extent that it might support the drawing of a categorical distinction between incoming correspondence from prisoners (to which Turner applied its reasonableness standard) and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners.  Pp.  490 U. S. 407-414.
2. The regulations at issue are facially valid under the Turner standard.  Their underlying objective of protecting prison security is undoubtedly legitimate, and is neutral with regard to the content of the expression regulated.  Also, the broad discretion the regulations accord wardens is rationally related to security interests.  Furthermore, alternative means of expression remain open to the inmates, since the regulations permit a broad range of publications to be sent, received, and read, even though specific publications are prohibited.  Moreover, respondents have established no alternative to the regulations that would accommodate prisoners' constitutional rights at a de minimis cost to valid penological interests.  Pp.  490 U. S. 414-419.
3. The case is remanded for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  P.  490 U. S. 419.

The less deferential standard of Martinez -- whereby prison regulations authorizing mail censorship must be ""generally necessary"" to protect one or more legitimate governmental interests -- is limited to regulations concerning outgoing personal correspondence 
Page 490 U. S. 402
 from prisoners, regulations which are not centrally concerned with the maintenance of prison order and security.  Moreover, Martinez is overruled to the extent that it might support the drawing of a categorical distinction between incoming correspondence from prisoners (to which Turner applied its reasonableness standard) and incoming correspondence from nonprisoners.  Pp.  490 U. S. 407-414.
2. The regulations at issue are facially valid under the Turner standard.  Their underlying objective of protecting prison security is undoubtedly legitimate, and is neutral with regard to the content of the expression regulated.  Also, the broad discretion the regulations accord wardens is rationally related to security interests.  Furthermore, alternative means of expression remain open to the inmates, since the regulations permit a broad range of publications to be sent, received, and read, even though specific publications are prohibited.  Moreover, respondents have established no alternative to the regulations that would accommodate prisoners' constitutional rights at a de minimis cost to valid penological interests.  Pp.  490 U. S. 414-419.
3. The case is remanded for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  P.  490 U. S. 419.

Syllabus 
After respondent, the manager of a company which provided medical services for patients eligible for federal Medicare benefits, was convicted, inter alia, of submitting 65 false claims for Government reimbursement in violation of the federal criminal false-claims statute, he was sentenced to prison and fined $5,000.  Based solely on facts established by his criminal conviction, the District Court then granted the Government summary judgment in its suit against him under the federal civil False Claims Act (Act).  Under the strict terms of that Act's remedial provision, as it then existed, respondent would have been liable for a civil penalty of $2,000 on each of the 65 false claims, as well as for twice the amount of the Government's actual damages of $585 and the costs of the action.  However, because the statutorily authorized recovery of more than $130,000 bore no ""rational relation"" to the sum of the Government's actual loss plus its costs in investigating and prosecuting the false claims, which the court approximated at no more than $16,000, the court held that imposition of the full statutory amount would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment by punishing respondent a second time for the same conduct for which he had been convicted.  Since it considered the Act unconstitutional as applied to respondent, the court limited the Government's recovery to double damages and costs.  The Government took a direct appeal to this Court.
Held:  The statutory penalty authorized by the Act, as applied to respondent, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Pp.  490 U. S. 440-452.
(a) Although Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, and Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, establish that proceedings and penalties under the Act are civil in nature, and that a civil remedy does not constitute multiple punishment violative of the Clause merely because Congress provided for civil recovery in excess of the Government's actual damages, those cases did not consider and do not foreclose the possibility that, in a particular case, a civil penalty authorized by the Act may be so extreme and so divorced from the Government's actual damages and expenses as to constitute prohibited ""punishment.""  Pp.  490 U. S. 440-446.
(b) In the rare case such as the present, where a prolific but small-gauge offender previously has sustained a criminal penalty, and the civil

 penalty sought in a subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as ""punishment"" in the plain meaning of the word, the defendant is entitled to an accounting of the Government's damages and costs in order to allow the trial court, in its discretion, to determine whether the penalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment violative of the Clause and to set the size of the civil sanction the Government may receive without crossing the line between permissible remedy and prohibited punishment.  Pp.  490 U. S. 446-451.
(c) While the District Court correctly found that the disparity between its approximation of the Government's costs and respondent's statutory liability is sufficiently disproportionate that the sanction provided by the Act constitutes a second punishment violative of double jeopardy, the case is remanded to permit the Government to demonstrate that that court's assessment of its injuries was erroneous, since it would be unfair to deprive the Government of an opportunity to present an accounting of its actual costs arising from respondent's fraud, to seek an adjustment of the court's approximation, and to recover demonstrated costs.

Syllabus 
Following the District Court's issuance of a consent decree settling a class action brought by Kentucky penal inmates under 42 U.S.C.  1983, the Commonwealth promulgated ""Corrections Policies and Procedures,"" which, inter alia, contain a nonexhaustive list of prison visitors who ""may be excluded,"" including those who ""would constitute a clear and probable danger to the institution's security or interfere with [its] orderly operation.""  The Kentucky State Reformatory at La Grange subsequently issued its own ""Procedures Memorandum,"" which, in addition to including language virtually identical to that of the state regulations, sets forth procedures under which a visitor ""may"" be refused admittance and have his or her visitation privileges suspended by reformatory officials.  After the reformatory refused to admit several visitors and denied them future visits without providing them a hearing, the representatives of an inmate class filed a motion with the District Court, claiming, among other things, that the suspensions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court agreed, and directed that minimal due process procedures be developed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed and remanded, concluding, inter alia, that the language of the relevant prison policies created a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.
Held:  The Kentucky regulations do not give state inmates a liberty interest in receiving visitors that is entitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  490 U. S. 459-465.
(a) In order to create a protected liberty interest in the prison context, state regulations must use ""explicitly mandatory language,"" in connection with the establishment of ""specific substantive predicates"" to limit official discretion, and thereby require that a particular outcome be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met.

(b) Although the regulations at issue do provide certain ""substantive predicates"" to guide prison decisionmakers in determining whether to allow visitation, the regulations lack the requisite relevant mandatory language, since visitors ""may,"" but need not, be excluded whether they. fall within or without one of the listed categories of excludable visitors.  
Page 490 U. S. 455

Syllabus 
Petitioners, securities investors, signed a standard customer agreement which included an agreement to settle account disputes through binding arbitration unless the agreement was found unenforceable under federal or state law.  When the investments turned sour, petitioners brought suit in the District Court against, inter alia, respondent brokerage firm, alleging that their money was lost in unauthorized and fraudulent transactions in violation of, among other things, the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The District Court ordered all but the Securities Act claims to be submitted to arbitration, holding that those claims must proceed in the court action pursuant to the ruling in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427, that an agreement to arbitrate Securities Act claims is void under  14 of the Act, which prohibits a binding stipulation ""to waive compliance with any provision"" of the Act.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the arbitration agreement is enforceable because this Court's subsequent decisions have reduced Wilko to ""obsolescence.""
Held:  A predispute agreement to arbitrate claims under the Securities Act of 1933 is enforceable, and resolution of the claims only in a judicial forum is not required.  Pp.  490 U. S. 479-486.
(a) Wilko is overruled.  It was incorrectly decided, and is inconsistent with the prevailing uniform construction of other federal statutes governing arbitration agreements in the setting of business transactions.  See, particularly, Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, which declined to read  29(a) of the 1934 Act, which is identical to  14 of the 1933 Act, to prohibit enforcement of predispute agreements to arbitrate, and which stressed the strong language of the Arbitration Act declaring a federal policy favoring arbitration.  It would be undesirable for Wilko and McMahon to exist side by side, because their inconsistency is at odds with the principle that the 1933 and 1934 Acts be construed harmoniously in order to discourage litigants from manipulating their allegations merely to cast their claims under one, rather than the other, securities law.

No. 88-357
Argued March 27, 1989
Decided May 15, 1989
490 U.S. 488

Syllabus 
As the result of a 1958 conviction in a Washington state court, respondent Cook served a sentence that expired by its terms in 1978.  Subsequently, he was convicted of other state crimes, and, in 1978, he was sentenced to two life terms and one 10-year term.  Under state law, the 1958 conviction will increase by several years the mandatory minimum term that he will have to serve on his 1978 sentences.  He is currently serving a term in federal prison for certain federal crimes, and will begin serving his 1978 state sentences when his federal prison term expires.  While in federal prison, Cook filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus relief in the Federal District Court, alleging that his 1958 conviction was invalid, and thus had been used illegally to enhance the 1978 sentences which he had not yet begun to serve.  The court dismissed the petition, holding that, because the 1958 sentence had expired, Cook was not ""in custody"" -- as required by 28 U.S.C.  2241(c)(3) -- for the purposes of a habeas attack on the 1958 conviction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that he was ""in custody"" on the 1958 conviction because it had been used to enhance his 1978 sentences.
Held:  Cook is not presently ""in custody"" under the 1958 sentence, but he is ""in custody"" under the 1978 sentences.  Although a prisoner need not be physically confined in order to challenge his sentence on habeas corpus, once a sentence has completely expired, the possibility that the prior conviction will be used to enhance the sentences imposed for any subsequent convictions is not itself sufficient to render an individual ""in custody.""  See Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234.  However, Cook can challenge the 1978 sentences.  While he is not physically confined under those sentences, the fact that the State has placed a detainer with the federal authorities to ensure that he will be returned to the State authorities at the conclusion of his federal sentence is sufficient to put him ""in custody"" for habeas purposes.  See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54; Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U. S. 484.  And Cook's habeas petition, construed with the deference to which pro se litigants are entitled, can be read as asserting a challenge to the 1978 sentences as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior conviction.

 Aubrey Dennis ADAMS, Jr.v. Richard L. DUGGER, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections. No. 88-7140 (A-875). 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 3, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth 
Page 490 U.S. 1059 , 1060
 and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976), I would grant the motion for a stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 II  
 Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether the sentencing procedure in this case violated the Eighth Amendment requirement that a convicted defendant have the opportunity to present any relevant mitigating evidence-not just statutory mitigating factors-at the sentencing hearing. Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393 (1987). The Florida Supreme Court declined to find petitioner's Hitchcock claim procedurally barred and addressed this claim on the merits. Adams v. State, 543 So.2d 1244, 1247 (1989). Likewise, the District Court addressed the merits, determining that petitioner's ""is not a proper Hitchcock issue."" No. 89-67-Civ.-Oc-16, p. 5 (MD Fla., May 3, 1989). Moreover, since Hitchcock was not decided until after petitioner had filed his second federal habeas petition, I detect no abuse of the writ in petitioner raising this claim now for the first time. 
 At the time petitioner was sentenced, Florida's ""standard jury instructions included a charge which had the effect of limiting the jury's consideration to the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances,"" 543 So.2d, at 1247, reflecting what may have been the general belief in the State, based upon decisions such as Cooper v. State, 336 So.2d 1133 ( Fla.1976), that mitigating factors not specifically itemized in the statute, Fla.Stat. 921.141 (1975), were not to be taken into account in sentencing. Reasonably believing that state law prohibited a jury or court from considering non-statutory factors at sentencing, a Florida lawyer might rationally have declined to divert resources from other aspects of case development into the investigation, development, and presentation of evidence of such factors. Indeed, two of petitioner's counsel have filed affidavits to the effect that, operating on the basis of what they understood to be the law at the time, they did not pursue nonstatutory mitigating evidence because they did not believe it would be admissible. I would grant certiorari in this case to consider whether state-generated disincentives to the pursuit and presentation of mitigating evidence infected petitioner's sentencing with constitutional error.

 Aubrey Dennis ADAMS, Jr.v. Richard L. DUGGER, Secretary, Florida Department of Corrections. No. 88-7140 (A-875). 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 3, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 I  
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth 
Page 490 U.S. 1059 , 1060
 and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950 (1976), I would grant the motion for a stay of execution and the petition for a writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 II  
 Even if I did not take this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether the sentencing procedure in this case violated the Eighth Amendment requirement that a convicted defendant have the opportunity to present any relevant mitigating evidence-not just statutory mitigating factors-at the sentencing hearing. Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393 (1987). The Florida Supreme Court declined to find petitioner's Hitchcock claim procedurally barred and addressed this claim on the merits. Adams v. State, 543 So.2d 1244, 1247 (1989). Likewise, the District Court addressed the merits, determining that petitioner's ""is not a proper Hitchcock issue."" No. 89-67-Civ.-Oc-16, p. 5 (MD Fla., May 3, 1989). Moreover, since Hitchcock was not decided until after petitioner had filed his second federal habeas petition, I detect no abuse of the writ in petitioner raising this claim now for the first time. 
 At the time petitioner was sentenced, Florida's ""standard jury instructions included a charge which had the effect of limiting the jury's consideration to the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances,"" 543 So.2d, at 1247, reflecting what may have been the general belief in the State, based upon decisions such as Cooper v.

No. 87-1167
Argued October 31, 1988
Decided May 1, 1989
490 U.S. 228

Syllabus 
Respondent was a senior manager in an office of petitioner professional accounting partnership when she was proposed for partnership in 1982.  She was neither offered nor denied partnership, but instead her candidacy was held for reconsideration the following year.  When the partners in her office later refused to repropose her for partnership, she sued petitioner in Federal District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, charging that it had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its partnership decisions.  The District Court ruled in respondent's favor on the question of liability, holding that petitioner had unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners' comments about her that resulted from sex stereotyping.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Both courts held that an employer who has allowed a discriminatory motive to play a part in an employment decision must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination, and that petitioner had not carried this burden.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
263 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 825 F.2d 458, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that, when a plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that her gender played a part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff's gender into account.  The courts below erred by requiring petitioner to make its proof by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp.  490 U. S. 237-258.
(a) The balance between employee rights and employer prerogatives established by Title VII by eliminating certain bases for distinguishing among employees, while otherwise preserving employers' freedom of choice, is decisive in this case.  The words ""because of"" in  703(a)(1) of the Act, which forbids an employer to make an adverse decision against an employee ""because of such individual's . . . sex,"" requires looking at all of the reasons, both legitimate and illegitimate, contributing to the decision at the time it is made.  The preservation of employers' freedom of choice means that an employer will not be liable if it can prove that, if 
Page 490 U. S. 229
 it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision.  This Court's prior decisions demonstrate that the plaintiff who shows that an impermissible motive played a motivating part in an adverse employment decision thereby places the burden on the defendant to show that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the unlawful motive.  Here, petitioner may not meet its burden by merely showing that respondent's interpersonal problems -- abrasiveness with staff members -- constituted a legitimate reason for denying her partnership; instead, petitioner must show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced petitioner to deny respondent partnership.  Pp.  490 U. S. 239-252.
(b) Conventional rules of civil litigation generally apply in Title VII cases, and one of these rules is that the parties need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp.  490 U. S. 252-255.
(c) The District Court's finding that sex stereotyping was permitted to play a part in evaluating respondent as a candidate for partnership was not clearly erroneous.  This finding is not undermined by the fact that many of the suspect comments made about respondent were made by partners who were supporters, rather than detractors.  Pp.  490 U. S. 255-258.
JUSTICE WHITE, although concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in requiring petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reached the same employment decision in the absence of the improper motive, rather than merely requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence, as in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, which sets forth the proper approach to causation in this case, also concluded that the plurality here errs in seeming to require, at least in most cases, that the employer carry its burden by submitting objective evidence that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation.  In a mixed-motives case, where the legitimate motive found would have been ample grounds for the action taken, and the employer credibly testifies that the action would have been taken for the legitimate reasons alone, this should be ample proof, and there is no special requirement of objective evidence.  This would even more plainly be the case where the employer denies any illegitimate motive in the first place, but the court finds that illegitimate, as well as legitimate, factors motivated the adverse action.  Pp.  490 U. S. 258-261.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, although agreeing that, on the facts of this case, the burden of persuasion should shift to petitioner to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision absent consideration of respondent's gender, and that this burden shift is properly part of the liability phase of the litigation, concluded that the plurality misreads Title VII's substantive causation requirement to command burden-shifting if the employer's decisional process is 
Page 490 U. S. 230
 ""tainted"" by awareness of sex or race in any way, and thereby effectively eliminates the requirement.  JUSTICE O'CONNOR also concluded that the burden-shifting rule should be limited to cases, such as the present, in which the employer has created uncertainty as to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to an impermissible criterion.  Pp.  490 U. S. 261-279.
(a) Contrary to the plurality's conclusion, Title VII's plain language making it unlawful for an employer to undertake an adverse employment action ""because of"" prohibited factors and the statute's legislative history demonstrate that a substantive violation only occurs when consideration of an illegitimate criterion is the ""but-for"" cause of the adverse action.  However, nothing in the language, history, or purpose of the statute prohibits adoption of an evidentiary rule which places the burden of persuasion on the defendant to demonstrate that legitimate concerns would have justified an adverse employment action where the plaintiff has convinced the factfinder that a forbidden factor played a substantial role in the employment decision.  Such a rule has been adopted in tort and other analogous types of cases, where leaving the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove ""but-for"" causation would be unfair or contrary to the deterrent purposes embodied in the concept of duty of care.  Pp.  490 U. S. 262-269.
(b) Although the burden-shifting rule adopted here departs from the careful framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 -- which clearly contemplate that an individual disparate treatment plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion throughout the litigation -- that departure is justified in cases, such as the present, where the plaintiff, having presented direct evidence that the employer placed substantial, though unquantifiable, reliance on a forbidden factor in making an employment decision, has taken her proof as far as it could go, such that it is appropriate to require the defendant, which has created the uncertainty as to causation by considering the illegitimate criterion, to show that its decision would have been justified by wholly legitimate concerns.  Moreover, a rule shifting the burden in these circumstances will not conflict with other Title VII policies, particularly its prohibition on preferential treatment based on prohibited factors.  Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, distinguished.  Pp.  490 U. S. 270-276.
(c) Thus, in order to justify shifting the burden on the causation issue to the defendant, a disparate treatment plaintiff must show by direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.  Such a showing entitles the factfinder to presume that the employer's discriminatory animus made a difference in the outcome, and, if the employer fails to carry its burden of persuasion, to conclude that the employer's decision was made ""because of "" consideration of the illegitimate factor, thereby satisfying 
Page 490 U. S. 231
 the substantive standard for liability under Title VII.  This burden-shifting rule supplements the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework, which continues to apply where the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the threshold standard set forth herein.  Pp.  490 U. S. 276-279.

S. 258, and O'CONNOR, J., post, p.  490 U. S. 261, filed opinions concurring in the judgment.

No. 87-1490
Argued February 28, 1989

Syllabus 
Petitioner Mallard, an attorney recently admitted to practice before the District Court, was selected to represent indigent inmates in their suit in that court against prison officials under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  After a Magistrate denied his motion to withdraw, he appealed to the District Court, contending that forcing him to represent indigent inmates in a complex action requiring trial skills he did not possess would compel him to violate his ethical obligation to take on only those cases he could handle competently and would exceed the court's authority under 28 U.S.C.  1915(d), which provides that federal courts may ""request"" an attorney to represent any person claiming in forma pauperis status.  The court upheld the Magistrate's decision, ruling, inter alia, that  1915(d) empowers federal courts to make compulsory appointments in civil actions.  The Court of Appeals denied without opinion Mallard's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the District Court to allow his withdrawal.
Held:
1. Section 1915(d) does not authorize a federal court to require an unwilling attorney to represent an indigent litigant in a civil case.  The section's operative term is ""request,"" which bespeaks an intent not to authorize mandatory appointments of counsel.  The fact that  1915(c) -- which was adopted at the same time as  1915(d) -- imposes mandatory duties on court officers and witnesses in in forma pauperis cases demonstrates that Congress knew how to require service when it deemed compulsory service appropriate.  The conclusion that  1915(d) evinces a desire to permit attorneys to decline representation of indigent litigants if in their view their personal, professional, or ethical concerns bid them do so is bolstered by the fact that Congress, when it passed  1915(d) in 1892, was aware of, but chose not to replicate, the language of various state statutes providing for the ""appointment"" or ""assignment"" of counsel in in forma pauperis proceedings; by the fact that no reported pre-1892 American or English decision held that a lawyer could be sanctioned for declining representation without compensation; and by the fact that other pre- and post-1892 federal statutes providing for court-ordered representation specify that the court could ""assign"" or ""appoint"" attorneys, 
Page 490 U. S. 297
 rather than merely ""request"" that they serve.  Contrary to respondent's assertion, construing  1915(d) to allow courts to ask but not compel lawyers to represent indigent litigants does not render the section a nullity on the theory that statutory authorization is unnecessary for a court simply to ask, since the section may meaningfully be read to legitimize a court's request, and therefore to confront a lawyer with an important ethical decision.  Pp.  490 U. S. 300-308.
2. Mallard discharged his burden of proving that he was entitled to a writ of mandamus, and the Court of Appeals erred when it denied his application.  In resting its decision solely on  1915(d), the District Court plainly acted beyond its ""jurisdiction.""  In addition, Mallard had no alternative remedy available to him.  Moreover, the principal reasons for this Court's reluctance to condone use of the writ -- the undesirability of making a district court judge a litigant and the inefficiency of piecemeal appellate litigation -- are not present here.  Pp.  490 U. S. 308-310.
3. Respondents' contention that the federal courts possess inherent authority to require lawyers to serve will not be considered by this Court, since the lower courts did not invoke such authority in reaching their decisions.  P.  490 U. S. 310.

Syllabus 
A provision in the federal in forma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C.  1915(d), authorizes courts to dismiss an in forma pauperis claim if, inter alia, ""the action is frivolous or malicious.""  Respondent Williams, a prison inmate, filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis and a complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in the District Court, charging that prison officials had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by denying him medical treatment and his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by transferring him without a hearing to a less desirable cellhouse when he refused to continue working because of his medical condition.  The District Court dismissed the complaint sua sponte as frivolous under  1915(d) on the grounds that Williams had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The Court of Appeals, holding that the District Court had wrongly equated the standard for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) with the more lenient standard for frivolousness under  1915(d), which permits dismissal only if a petitioner cannot make any rational argument in law or fact entitling him to relief, affirmed the dismissal of the Fourteenth Amendment claim on the ground that a prisoner clearly has no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest in being incarcerated in a particular institution or wing.  However, the court reversed the dismissal of the Eighth Amendment claim as to two of the five defendants, declaring itself unable to state with certainty that Williams was unable to make any rational argument to support his claim.
Held:  A complaint filed in forma pauperis is not automatically frivolous within the meaning of  1915(d) because it fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  The two standards were devised to serve distinctive goals, and have separate functions.  Under Rule 12(b)(6)'s failure to state a claim standard -- which is designed to streamline litigation by dispensing with needless discovery and factfinding -- a court may dismiss a claim based on a dispositive issue of law without regard to whether it is based on an outlandish legal theory or on a close but ultimately unavailing one, whereas, under  1915(d)'s frivolousness standard -- which is intended to discourage baseless lawsuits -- dismissal is proper only if the legal theory (as in Williams' Fourteenth Amendment claim) or the factual contentions lack an arguable basis.  The considerable common 
Page 490 U. S. 320
 ground between the two standards does not mean that one invariably encompasses the other, since, where a complaint raises an arguable question of law which the district court ultimately finds is correctly resolved against the plaintiff, dismissal on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds is appropriate, but dismissal on the basis of frivolousness is not.  This conclusion flows from  1915(d)'s role of replicating the function of screening out inarguable claims from arguably meritorious ones played out in the realm of paid cases by financial considerations.  Moreover, it accords with the understanding articulated in other areas of law that not all unsuccessful claims are frivolous.  It is also consonant with Congress' goal in enacting the in forma pauperis statute of assuring equality of consideration for all litigants.  To conflate these standards would deny indigent plaintiffs the practical protections of Rule 12(b)(6) -- notice of a pending motion to dismiss and an opportunity to amend the complaint before the motion is ruled on -- which are not provided when complaints are dismissed sua sponte under  1915(d).  Pp.  490 U. S. 324-331.

Syllabus 
The Forest Service is authorized by statute to manage national forests for, inter alia, recreational purposes.  Because its decision to issue a recreational special use permit is a ""major Federal action"" within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), that decision must be preceded by the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  After a Service study designated a particular national forest location as having a high potential for development as a major downhill ski resort, Methow Recreation, Inc. (MRI), applied for a special use permit to develop and operate such a resort on that site and on adjacent private land MRI had acquired.  In cooperation with state and local officials, the Service prepared an EIS (the Study), which, among other things, considered the effects of various levels of development on wildlife and air quality both on-site and -- as required by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations -- off-site, and outlined steps that might be taken to mitigate adverse effects, indicating that these proposed steps were merely conceptual, and would ""be made more specific as part of the design and implementation stages of the planning process.""  The Study's proposed options regarding off-site mitigation measures were primarily directed to steps that might be taken by state and local governments.  After the Regional Forester decided to issue a permit as recommended by the Study, respondents appealed to the Chief of the Forest Service, who affirmed.  Respondents then brought suit to review the Service's decision, claiming that the Study did not satisfy NEPA's requirements.  The District Court's Magistrate filed an opinion concluding that the Study was adequate, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Study was inadequate as a matter of law on the grounds, inter alia, that NEPA imposes a substantive duty on agencies to take action to mitigate the adverse effects of major federal actions, which entails the further duty to include in every EIS a detailed explanation of specific actions that will be employed to mitigate the adverse impact; that if the Service had difficulty obtaining adequate information to make a reasoned assessment of the project's environmental impact, it had an obligation to make a ""worst 
Page 490 U. S. 333
 case analysis"" on the basis of available information, using reasonable projections of the worst possible consequences; and that the Service's failure to develop a complete mitigation plan violated its own regulations.
Held:
1. NEPA does not impose a substantive duty on agencies to mitigate adverse environmental effects or to include in each EIS a fully developed mitigation plan.  Although the EIS requirement and NEPA's other ""action-forcing"" procedures implement that statute's sweeping policy goals by ensuring that agencies will take a ""hard look"" at environmental consequences and by guaranteeing broad public dissemination of relevant information, it is well settled that NEPA itself does not impose substantive duties mandating particular results, but simply prescribes the necessary process for preventing uninformed -- rather than unwise -- agency action.  While a reasonably complete discussion of possible mitigation measures is an important ingredient of an EIS, and its omission therefrom would undermine NEPA's ""action-forcing"" function, there is a fundamental distinction between a requirement that mitigation be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated and a substantive requirement that a complete mitigation plan be actually formulated and adopted.  Here, since the off-site environmental effects of the project cannot be mitigated unless the nonfederal government agencies having jurisdiction over the off-site area take appropriate action, it would be incongruous to conclude that the Service has no power to act until the local agencies have finally determined what mitigation measures are necessary.  More significantly, it would be inconsistent with NEPA's reliance on procedural mechanisms -- as opposed to substantive, result-based standards -- to demand the presence of a fully developed mitigation plan before the agency can act.  Pp.  490 U. S. 348-353.
2. NEPA does not impose a duty on an agency to make a ""worst case analysis"" in its EIS if it cannot make a reasoned assessment of a proposed project's environmental impact.  Although prior CEQ regulations requiring such an analysis may well have expressed a permissible interpretation of NEPA, those regulations have since been amended to replace the worst case requirement with new requirements, and the Act itself does not mandate that uncertainty in predicting environmental harms be addressed exclusively by a worst case analysis.  The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the worst case regulation was a codification of prior NEPA case law, which, in fact, merely required agencies to describe environmental impacts even in the face of substantial uncertainty.  Moreover, the new CEQ regulations -- which require that agencies, in the face of unavailable information concerning a reasonably foreseeable 
Page 490 U. S. 334
 significant environmental consequence, prepare a summary of existing relevant and credible scientific evidence and an evaluation of adverse impacts based on generally accepted scientific approaches or research methods -- is entitled to substantial deference even though the worst case rule was in some respects more demanding, since there was good reason for the change in light of the substantial criticism to which the old regulation was subjected, and since the amendment was designed to better serve the EIS' ""hard look"" and public disclosure functions in preference to distorting the decisionmaking process by overemphasizing highly speculative harms.  Pp.  490 U. S. 354-356.
3. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the Service's failure to develop a complete mitigation plan violated its own regulations, which require, inter alia, that ""[e]ach special use authorization . . . contain . . . [t]erms and conditions which will . . . minimize damage to . . . the environment.""  Since the Study made clear that on-site effects of the proposed development will be minimal and easily mitigated, its recommended ameliorative steps cannot be deemed overly vague or underdeveloped.  Moreover, although NEPA and CEQ regulations require detailed analysis of off-site mitigation measures, there is no basis to conclude that the Service's own regulations must also be read in all cases to condition permit issuance on consideration (and implementation) of such measures.  The Service's regulations were promulgated pursuant to its broad statutory authorization to allow recreational use of national forests, and were not based on NEPA's more direct concern for environmental quality.  As is clear from the text of the permit issued to MRI, the Service has decided to implement its mitigation regulations by imposing appropriate controls over MRI's actual development and operation during the permit's term.  It was not unreasonable for the Service to have construed those regulations as not extending to off-site mitigation efforts that might be taken by state and local authorities, and that interpretation is controlling.  Pp.  490 U. S. 357-359.

Syllabus 
The Elk Creek Dam is part of a three-dam project designed to control the water supply in Oregon's Rogue River Basin.  The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) completed an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Elk Creek project in 1971, and, in 1980, released its final Environmental Impact Statement, Supplement No. 1 (FEISS).  Since the Rogue River is a premier fishing ground, the FEISS paid special heed to water quality, fish production, and angling, and predicted that the Elk Creek Dam would have no major effect on fish production, but that the effect of the Lost Creek and Elk Creek Dams on turbidity might, on occasion, impair fishing.  After reviewing the FEISS, the Corps' Division Engineer decided to proceed with the project and, in 1985, Congress appropriated funds for construction of the dam, now one-third completed.  Respondents, four Oregon nonprofit corporations, filed an action in the District Court to enjoin construction of the Elk Creek Dam, claiming that the Corps had violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) by failing, among other things, to describe adequately the environmental consequences of the project; to include a ""worst case analysis""; and to prepare a second supplemental EIS to review information in two documents developed after 1980.  The first -- the Cramer Memorandum -- is an internal memorandum, prepared by two Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) biologists based on a draft ODFW study on the effects of the Lost Creek Dam, suggesting that the Elk Creek Dam will adversely affect downstream fishing; and the second is a United States Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil survey containing information that might be taken to indicate greater downstream turbidity than did the FEISS.  The District Court denied relief on all claims and held, inter alia, that the Corps' decision not to prepare a second supplemental EIS to address the new information was reasonable.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, among other things, that the FEISS was defective because it did not include a complete mitigation plan and ""worst case analysis,"" and, with regard to the failure to prepare a supplemental EIS, that the ODFW and SCS documents brought to light significant new information 
Page 490 U. S. 361
 that was probably accurate, and that the Corps' experts failed to evaluate with sufficient care.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' conclusions that the FEISS was defective because it did not include a complete mitigation plan and a ""worst case analysis"" are erroneous for the reasons stated in Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, ante p.  490 U. S. 332.  Pp.  490 U. S. 369-370.
2. The Corps' decision that the FEISS need not be supplemented is not arbitrary and capricious, and should not be set aside.  Pp.  490 U. S. 370-385.
(a) An agency must apply a ""rule of reason"" and prepare a supplemental EIS if there remains ""major Federal actio[n]"" to occur, and if the new information will affect the quality of the human environment in a significant manner or to a significant extent not already considered.  Although not expressly addressed in NEPA, such a duty is supported by NEPA's approach to environmental protection and its manifest concern with preventing uninformed action, as well as by Council on Environmental Quality and Corps regulations, both of which make plain that, at times, supplementation is required.  Pp.  490 U. S. 370-374.
(b) Court review of the Corps' decision is controlled by the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(a).  Respondents' supposition that the determination that new information is ""significant"" is either a question of law or of ultimate fact and, thus, ""deserves no deference"" on review is incorrect, since the resolution of this dispute involves primarily issues of fact concerning contentions that the new information is accurate and undermines the FEISS' conclusions, and that the Corps' review was incomplete, inconclusive, or inaccurate.  Because analysis of the documents requires a high degree of technical expertise, this Court must defer to the informed discretion of the responsible agency.  However, courts should not defer to an agency without carefully reviewing the record and satisfying themselves that the agency has made a reasoned decision based on its evaluation of the new information.  Pp.  490 U. S. 375-378.
(c) The Corps conducted a reasoned evaluation of the relevant information in a formal Supplemental Information Report (SIR) and reached a decision that was not arbitrary and capricious.  The Corps carefully scrutinized the Cramer Memorandum -- which did not reflect the neutral stand of ODFW's official position -- and, in disputing its accuracy and significance, hired two independent experts who found significant fault in the methodology and conclusions of the underlying draft ODFW study.  Although the SIR did not expressly comment on the SCS survey, in light of in-depth studies conducted in 1974 and 1979, its 
Page 490 U. S. 362
 conclusion that ""turbidity effects are not expected to differ from those described in the 1980 EISS"" provided a legitimate reason for not preparing a supplemental FEISS to discuss turbidity.  Pp.  490 U. S. 378-385.

 In Seated in the front seat of the car was its owner and another occupant; petitioner was in the back seat. The officers approached the car and began to ask questions of the owner. As they did this, they saw petitioner lean over and appear to place an object on the floor. Fearful that the item might be a weapon, the officers ordered the men out of the car and searched its interior. The front and back seat areas were searched. [ Paulino v. U.S. 490 U.S. 1052 (1989) ][1052-Continued.] 
When one officer lifted the rear floormat, he found a packet of currency there. He picked up the packet, removed a rubber band, and examined the bills closely. He observed that all the bills had the same serial number and concluded that they were counterfeit. Petitioner was arrested and charged with a counterfeiting offense. 
 The District Court granted petitioner's motion to suppress the fruits of the search of the packet, but the Second Circuit reversed. 850 F.2d 93 ( 1988). The panel majority agreed with petitioner that the officer, upon determining that the item beneath the floor mat was neither a weapon nor plainly contraband, ""had no basis to take any further action."" Id., at 98 . ""[A]bsent either probable cause or self-evident contraband the search and seizure of these bills was unjustified,"" the Court of Appeals concluded. Ibid. However, the Second Circuit nonetheless refused to suppress the evidence so obtained because it found that petitioner lacked a ""reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched."" Ibid. 
 As I see it, the decision below was incorrect; it at least merits review here. The Fourth Amendment protects from unreasonable searches not only an individual's home and person, but also his effects. Even granting that petitioner had no ""expectation of privacy"" in the back seat of the car, he had standing to object to the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights when an admittedly illegal search and seizure of his property was conducted. To conclude otherwise, as the Second Circuit did here, would suggest 
Page 490 U.S. 1052 , 1053
 that when someone lays a sheaf of papers down on a sales counter, or places a sta k of documents on the bus seat beside him, or the like, the police may come along, pick up these items, and rifle through them-even if the officers lack probable cause or reasonable suspicion or any basis whatsoever for the search or seizure. None of our precedents reflects such an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment with respect to the right to resist the search and seizure of one's possessions, even when those possessions are in public places. 
 In its decision below, the Court of Appeals relied on our prior rulings in Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98 (1980); United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 65 L. Ed.2d 619 (1980); and Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 58 L. Ed.2d 387 (1978). These cases do support the notion that merely having a property right in a seized item does not give one standing to challenge the unlawful search of another person's property to find that item. Salvucci, supra, 448 U.S., at 91; Rawlings, supra, 448 U.S., at 105-106-2562. But this case is different from the cases on which the Second Circuit relied. In those cases, the aggrieved defendants sought to challenge the legality of searches of others' private places, when those searches revealed contraband items belonging to the defendants. In this case, though, the officers opened and examined an item belonging to petitioner which, on its face, offered no justification for such an examination. This case is thus like the one we left open in Rakas, supra, 439 U.S., at 142, n. 11, n. 11. 
 We have noted repeatedly in the past that the Fourth Amendment "" protects people, not places."" Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351, 511 (1967). Just because petitioner's packet was in a place that was not private does not deprive him of a right to resist a search of that packet, any more than Chadwick was so deprived by his placement of his suitcase in a car which the police had no cause to search. See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1d 538 (1977); United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 812-813, 2166-2167 (1982). Simply put, the Second Circuit confused petitioner's lack of standing to challenge the search of another's car for an item belonging to petitioner, with petitioner's right to challenge the search of an item belonging to him that was found within the car. 
 Nor is the sweep of the ruling below limited by observing that petitioner could have preserved his privacy interest in the packet of bills if he had kept it on his person. Such a view suggests that the officers could not have taken petitioner's wallet from his person and examined its contents but could have searched his brief- [490 U.S. 1052 , 1054]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 1, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Memorandum of Justice STEVENS respecting the denial of the petition for writ of certiorari. 
 There are times when it is important to emphasize the fact that an order denying a petition for a writ of certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any question presented by the petition. See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 940, 942, 337 (1978) ( STEVENS, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). In my opinion, this is such an occasion. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice SCALIA and Justice KENNEDY join, dissenting. 
 In this case, the Court of Appeals has misread a statute designed to protect the rights of a class of federal workers and misapplied our decision in United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392d 114 (1976). The result is a jurisdictional ruling which even respondent here, the United States, does not defend. The Solicitor General has informed this Court that the United States views the jurisdictional holding of the Court of Appeals as plainly wrong and asks that its decision be vacated and remanded. See Brief for United States 6- 7. Because the error is plain, and because it carries the clear potential of compounding itself in the Back Pay Act jurisprudence of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, I would grant the petition and summarily reverse the judgment below. 
 Petitioner, a former member of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division (USSSUD), was involved in a motorcycle accident while allegedly responding to a call for relief at 1310 L Street, N.W., in Washington, D.C., which is the headquarters of the Secret Service. As he and a fellow officer were passing through a private alley on motorcycles, an automobile exited from 
Page 490 U.S. 1054 , 1055
 an underground garage and struck petitioner's motorcycle, pinning him underneath his vehicle. Petitioner received immediate medical care, and later underwent corrective surgery for damage to his left knee. After the accident, in order to receive paid administrative leave, petitioner requested a determination that the accident occurred in the performance of his duties. Such a determination was critical to petitioner's rights under 5 U.S.C. 6324(a), which provides: ""Sick leave may not be charged to the account of a member of the Metropolitan Police force or the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, the United States Park Police force, or the Executive Protective Service force for an absence due to injury or illness resulting from the performance of duty."" Pursuant to agency regulations, an investigation and subsequent review by the Administrative Review Board were conducted. The agency determined that under its regulations petitioner's injury did not occur in ""the performance of duty"" due to the fact that he was in violation of local traffic regulations and USSSUD regulations at the time of the accident. Petitioner was thus denied administrative leave for the period of his convalescence, and after his sick leave was exhausted, he was placed on leave without pay. 
 Petitioner subsequently brought this action in the United States Claims Court, seeking a determination that he was erroneously denied paid administrative leave by the agency and was thus entitled to an award of backpay for the period in question. Petitioner premised the Claims Court's jurisdiction on that portion of the Tucker Act now codified at 28 U.S.C. 1491(a)(1), which provides generally that the United States Claims Court ""shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress."" The ""Act of Congress"" upon which petitioner relied was the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. 5596, which provides in pertinent part: 
 ""(b)(1) An employee of an agency who . . . is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee-

|490 u.s. 163|"Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico
No. 87-1327
Argued November 30, 1988
Decided April 25, 1989
490 U.S. 163

Syllabus 
Pursuant to authority granted by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (1938 Act), the Jicarilla Apache Tribe (Tribe) leased lands on its New Mexico reservation to appellant Cotton Petroleum Corp. (Cotton), a non-Indian company, for the production of oil and gas.  Cotton's on-reservation production is subject to both a 6% tribal severance tax and appellee State's 8% severance taxes, which apply to all producers throughout the State.  In 1982, Cotton paid its state taxes under protest, and then brought an action in state court under, inter alia, the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, contending that the state taxes were invalid on the basis of evidence tending to prove that the amount of such taxes imposed on reservation activity far exceeded the value of services the State provided in relation to such activity.  The Tribe filed a brief amicus curiae arguing that a decision upholding the state taxes would substantially interfere with the Tribe's ability to raise its own tax rates and would diminish the desirability of on-reservation leases.  The trial court upheld the state taxes, concluding, among other things, that the State provides substantial services to both the Tribe and Cotton, that the theory of public finance does not require that expenditures equal revenues, that the taxes' economic and legal burden falls on Cotton and has no adverse impact on tribal interests, and that the taxes are not preempted by federal law.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed.  This Court noted probable jurisdiction and invited the parties to brief and argue the additional question whether the Commerce Clause requires a tribe to be treated as a ""State"" for purposes of determining whether a state tax on nontribal activities conducted on a reservation must be apportioned to account for taxes the tribe imposed on the same activity.
Held:  The State may validly impose severance taxes on the same on-reservation production of oil and gas by non-Indian lessees as is subject to the Tribe's own severance tax.  Pp.  490 U. S. 173-193.
(a) Under this Court's modern decisions, on-reservation oil and gas production by non-Indian lessees is subject to nondiscriminatory state taxation unless Congress has expressly or impliedly acted to preempt the state taxes.  See, e.g., Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376,  303 U. S. 386-387.  Pp.  490 U. S. 173-176. 
Page 490 U. S. 164

(b) The state taxes in question are not preempted by federal law, even when it is given the most generous construction under the relevant preemption test, which is flexible and sensitive to the particular facts and legislation involved and requires a particularized examination of the relevant state, federal, and tribal interests, including tribal sovereignty and independence.  The 1938 Act neither expressly permits nor precludes state taxation, but simply authorizes the leasing for mining purposes of Indian lands.  Moreover, that Act's legislative history sheds little light on congressional intent.  The statement therein that preexisting law was inadequate to give Indians the greatest return for their property does not embody a broad congressional policy of maximizing tribes' revenues without regard to competing state interests, but simply suggests that Congress sought to remove disadvantages in mineral leasing on Indian lands that were not present with respect to public lands, which were, at the time, subject to state taxation.  Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759,  471 U. S. 767, n. 5, distinguished.  The fact that the 1938 Act's statutory predecessor expressly waived immunity from state taxation of oil and gas lessees on reservations demonstrates that there is no history of tribal independence from such taxation, while the 1938 Act's omission of that waiver simply reflects congressional recognition that this Court's intervening decisions had repudiated the preexisting doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity, under which such state taxation was barred absent express congressional authorization.  White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, and Ramah Navajo School Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue of New Mexico, 458 U. S. 832, are distinguished on the ground that, here, the State provides substantial services to the Tribe and Cotton that justify the tax; the tax imposes no economic burden on the Tribe; and federal and tribal regulation is not exclusive, since the State regulates the spacing and mechanical integrity of on-reservation wells.  Pp.  490 U. S. 176-187.
(c) There is no merit to Cotton's contention that the State's severance taxes -- insofar as they are imposed without allocation or apportionment on top of tribal taxes -- impose an unlawful multiple tax burden on interstate commerce.  The fact that the State and Tribe tax the same activity is not dispositive, since each of those entities has taxing jurisdiction over the non-Indian wells by virtue of the location of Cotton's leases entirely on reservation lands within a single State.  That the total tax burden on Cotton is greater than the burden on off-reservation producers is also not determinative, since neither taxing jurisdiction's tax is discriminatory, and the burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact of concurrent jurisdiction.  The argument that the state taxes generate revenues that far exceed the value of the State's on-reservation services 
Page 490 U. S. 165
 is also rejected.  Moreover, there is no constitutional requirement that the benefits received from a taxing authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer -- or by those living in the taxpayer's community -- must equal the amount of its tax obligations.  Pp.  490 U. S. 187-191.
(d) The express language, distinct applications, and judicial interpretation of the Interstate Commerce and Indian Commerce Clauses establish that Indian tribes may not be treated as ""States"" for tax apportionment purposes.  Pp.  490 U. S. 191-193.
106 N.M. 517, 745 P.2d 1170, affirmed.
STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined.  BLACKMUN, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which BRENNAN and MARSHALL, JJ., joined, post, p.  490 U. S. 193.

(c) There is no merit to Cotton's contention that the State's severance taxes -- insofar as they are imposed without allocation or apportionment on top of tribal taxes -- impose an unlawful multiple tax burden on interstate commerce.  The fact that the State and Tribe tax the same activity is not dispositive, since each of those entities has taxing jurisdiction over the non-Indian wells by virtue of the location of Cotton's leases entirely on reservation lands within a single State.  That the total tax burden on Cotton is greater than the burden on off-reservation producers is also not determinative, since neither taxing jurisdiction's tax is discriminatory, and the burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact of concurrent jurisdiction.  The argument that the state taxes generate revenues that far exceed the value of the State's on-reservation services 
Page 490 U. S. 165
 is also rejected.  Moreover, there is no constitutional requirement that the benefits received from a taxing authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer -- or by those living in the taxpayer's community -- must equal the amount of its tax obligations.  Pp.  490 U. S. 187-191.
(d) The express language, distinct applications, and judicial interpretation of the Interstate Commerce and Indian Commerce Clauses establish that Indian tribes may not be treated as ""States"" for tax apportionment purposes.  Pp.  490 U. S. 191-193.

No. 87-2098
Argued March 1, 1989
Decided April 25, 1989
490 U.S. 212

Syllabus 
Section 7005 of the Consolidated Onmibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish a schedule of pipeline safety user fees based on usage of hazardous pipelines and to collect such fees annually from persons operating pipeline facilities subject to the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) and the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA).  Section 7005 -- designed to make the administration of the HLPSA and the NGPSA self-financing -- provides that the assessed fees be used to finance activities authorized by the HLPSA and the NGPSA, and that such fees may not exceed 105 percent of the aggregate of congressional appropriations for the fiscal year for activities to be funded by the fees.  Pursuant to this mandate, the Secretary published fee schedules and assessed fees for fiscal year 1986.   Appellee Mid-America Pipeline Co. -- which owns and operates pipelines that transport hazardous liquids and is, therefore, subject to the HLPSA -- paid its fees under protest and filed suit against the Secretary in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court adopted the conclusions of a Magistrate recommending that  7005 be struck down as an unconstitutional delegation to the Department of Transportation of Congress' taxing power on the grounds that the assessments were taxes, rather than fees, and that, in enacting  7005, Congress did not give the kind of guidance to the Secretary necessary to avoid the conclusion that Congress had unconstitutionally delegated such power to the Executive Branch.
Held:  Section 7005 of COBRA is not an unconstitutional delegation of the taxing power by Congress to the Executive Branch.  Pp.  490 U. S. 218-224.
(a) The multiple restrictions Congress placed on the Secretary's discretion to assess user fees meet the normal requirements of the nondelegation doctrine, which requires that Congress provide an administrative agency with standards guiding its actions such that a court can ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed.  In enacting  7005, Congress delimited the scope of the Secretary's discretion with greater specificity than in other delegations this Court has upheld.  The Secretary may not collect fees from firms not subject to either of the two 
Page 490 U. S. 213
 Pipeline Safety Acts or use the funds for purposes other than administering such Acts; he may not set fees on a case-by-case basis, apply a fee-setting criteria other than one of those delineated by Congress, or establish a fee schedule that does not bear a reasonable relationship to these criteria, and he has no discretion to expand the budget for administering the Pipeline Safety Acts because of the 105 percent ceiling.  Pp.  490 U. S. 218-220.
(b) Even if the user fees are a form of taxation, neither the Constitution nor congressional practices require the application of a different and stricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where Congress delegates discretionary authority to the Executive under its taxing power.  There is nothing in the placement of the Taxing Clause -- first in place among the powers of Congress enumerated in Art. I,  8, of the Constitution -- that would distinguish the power to tax from other enumerated powers in terms of the scope and degree of authority that Congress may delegate to the Executive Branch to execute the laws.  Moreover, the Origination Clause -- which requires that all revenue bills originate in the House of Representatives -- implies nothing about the scope of Congress' power to delegate discretionary authority under its taxing power once a bill has been properly enacted.  Even when enacting tax legislation with remarkable specificity, as it has done in the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has delegated the authority to prescribe, and to determine the retroactivity of, rules and regulations for enforcement of the Code.  Congress relies on administrators and the courts to implement the legislative will, since it cannot be expected to anticipate every conceivable problem that can arise or carry out day-to-day oversight.  Pp.  490 U. S. 220-223.
(c) This Court's decisions in National Cable Television Assn., Inc. v. United States, 415 U. S. 336, and FPC v. New England Power Co., 415 U. S. 345, are not to the contrary, since they stand only for the proposition that Congress must indicate clearly its intention to delegate to the Executive the discretionary authority to recover administrative costs not inuring directly to the benefit of regulated parties by imposing additional financial burdens, whether characterized as ""fees"" or ""taxes,"" on those parties.  Section 7005 explicitly reflects Congress' intent that the total costs of administering the HLPSA and the NGPSA be recovered through assessment of charges on those regulated by the Acts.  Pp.  490 U. S. 223-223.

490 U.S. 225

Syllabus 
Appellee filed suit in the District Court to bar enforcement of 18 U.S.C.  1302 -- which, inter alia, prohibits the mailing of any ""publication of any kind . . . containing any list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of"" a lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme offering prizes dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance -- based on the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The court found  1302 valid as applied to advertisements, but unconstitutional as applied to prize lists.  After appellants sought review of the ruling on prize lists and appellee cross-appealed from the ruling on advertisements, Congress passed two laws affecting 1302's coverage.  The parties have agreed to dismiss the cross-appeal.
Held:  The appeal on the issue whether  1302 is constitutional as applied to prize lists is moot.  Since appellants now take the position that the statute does not apply to the noncommercial publishing of prize lists, appellee is willing to forgo any further claim to the declaratory and equitable relief sought in its complaint.  Thus, there is no longer any live controversy.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 24, 1989
 Rehearing Denied June 12, 1989. 
 See 490 U.S. 1117. 
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 Even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the petition and vacate petitioner's death sentence, so that we might address petitioner's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial. After an extended hearing, the District Court granted petitioner's writ of habeas corpus, ruling that petitioner had not received effective assistance of counsel, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. The panel's judgment, however, was overturned 
Page 490 U.S. 1040 , 1041
 by the Court of Appeals sitting en banc, over a strong dissenting opinion which three judges joined. 863 F.2d 1377, 1394 (1988) (McMillian, J., dissenting, joined by Lay, C.J., and Heaney and Arnold, JJ.). 
 In my view, the behavior of petitioner's attorney at the penalty phase was plainly deficient, depriving his client of ""the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment."" Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 2064 (1984 ). The attorney offered literally no evidence in mitigation. This inaction cannot be explained by a dearth of potentially mitigating evidence. On the contrary, the attorney knew of, but failed to investigate, a number of facts about petitioner on which quite credible arguments in mitigation could have been made. Petitioner told his attorney, for example, that he had fought for this country in Vietnam and received an honorable discharge from the Army. 863 F.2d, at 1396 ( dissenting opinion). The attorney, however, failed to pursue this claim. Had he done so, he would have learned that petitioner had earned the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. Id., at 1397. 
 The attorney also knew that many of the soldiers who served in the Vietnam conflict suffered severe emotional trauma afterwards, encountering problems of socialization and readjustment. In some cases, they have suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder so severe as to induce violent criminality, a fact recognized by Congress when it passed the Veterans Health Care Amendments of 1979, 38 U.S.C. 612 et seq. 863 F.2d, at 1396- 1397. The attorney failed, too, to explore this potential source of mitigating evidence, deciding after a sketchy telephone conversation with petitioner's stepmother and after a brief conversation with his brother not to interview the family. Id., at 1395-1396. Had he done so, he would have learned that after his experience in Vietnam, petitioner ""changed from a church-going young man who had never had any trouble with the law to a nervous and withdrawn loner constantly in trouble, in and out of prison."" Id., at 1397. The attorney also failed to explore petitioner's postdischarge psychiatric records, documents which would have provided "" even more evidence of [petitioner's] personality change after his military service in Vietnam.""

490 U.S. 93

Syllabus 
Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, held that, generally, only overcharged direct purchasers, and not subsequent indirect purchasers, are entitled to recover treble damages under  4 of the Clayton Act for price fixing violative of  1 of the Sherman Act.  Appellant States -- who are, at least in part, indirect purchasers of cement -- brought class actions against various cement producers in the appropriate federal courts seeking treble damages under the federal antitrust laws for an alleged nationwide conspiracy to fix cement prices and damages for alleged violations of their respective state antitrust laws, which arguably allow indirect purchasers to recover for all overcharges passed on to them by direct purchasers.  The cases were transferred to the District Court for coordinated pretrial proceedings, and a settlement was reached with several major defendants.  When appellants sought payment out of the settlement fund for their state indirect purchaser claims, appellees, class members who are direct purchasers, objected.  The court refused to allow the claims, ruling that the state statutes are preempted by federal law because they are clear attempts to frustrate Congress' purposes and objectives, as interpreted in Illinois Brick.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, depending on how they were construed, the state statutes would either conflict directly with federal law under Illinois Brick or would impermissibly interfere with the three federal antitrust policy goals that the court identified as having been defined by Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481:  avoiding unnecessarily complicated litigation; providing direct purchasers with incentives to bring private antitrust actions; and avoiding multiple liability of defendants.
Held:  The rule limiting federal antitrust recoveries to direct purchasers does not prevent indirect purchasers from recovering damages flowing from state antitrust law violations.  Pp.  490 U. S. 100-106.
(a) The state indirect purchaser statutes are not preempted by the federal antitrust laws.  There is no claim of express preemption or of congressional occupation of the field.  The claim that the state laws are inconsistent with, and stand as an obstacle to, effectuating the congressional purposes identified in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick misunderstands these cases, which merely construed the federal antitrust laws 
Page 490 U. S. 94
 and did not consider state law or preemption standards or define the interrelationship between the federal and state law.  Nothing in Illinois Brick suggests that it would be contrary to congressional purposes for States to allow indirect purchasers to recover under their own antitrust laws.  Pp.  490 U. S. 100-103.
(b) In any event, the state indirect purchaser statutes do not interfere with accomplishing the federal law purposes as identified in Illinois Brick.  First, the state statutes will not engender unnecessarily complicated federal antitrust proceedings, since they cannot and do not purport to affect available federal law remedies; since claims under them could be brought in state court, separately from federal direct purchaser actions; and since federal courts have discretion to decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over burdensome state claims.  Second, claims under the state statutes will not reduce the incentives of direct purchasers to bring private federal antitrust actions by reducing their potential recoveries.  Illinois Brick was not concerned with the risk that a federal plaintiff might not be able to recover its entire damages award or might be offered less to settle.  Rather, it was concerned that requiring direct and indirect purchasers to apportion the recovery under a single statute --  4 of the Clayton Act -- would result in no one plaintiff having a sufficient incentive to sue under that statute.  The state statutes at issue pose no similar risk.  That direct purchasers' recoveries may be reduced because they will have to share the settlement fund with indirect purchasers is not due to the impermissible operation of the state statutes, but is, rather, a function of the fact and form of the settlement, which was intended to dispose of all claimants, whether claiming under federal or state law and whether direct or indirect purchasers.  Third, claims under the state statutes will not contravene any express federal policy condemning multiple liability for antitrust defendants, since Illinois Brick and similar cases simply construed  4, and did not identify a federal policy against imposing state liability in addition to that imposed by federal law.  Pp.  490 U. S. 103-106.
817 F.2d 1435, reversed.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except STEVENS and O'CONNOR, JJ., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Rather, it was concerned that requiring direct and indirect purchasers to apportion the recovery under a single statute --  4 of the Clayton Act -- would result in no one plaintiff having a sufficient incentive to sue under that statute.  The state statutes at issue pose no similar risk.  That direct purchasers' recoveries may be reduced because they will have to share the settlement fund with indirect purchasers is not due to the impermissible operation of the state statutes, but is, rather, a function of the fact and form of the settlement, which was intended to dispose of all claimants, whether claiming under federal or state law and whether direct or indirect purchasers.  Third, claims under the state statutes will not contravene any express federal policy condemning multiple liability for antitrust defendants, since Illinois Brick and similar cases simply construed  4, and did not identify a federal policy against imposing state liability in addition to that imposed by federal law.  Pp.  490 U. S. 103-106.

No. 88-32
Argued February 21, 1989

490 U.S. 107

Syllabus 
Petitioner Commonwealth issued criminal complaints charging that, in failing to compensate two discharged bank vice presidents for vacation time they accrued but did not use, respondent bank president had violated a Massachusetts statute making it unlawful for an employer not to pay a discharged employee his full wages, including vacation payments, on the date of his discharge.  Respondent moved to dismiss on the ground that the bank's vacation policy constituted an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" under  3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and that the prosecution therefore ran afoul of  514(a) of ERISA, which preempts ""any and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan.""  The trial court reported the preemption question to the Massachusetts Appeals Court for decision.  For the purpose of answering the reported question, the parties stipulated that the bank had agreed to pay employees in lieu of unused vacation time, and that such payments were made out of general assets in lump sums upon employment termination.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts transferred the case to its docket on its own initiative and held that the bank's policy constituted an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" and that the prosecution was therefore preempted.
Held:  A policy of paying discharged employees for their unused vacation time does not constitute an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" within the meaning of  3(1) of ERISA, and a criminal action to enforce that policy is therefore not foreclosed by  514(a).  Pp.  490 U. S. 112-121.
(a) Although  3(1) defines an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" as ""any plan . . . maintained for the purpose of providing . . . vacation benefits,"" the reference to such benefits -- when viewed in the context of the many other, related types of welfare benefits listed in the section and in light of ERISA's primary purposes of preventing the mismanagement of accumulated plan funds and the failure to pay benefits from such funds -- must be understood not to relate to ordinary vacation payments, which typically are fixed, due at known times, not dependent on contingencies outside the employee's control, and payable from the employer's general assets; rather, it encompasses only those vacation benefit funds which accumulate over a period of time and in which either the employee's right to a benefit is contingent upon some future occurrence or the employee 
Page 490 U. S. 108
 bears a risk different from his ordinary employment risk.  The regulations of the Secretary of Labor, which are entitled to deference as the reasonable interpretations of the official specifically authorized to define ERISA's terms, adopt this understanding of the statute by providing that numerous ""payroll practices"" are not ""employee welfare benefit plans,"" including the payment of (1) vacation benefits out of an employer's general assets, rather than from a trust fund and (2) premium rates for work during special periods such as holidays and weekends, which position the Secretary has consistently followed even when the premium pay is accumulated and carried over to later years.  Pp.  490 U. S. 112-119.
(b) There is no merit to respondent's argument that the bank's policy did not constitute an exempted ""payroll practice"" under the Secretary's regulations because employees were allowed at their option to accumulate vacation time and defer payment for such time until termination.  Although neither regulation explicitly covers this precise practice, the reasons for treating premium and vacation payments as payroll practices are equally applicable here, and the vacation benefit cannot be transformed into an ""employee welfare benefit plan"" solely because the employees did not use their vacation days prior to their formal termination.  Moreover, except for the fact of deferral, the payments in question are as much a part of regular basic compensation as overtime pay or salary payments made while the employee is on vacation; amount to the same kind of premium pay that is available for holiday or weekend work; and, unlike normal severance pay, are not contingent upon employment termination.

No. 87-1055
Argued December 7, 1988
Decided April 18, 1989
490 U.S. 122

Syllabus 
This case involves wrongful-death actions against Korean Air Lines, Ltd. (KAL) by survivors of persons killed when one of its planes was destroyed by a Soviet aircraft.  All parties agree that their rights are governed by the multilateral treaty known as the Warsaw Convention, which provides a per passenger damages limitation for personal injury or death.  A private accord among airlines known as the Montreal Agreement requires carriers to give notice of this limitation to passengers in print size no smaller than 10-point type.  Since KAL's notice to passengers on the flight in question appeared in only 8-point type, plaintiffs moved for a partial summary judgment declaring that the discrepancy deprived KAL of the benefit of the damages limitation.  The District Court denied the motion, finding that neither the Convention nor the Agreement prescribes elimination of the limitation as the sanction for failure to provide the required form of notice.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on interlocutory appeal.
Held:  International air carriers do not lose the benefit of the Warsaw Convention's damages limitation if they fail to provide notice of that limitation in passenger tickets.  The Montreal Agreement concededly does not impose such a sanction, and the Convention's plain language also does not direct that result.  Interpreting the second sentence of Article 3(2) of the Convention -- which subjects a carrier to unlimited liability only for the nondelivery of a passenger ticket -- to apply to the failure to provide an ""adequate"" statement of notice of the damages limitation conflicts with the language of the first sentence of Article 3(2), which specifies that ""[t]he . . . irregularity . . . of the . . . ticket shall not affect the existence or the validity of the [transportation] contract.""  Such an interpretation of the text would also entail the unlikely result that even a minor defect in a ticket, totally unrelated to adequate notice, would eliminate the liability limitation.  That defective compliance with the notice provision does not void the damages limitation is confirmed by comparing Article 3(2) with other Convention provisions, which specifically impose that sanction for failure to include the notice of liability limitation in baggage checks and air waybills for cargo.  Although the Convention's drafting history might be consulted to elucidate a text that is ambiguous,

Standard Form 189, devised by appellee Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (DISOO), and Form 4193, created by appellee Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), forbade certain Executive Branch employees to reveal classified or ""classifiable"" information to persons not authorized to receive such information, making clear that, if they did so, they could lose their security clearances, their jobs, or both.  The DISOO, but not the DCI, defined the term ""classifiable.""  Although  630 of the Continuing Resolution for fiscal year 1988 prohibited the expenditure of that year's funds for the implementation or enforcement of, inter alia, the forms, both forms continued to be used.  Appellant American Foreign Service Association and others filed suit in the District Court challenging the use of the forms on the ground that they violated  630, and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would, among other things, direct appellees to notify all employees who signed either form after the effective date of  630 that the agreements were void and that their terms could not be enforced during fiscal year 1988.  The lawsuit was consolidated with other suits seeking to enjoin the forms' use on the ground, inter alia, that the term ""classifiable"" was so vague and overbroad that it inhibited employees' speech in violation of the First Amendment.  The District Court assumed that the Executive Branch's actions since  630's enactment did not comply with the section's requirements, but granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on the ground that  630 was an unconstitutional interference with the President's authority to protect the national security.  While the court's judgment was pending review in this Court, the District Court ruled on the constitutional challenge in the cases consolidated with appellants' suit.  It concluded that the term ""classifiable"" is unconstitutionally vague, but that the DISOO's definition would remedy the vagueness.  It also ordered appellees to notify employees either that this definition was in force or that no penalties would be imposed for the disclosure of ""classifiable"" information.  Thereafter, appellees deleted the word ""classifiable"" from the forms, replacing it with th154
DISOO's definition, and gave individualized notice of this change to current employees.
Held:
1. The controversy is moot as to current employees who have been notified that the term ""classifiable"" no longer controls their disclosure of information.  P.  490 U. S. 159.
2. The case is remanded to the District Court for it to address in the first instance:  (1) with respect to appellants' request for individualized notice to former employees, whether individualized notice is required by  630 and whether appellants' complaint can be read to request such notice for former employees; (2) with respect to appellants' argument that the DISOO's definition of ""classified"" does not comply with  630, whether appellants should be allowed to amend their complaint to take into account this new definition; and (3) with respect to appellants' argument that the forms do not comply with the  630 provisions dealing with disclosure of classified information to Congress, whether this part of the case is ripe for decision, since no instance in which an employee has sought to disclose information to Congress and was prohibited from doing so has been brought to this Court's attention.  Pp.  490 U. S. 159-161.
3. On remand, the District Court should decide first whether the controversy is sufficiently live and concrete to be adjudicated and whether it is an appropriate case for equitable relief, and then decide whether the statute and forms are susceptible of a reconciling interpretation.  Only if they are not should the court turn to the constitutional question whether  630 impermissibly intruded upon the Executive Branch's authority over national security information.  Pp.  490 U.

 PUEBLO OF ACOMAv. PADILLA. No. 88-415. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 17, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Mexico. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 Respondent Frank Padilla, a roofing consultant, filed suit in New Mexico state court alleging a breach of contract by petitioner Pueblo of Acoma, doing business as Sky City Contractors. Petitioner had hired respondent to supervise Sky City's installation of roofs on two building projects located off the Acoma Indian Reservation. The New Mexico Supreme Court held that petitioner was not protected from suit by tribal sovereign immunity. 107 N.M. 174, 754 P.2d 845 (1988). According to the New Mexico court, a State's ""exercise of jurisdiction over a sovereign Indian tribe for off-reservation conduct is solely a matter of comity."" Id., at 179, 754 P.2d, at 850 (citing Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 59 L. Ed.2d 416 (1979)). Because the State of New Mexico allows breach of contract actions to be rought against itself, the court reasoned, such actions were allowable against Indian tribes as well. 
 This decision conflicts with decisions of the Arizona courts applying tribal sovereign immunity to off-reservation activities. In Morgan v. Colorado River Indian Tribe, 103 Ariz. 425, 427-428, 443 P.2d 421, 423-424 ( 1968), the Arizona Supreme Court held that the Colorado River Indian Tribe was immune from suit for an accident at the Blue Water Marina Park, a tribal enterprise located outside the boundaries of its reservation. The court did not treat the question as one of comity; indeed, the court noted that under identical circumstances the State of Arizona would be liable. Id., at 428, n. 1, 443 P.2d, at 424, n. 1. See also S. Unique, Ltd. v. Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, 138 Ariz. 378, 380-381, 674 P.2d 1376, 1378-1379 (App.1983) 
Page 490 U.S. 1029 , 1030
 (breach of contract action arising out of business transaction initiated off reservation). The doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, as applied by the Arizona courts, extends not only to an Indian tribe but also to a "" subordinate economic organization"" of the tribe. White Mountain Apache Indian Tribe v. Shelley, 107 Ariz. 4, 6-7, 480 P.2d 654, 656-657 (1971); Smith Plumbing Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 149 Ariz. 524, 532, 720 P.2d 499, 507, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 987 ( 1986). The New Mexico Supreme Court expressly recognized that Sky City Contractors was a subordinate economic organization of petitioner, 107 N.M ., at 178, 754 P.2d, at 849 (citing White Mountain Apache, supra ), yet nevertheless held that it was not immune from suit. 
 An opportunity to resolve this conflict was presented by our grant of certiorari in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 488 U.S. 816 (1988), although we ultimately decided the case on other grounds. In that case, two questions were before us: whether the case had been properly removed to federal court and whether tribal sovereign immunity barred an action to collect taxes ""on commercial activities conducted by an Indian tribe on off-reservation lands."" We held that the case had not been properly removed, Okl. Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 489 U.S. 838 (1989) (per curiam), and as a result did not need to reach the sovereign immunity question. The present case provides an opportunity to resolve the issue we did not reach in Graham and thereby to resolve the conflict among the state courts. 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari and resolve the question on which we previously granted certiorari but did not decide. 
 Justice KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.

 Respondent Frank Padilla, a roofing consultant, filed suit in New Mexico state court alleging a breach of contract by petitioner Pueblo of Acoma, doing business as Sky City Contractors. Petitioner had hired respondent to supervise Sky City's installation of roofs on two building projects located off the Acoma Indian Reservation. The New Mexico Supreme Court held that petitioner was not protected from suit by tribal sovereign immunity. 107 N.M. 174, 754 P.2d 845 (1988). According to the New Mexico court, a State's ""exercise of jurisdiction over a sovereign Indian tribe for off-reservation conduct is solely a matter of comity."" Id., at 179, 754 P.2d, at 850 (citing Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 59 L. Ed.2d 416 (1979)). Because the State of New Mexico allows breach of contract actions to be rought against itself, the court reasoned, such actions were allowable against Indian tribes as well. 
 This decision conflicts with decisions of the Arizona courts applying tribal sovereign immunity to off-reservation activities. In Morgan v. Colorado River Indian Tribe, 103 Ariz. 425, 427-428, 443 P.2d 421, 423-424 ( 1968), the Arizona Supreme Court held that the Colorado River Indian Tribe was immune from suit for an accident at the Blue Water Marina Park, a tribal enterprise located outside the boundaries of its reservation. The court did not treat the question as one of comity; indeed, the court noted that under identical circumstances the State of Arizona would be liable. Id., at 428, n. 1, 443 P.2d, at 424, n. 1. See also S. Unique, Ltd. v. Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, 138 Ariz. 378, 380-381, 674 P.2d 1376, 1378-1379 (App.1983) 
Page 490 U.S. 1029 , 1030
 (breach of contract action arising out of business transaction initiated off reservation). The doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, as applied by the Arizona courts, extends not only to an Indian tribe but also to a "" subordinate economic organization"" of the tribe. White Mountain Apache Indian Tribe v. Shelley, 107 Ariz. 4, 6-7, 480 P.2d 654, 656-657 (1971); Smith Plumbing Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 149 Ariz. 524, 532, 720 P.2d 499, 507, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 987 ( 1986). The New Mexico Supreme Court expressly recognized that Sky City Contractors was a subordinate economic organization of petitioner, 107 N.M ., at 178, 754 P.2d, at 849 (citing White Mountain Apache, supra ), yet nevertheless held that it was not immune from suit. 
 An opportunity to resolve this conflict was presented by our grant of certiorari in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 488 U.S. 816 (1988), although we ultimately decided the case on other grounds. In that case, two questions were before us: whether the case had been properly removed to federal court and whether tribal sovereign immunity barred an action to collect taxes ""on commercial activities conducted by an Indian tribe on off-reservation lands."" We held that the case had not been properly removed, Okl. Tax Comm'n v. Graham, 489 U.S. 838 (1989) (per curiam), and as a result did not need to reach the sovereign immunity question. The present case provides an opportunity to resolve the issue we did not reach in Graham and thereby to resolve the conflict among the state courts. 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari and resolve the question on which we previously granted certiorari but did not decide. 
 Justice KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.

Syllabus 
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents stopped respondent upon his arrival at Honolulu International Airport.  The agents found 1,063 grams of cocaine in his carry-on luggage.  When respondent was stopped, the agents knew, inter alia, that (1) he paid $2,100 for two round-trip plane tickets from a roll of $20 bills; (2) he traveled under a name that did not match the name under which his telephone number was listed; (3) his original destination was Miami, a source city for illicit drugs; (4) he stayed in Miami for only 48 hours, even though a round-trip flight from Honolulu to Miami takes 20 hours; (5) he appeared nervous during his trip; and (6) he checked none of his luggage.  Respondent was indicted for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.  The District Court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, finding that the stop was justified by a reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity, as required by the Fourth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed respondent's conviction, applying a two-part test for determining reasonable suspicion.  First, ruled the court, at least one fact describing ""ongoing criminal activity"" -- such as the use of an alias or evasive movement through an airport -- was always necessary to support a reasonable suspicion finding.  Second, ""probabilistic"" facts describing ""personal characteristics"" of drug couriers -- such as the cash payment for tickets, a short trip to a major source city for drugs, nervousness, type of attire, and unchecked luggage -- were only relevant if there was evidence of ""ongoing criminal activity"" and the Government 
Page 490 U. S. 2
 offered ""[e]mpirical documentation"" that the combination of facts at issue did not describe the behavior of ""significant numbers of innocent persons.""  The Court of Appeals held the agents' stop impermissible, because there was no evidence of ongoing criminal behavior in this case.
Held:  On the facts of this case, the DEA agents had a reasonable suspicion that respondent was transporting illegal drugs when they stopped him.  Pp.  490 U. S. 7-11.
(a) Under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1,  392 U. S. 30, the police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if they have a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity ""may be afoot,"" even if they lack probable cause under the Fourth Amendment.  Reasonable suspicion entails some minimal level of objective justification for making a stop -- that is, something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ""hunch,"" but less than the level of suspicion required for probable cause.  P.  490 U. S. 7.
(b) The Court of Appeals' two-part test creates unnecessary difficulty in dealing with one of the relatively simple concepts embodied in the Fourth Amendment.  Under this Court's decisions, the totality of the circumstances must be evaluated to determine the probability, rather than the certainty, of criminal conduct.  United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411,  449 U. S. 417.  The Court of Appeals' test draws an unnecessarily sharp line between types of evidence, the probative value of which varies only in degree.  While traveling under an alias or taking an evasive path through an airport may be highly probative, neither type of evidence has the sort of ironclad significance attributed to it by the Court of Appeals, because there are instances in which neither factor would reflect ongoing criminal activity.  On the other hand, the test's ""probabilistic"" factors also have probative significance.  Paying $2,100 in cash for airline tickets from a roll of $20 bills containing nearly twice that amount is not ordinary conduct for most business travelers or vacationers.  The evidence that respondent was traveling under an alias, although not conclusive, was sufficient to warrant consideration.  Of similar effect is the probability that few Honolulu residents travel for 20 hours to spend 48 hours in Miami during July.  Thus, although each of these factors is not, by itself, proof of illegal conduct, and is quite consistent with innocent travel, taken together, they amount to reasonable suspicion that criminal conduct was afoot.  Pp.  490 U. S. 7-10.
(c) The fact that the agents believed that respondent's behavior was consistent with one of the DEA's ""drug courier profiles"" does not alter this analysis, because the factors in question have evidentiary significance regardless of whether they are set forth in a ""profile.""  P.  490 U. S. 10.
(d) The reasonableness of the decision to stop does not, as respondent contends, turn upon whether the police used the least intrusive means

 available to verify or dispel their suspicions.  Such a rule would unduly hamper the officers' ability to make on-the-spot decisions -- here, respondent was about to enter a taxicab -- and would require courts to indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.

Syllabus 
For the express purpose of providing a place where teenagers can socialize with each other but not be subject to the potentially detrimental influences of older teenagers and adults, a Dallas ordinance authorizes the licensing of ""Class E"" dancehalls, restricting admission thereto to persons between the ages of 14 and 18 and limiting their hours of operation.  Respondent, whose rollerskating rink and Class E dancehall share a divided floor space, filed suit in state court to enjoin the ordinance's age and hour restrictions, contending, inter alia, that they violated the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The trial court upheld the ordinance, but the Texas Court of Appeals struck down the ordinance's age restriction, holding that it violated the First Amendment associational rights of minors.
Held:
1. The ordinance does not infringe on the First Amendment right of association.  Respondent's patrons, who may number as many as 1,000 per night, are not engaged in a form of ""intimate association.""  Nor do the opportunities of adults and minors to dance with one another, which might be described as ""associational"" in common parlance, involve the sort of ""expressive association"" that the First Amendment has been held to protect.  The teenagers who congregate are not members of any organized association, and most are strangers to one another.  The dancehall admits all who pay the admission fee, and there is no suggestion that the patrons take positions on public questions or perform other similar activities.  Moreover, the Constitution does not recognize a generalized right of ""social association"" that includes chance encounters in dancehalls.  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,  381 U. S. 483, distinguished.  Pp.  490 U. S. 23-25.
2. The ordinance does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there is a rational relationship between the age restriction for Class E dancehalls and the city's interest in promoting the welfare of teenagers.  Respondent's claims -- that the ordinance does not meet the city's objectives because adults and teenagers can still associate with one another in places such as his skating rink and that there are other, less intrusive, alternatives to achieve the objectives -- misapprehend the nature of 
Page 490 U. S. 20
 rational basis scrutiny, the most relaxed and tolerant form of judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  Under this standard, a classification that has some reasonable basis does not offend the Constitution because it is imperfect.  Here, the city could reasonably conclude that teenagers might be more susceptible to corrupting influences if permitted to frequent dancehalls with older persons or that limiting dance-hall contacts between adults and teenagers would make less likely illicit or undesirable juvenile involvement with alcohol, illegal drugs, or promiscuous sex.  While the city permits teenagers and adults to rollerskate together, skating involves less physical contact than dancing, a differentiation that need not be striking to survive rational-basis scrutiny.

490 U.S. 30

Syllabus 
On the basis of extensive evidence indicating that large numbers of Indian children were being separated from their families and tribes and were being placed in non-Indian homes through state adoption, foster care, and parental rights termination proceedings, and that this practice caused serious problems for the children, their parents, and their tribes, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which, inter alia, gives tribal courts exclusive jurisdiction over custody proceedings involving an Indian child ""who resides or is domiciled within"" a tribe's reservation.  This case involves the status of twin illegitimate babies, whose parents were enrolled members of appellant Tribe and residents and domiciliaries of its reservation in Neshoba County, Mississippi.  After the twins' births in Harrison County, some 200 miles from the reservation, and their parents' execution of consent-to-adoption forms, they were adopted in that county's Chancery Court by the appellees Holyfield, who were non-Indian.  That court subsequently overruled appellant's motion to vacate the adoption decree, which was based on the assertion that, under the ICWA exclusive jurisdiction was vested in appellant's tribal court.  The Supreme Court of Mississippi affirmed, holding, among other things, that the twins were not ""domiciled"" on the reservation under state law, in light of the Chancery Court's findings (1) that they had never been physically present there, and (2) that they were ""voluntarily surrendered"" by their parents, who went to some efforts to see that they were born outside the reservation and promptly arranged for their adoption.  Therefore, the court said, the twins' domicile was in Harrison County, and the Chancery Court properly exercised jurisdiction over the adoption proceedings.
Held:  The twins were ""domiciled"" on the Tribe's reservation within the meaning of the ICWA's exclusive tribal jurisdiction provision, and the Chancery Court was, accordingly, without jurisdiction to enter the adoption decree.  Pp.  490 U. S. 42-54.
(a) Although the ICWA does not define ""domicile,"" Congress clearly intended a uniform federal law of domicile for the ICWA, and did not consider the definition of the word to be a matter of state law.  The ICWA's purpose was, in part, to make clear that, in certain situations, the state courts did not have jurisdiction over child custody proceedings.  In fact, 
Page 490 U. S. 31
 the statutory congressional findings demonstrate that Congress perceived the States and their courts as partly responsible for the child separation problem it intended to correct.  Thus, it is most improbable that Congress would have intended to make the scope of the statute's key jurisdictional provision subject to definition by state courts as a matter of state law.  Moreover, Congress could hardly have intended the lack of nationwide uniformity that would result from state law definitions of ""domicile,"" whereby different rules could apply from time to time to the same Indian child simply as a result of his or her being moved across state lines.  Pp.  490 U. S. 43-47.
(b) The generally accepted meaning of the term ""domicile"" applies under the ICWA to the extent it is not inconsistent with the objectives of the statute.  In the absence of a statutory definition, it is generally assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used, in light of the statute's object and policy.  Well settled common law principles provide that the domicile of minors, who generally are legally incapable of forming the requisite intent to establish a domicile, is determined by that of their parents, which has traditionally meant the domicile of the mother in the case of illegitimate children.  Thus, since the domicile of the twins' mother (as well as their father) has been, at all relevant times, on appellant's reservation, the twins were also domiciled there even though they have never been there.  This result is not altered by the fact that they were ""voluntarily surrendered"" for adoption.  Congress enacted the ICWA because of concerns going beyond the wishes of individual parents, finding that the removal of Indian children from their cultural setting seriously impacts on long-term tribal survival, and has a damaging social and psychological impact on many individual Indian children.  These concerns demonstrate that Congress could not have intended to enact a rule of domicile that would permit individual Indian parents to defeat the ICWA's jurisdictional scheme simply by giving birth and placing the child for adoption off the reservation.

No. 87-453
Argued November 29, 1988

Syllabus 
Appellant oil companies do business in New Jersey and are subject to that State's Corporation Business Tax.  They are also subject to the federal windfall profit tax on their crude-oil production, which does not occur in New Jersey.  They each sought a deduction for the federal tax in calculating ""entire net income"" on their 1980 and 1981 state tax returns, but appellee, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, assessed deficiencies on the ground that the ""add-back"" provision of the state tax statute prohibited corporations from deducting a federal tax that is ""on or measured by profits or income.""  The State Tax Court affirmed the assessments, but the Appellate Division of the State Superior Court reversed.  The State Supreme Court in turn reversed and reinstated the Tax Court's judgment, holding that the windfall profit tax is measured by ""profits or income"" for the purposes of the add-back provision and that, as so construed, that provision did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
Held:
1. The New Jersey tax satisfies all four elements of the test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, and therefore passes Commerce Clause scrutiny even though the add-back provision denies appellants deductions for windfall profit tax payments.  Pp.  490 U. S. 72-79.
(a) New Jersey has a ""substantial nexus"" with the activities that generate appellants' ""entire net income,"" including oil production occurring entirely outside the State, since each appellant's New Jersey operations are part of an integrated ""unitary business"" that includes crude-oil production.  P.  490 U. S. 73.
(b) The tax is fairly apportioned, since the part of the ""entire net income"" to be taxed is determined according to the standard three-factor apportionment formula that this Court has expressly approved.  See, e.g.,  463 U. S.  of America v. Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. 
Page 490 U. S. 67
 159,  463 U. S. 170.  The use of the formula as applied to appellants is not invalid on the ground that the windfall profit tax is an exclusively out-of-state expense, since the costs of a unitary business cannot be deemed confined to the locality in which they are incurred.  Pp.  490 U. S. 73-75.
(c) The tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  The add-back provision is not facially discriminatory, since there is no explicit discriminatory design to the tax.  Nor does the provision apply exclusively to a localized industry, since it generally excludes any federal tax ""on or measured by income or profits,"" including the nationwide federal income tax.  Moreover, appellants concede that no discriminatory motive underlies the provision, which cannot be held to exert pressure on an interstate business to conduct more of its activities in New Jersey.  Pp.  490 U. S. 75-79.
(d) The tax is ""fairly related"" to the benefits the State provides appellants, including police and fire protection, a trained workforce, and the advantages of a civilized society.  P.  490 U. S. 79.

No. 87-1865
Argued February 27, 1989
Decided April 3, 1989
490 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. (FSLIC), in its capacity as receiver of a state-chartered savings and loan association, brought an action in the Federal District Court against former directors of the association for breach of their fiduciary duties under Illinois law.  The District Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1345, which specifies that, except as ""otherwise provided"" by federal law, district courts have jurisdiction of all civil actions ""commenced by"" a federal agency ""expressly authorized to sue"" by Act of Congress.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a proviso in 12 U.S.C.  1730(k)(1) withdraws federal jurisdiction in cases in which the FSLIC ""is a party in its capacity as . . . receiver . . . of an insured State-chartered institution"" if the suit ""involves only the rights or obligations of investors, creditors, stockholders, and such institution under State law.""
Held:  The District Court has jurisdiction over the FSLIC's action.  Pp.  490 U. S. 84-87.
(a) In view of the fact that this case was ""commenced by"" a federal agency ""expressly authorized to sue"" under 12 U.S.C.  1725(c),  1345 supports the District Court's jurisdiction unless  1730(k)(1) ""otherwise provide[s].""  Pp.  490 U. S. 84-85.
(b) A limitation on  1345's jurisdictional grant is not ""otherwise provided"" by  1730(k)(1), the proviso of which declares that FSLIC receivership cases involving specified parties and state law rights ""shall not be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.""  The proviso does not apply to clause (A) of  1730(k)(1) -- which states that the FSLIC ""shall be deemed to be an agency of the United States"" and thereby confirms that  1345's party-based jurisdiction is applicable in cases brought by the FSLIC -- since that clause does not rely on the presence of a federal question as a jurisdictional prerequisite.  Rather, the proviso imposes a limit on the grant of federal question jurisdiction set forth in clauses (B) and (C) of  1730(k)(1), which declare respectively that any civil suit in which the FSLIC is a party ""shall be deemed to arise under 
Page 490 U. S. 83

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California. 
 The petition for writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.

 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L.

 even if I did not hold this view, I would still grant the petition. The record in this case strongly suggests that, in the words of the dissenting judge below, ""certain remarks by the court during the penalty phase, superimposed upon an emotional episode that had already occurred in the jury room, had an improperly coercive effect upon the jury's deliberations and improperly influenced the verdict."" 46 Cal.3d 478, 545, 250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 594, 758 P.2d 1081, 1124 (1988) (Kaufman, J., dissenting in part). I would therefore grant certiorari, both to ascertain whether petitioner was denied his right to an uncoerced verdict, and to clarify our standards for determining jury coercion, a subject discussed most recently in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231 (1988). 
 The penalty phase in question was described at length in the majority and partially dissenting opinions below, 46 Cal.3d, at 527-544, 250 Cal.

During jury deliberations, only one juror held out: an elderly woman who refused to vote to impose the death penalty. After a day of deliberations, another juror rose out of his chair and verbally attacked her in a tirade that apparently included a death threat. Id., at 545, 250 Cal.Rptr., at 594, 758 P.2d, at 1125. Crying and shaking, she left the jury room a d went to a bathroom, where she vomited. In response, the foreman sent the judge notes indicating that there was one holdout against imposing the death penalty. Ibid.

No. 87-1945
Argued March 1, 1989
Decided March 29, 1989
489 U.S. 829

Syllabus 
Appellant, who refused a temporary retail position because the job would have required him to work on Sunday in violation of his personal religious beliefs, applied for, and was denied, unemployment compensation benefits.  The denial was affirmed by an administrative review board, an Illinois Circuit Court, and the State Appellate Court, which found that, since appellant was not a member of an established religious sect or church and did not claim that his refusal to work resulted from a tenet, belief, or teaching of an established religious body, his personal professed religious belief, although unquestionably sincere, was not good cause for his refusal to work on Sunday.
Held:  The denial of unemployment compensation benefits to appellant on the ground that his refusal to work was not based on tenets or dogma of an established religious sect violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, and Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Florida, 480 U. S. 136, rested on the fact that each of the claimants had a sincere belief that religion required him or her to refrain from the work in question, not on the consideration that each of them was a member of a particular religious sect or on any tenet of the sect forbidding such work.  While membership in a sect would simplify the problem of identifying sincerely held beliefs, the notion that one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization to claim the protection of the Free Exercise Clause is rejected.  The sincerity or religious nature of appellant's belief was not questioned by the courts below, and was conceded by the State, which offered no justification for the burden that the denial of benefits placed on appellant's right to exercise his religion.  The fact that Sunday work has become a way of life does not constitute a state interest sufficiently compelling to override a legitimate free-exercise claim, since there is no evidence that there will be a mass movement away from Sunday employment if appellant succeeds on his claim.

No. 88-266
Argued February 21, 1989
Decided March 29, 1989
489 U.S. 838

Syllabus 
Respondent Chickasaw Nation owns and operates a motor inn in Oklahoma at which it conducts bingo games and sells cigarettes.  After the State filed a state court suit against the Tribe and respondent inn manager to collect unpaid state taxes on these activities, the Tribe, asserting federal question jurisdiction, removed the action to the Federal District Court.  The State's motion to remand the case on the ground that the complaint alleged only state statutory violations and state tax liabilities was denied by the District Court, which held that the complaint implicated the federal question of tribal immunity, since it sought to apply state law to an Indian Tribe.  Thereafter, the court dismissed the suit, finding it barred by tribal sovereign immunity.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, noting that, as a prerequisite to stating jurisdiction over an Indian tribe, an alleged waiver or consent to suit is a necessary element of a well-pleaded complaint.  The court adhered to that disposition on remand from this Court, finding that the rule of Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S. 386 -- that to support federal court removability, a complaint on its face must present a federal question -- did not apply to the State's complaint.  The court found that, although nothing within the complaint's literal language suggested the implication of a federal question, such a question was inherent within the complaint because of the parties subject to the action.
Held:  This case was improperly removed from the Oklahoma courts.  The Court of Appeals' decision is plainly inconsistent with Caterpillar.  The possible existence of a federal tribal immunity defense to the State's claims did not convert a suit otherwise arising under state law into one which, in the statutory sense, arises under federal law.  And there was no independent basis for original federal jurisdiction to support removal.  This jurisdictional question is not affected by the fact that tribal immunity is governed by federal law, since Congress has expressly provided by statute for removal when it desired federal courts to adjudicate defenses based on federal immunities.

No. 87-1759
Argued March 1, 1989
Decided March 28, 1989
489 U.S. 782

Syllabus 
Petitioners, state and local teachers' associations and several of their members and employees, brought suit in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that respondent school district's policy of prohibiting communications by or with teachers during the schoolday concerning employee organizations violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights in various particular respects.  The District Court granted the school district summary judgment on most of petitioners' claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, granting petitioners summary judgment on their claims that the school district's actions in prohibiting teacher-to-teacher discussion of employee organizations during the schoolday and teacher use of internal mail and billboard facilities to discuss such organizations were unconstitutional.  After this Court summarily affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment, petitioners filed the instant application for an award of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988.  The District Court held that petitioners were not ""prevailing parties"" within the meaning of  1988, and thus were ineligible for any fee award, since, under Fifth Circuit precedent, the test for prevailing party status was whether the plaintiff prevailed on the central issue in the litigation by acquiring the primary relief sought.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that, although petitioners had achieved success on ""significant secondary issues,"" they had not prevailed on the central issue in the lawsuit -- the constitutionality of the school district's policy of limiting employee organizations' access to teachers and school facilities during school hours.
Held:
1. The lower courts' ""central issue"" test for determining ""prevailing party"" status under  1988 is rejected in favor of a standard requiring only that parties ""succeed on any significant issue in the litigation which achieves some of the benefit [they] sought in bringing the suit.'""  Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-279, quoted in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424,  461 U. S. 433. Pp.  489 U. S. 788-793.
(a) The ""central issue"" test is directly contrary to the thrust of Hensley, supra, which, although it did not adopt one particular standard 
Page 489 U. S. 783
 for determining prevailing party status, nevertheless indicated that the degree of the plaintiff's success in relation to the lawsuit's overall goals is a factor critical to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.  The ""central issue"" test is also incongruous in light of the clear congressional intent, as expressed in  1988's legislative history, that interim fee awards be available to partially prevailing civil rights plaintiffs.  Congress cannot have meant ""prevailing party"" status to depend entirely on the timing of a fee request:  a prevailing party must be one who has succeeded on any significant claim affording it some of the relief sought, either pendente lite or at the conclusion of the litigation.  Furthermore, the search for the ""central"" and ""tangential"" issues in the lawsuit, or for the ""primary"" as opposed to the ""secondary"" relief sought, forces district courts to focus on the subjective intent of the parties, which is almost impossible to determine; is irrelevant to  1988's prime purposes and essentially unhelpful in defining the term ""prevailing party""; and is sure to provoke prolonged litigation of fee disputes.  Pp.  489 U. S. 788-791.
(b) A plaintiff has crossed the threshold to a fee award of some kind if he or she satisfies the Nadeau ""significant issue"" -- ""some benefit"" standard.  Under that standard, at a minimum, the plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which materially alters the parties' legal relationship in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.  Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755,  482 U. S. 760.  Where the plaintiff's success on a legal claim can be characterized as purely technical or de minimis, a district court would be justified in concluding that it is so insignificant as to be insufficient to support prevailing party status.  However, where the parties' relationship has been materially changed, the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness of the award under Hensley, supra, not to the availability of the fee award vel non.  Pp.  489 U. S. 791-793.
2. Petitioners are ""prevailing parties"" within the meaning of  1988.  They have prevailed on a significant issue in the litigation, in that their success has materially altered the school district's policy limiting the rights of teachers to communicate with each other concerning employee organizations and union activities.  Moreover, they have obtained some of the relief they sought, a judgment vindicating the rights of public employees in the workplace.

Syllabus 
Petitioners moved to dismiss a federal indictment against them on the ground, inter alia, that the prosecution had violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2) -- which generally prohibits public disclosure by Government attorneys of ""matters occurring before the grand jury"" -- by filing, in a separate criminal case, a memorandum disclosing matters before the grand jury in this case.  After the District Court denied the motion, the Court of Appeals granted the Government's motion to dismiss petitioners' appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the District Court's order was not an immediately appealable ""final decision"" under 28 U.S.C.  1291.  The court rejected petitioners' contention that United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.

Held:  A district court order denying a defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment for an alleged violation of Rule 6(e) is not immediately appealable under  1291.

Argued January 9, 1989
Decided March 28, 1989
489 U.S. 803

Syllabus 
In each of the years 1979 through 1984, appellant, a Michigan resident and former federal employee, paid state income tax on his federal retirement benefits in accordance with the Michigan Income Tax Act, which exempts from taxation all retirement benefits paid by the State or its political subdivisions, but taxes retirement benefits paid by other employers, including the Federal Government.  After the State denied appellant's request for refunds, he filed suit in the Michigan Court of Claims, alleging that the State's inconsistent treatment of retirement benefits violated 4 U.S.C.  111, which authorizes States to tax
""pay or compensation for personal services as [a federal] officer or employee . . . if the taxation does not discriminate against the . . . employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.""
The Court of Claims denied relief, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that appellant is an ""annuitant"" under federal law, rather than an ""employee"" within the meaning of  111, and that that section therefore has no application to him.  The Court of Appeals also held that the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity did not render the State's discriminatory tax scheme unconstitutional, since the discrimination was justified under a rational basis test:  the State's interest in attracting and retaining qualified employees was a legitimate objective which was rationally achieved by a retirement plan offering economic inducements.
Held:
1. Section 111 applies to federal retirees such as appellant.  The State's contention that the section is limited to current federal employees is refuted by the plain language of the statute's first clause.  Since the amount of civil service retirement benefits is based and computed upon an individual's salary and years of service, it represents deferred compensation for service to the Government, and therefore constitutes ""pay or compensation . . . as [a federal] employee"" within the meaning of that clause.  The State's contention that, since this quoted language does not occur in the statute's second, nondiscrimination clause, that clause applies only to current employees, is hypertechnical, and fails to read the nondiscrimination clause in its context within the overall statutory scheme.  The reference to ""the pay or compensation"" in the latter clause must, in context, mean the same ""pay or compensation"" defined in 
Page 489 U. S. 804
 the section's first clause, and thus includes retirement benefits.  The State's reading of the clause is implausible because it is unlikely that Congress consented to discriminatory taxation of retired federal civil servants' pensions while refusing to permit such taxation of current employees, and there is nothing in the statutory language or legislative history to suggest such a result.  Pp.  489 U. S. 808-810.
2. Section 111's language, purpose, and legislative history establish that the scope of its nondiscrimination clause's grant or retention of limited tax immunity for federal employees is coextensive with, and must be determined by reference to, the prohibition against discriminatory taxes embodied in the modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.  Pp.  489 U. S. 810-814
3. Michigan's tax scheme violates principles of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local government employees over retired federal employees.  Pp.  489 U. S. 814-817.
(a) The State's contention that appellant is not entitled to claim the protection of the immunity doctrine is without merit.  Although the doctrine is based on the need to protect each sovereign's governmental operations from undue interference by another sovereign, this Court's precedents establish that private entities or individuals who are subjected to discriminatory taxation on account of their dealings with a sovereign can themselves receive the protection of the constitutional doctrine.  See, for example, Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U. S. 376,  361 U. S. 387.  Pp.  489 U. S. 814-815.
(b) In determining whether the State's inconsistent tax treatment of federal and state retirees is permissible, the relevant inquiry is whether the inconsistency is directly related to, and justified by, ""significant differences between the two classes.""  Phillips, supra, at  361 U. S. 384-385.  The State's claimed interest in hiring qualified civil servants through the inducement of a tax exemption for retirement benefits is irrelevant to this inquiry, since it merely demonstrates that the State has a rational reason for discriminating between two similar groups of retirees without demonstrating any differences between those groups themselves.  Moreover, the State's claim that its retirement benefits are significantly less munificent than federal benefits in terms of vesting requirements, rate of accrual, and benefit computations is insufficient to justify the type of blanket exemption at issue here.  A tax exemption truly intended to account for differences in benefits would not discriminate on the basis of the source of those benefits, but would, rather, discriminate on the basis of the amount of benefits received by individual retirees.  Pp.  489 U. S. 815-817.
4. Because the State concedes that a refund is appropriate in these circumstances, appellant is entitled to a refund to the extent he has paid 
Page 489 U. S. 805
 taxes pursuant to the invalid Michigan scheme.  However, his additional claim for prospective relief from discriminatory taxation should be decided by the state courts, whose special expertise in state law puts them in a better position than this Court to fashion the remedy most appropriate to comply with the constitutional mandate of equal treatment.

Syllabus 
New York City's Board of Estimate consists of the mayor and two other members elected citywide, each of whom casts two votes, plus the elected presidents of the city's five boroughs, each of whom casts one vote.  Appellees, residents and voters of Brooklyn, the most populous borough, charging that the city charter's sections governing the board's composition are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, brought suit in the District Court, which concluded that the board was a nonelective, nonlegislative body not subject to the rule established by Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, and other reapportionment cases.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the board's selection process must comply with the reapportionment cases' so-called ""one-person, one-vote"" requirement, since its members ultimately are chosen by popular vote.  On remand, the District Court determined that applying the Abate v. Mundt, 403 U. S. 182, population per representative methodology to the disparate borough populations produced a total deviation of 132.9% from voter equality among the electorates, and that the city's explanations for this range neither required nor justified such a gross deviation.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, that the presence of citywide representatives did not warrant departure from the Abate methodology, and, thus, that the District Court's finding of a 132.9% deviation was correct.
Held:  The Board of Estimate's structure is inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, although the boroughs have widely disparate populations, each has equal representation on the board.  Pp.  489 U. S. 692-703.
(a) Board membership elections are local elections subject to review under the prevailing reapportionment doctrine.  The board, composed of officials who become members as a matter of law upon their elections, has a significant range of fiscal and legislative functions common to municipal governments, including assisting in the formulation of the 
Page 489 U. S. 689
 city's budget and controlling land use, contract, and franchise powers.  That the citywide members enjoy a 6-to-5 voting majority does not render the board's composition constitutional, since the borough presidents control the outcome of board decisions anytime the citywide members do not vote together, and always control budgetary decisions, because the mayor has no vote on such matters.  Moreover, the Reynolds-Abate approach should not be put aside in favor of the theoretical Banzhaf Index -- which produces a standard deviation of 30.8% for nonbudget matters and a larger figure for budget items by mathematically calculating a voter's power to determine the outcome of an election -- since the latter approach tends to ignore partisanship, race, voting habits, and other characteristics having an impact on general election outcomes.  Pp.  489 U. S. 692-699.
(b) The presence of citywide members is a major component to be factored into the process of determining the deviation between more or less populous boroughs.  This approach -- which yields a standard deviation of 78% -- recognizes that voters in each borough vote for, and are represented by, both their borough president and the citywide members, thus departing from the lower courts' approach which treated the five boroughs as single-member districts, each with a representative having a single vote.  Pp.  489 U. S. 699-701.
(c) The city's proffered governmental interests -- that the board is essential to the successful government of New York City, is effective, and accommodates natural and political boundaries as well as local interests -- do not suffice to justify a 78% deviation from the one-person, one-vote ideal, particularly because the city could be served by alternative ways of constituting the board that would minimize the discrimination in voting power.

Syllabus 
Petitioner used-car distributor was charged with multiple counts of mail fraud.  The indictment alleged that he purchased used cars, rolled back their odometers, and sold them to Wisconsin retail dealers at prices artificially inflated by the low-mileage readings, and that the unwitting dealers, relying on the altered readings, resold the cars to customers at inflated prices, consummating the transactions by mailing title-application forms to the State on behalf of the buyers.  Petitioner filed a pretrial motion to dismiss on the ground that the latter mailings were not in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme and, thus, did not satisfy the mailing element of the crime of mail fraud.  He also moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(c) for a lesser included offense jury instruction on the crime of tampering with an odometer.  The District Court denied both motions, and, after trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.  A Court of Appeals panel initially ruled that, although the mailings satisfied the mailing element of the crime, the requested jury instruction should have been given under the ""inherent relationship"" test, which considers one offense to be included in another when the facts as alleged and proved support the inference that the defendant committed the less serious crime, and when an ""inherent relationship"" exists between the two offenses such that both relate to the protection of the same interests and the proof of the greater offense can generally be expected to require proof of the lesser one.  However, the Court of Appeals en banc rejected the ""inherent relationship"" test in favor of the ""elements"" test, whereby one offense is necessarily included within another only when the elements of the lesser offense form a subset of the elements of the offense charged.  Finding that the elements of odometer tampering are not a subset of the elements of mail fraud, the en banc court affirmed petitioner's conviction.
Held:
1. The mailings at issue satisfy the mailing element of the crime of mail fraud.  Such mailings need not, as petitioner contends, be an essential element of the scheme to defraud, but are sufficient so long as they are incident to an essential part of the scheme.  Here, although the mailings may not have contributed directly to the duping of either the retail dealers or the customers, they were necessary to the successful 
Page 489 U. S. 706
 passage of title to the cars, which in turn was essential to the perpetuation of the scheme to defraud, since a failure in the passage of title would have jeopardized petitioner's relationship of trust and goodwill with the dealers upon whose unwitting cooperation the scheme depended.  Kann v. United States, 323 U. S. 88; Parr v. United States, 363 U. S. 370; and United States v. Maze, 414 U. S. 395, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 710-715.
2. The elements test must be utilized in determining when a lesser included offense instruction is appropriate under Rule 31(c).  Pp.  489 U. S. 715-721.
(a) The Rule's language -- which provides in relevant part that ""[t]he defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged"" -- supports the application of the elements approach.  That language suggests that a comparison must be drawn between offenses -- and therefore between the statutory elements of the offenses in question -- whereas the inherent relationship approach mandates that the determination be made by reference to conduct proved at trial regardless of the statutory definitions of offenses.  Furthermore, while the elements test is true to the Rule's requirement that the lesser offense be included in the greater, the inherent relationship approach dispenses with that requirement by permitting an instruction even if the proof of one offense does not invariably require proof of the other, as long as the two offenses serve the same legislative goals.  Moreover, although the Rule implicitly suggests that an instruction is equally available to the prosecution and the defense, the inherent relationship approach -- which delays the determination whether the offenses are sufficiently related until all the evidence is developed -- renders such mutuality impossible.  Pp.  489 U. S. 716-718.
(b) The elements approach is grounded in the Rule's history, which demonstrates that that approach was settled doctrine at the time of the Rule's promulgation and thereafter, and that the Rule incorporated this established practice by restating the preexisting law.  Pp.  489 U. S. 718-720.
(c) Since the elements test involves an objective, textual comparison of criminal statutes and does not depend on inferences that may be drawn on evidence introduced at trial, it is far more certain and predictable in its application than the inherent relationship approach.  Pp.  489 U. S. 720-721.
3. Petitioner was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction.  The offense of odometer tampering includes the element of knowingly and willfully causing an odometer to be altered, which is not a subset of any element of mail fraud.  Pp.  489 U. S. 721-722.

489 U.S. 726

Syllabus 
Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, gain resulting from the sale or exchange of property is generally treated as capital gain.  Although the Code imposes no current tax on certain stock-for-stock exchanges,  356(a)(1) provides that, if such an exchange pursuant to a corporate reorganization plan is accompanied by a cash payment or other property -- commonly referred to as ""boot"" -- any gain which the recipient realizes from the exchange is treated in the current tax year as capital gain up to the value of the boot.  However,  356(a)(2) creates an exception, specifying that, if the ""exchange . . . has the effect of the distribution of a dividend,"" the boot must be treated as a dividend, and is therefore appropriately taxed as ordinary income to the extent that gain is realized.  In 1979, respondent husband (hereinafter the taxpayer), the sole shareholder of Basin Surveys, Inc. (Basin), entered into a ""triangular merger"" agreement with NL Industries, Inc. (NL), whereby he transferred all of Basin's outstanding shares to NL's wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for 300,000 NL shares -- representing approximately 0.92% of NL's outstanding common stock -- and substantial cash boot.  On their 1979 joint federal income tax return, respondents reported the boot as capital gain pursuant to  356(a)(1).  Although agreeing that the merger at issue qualified as a reorganization for purposes of that section, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency against respondents, ruling that the boot payment had ""the effect of the distribution of a dividend"" under  356(a)(2).  On review, the Tax Court held in respondents' favor, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Both courts rejected the test proposed by the Commissioner for determining whether a boot payment has the requisite  356(a)(2) effect, whereby the payment would be treated as though it were made in a hypothetical redemption by the acquired corporation (Basin) immediately prior to the reorganization.  Rather, both courts accepted and applied the post-reorganization test urged by the taxpayer, which requires that a pure stock-for-stock exchange be imagined, followed immediately by a redemption of a portion of the taxpayer's shares in the acquiring corporation (NL) in return for a payment in an amount equal to the boot.  The courts ruled that NL's 
Page 489 U. S. 727
 redemption of 125,000 of its shares from the taxpayer in exchange for the boot was subject to capital gains treatment under  302 of the Code, which defines the tax treatment of a redemption of stock by a corporation from its shareholders.
Held:  Section 356(a)'s language and history, as well as a common sense understanding of the economic substance of the transaction at issue, establish that NL's boot payment to the taxpayer is subject to capital gains, rather than ordinary income, treatment.  Pp.  489 U. S. 737-745.
(a) The language of  356(a) strongly supports the view that the question whether an ""exchange . . . has the effect of the distribution of a dividend"" should be answered by examining the effect of the exchange as a whole.  By referring to the ""exchange,"" both  356(a)(2) and  356(a)(1) plainly contemplate one integrated transaction, and make clear that the character of the exchange as a whole, and not simply its component parts, must be examined.  Moreover, the fact that  356 expressly limits the extent to which boot may be taxed to the amount of gain realized in the reorganization suggests that Congress intended that boot not be treated in isolation from the overall reorganization.  Pp.  489 U. S. 737-738.
(b) Viewing the exchange in this case as an integrated whole, the pre-reorganization analogy is unacceptable, since it severs the payment of boot from the context of the reorganization, and since it adopts an overly expansive reading of  356(a)(2) that is contrary to this Court's standard approach of construing a statutory exception narrowly to preserve the primary operation of the general rule.  Pp.  489 U. S. 738-739.
(c) The post-reorganization approach is preferable, and is adopted, since it does a far better job of treating the payment of boot as a component of the overall exchange.  Under that approach, NL's hypothetical redemption easily satisfied  302(b)(2), which specifies that redemptions whereby the taxpayer relinquishes more than 20% of his corporate control, and thereafter retains less than 50% of the voting shares, shall not be treated as dividend distributions.  P.  489 U. S. 739-740.
(d) The Commissioner's objection to this ""recasting [of] the merger transaction,"" on the ground that it forces courts to find a redemption where none existed, overstates the extent to which the redemption is imagined.  Since a tax-free reorganization transaction is, in theory, merely a continuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise under modified corporate form, the boot-for-stock transaction can be viewed as a partial repurchase of stock by the continuing corporate enterprise -- i.e., as a redemption.  Although both the pre-reorganization and post-reorganization analogies ""recast the transaction,"" the latter view at least recognizes that a reorganization has taken place.  Pp.  489 U. S. 740-741. 
Page 489 U. S. 728

(e) Even if the post-reorganization analogy and the principles of  302 were abandoned in favor of a less artificial understanding of the transaction, the result would be the same.  The legislative history of  356(a)(2) suggests that Congress was primarily concerned with preventing corporations from evading tax by ""siphon[ing] off"" accumulated earnings and profits at a capital gains rate through the ruse of a reorganization.  This purpose, in turn, suggests that Congress did not intend to impose ordinary income tax on boot accompanying a transaction that involves a bona fide, arm's-length exchange between unrelated parties in the context of a reorganization.  In the instant transaction, there is no indication that the reorganization was used as a ruse.  Thus, the boot is better characterized as part of the proceeds of a sale of stock, subject to capital gains treatment, than as a proxy for a dividend.  Pp.  489 U. S. 741-745.
828 F.2d 221, affirmed.

(b) Viewing the exchange in this case as an integrated whole, the pre-reorganization analogy is unacceptable, since it severs the payment of boot from the context of the reorganization, and since it adopts an overly expansive reading of  356(a)(2) that is contrary to this Court's standard approach of construing a statutory exception narrowly to preserve the primary operation of the general rule.  Pp.  489 U. S. 738-739.
(c) The post-reorganization approach is preferable, and is adopted, since it does a far better job of treating the payment of boot as a component of the overall exchange.  Under that approach, NL's hypothetical redemption easily satisfied  302(b)(2), which specifies that redemptions whereby the taxpayer relinquishes more than 20% of his corporate control, and thereafter retains less than 50% of the voting shares, shall not be treated as dividend distributions.  P.  489 U. S. 739-740.
(d) The Commissioner's objection to this ""recasting [of] the merger transaction,"" on the ground that it forces courts to find a redemption where none existed, overstates the extent to which the redemption is imagined.  Since a tax-free reorganization transaction is, in theory, merely a continuance of the proprietary interests in the continuing enterprise under modified corporate form, the boot-for-stock transaction can be viewed as a partial repurchase of stock by the continuing corporate enterprise -- i.e., as a redemption.  Although both the pre-reorganization and post-reorganization analogies ""recast the transaction,"" the latter view at least recognizes that a reorganization has taken place.  Pp.  489 U. S. 740-741. 
Page 489 U. S. 728

(e) Even if the post-reorganization analogy and the principles of  302 were abandoned in favor of a less artificial understanding of the transaction, the result would be the same.  The legislative history of  356(a)(2) suggests that Congress was primarily concerned with preventing corporations from evading tax by ""siphon[ing] off"" accumulated earnings and profits at a capital gains rate through the ruse of a reorganization.  This purpose, in turn, suggests that Congress did not intend to impose ordinary income tax on boot accompanying a transaction that involves a bona fide, arm's-length exchange between unrelated parties in the context of a reorganization.  In the instant transaction, there is no indication that the reorganization was used as a ruse.  Thus, the boot is better characterized as part of the proceeds of a sale of stock, subject to capital gains treatment, than as a proxy for a dividend.  Pp.  489 U. S. 741-745.

Petitioner Department of Justice responded that it had no record of such crimes, but refused to confirm or deny whether it had any information concerning nonfinancial crimes by Medico.  The court granted summary judgment for the Department, holding, inter alia, that the rap-sheet was protected by Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, which excludes from that statute's disclosure requirements records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes

Held:  Disclosure of the contents of an FBI rap-sheet to a third party ""could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of

(b) Whether disclosure of a private document is ""warranted"" within the meaning of the Exemption turns upon the nature of the requested document and its relationship to the FOIA's central purpose of exposing to public scrutiny official information that sheds light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties, rather than upon the particular purpose for which the document is requested or the identity of the requesting party.

No. 87-996
Argued November 1, 1988
Decided March 21, 1989
489 U.S. 561

Syllabus 
Due to disagreements about loans to petitioner by FirstSouth, F.A. a federal savings and loan association, petitioner filed suit against FirstSouth in state court, alleging various state law causes of action and seeking damages and equitable relief.  Two months later, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Bank Board) determined that FirstSouth was insolvent, and appointed as receiver the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which substituted itself for FirstSouth in petitioner's suit and removed the case to Federal District Court.  That court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under North Mississippi Savings & Loan Assn. v. Hudspeth, 756 F.2d 1096 (CA5), which held that Congress, by virtue of 12 U.S.C.  1464(d)(6)(C) and 1729(d), had granted FSLIC exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the assets of an insolvent savings and loan association under FSLIC receivership, subject only to review by the Bank Board and then to limited judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Shortly before the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on the basis of Hudspeth, petitioner, on the day established by FSLIC as the deadline for the filing of creditor claims against FirstSouth, filed its proof of claim for approximately $113 million.  Six months later, FSLIC notified petitioner that its claim had been ""retained for further review.""  There has been no further action on the claim.
Held.
1. The statutes governing FSLIC and the Bank Board do not grant FSLIC adjudicatory power over creditors' claims against insolvent savings and loan associations under FSLIC receivership, and do not divest the courts of jurisdiction to consider those claims de novo.  Pp.  489 U. S. 572-579.
(a) The plain language of  1729(b) and (d) cannot be read to confer upon FSLIC as receiver the power to adjudicate creditors' claims with the force of law.  The power granted by  1729(d) to ""settle, compromise, or release"" claims is distinguishable from the power to adjudicate, and is to some extent inconsistent with it, since a body with the power to say ""yes"" or ""no"" with the force of law has little need to settle or compromise.  Similarly,  1729(b)(1)(B)'s directive to FSLIC to ""pay all valid 
Page 489 U. S. 562
 credit obligations"" of an insolvent association cannot be read to confer adjudicatory power over claims, or to preclude claimants from resorting to the courts for a determination of their claims' validity; it simply empowers FSLIC, much like an ordinary insurance company, to pay claims proved to its satisfaction.  The statutory framework in which  1729 appears demonstrates clearly that, when Congress meant to confer adjudicatory authority on FSLIC, it did so explicitly, enacting detailed provisions governing procedural and substantive rights and providing for judicial review.  Pp.  489 U. S. 572-574.
(b) Judicial resolution of petitioner's state law claims would not ""restrain or affect"" FSLIC's exercise of its receivership functions in violation of  1464(d)(6)(C), which states that,
""[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court may take any action for or toward the removal of any . . . receiver, or, except at the instance of the Board, restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of a . . . receiver.""
This language does not add adjudication of creditor claims to FSLIC's receivership powers, but simply prohibits courts from restraining or affecting FSLIC's exercise of those receivership ""powers and functions"" that have been granted by other statutory sources, none of which confer adjudicatory power.  Moreover, in the context of its relationship to  1464(d)(6)(A) -- which specifies grounds for the Bank Board's appointment of a receiver and authorizes an association placed in receivership to bring a district court suit within 30 days to challenge the appointment --  1464(d)(6)(C) must be read simply to prohibit untimely challenges to the receiver's appointment or collateral attacks attempting to restrain the receiver from carrying out its basic functions, and not to divest state and federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction to determine the validity of claims against institutions under a FSLIC receivership.  This reading is reinforced by the fact that, at the time of the statute's enactment, it was well established at common law that suits to establish the validity and amount of a claim against an insolvent debtor in receivership did not interfere with the receiver's powers and functions.  Hudspeth erred in assuming that such adjudication would ""restrain"" FSLIC's exercise of its receivership powers by delaying its prompt liquidation of failed savings and loans, since a receiver can make an interim distribution of assets pending the resolution of disputed claims in other courts.  Pp.  489 U. S. 574-577.
(c) That Congress clearly envisaged that the courts would have subject matter jurisdiction over creditor suits against FSLIC as receiver is demonstrated by several other statutory provisions, including those allowing FSLIC to sue and be sued in any court,  1725(c)(4), and establishing a statute of limitations for actions against FSLIC to enforce deposit insurance claims,  1728(c).  Most significantly,  1730(k)(1) provides 
Page 489 U. S. 563
 an explicit grant of subject matter jurisdiction that clearly contemplates creditors' state court suits against FSLIC as receiver for state-chartered associations.  There is no indication that Congress intended to treat federally chartered associations differently in this respect.  Pp.  489 U. S. 577-579.
2. Creditors are not required to exhaust the Bank Board's current administrative claims procedure before bringing suit, because that procedure does not place a reasonable time limit on FSLIC's consideration of creditors' claims.  Pp.  489 U. S. 579-587.
(a) Under the current claims procedure, the entire process for a claimant whose claim is not allowed in full could take well over a year from the time the claim is first filed with FSLIC until the Board completes its final review.  Moreover, because the claims procedure places no time limit on FSLIC's consideration of claims retained for ""further review,"" the length of time for such claims could be far longer, and even indefinite.  Nevertheless, the claims procedure specifies that judicial review is available only after exhaustion of these administrative procedures.  Pp.  489 U. S. 579-583.
(b) Although the statutes governing FSLIC and the Bank Board do not explicitly mandate exhaustion of administrative remedies, it would be a reasonable exercise of the Board's broad power to make rules for the conduct of receiverships,  1464(d)(11), and it would be entirely consistent with Congress' clear intent that FSLIC liquidate failed associations ""in an orderly manner,""  1729(b)(1)(A)(v), if the Board's regulations only required that claimants give FSLIC notice of their claims and then wait for a reasonable period of time before filing suit while FSLIC decided whether to pay, settle, or disallow the claims.  The Board reasonably could decide that FSLIC simply cannot perform its statutory function unless it is notified of the entire array of claims against a failed association's assets and has a reasonable period of time to make rational and consistent judgments regarding those claims.  Pp.  489 U. S. 583-585.
(c) However, the present claims procedure exceeds the Bank Board's statutory authority by not placing a clear and reasonable time limit on FSLIC's consideration of claims.  The lack of such a reasonable limit renders the claims procedure inadequate, because it allows FSLIC to delay the administrative processing of claims indefinitely, thereby denying litigants their day in court while the statute of limitations runs; because it may enable FSLIC to coerce unfair settlements by virtue of the fact that the receiver's assets may be depleted by other, interim distributions before the claimant gets to court; and because FSLIC itself is often the main creditor, and thus may well have an incentive to delay decisions on large claims such as petitioner's.  Because an inadequate administrative remedy need not be exhausted, petitioner may proceed 
Page 489 U. S. 564
 directly to court for a de novo determination on the merits of its state law claims.  Pp.  489 U. S. 586-587.

Petitioners' decedent (Brower) was killed when the stolen car he had been driving at high speeds to elude pursuing police crashed into a police roadblock.  Petitioners brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that respondents, acting under color of law, violated Brower's Fourth Amendment rights by effecting an unreasonable seizure using excessive force.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that respondents placed an 18-wheel truck completely across the highway in the path of Brower's flight, behind a curve, with a police cruiser's headlights aimed in such fashion as to blind Brower on his approach.  It also alleges that the fatal collision was a ""proximate result"" of this police conduct.  The District Court dismissed for failure to state a claim, concluding that the roadblock was reasonable under the circumstances, and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that no ""seizure"" had occurred.
Held:
1. Consistent with the language, history, and judicial construction of the Fourth Amendment, a seizure occurs when governmental termination of a person's movement is effected through means intentionally applied.  Because the complaint alleges that Brower was stopped by the instrumentality set in motion or put in place to stop him, it states a claim of Fourth Amendment ""seizure.""  Pp.  489 U. S. 595-599.
2. Petitioners can claim the right to recover for Brower's death because the unreasonableness alleged consists precisely of setting up the roadblock in such a manner as to be likely to kill him.  On remand, the Court of Appeals must determine whether the District Court erred in concluding that the roadblock was not ""unreasonable.""  Pp.  489 U. S. 599-600.

No. 87-1555
Argued November 2, 1988
Decided March 21, 1989
489 U.S. 602

Syllabus 
Upon the basis of evidence indicating that alcohol and drug abuse by railroad employees had caused or contributed to a number of significant train accidents, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) promulgated regulations under petitioner Secretary of Transportation's statutory authority to adopt safety standards for the industry.  Among other things, Subpart C of the regulations requires railroads to see that blood and urine tests of covered employees are conducted following certain major train accidents or incidents, while Subpart D authorizes, but does not require, railroads to administer breath or urine tests, or both, to covered employees who violate certain safety rules.  Respondents, the Railway Labor Executives' Association and various of its member labor organizations, brought suit in the Federal District Court to enjoin the regulations.  The court granted summary judgment for petitioners, concluding that the regulations did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling, inter alia, that a requirement of particularized suspicion is essential to a finding that toxicological testing of railroad employees is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  The court stated that such a requirement would ensure that the tests, which reveal the presence of drug metabolites that may remain in the body for weeks following ingestion, are confined to the detection of current impairment.
Held:
1. The Fourth Amendment is applicable to the drug and alcohol testing mandated or authorized by the FRA regulations.  Pp.  489 U. S. 613-618.
(a) The tests in question cannot be viewed as private action outside the reach of the Fourth Amendment.  A railroad that complies with Subpart C does so by compulsion of sovereign authority, and therefore must be viewed as an instrument or agent of the Government.  Similarly, even though Subpart D does not compel railroads to test, it cannot be concluded, in the context of this facial challenge, that such testing will be primarily the result of private initiative, since specific features of the regulations combine to establish that the Government has actively encouraged, endorsed, and participated in the testing.  Specifically, since 
Page 489 U. S. 603
 the regulations preempt state laws covering the same subject matter, and are intended to supersede collective bargaining and arbitration award provisions, the Government has removed all legal barriers to the testing authorized by Subpart D.  Moreover, by conferring upon the FRA the right to receive biological samples and test results procured by railroads, Subpart D makes plain a strong preference for testing and a governmental desire to share the fruits of such intrusions.  In addition, the regulations mandate that railroads not bargain away their Subpart D testing authority, and provide that an employee who refuses to submit to such tests must be withdrawn from covered service.  Pp.  489 U. S. 614-616.
(b) The collection and subsequent analysis of the biological samples required or authorized by the regulations constitute searches of the person subject to the Fourth Amendment.  This Court has long recognized that a compelled intrusion into the body for blood to be tested for alcohol content, and the ensuing chemical analysis, constitute searches.  Similarly, subjecting a person to the breath test authorized by Subpart D must be deemed a search, since it requires the production of ""deep lung"" breath, and thereby implicates concerns about bodily integrity.  Moreover, although the collection and testing of urine under the regulations do not entail any intrusion into the body, they nevertheless constitute searches, since they intrude upon expectations of privacy as to medical information and the act of urination that society has long recognized as reasonable.  Even if the employer's antecedent interference with the employee's freedom of movement cannot be characterized as an independent Fourth Amendment seizure, any limitation on that freedom that is necessary to obtain the samples contemplated by the regulations must be considered in assessing the intrusiveness of the searches affected by the testing program.  Pp.  489 U. S. 616-618.
2. The drug and alcohol tests mandated or authorized by the FRA regulations are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, even though there is no requirement of a warrant or a reasonable suspicion that any particular employee may be impaired, since, on the present record, the compelling governmental interests served by the regulations outweigh employees' privacy concerns.  Pp.  489 U. S. 618-633.
(a) The Government's interest in regulating the conduct of railroad employees engaged in safety-sensitive tasks in order to ensure the safety of the traveling public and of the employees themselves plainly justifies prohibiting such employees from using alcohol or drugs while on duty or on call for duty and the exercise of supervision to assure that the restrictions are in fact observed.  That interest presents ""special needs"" beyond normal law enforcement that may justify departures from the usual warrant and probable cause requirements.  Pp.  489 U. S. 618-621. 
Page 489 U. S. 604

(b) Imposing a warrant requirement in the present context is not essential to render the intrusions at issue reasonable.  Such a requirement would do little to further the purposes of a warrant, since both the circumstances justifying toxicological testing and the permissible limits of such intrusions are narrowly and specifically defined by the regulations, and doubtless are well known to covered employees, and since there are virtually no facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate, in light of the standardized nature of the tests and the minimal discretion vested in those charged with administering the program.  Moreover, imposing a warrant requirement would significantly hinder, and in many cases frustrate, the objectives of the testing program, since the delay necessary to procure a warrant could result in the destruction of valuable evidence, in that alcohol and drugs are eliminated from the bloodstream at a constant rate, and since the railroad supervisors who set the testing process in motion have little familiarity with the intricacies of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  Pp.  489 U. S. 621-624.
(c) Imposing an individualized suspicion requirement in the present context is not essential to render the intrusions at issue reasonable.  The testing procedures contemplated by the regulations pose only limited threats to covered employees' justifiable privacy expectations, particularly since they participate in an industry subject to pervasive safety regulation by the Federal and State Governments.  Moreover, because employees ordinarily consent to significant employer-imposed restrictions on their freedom of movement, any additional interference with that freedom that occurs in the time it takes to procure a sample from a railroad employee is minimal.  Furthermore, Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, established that governmentally imposed blood tests do not constitute an unduly extensive imposition on an individual's privacy and bodily integrity, and the breath tests authorized by Subpart D are even less intrusive than blood tests.  And, although urine tests require employees to perform an excretory function traditionally shielded by great privacy, the regulations reduce the intrusiveness of the collection process by requiring that samples be furnished in a medical environment, without direct observation.  In contrast, the governmental interest in testing without a showing of individualized suspicion is compelling.  A substance-impaired railroad employee in a safety-sensitive job can cause great human loss before any signs of the impairment become noticeable, and the regulations supply an effective means of deterring such employees from using drugs or alcohol by putting them on notice that they are likely to be discovered if an accident occurs.  An individualized suspicion requirement would also impede railroads' ability to obtain valuable information about the causes of accidents or incidents and how to protect the public, since obtaining evidence giving rise to the suspicion 
Page 489 U. S. 605
 that a particular employee is impaired is impracticable in the chaotic aftermath of an accident, when it is difficult to determine which employees contributed to the occurrence and objective indicia of impairment are absent.  The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the regulations are unreasonable because the tests in question cannot measure current impairment is flawed.  Even if urine test results disclosed nothing more specific than the recent use of controlled substances, this information would provide the basis for a further investigation, and might allow the FRA to reach an informed judgment as to how the particular accident occurred.  More importantly, the court overlooked the FRA's policy of placing principal reliance on blood tests, which unquestionably can identify recent drug use, and failed to recognize that the regulations are designed not only to discern impairment, but to deter it.  Pp.  489 U. S. 624-632.

489 U.S. 656

Syllabus 
The United States Customs Service, which has as its primary enforcement mission the interdiction and seizure of illegal drugs smuggled into the country, has implemented a drug-screening program requiring urinalysis tests of Service employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions having a direct involvement in drug interdiction or requiring the incumbent to carry firearms or to handle ""classified"" material.  Among other things, the program requires that an applicant be notified that his selection is contingent upon successful completion of drug screening, sets forth procedures for collection and analysis of the requisite samples and procedures designed both to ensure against adulteration or substitution of specimens and to limit the intrusion on employee privacy, and provides that test results may not be turned over to any other agency, including criminal prosecutors, without the employee's written consent.  Petitioners, a federal employees' union and one of its officials, filed suit on behalf of Service employees seeking covered positions, alleging that the drug testing program violated, inter alia, the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court agreed, and enjoined the program.  The Court of Appeals vacated the injunction, holding that, although the program effects a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, such searches are reasonable in light of their limited scope and the Service's strong interest in detecting drug use among employees in covered positions.
Held:
1. Where the Government requires its employees to produce urine samples to be analyzed for evidence of illegal drug use, the collection and subsequent chemical analysis of such samples are searches that must meet the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.  Cf. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., ante at  489 U. S. 616-618.  However, because the Service's testing program is not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement -- i.e., test results may not be used in a criminal prosecution without the employee's consent, and the purposes of the program are to deter drug use among those eligible for promotion to sensitive positions and to prevent the promotion of drug users to those positions -- the public interest in the program must be balanced against 
Page 489 U. S. 657
 the individual's privacy concerns implicated by the tests to determine whether a warrant, probable cause, or some level of individualized suspicion is required in this particular context.  Railway Labor Executives, ante at  489 U. S. 619-620.  Pp.  489 U. S. 665-666
2. A warrant is not required by the balance of privacy and governmental interests in the context of this case.  Such a requirement would serve only to divert valuable agency resources from the Service's primary mission, which would be compromised if warrants were necessary in connection with routine, yet sensitive, employment decisions.  Furthermore, a warrant would provide little or no additional protection of personal privacy, since the Service's program defines narrowly and specifically the circumstances justifying testing and the permissible limits of such intrusions; affected employees know that they must be tested, are aware of the testing procedures that the Service must follow, and are not subject to the discretion of officials in the field; and there are no special facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate, in that implementation of the testing process becomes automatic when an employee pursues a covered position.  Pp.  489 U. S. 666-667
3. The Service's testing of employees who apply for promotion to positions directly involving the interdiction of illegal drugs, or to positions that require the incumbent to carry firearms, is reasonable despite the absence of a requirement of probable cause or of some level of individualized suspicion.  Pp.  489 U. S. 667-677.
(a) In light of evidence demonstrating that there is a national crisis in law enforcement caused by the smuggling of illicit narcotics, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that front-line interdiction personnel are physically fit and have unimpeachable integrity and judgment.  It also has a compelling interest in preventing the risk to the life of the citizenry posed by the potential use of deadly force by persons suffering from impaired perception and judgment.  These governmental interests outweigh the privacy interests of those seeking promotion to such positions, who have a diminished expectation of privacy in respect to the intrusions occasioned by a urine test by virtue of the special, and obvious, physical and ethical demands of the positions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 668-672.
(b) Petitioners' contention that the testing program is unreasonable because it is not based on a belief that testing will reveal any drug use by covered employees evinces an unduly narrow view of the context in which the program was implemented.  Although it was not motivated by any perceived drug problem among Service employees, the program is nevertheless justified by the extraordinary safety and national security hazards that would attend the promotion of drug users to the sensitive positions in question.  Moreover, the mere circumstance that all but a few of the employees tested are innocent does not impugn the program's 
Page 489 U. S. 658
 validity, since it is designed to prevent the substantial harm that could be caused by the promotion of drug users as much as it is designed to detect actual drug use.  Pp.  489 U. S. 673-675.
(c) Also unpersuasive is petitioners' contention that the program is not a sufficiently productive mechanism to justify its intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests because illegal drug users can easily avoid detection by temporary abstinence or by surreptitious adulteration of their urine specimens.  Addicts may be unable to abstain even for a limited period or may be unaware of the ""fade-away effect"" of certain drugs.  More importantly, since a particular employee's pattern of elimination for a given drug cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy, and may extend for as long as 22 days, and since this information is not likely to be known or available to the employee in any event, he cannot reasonably expect to deceive the test by abstaining after the test date is assigned.  Nor can he expect attempts at adulteration to succeed, in view of the precautions built into the program to ensure the integrity of each sample.  Pp.  489 U. S. 676-677.
4. The record is inadequate for the purpose of determining whether the Service's testing of those who apply for promotion to positions where they would handle ""classified"" information is reasonable, since it is not clear whether persons occupying particular positions apparently subject to such testing are likely to gain access to sensitive information.  On remand, the Court of Appeals should examine the criteria used by the Service in determining what materials are classified and in deciding whom to test under this rubric and should, in assessing the reasonableness of requiring tests of those employees, consider pertinent information bearing upon their privacy expectations and the supervision to which they are already subject.  Pp.  489 U. S. 677-678.

It also has a compelling interest in preventing the risk to the life of the citizenry posed by the potential use of deadly force by persons suffering from impaired perception and judgment.  These governmental interests outweigh the privacy interests of those seeking promotion to such positions, who have a diminished expectation of privacy in respect to the intrusions occasioned by a urine test by virtue of the special, and obvious, physical and ethical demands of the positions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 668-672.
(b) Petitioners' contention that the testing program is unreasonable because it is not based on a belief that testing will reveal any drug use by covered employees evinces an unduly narrow view of the context in which the program was implemented.  Although it was not motivated by any perceived drug problem among Service employees, the program is nevertheless justified by the extraordinary safety and national security hazards that would attend the promotion of drug users to the sensitive positions in question.  Moreover, the mere circumstance that all but a few of the employees tested are innocent does not impugn the program's 
Page 489 U. S. 658
 validity, since it is designed to prevent the substantial harm that could be caused by the promotion of drug users as much as it is designed to detect actual drug use.  Pp.  489 U. S. 673-675.
(c) Also unpersuasive is petitioners' contention that the program is not a sufficiently productive mechanism to justify its intrusion on Fourth Amendment interests because illegal drug users can easily avoid detection by temporary abstinence or by surreptitious adulteration of their urine specimens.  Addicts may be unable to abstain even for a limited period or may be unaware of the ""fade-away effect"" of certain drugs.  More importantly, since a particular employee's pattern of elimination for a given drug cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy, and may extend for as long as 22 days, and since this information is not likely to be known or available to the employee in any event, he cannot reasonably expect to deceive the test by abstaining after the test date is assigned.  Nor can he expect attempts at adulteration to succeed, in view of the precautions built into the program to ensure the integrity of each sample.  Pp.  489 U. S. 676-677.
4. The record is inadequate for the purpose of determining whether the Service's testing of those who apply for promotion to positions where they would handle ""classified"" information is reasonable, since it is not clear whether persons occupying particular positions apparently subject to such testing are likely to gain access to sensitive information.  On remand, the Court of Appeals should examine the criteria used by the Service in determining what materials are classified and in deciding whom to test under this rubric and should, in assessing the reasonableness of requiring tests of those employees, consider pertinent information bearing upon their privacy expectations and the supervision to which they are already subject.  Pp.  489 U. S. 677-678.

489 U.S. 468

Syllabus 
A construction contract between appellant and appellee contained an agreement to arbitrate all disputes arising out of the contract and a choice-of-law clause providing that the contract would be governed by the law of ""the place where the Project is located.""  When a dispute arose under the contract, appellant made a formal demand for arbitration.  In response, appellee filed an action against appellant in the California Superior Court alleging fraud and breach of contract; in the same action, appellee sought indemnity from two other parties involved in the construction project, with whom it did not have arbitration agreements.  The trial court denied appellant's motion to compel arbitration and granted appellee's motion to stay arbitration under Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann.  1281.2(c), which allows such a stay pending resolution of related litigation between a party to the arbitration agreement and third parties not bound by it.  The State Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that (1) by specifying that the contract would be governed by ""the law of the place where the Project is located,"" the choice-of-law clause incorporated the California rules of arbitration, including  1281.2(c), into the parties' arbitration agreement, and (2) application of  1281.2(c) was not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), even though the contract involved interstate commerce.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeal's conclusion that the parties intended the choice-of-law clause to incorporate the California arbitration rules into their arbitration agreement is a question of state law, which this Court will not set aside.  Pp.  489 U. S. 474-476.
(a) Appellant's contention that the state court's construction of the choice-of-law clause was in effect a finding that appellant had ""waived"" its federally guaranteed right to compel arbitration, a waiver whose validity must be judged by reference to federal, rather than state, law, fundamentally misconceives the nature of the rights created by the FAA.  Section 4 of that Act does not confer an absolute right to compel arbitration, but only a right to obtain an order directing that ""arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in [the parties'] agreement.""  (Emphasis 
Page 489 U. S. 469
 added.)  Here, the state court found that, by incorporating California arbitration rules into their agreement, the parties had agreed that arbitration would not proceed in situations within the scope of  1281.2(c).  This was not a finding that appellant had ""waived"" an FAA-guaranteed right to compel arbitration, but a finding that it had no such right in the first place, because the parties' agreement did not require arbitration to proceed in this situation.  Pp.  489 U. S. 474-475.
(b) Also without merit is appellant's argument that the state court's construction of the choice-of-law clause must be set aside because it violates the settled federal rule that questions of arbitrability in contracts subject to the FAA must be resolved with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.  See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U. S. 1,  460 U. S. 24-25.  There is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules; the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of private agreements to arbitrate.  Interpreting a choice-of-law clause to make applicable the California arbitration rules -- which are manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process -- does not offend Moses H. Cone's rule of liberal construction.  Pp.  489 U. S. 475-476.
2. Application of  1281.2(c) to stay arbitration under the parties' contract is not preempted by the FAA.  The FAA contains no express preemptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.  Moreover, since the FAA's principal purpose is to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms, it cannot be said that application of  1281.2(c) here would undermine the Act's goals and policies.  Arbitration under the Act in a matter of consent, not coercion, and the parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.  Just as they may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614,  473 U. S. 628, so too may they specify by contract the rules under which the arbitration will be conducted.  Where, as here, the parties have agreed to abide by state arbitration rules, enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the FAA's goals, even if the result is that arbitration is stayed when the Act would otherwise permit it to go forward.  Pp.  489 U. S. 476-479.

Commission of Kansas
No. 86-1856
Argued November 29, 1988
Decided March 6, 1989
489 U.S. 493

Syllabus 
The issues for decision are whether a regulation adopted by appellee State Corporation Commission of Kansas (KCC) (1) was preempted by the federal Natural Gas Act (NGA) or (2) violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  Interrelated market, contractual, and regulatory factors have led interstate pipelines to cut back their purchases of ""old,"" federally regulated natural gas from producers at the Kansas-Hugoton field.  The KCC found that the cutbacks had caused an imbalance between underproduced Hugoton wells supplying interstate pipelines and overproduced wells supplying the intrastate market, resulting in drainage between wells that posed a threat to producers' correlative property rights in the field's common gas pool.  To protect correlative rights, the KCC adopted a regulation providing that producers' entitlements to assigned quantities of Hugoton gas would permanently be canceled if production were too long delayed.  The KCC reasoned that, were permanent cancellation of production underages the alternative to their timely production, purchasers and producers would have an incentive to run more gas out of the field, and thereby reduce existing underages, deter future underages, and restore balance to the field.  In dismissing a challenge to the regulation by appellant, an interstate pipeline having a long-term contract for Hugoton gas, the KCC rejected the contention that the regulation was preempted by the NGA, which gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of regulated gas in interstate commerce, including interstate pipelines' purchasing policies and pricing practices.  On judicial review, a county court agreed that the regulation was not preempted, and the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Congress has not exercised its power under the Supremacy Clause of Art. VI of the Constitution to preempt the KCC regulation, and therefore the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court holding that the Commission's regulation was not preempted is affirmed.  Pp.  489 U. S. 509-522.
(a) The regulation does not encroach upon a field that Congress has marked out for comprehensive and exclusive federal control, but, in fact, regulates in a field that Congress expressly left to the States.  Section 1(b) of the NGA carefully divides up regulatory power over the natural 
Page 489 U. S. 494
 gas industry, conferring on FERC exclusive jurisdiction over interstate transportation and sales, but expressly reserving to the States the power to regulate, inter alia, ""production or gathering.""  Since the latter phrase and the NGA's legislative history clearly establish Congress' intent not to interfere with the States' traditional power to regulate production -- and therefore rates of production over time -- as a means of conserving natural resources and protecting producers' correlative rights, the KCC's regulation represents precisely the sort of scheme that Congress intended to leave within a State's authority.  To find field preemption merely because the regulation might affect gas purchasers' costs, and hence interstate rates, would be largely to nullify such state authority, for there can be little if any regulation of production that might not have at least an incremental effect on purchasers' costs in some market and contractual situations.  Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm'n of Kansas, 372 U. S. 84, and Transcontinental Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil and Gas Bd. of Mississippi, 474 U. S. 409, which invalidated state regulations directed to interstate purchasers, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 510-514.
(b) The regulation does not conflict with the federal scheme regulating interstate purchasers' cost structures.  Appellant has not asserted that there exists any conflict so direct that it is impossible for pipelines to comply with both the regulation and with federal regulation of purchasing practices and pricing.  Moreover, Kansas' threat to cancel underages does not prevent the attainment of FERC's regulatory goals, because the regulation imposes no direct purchasing requirements on pipelines, but simply defines producers' rights to extract gas; because FERC will make its own regulatory decisions with the KCC's regulation in mind, and because, if the regulation operates as a spur to greater production of low-cost Hugoton gas as Kansas intends, this would be congruous with current federal goals.  Further, the purpose of the regulation is to protect the correlative rights of producers, and the means adopted are plausibly related to that legitimate state goal.  The KCC's asserted purpose is not rendered suspect by the fact that the regulation might worsen correlative rights problems if underages are actually canceled, since the KCC's assumption that the regulation would likely increase production is not implausible in light of supporting evidence in the record.  Pp.  489 U. S. 514-519.
(c) The regulation is not preempted under  7(c) and 7(b) of the NGA, which respectively require that producers who sell gas to pipelines for resale in interstate commerce obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC and obligate certificated producers to continue supplying ""old"" gas in the interstate market until FERC authorizes an abandonment.  Plainly meritless is appellant's argument 
Page 489 U. S. 495
 that, since a producer's available reserves are a factor in FERC's certification decision, and since cancellation of underages under the regulation will work an abandonment through the noncompensable drainage of dedicated reserves, such an abandonment without FERC's approval undercuts the certification and abandonment process.  FERC's abandonment authority encompasses only gas that operators have a right under state law to produce, and the regulation has settled that right in Kansas.  Nor is there merit to appellant's argument to the effect that the regulation stands as an obstacle to the objective Congress sought to attain when it gave FERC authority over certification and abandonment -- assuring the public a reliable source of gas.  That goal is entirely harmonious with the regulation's aim of assuring that producers have an opportunity to extract all the reserves underlying their leases before the Hugoton field is exhausted.  Pp.  489 U. S. 520-522.
2. The KCC regulation does not violate the Commerce Clause of Art. I,  8, of the Constitution.  Pp.  489 U. S. 522-526.
(a) The regulation does not amount to per se unconstitutional economic protectionism, since it is neutral on its face, providing for the cancellation of producers' underages regardless of whether they supply the intrastate or interstate markets, and since its effects on interstate commerce are incident to Kansas' legitimate efforts under  1(b) of the NGA to regulate production to prevent waste and protect correlative rights.  Moreover, current federal policy is to encourage the production of low-cost gas, so that, were the regulation to increase Kansas takes at the expense of States producing more costly gas, this would not disrupt interstate commerce, but would improve its efficiency.  Although Kansas may fail in its efforts to encourage production of underages, and the regulation might, as a result, engender noncompensable drainage to producers for the intrastate market, such indirect and speculative effects on interstate commerce are insufficient to render the regulation unconstitutional.  Pp.  489 U. S. 522-525.
(b) The regulation is not invalid under the balancing test set forth in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137,  397 U. S. 142, since it applies evenhandedly, regardless of whether the producer supplies the intrastate or interstate market, and is an exercise of Kansas' traditional and congressionally recognized power over gas production.  Moreover, the regulation's intended effect of increasing production is not clearly excessive in relation to Kansas' substantial interest in controlling production to prevent waste and protect correlative rights, and the possibility that it may result in the diversion of gas to intrastate purchasers is too impalpable to override the State's weighty interest.  Appellant's claim that the regulation must be invalidated because Kansas could have achieved its aims without burdening interstate commerce simply by establishing production 
Page 489 U. S. 496
 quotas in line with appellant's conception of market demand levels is rejected, since appellant has not challenged the KCC's determination of allowables, and has identified nothing in the record that could adequately establish that the KCC might have achieved its goals as effectively had it adopted a different allowables formula.  Pp.  489 U. S. 525-526.
240 Kan. 638, 732 P.2d 775, affirmed.

The issues for decision are whether a regulation adopted by appellee State Corporation Commission of Kansas (KCC) (1) was preempted by the federal Natural Gas Act (NGA) or (2) violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  Interrelated market, contractual, and regulatory factors have led interstate pipelines to cut back their purchases of ""old,"" federally regulated natural gas from producers at the Kansas-Hugoton field.  The KCC found that the cutbacks had caused an imbalance between underproduced Hugoton wells supplying interstate pipelines and overproduced wells supplying the intrastate market, resulting in drainage between wells that posed a threat to producers' correlative property rights in the field's common gas pool.  To protect correlative rights, the KCC adopted a regulation providing that producers' entitlements to assigned quantities of Hugoton gas would permanently be canceled if production were too long delayed.  The KCC reasoned that, were permanent cancellation of production underages the alternative to their timely production, purchasers and producers would have an incentive to run more gas out of the field, and thereby reduce existing underages, deter future underages, and restore balance to the field.  In dismissing a challenge to the regulation by appellant, an interstate pipeline having a long-term contract for Hugoton gas, the KCC rejected the contention that the regulation was preempted by the NGA, which gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of regulated gas in interstate commerce, including interstate pipelines' purchasing policies and pricing practices.  On judicial review, a county court agreed that the regulation was not preempted, and the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1. Congress has not exercised its power under the Supremacy Clause of Art. VI of the Constitution to preempt the KCC regulation, and therefore the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court holding that the Commission's regulation was not preempted is affirmed.  Pp.  489 U. S. 509-522.
(a) The regulation does not encroach upon a field that Congress has marked out for comprehensive and exclusive federal control, but, in fact, regulates in a field that Congress expressly left to the States.  Section 1(b) of the NGA carefully divides up regulatory power over the natural 
Page 489 U. S. 494
 gas industry, conferring on FERC exclusive jurisdiction over interstate transportation and sales, but expressly reserving to the States the power to regulate, inter alia, ""production or gathering.""  Since the latter phrase and the NGA's legislative history clearly establish Congress' intent not to interfere with the States' traditional power to regulate production -- and therefore rates of production over time -- as a means of conserving natural resources and protecting producers' correlative rights, the KCC's regulation represents precisely the sort of scheme that Congress intended to leave within a State's authority.  To find field preemption merely because the regulation might affect gas purchasers' costs, and hence interstate rates, would be largely to nullify such state authority, for there can be little if any regulation of production that might not have at least an incremental effect on purchasers' costs in some market and contractual situations.  Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corporation Comm'n of Kansas, 372 U. S. 84, and Transcontinental Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil and Gas Bd. of Mississippi, 474 U. S. 409, which invalidated state regulations directed to interstate purchasers, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 510-514.
(b) The regulation does not conflict with the federal scheme regulating interstate purchasers' cost structures.  Appellant has not asserted that there exists any conflict so direct that it is impossible for pipelines to comply with both the regulation and with federal regulation of purchasing practices and pricing.  Moreover, Kansas' threat to cancel underages does not prevent the attainment of FERC's regulatory goals, because the regulation imposes no direct purchasing requirements on pipelines, but simply defines producers' rights to extract gas; because FERC will make its own regulatory decisions with the KCC's regulation in mind, and because, if the regulation operates as a spur to greater production of low-cost Hugoton gas as Kansas intends, this would be congruous with current federal goals.  Further, the purpose of the regulation is to protect the correlative rights of producers, and the means adopted are plausibly related to that legitimate state goal.  The KCC's asserted purpose is not rendered suspect by the fact that the regulation might worsen correlative rights problems if underages are actually canceled, since the KCC's assumption that the regulation would likely increase production is not implausible in light of supporting evidence in the record.  Pp.  489 U. S. 514-519.
(c) The regulation is not preempted under  7(c) and 7(b) of the NGA, which respectively require that producers who sell gas to pipelines for resale in interstate commerce obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC and obligate certificated producers to continue supplying ""old"" gas in the interstate market until FERC authorizes an abandonment.  Plainly meritless is appellant's argument 
Page 489 U. S. 495
 that, since a producer's available reserves are a factor in FERC's certification decision, and since cancellation of underages under the regulation will work an abandonment through the noncompensable drainage of dedicated reserves, such an abandonment without FERC's approval undercuts the certification and abandonment process.  FERC's abandonment authority encompasses only gas that operators have a right under state law to produce, and the regulation has settled that right in Kansas.  Nor is there merit to appellant's argument to the effect that the regulation stands as an obstacle to the objective Congress sought to attain when it gave FERC authority over certification and abandonment -- assuring the public a reliable source of gas.  That goal is entirely harmonious with the regulation's aim of assuring that producers have an opportunity to extract all the reserves underlying their leases before the Hugoton field is exhausted.  Pp.  489 U. S. 520-522.
2. The KCC regulation does not violate the Commerce Clause of Art. I,  8, of the Constitution.  Pp.  489 U. S. 522-526.
(a) The regulation does not amount to per se unconstitutional economic protectionism, since it is neutral on its face, providing for the cancellation of producers' underages regardless of whether they supply the intrastate or interstate markets, and since its effects on interstate commerce are incident to Kansas' legitimate efforts under  1(b) of the NGA to regulate production to prevent waste and protect correlative rights.  Moreover, current federal policy is to encourage the production of low-cost gas, so that, were the regulation to increase Kansas takes at the expense of States producing more costly gas, this would not disrupt interstate commerce, but would improve its efficiency.  Although Kansas may fail in its efforts to encourage production of underages, and the regulation might, as a result, engender noncompensable drainage to producers for the intrastate market, such indirect and speculative effects on interstate commerce are insufficient to render the regulation unconstitutional.  Pp.  489 U. S. 522-525.
(b) The regulation is not invalid under the balancing test set forth in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137,  397 U. S. 142, since it applies evenhandedly, regardless of whether the producer supplies the intrastate or interstate market, and is an exercise of Kansas' traditional and congressionally recognized power over gas production.  Moreover, the regulation's intended effect of increasing production is not clearly excessive in relation to Kansas' substantial interest in controlling production to prevent waste and protect correlative rights, and the possibility that it may result in the diversion of gas to intrastate purchasers is too impalpable to override the State's weighty interest.  Appellant's claim that the regulation must be invalidated because Kansas could have achieved its aims without burdening interstate commerce simply by establishing production 
Page 489 U. S. 496
 quotas in line with appellant's conception of market demand levels is rejected, since appellant has not challenged the KCC's determination of allowables, and has identified nothing in the record that could adequately establish that the KCC might have achieved its goals as effectively had it adopted a different allowables formula.  Pp.  489 U. S. 525-526.

Syllabus 
Petitioner -- a language instructor for the Defense Language Institute, a federal agency -- was not a union member but was within a bargaining unit for which respondent union was the exclusive bargaining agent.  He was promoted to a reopened ""course developer"" position, which had previously been occupied by one Kuntelos, who was demoted when the Institute first abolished the position.  After respondent agreed to arbitrate on behalf of Kuntelos (who was a member of its board) and successfully argued that the position should be declared vacant for refilling, the Institute reassigned the job to Kuntelos, demoted petitioner, and denied his direct protest.  Respondent refused to prosecute petitioner's grievance because of a perceived conflict of interest with its previous Kuntelos advocacy.  Petitioner then filed unfair labor practice charges with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), alleging, inter alia, that respondent had breached its duty of fair representation.  The FLRA's General Counsel upheld this charge, and ordered that a complaint be issued against respondent, which entered into a settlement whereby it posted notice guaranteeing representation to all employees seeking a single position.  When the General Counsel rejected petitioner's contention on appeal that the settlement provided him no relief, he filed a damages suit in the District Court, which held that his charge against respondent was judicially cognizable, since the grant of exclusive union representation contained in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA or Act) impliedly gives federal employees a private right of action to safeguard their right to fair representation.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment for petitioner, stating that the CSRA's statutory scheme, which creates both an express duty of fair representation and a remedy in the FLRA for infringement of this duty, precludes implication of a parallel right to sue in federal court.
Held:  Title VII of the CSRA does not confer on federal employees a private cause of action against a breach by a union representing such employees of its statutory duty of fair representation.  Pp.  489 U. S. 531-537.
(a) Title VII's express language does not create a private cause of action, and there is nothing in the Act's language, structure, or legislative history from which a congressional intent to provide such a remedy 
Page 489 U. S. 528
 can be implied.  In fact, Title VII's provisions demonstrate that Congress vested exclusive enforcement authority over the duty of fair representation in the FLRA and its General Counsel, since the Title renders a breach of that duty an unfair labor practice, which is adjudicated by the FLRA upon the General Counsel's complaint, and since the Title provides recourse to the courts in only three instances, none of which directly relate to the enforcement of the duty of fair representation.  To hold that the district courts must entertain such cases in the first instance would seriously weaken the congressional scheme.  Pp.  489 U. S. 532-534.
(b) A congressional intent to provide a private CSRA cause of action cannot be implied from that Act's similarities to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Railway Labor Act, under which this Court has recognized implicit judicial causes of action to enforce the fair representation duty in the private sector.  Unlike the CSRA, neither of those statutes expressly recognizes that duty or provides any administrative remedy for its enforcement.  Furthermore, the implication in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, of a private NLRA cause of action was intended to preserve courts' preexisting jurisdiction to enforce the fair representation duty after the National Labor Relations Board tardily assumed jurisdiction, whereas, under the pre-CSRA regulatory scheme, there was no equivalent judicial role.  Moreover, Vaca and earlier cases stressed that it was critical that unions represent all employees in good faith, since the pertinent statutes deprived bargaining unit employees of their individual rights to bargain by providing for exclusive bargaining agents.  In contrast, federal employment does not rest on contract in the private sector sense; the deprivation a federal employee suffers from the election of a bargaining agent -- if there is such a deprivation -- is not clearly comparable to the private sector predicament; and the collective bargaining mechanisms created by Title VII do not deprive employees of remedies otherwise provided by statute or regulation.  Vaca also rested in part on the fact that private collective bargaining contracts were enforceable in the courts under  301 of the NLRA, whereas no provision equivalent to  301 exists in the CSRA.

Syllabus 
Under Nevada law, a first-time offender convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) faces up to six months of incarceration or, in the alternative, 48 hours of community work while identifiably dressed as a DUI offender.  In addition, the offender must pay a fine of up to $1,000, attend an alcohol abuse education course, and lose his license for 90 days.  Penalties increase for repeat offenders.  Petitioners, first-time offenders, were charged with DUI in separate incidents.  The Municipal Court denied each petitioner's demand for a jury trial.  On appeal, the Judicial District Court again denied petitioner Blanton's request, but granted petitioner Fraley's.  The Nevada Supreme Court remanded both cases, concluding that the Federal Constitution does not guarantee a right to a jury trial for a DUI offense.
Held:  There is no Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury for persons charged under Nevada law with DUI.  This Court has long held that petty crimes or offenses are not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision.  The most relevant criterion for determining the seriousness of an offense is the severity of the maximum authorized penalty fixed by the legislature.  Under this approach, when an offense carries a maximum prison term of six months or less, as DUI does under Nevada law, it is presumed to be petty unless the defendant can show that any additional statutory penalties, viewed in conjunction with the maximum authorized period of incarceration, are so severe that they clearly reflect a legislative determination that the offense is a ""serious"" one.  Under this test, it is clear that the Nevada legislature does not view DUI as a serious offense.  It is immaterial that a first-time DUI offender may face a minimum prison term or that some offenders may receive the maximum prison sentence, because even the maximum prison term does not exceed the constitutional demarcation point of six months.  Likewise, the 90-day license suspension is irrelevant if it runs concurrently with the prison term.  The 48 hours of community service in the specified clothing, while a source of embarrassment, is less embarrassing and less onerous than six months in jail.  Also, the $1,000 fine is well below the $5,000 level set by Congress in its most recent definition of a petty

Syllabus 
The District Court of the Virgin Islands' Local Rule 56(b) provides that, before an otherwise qualified attorney is admitted to the Virgin Islands Bar, he must ""allege and prove to the satisfaction"" of the Committee of Bar Examiners that he has ""resided in the Virgin Islands for at least one year immediately preceding his proposed admission,"" and that, ""[i]f admitted to practice, he intends to continue to reside in and to practice law in the Virgin Islands.""  Respondents Thorstenn and DeVos -- who do not reside in the Virgin Islands -- applied to take the Virgin Islands bar examination, but their applications were rejected because they did not satisfy Rule 56(b)'s residency requirements.  They filed suit in the District Court, seeking a declaration that the residency requirements violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV,  2, of the Constitution, and seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the Rule against them.  The court granted summary judgment for petitioners -- the Chairman of the Committee of Bar Examiners and the Virgin Islands Bar Association -- concluding that the reasons offered for the residency requirements, grounded in the unique conditions in the Virgin Islands, were substantial enough to justify the discrimination against nonresidents.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the residency requirements were invalid under Frazier v. Heebe, 482 U. S. 641, in which this Court invoked its supervisory power to invalidate certain residency requirements of the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  In light of this ruling, the Court of Appeals did not address respondents' claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.
Held:
1. The Court will not exercise its supervisory power in this case, since both the nature of the District Court and the reach of its residency requirements implicate interests beyond the federal system.  Although it is vested with the jurisdiction of a federal district court, the District Court of the Virgin Islands also has original jurisdiction over certain matters of local law and concurrent jurisdiction with the local courts over 
Page 489 U. S. 547
 certain criminal matters, and serves as an appellate court for decisions rendered by the local courts.  Moreover, the application of Rule 56(b) itself extends beyond practice in the federal system to practice before the territorial courts.  Pp.  489 U. S. 551-552.
2. Rule 56(b)'s residency requirements violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, since none of the justifications offered in support of the requirements are sufficient to meet petitioners' burden of demonstrating that the discrimination against nonresidents is warranted by a substantial objective and bears a close or substantial relation to such an objective.  Pp.  489 U. S. 552-558.
(a) Petitioners' contention that the geographical isolation of the Virgin Islands, together with irregular airline and telephone service with the mainland, make it difficult for nonresidents to attend court proceedings held with little advance notice, is an insufficient justification.  The Virgin Islands could protect its interests by requiring lawyers who reside at a great distance to retain a local attorney who would be available for unscheduled meetings and hearings.  P.  489 U. S. 554.
(b) The District Court's finding that the delay caused by trying to accommodate the schedules of nonresident attorneys would increase the massive caseload under which that court suffers is an insufficient justification.  Any burden to accommodate nonresidents' travel schedules can be relieved by requiring them to associate with local counsel.  Moreover, a Territory to which the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies may not solve the problem of congested court dockets by discriminating against nonresidents.  Furthermore, the problem of conflicting court appearances is not unique to the Virgin Islands, and the District Court may make appropriate orders for prompt appearances and speedy trials.  Pp.  489 U. S. 554-555
(c) Petitioners' claim that delays in the publication of local law require exclusion of nonresidents because they will be unable to maintain an adequate level of professional competence is unpersuasive.  It can be assumed that a lawyer who anticipates sufficient practice in the Virgin Islands to justify taking the bar examination and paying the annual dues will inform himself of the laws of that Territory.  Moreover, the fact that the most recent local legal materials are not available on a current basis is no more of a problem for nonresidents than residents.  Pp.  489 U. S. 555-556.
(d) The contention that the Virgin Islands Bar Association does not have the resources and personnel for adequate supervision of the ethics of a nationwide bar membership is not a sufficient justification, since increased membership brings increased dues revenue, which presumably will be adequate to pay for any additional administrative burdens.  Moreover, the problems faced by petitioners in monitoring the ethical conduct of nonresidents are no greater than those faced by any mainland State with limited resources.  Pp.  489 U. S. 556-557. 
Page 489 U. S. 548

(e) Petitioners' argument is unavailing that the residency requirements are necessary to a strict and fair application of Local Rule 16, which requires each active bar member to be available to accept appointments to appear on behalf of indigent criminal defendants, and which is interpreted by the District Court to require that only the appointed attorney may appear on behalf of the defendant.  The strong interests in securing representation for indigents can be protected by allowing an appointed nonresident to substitute a colleague if he is unable to attend a particular appearance.  Moreover, in some circumstances it would be detrimental to the goal of competent representation for criminal defendants to require the appointed attorney, whether a resident or nonresident, to appear personally.  Rule 16, in fact, explicitly allows the District Court to substitute one appointed counsel for another where the interests of justice require.  Petitioners' speculation that resident attorneys will be unwilling to enter into arrangements with nonresidents to make additional appearances when nonresidents are unavailable is insufficient to justify discrimination against nonresidents.  If the nonresident fails to make the arrangements necessary to protect the rights of the indigent defendant, the District Court may take appropriate action.  Pp.  489 U. S. 557-558.

(a) Petitioners' contention that the geographical isolation of the Virgin Islands, together with irregular airline and telephone service with the mainland, make it difficult for nonresidents to attend court proceedings held with little advance notice, is an insufficient justification.  The Virgin Islands could protect its interests by requiring lawyers who reside at a great distance to retain a local attorney who would be available for unscheduled meetings and hearings.  P.  489 U. S. 554.
(b) The District Court's finding that the delay caused by trying to accommodate the schedules of nonresident attorneys would increase the massive caseload under which that court suffers is an insufficient justification.  Any burden to accommodate nonresidents' travel schedules can be relieved by requiring them to associate with local counsel.  Moreover, a Territory to which the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies may not solve the problem of congested court dockets by discriminating against nonresidents.  Furthermore, the problem of conflicting court appearances is not unique to the Virgin Islands, and the District Court may make appropriate orders for prompt appearances and speedy trials.  Pp.  489 U. S. 554-555
(c) Petitioners' claim that delays in the publication of local law require exclusion of nonresidents because they will be unable to maintain an adequate level of professional competence is unpersuasive.  It can be assumed that a lawyer who anticipates sufficient practice in the Virgin Islands to justify taking the bar examination and paying the annual dues will inform himself of the laws of that Territory.  Moreover, the fact that the most recent local legal materials are not available on a current basis is no more of a problem for nonresidents than residents.  Pp.  489 U. S. 555-556.
(d) The contention that the Virgin Islands Bar Association does not have the resources and personnel for adequate supervision of the ethics of a nationwide bar membership is not a sufficient justification, since increased membership brings increased dues revenue, which presumably will be adequate to pay for any additional administrative burdens.  Moreover, the problems faced by petitioners in monitoring the ethical conduct of nonresidents are no greater than those faced by any mainland State with limited resources.  Pp.  489 U. S. 556-557. 
Page 489 U. S. 548

(e) Petitioners' argument is unavailing that the residency requirements are necessary to a strict and fair application of Local Rule 16, which requires each active bar member to be available to accept appointments to appear on behalf of indigent criminal defendants, and which is interpreted by the District Court to require that only the appointed attorney may appear on behalf of the defendant.  The strong interests in securing representation for indigents can be protected by allowing an appointed nonresident to substitute a colleague if he is unable to attend a particular appearance.  Moreover, in some circumstances it would be detrimental to the goal of competent representation for criminal defendants to require the appointed attorney, whether a resident or nonresident, to appear personally.  Rule 16, in fact, explicitly allows the District Court to substitute one appointed counsel for another where the interests of justice require.  Petitioners' speculation that resident attorneys will be unwilling to enter into arrangements with nonresidents to make additional appearances when nonresidents are unavailable is insufficient to justify discrimination against nonresidents.  If the nonresident fails to make the arrangements necessary to protect the rights of the indigent defendant, the District Court may take appropriate action.  Pp.  489 U. S. 557-558.

489 U.S. 353

Syllabus 
Articles XIX and XXI of the 1942 Convention Respecting Double Taxation (1942 Convention) between the United States and Canada require the United States, upon request and consistent with United States revenue laws, to obtain and convey information to Canadian authorities to assist them in determining a Canadian taxpayer's income tax liability.  Respondent Canadian citizens and residents maintained accounts in a bank in the United States.  In attempting to ascertain their Canadian income tax liability for certain years, the Canadian Department of National Revenue (Revenue Canada), pursuant to Articles XIX and XXI, requested the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide pertinent bank records.  After the IRS Director of Foreign Operations concluded that the requests fell within the 1942 Convention's scope and that it would be appropriate for the United States to honor them, the IRS served on the bank administrative summonses for the requested information, but, at respondents' request, the bank refused to comply.  Respondents then petitioned the Federal District Court to quash the summonses, contending that, because, under 26 U.S.C.  7602(c), the IRS may not issue a summons to further its investigation of a United States taxpayer when a Justice Department referral for possible criminal prosecution is in effect, and because Revenue Canada's investigation of respondents was ""a criminal investigation, preliminary stage,"" United States law proscribed the use of a summons to obtain information for Canadian authorities regarding respondents' American bank accounts.  This argument was rejected, and the District Court ordered the bank to comply with the summonses.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, before the IRS may honor a request for information under the 1942 Convention, it must determine that Revenue Canada's investigation has not reached a stage analogous to a Justice Department referral by the IRS, and that here the affidavit submitted by the IRS failed to state that such a determination had been made with respect to Revenue Canada's investigation of respondents.
Held:  Neither the 1942 Convention nor domestic legislation requires the IRS to attest that a Canadian tax investigation has not reached a stage analogous to a Justice Department referral by the IRS in order to obtain enforcement of a summons issued pursuant to a request by Canadian authorities under the 1942 Convention.  So long as the IRS satisfies 
Page 489 U. S. 354
 the requirements of good faith set forth in United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48,  379 U. S. 57-58 -- that the investigation be conducted for and relevant to a legitimate purpose, that the information sought not be already in the IRS' possession, and that the statutorily required administrative steps have been followed -- and complies with applicable statutes, it is entitled to enforcement of its summons, whether or not the Canadian tax investigation is directed towards criminal prosecution under Canadian law.  Pp.  489 U. S. 359-370.
(a) Aside from whether the 1942 Convention, in conjunction with 26 U.S.C.  7602(c), narrows the class of legitimate purposes for which the IRS may issue an administrative summons, the IRS' affidavits plainly satisfied the requirements of good faith set forth in United States v. Powell, supra.  Pp.  489 U. S. 359-361.
(b) Section 7602(c) does not, by its terms, apply to the summonses challenged in this case, for its speaks only to investigation into possible violations of United States revenue laws, forbidding the issuance of a summons ""if a Justice Department referral is in effect.""  Therefore,  7602(c) does not itself appear to bar enforcement of the summonses in question.  This conclusion is supported by  7602(c)'s legislative history indicating that Congress did not intend to make enforcement of a treaty summons contingent upon the foreign tax investigation's not having reached a stage analogous to a Justice Department referral.  The concerns that prompted Congress to enact  7602(c) -- particularly that of preventing the IRS from encroaching upon the rights of potential criminal defendants -- are not present when the IRS issues summonses at the request of most foreign governments conducting investigations into possible violations of their own tax laws.  This is especially so where none of the countries, including Canada, with whom the United States has tax treaties providing for exchanges of information employs grand juries, and criminal discovery procedures differ considerably among those countries.  Pp.  489 U. S. 361-365.
(c) Articles XIX and XXI of the 1942 Convention, on their face, do not support respondents' argument that, because the IRS would not be able, under American law, to issue an administrative summons to gather information for use by the Government once a Justice Department referral was in effect, the IRS is not in a position to obtain such information once Canadian authorities have reached a corresponding stage in their investigation.  Those Articles both refer to information that the IRS may obtain under American law, but that law does not contain the restriction respondents claim.  Section 7602(c) only limits the issuance of a summons when a Justice Department referral is in effect, and says nothing about foreign officials' decisions to investigate possible violations of their countries' laws with a view to criminal prosecution outside the United States.  The elements of good faith outlined in United States v. Powell, 
Page 489 U. S. 355
 supra, do not constitute such a restriction, nor does the reasoning in United States v. LaSalle National Bank, 437 U. S. 298, whose principal holding was codified in  7602(c), favor respondents' position, since the provision of information to Canadian authorities could not curtail the rights of potential criminal defendants in this country by undermining American discovery rules or diminishing the grand jury's role.  Moreover, the purpose behind Articles XIX and XXI -- the reduction of tax evasion by allowing signatories to demand information from each other -- counsels against interpreting those provisions to limit inquiry in the manner respondents desire; the Government's regular compliance with Canadian authorities' requests for information without inquiring whether they intend to use the information for criminal prosecution weighs in favor of its reading of Articles XIX and XXI; and the result urged by respondents would contravene Congress' main reason for laying down an easily administrable test in  7602(c).

Syllabus 
Although respondent fell down several times and was incoherent following her arrest by officers of petitioner city's police department, the officers summoned no medical assistance for her.  After her release, she was diagnosed as suffering from several emotional ailments requiring hospitalization and subsequent outpatient treatment.  Some time later, she filed suit seeking, inter alia, to hold the city liable under 42 U.S.C.  1983 for its violation of her right, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to receive necessary medical attention while in police custody.  The jury ruled in her favor on this claim upon the basis of evidence indicating that a city regulation gave shift commanders sole discretion to determine whether a detainee required medical care, and suggesting that commanders were not provided with any special training to make a determination as to when to summon such care for an injured detainee.  Both the District Court, in rejecting the city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the Court of Appeals, in ruling that there had been no error in submitting the ""failure to train"" claim to the jury, held that, under Circuit precedent, a municipality is liable for failure to train its police force where the plaintiff proves that the municipality acted recklessly, intentionally, or with gross negligence, and that the lack of training was so reckless or grossly negligent that deprivation of persons' constitutional rights was substantially certain to result.  However, upon finding that certain aspects of the District Court's jury instructions might have led the jury to believe that it could find against the city on a mere respondeat superior theory, and that the jury's verdict did not state the basis on which it had ruled for respondent, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment in her favor and remanded the case for a new trial.
Held:
1. The writ of certiorari will not be dismissed as improvidently granted on the basis of respondent's claim that petitioner failed to preserve for review the principal issues before this Court.  Since the petition for certiorari directly addressed the critical question here -- the  1983 actionability of a municipality's failure to train -- and since respondent's brief in opposition neither raised the objection that petitioner had failed to press its claims on the courts below nor informed this Court 
Page 489 U. S. 379
 that petitioner had arguably conceded below that inadequate training is actionable, this Court will exercise its discretion to deem these defects waived.  Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808,  471 U. S. 816.  Moreover, even if the asserted failure of petitioner to present the claims it makes here in the same fashion below actually occurred, that failure does not affect this Court's jurisdiction.  Pp.  489 U. S. 383-385.
2. A municipality may, in certain circumstances, be held liable under  1983 for constitutional violations resulting from its failure to train its employees.  Pp.  489 U. S. 385-392.
(a) Petitioner's contention that  1983 liability can be imposed only where the municipal policy in question is itself unconstitutional is rejected, in light of the rule established by the Court in this case that there are limited circumstances in which a ""failure to train"" allegation can be the basis for liability.  Pp.  489 U. S. 386-387.
(b) The inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for  1983 liability only where the failure to train in a relevant respect amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.  In contrast to the Court of Appeals' overly broad rule, this ""deliberate indifference"" standard is most consistent with the rule of Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658,  436 U. S. 694, that a city is not liable under  1983 unless a municipal ""policy"" or ""custom"" is the moving force behind the constitutional violation.  Only where a failure to train reflects a ""deliberate"" or ""conscious"" choice by the municipality can the failure be properly thought of as an actionable city ""policy.""  Monell will not be satisfied by a mere allegation that a training program represents a policy for which the city is responsible.  Rather, the focus must be on whether the program is adequate to the tasks the particular employees must perform, and if it is not, on whether such inadequate training can justifiably be said to represent ""city policy.""  Moreover, the identified deficiency in the training program must be closely related to the ultimate injury.  Thus, respondent must still prove that the deficiency in training actually caused the police officers' indifference to her medical needs.  To adopt lesser standards of fault and causation would open municipalities to unprecedented liability under  1983; would result in de facto respondeat superior liability, a result rejected in Monell; would engage federal courts in an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal employee training programs, a task that they are ill-suited to undertake; and would implicate serious questions of federalism.  Pp.  489 U. S. 388-392.
3. Although the evidence presently in the record does not satisfy the ""deliberate indifference"" rule of liability, the question whether respondent should have an opportunity to prove her case under that rule must be left to the Court of Appeals on remand, since the standard of proof the 
Page 489 U. S. 380
 District Court ultimately imposed on her was a lesser one than the one here adopted.  P.  489 U. S. 392.

Syllabus 
At the start of jury selection for respondent's Florida state court trial for first-degree murder, the trial judge instructed the prospective jurors on their responsibility for the sentence they would recommend, stating that the court, not the jury, was responsible for sentencing, and that the jury had merely an advisory role.  Defense counsel did not object to these instructions.  The jury found respondent guilty and recommended the death sentence, which the trial judge then imposed.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal in which respondent did not allege as error, on either state or federal grounds, the above instructions.  Nor did he so allege in a subsequent unsuccessful motion in state court for postconviction relief or in a later unsuccessful federal habeas corpus petition.  Thereafter, it was held in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, that the prosecutor's remarks that misinformed the jury in a capital case as to the role of appellate review violated the Eighth Amendment.  Based on Caldwell, respondent filed another motion in state court for postconviction relief, challenging for the first time the instructions in question and arguing that they violated the Eighth Amendment by misinforming the jury of its sentencing role under Florida law because the Florida Supreme Court in another case had held that a trial judge could override the jury's recommended sentence only if the facts were ""so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ,"" and that therefore, since the trial judge in this case had told the jurors that the sentencing responsibility was solely his, and failed to tell them that he could override their verdict only under limited circumstances, the judge misled the jury in violation of Caldwell.  On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court refused to address this argument because respondent had failed to raise it on direct appeal.  The Caldwell claim was then raised in respondent's second federal habeas petition, and the District Court held that the claim was procedurally barred.

No. 87-121
Argued November 1, 1988
Decided February 28, 1989
489 U.S. 401

Syllabus 
At the start of jury selection for respondent's Florida state court trial for first-degree murder, the trial judge instructed the prospective jurors on their responsibility for the sentence they would recommend, stating that the court, not the jury, was responsible for sentencing, and that the jury had merely an advisory role.  Defense counsel did not object to these instructions.  The jury found respondent guilty and recommended the death sentence, which the trial judge then imposed.  The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct appeal in which respondent did not allege as error, on either state or federal grounds, the above instructions.  Nor did he so allege in a subsequent unsuccessful motion in state court for postconviction relief or in a later unsuccessful federal habeas corpus petition.  Thereafter, it was held in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, that the prosecutor's remarks that misinformed the jury in a capital case as to the role of appellate review violated the Eighth Amendment.  Based on Caldwell, respondent filed another motion in state court for postconviction relief, challenging for the first time the instructions in question and arguing that they violated the Eighth Amendment by misinforming the jury of its sentencing role under Florida law because the Florida Supreme Court in another case had held that a trial judge could override the jury's recommended sentence only if the facts were ""so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ,"" and that therefore, since the trial judge in this case had told the jurors that the sentencing responsibility was solely his, and failed to tell them that he could override their verdict only under limited circumstances, the judge misled the jury in violation of Caldwell.  On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court refused to address this argument because respondent had failed to raise it on direct appeal.  The Caldwell claim was then raised in respondent's second federal habeas petition, and the District Court held that the claim was procedurally barred.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the claim was so novel at the time of respondent's trial, sentencing, and appeal that its legal basis was not reasonably available, and that therefore he had established cause for his procedural default.  The court then proceeded to hold that the instructions in question violated the Eighth Amendment.

No. 87-548
Argued November 7, 1988
Decided February 28, 1989
489 U.S. 426

Syllabus 
Although petitioner airline (TWA) and respondent flight attendants' union (IFFA) pursued all the required dispute resolution mechanisms of the Railway Labor Act (RLA), their negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement were unsuccessful.  The parties bargained over wages and working conditions, but not over the existing agreement's seniority system, which ensured that the most senior qualified attendant who bid on a vacant job assignment, flight schedule, or base of operation (domicile) would obtain it, and would be least affected by periodic furloughs.  During the IFFA's subsequent strike, TWA continued operations by hiring permanent replacements for strikers, by continuing to employ attendants who chose not to strike, and by rehiring strikers who abandoned the strike, and filled strike-created vacancies by application of the existing seniority bidding system to all working attendants.  After the strike ended, and pursuant to its preannounced policy, TWA refused to displace permanent replacements or junior nonstriking attendants (""crossover"" employees) with senior full-term strikers, many of whom were therefore left without an opportunity to return to work.  Although a post-strike arbitral agreement guaranteed that all reinstated full-term strikers would be returned to work as vacancies arose and with precisely the seniority they would have had if no strike had occurred, the IFFA filed the instant action contending that, even assuming the strike was economic, the full-term strikers were entitled to displace the newly hired replacements and the less senior crossover attendants either under the terms of the prestrike collective bargaining agreement or under the RLA itself.  The District Court denied relief for the most part, but the Court of Appeals, relying on its reading of the pre-strike agreement and on judicial interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), reversed the lower court's ruling that the more senior full-term strikers could not displace junior crossovers.
Held:  An employer is not required by the RLA to lay off junior crossover employees in order to reinstate more senior full-term strikers at the conclusion of a strike.  Pp.  489 U. S. 432-443.
(a) Nothing in the federal common labor law developed under the NLRA, which may provide guiding precedent in RLA cases, indicates that TWA's crossover policy is unlawful.  In fact, under NLRB v. 
Page 489 U. S. 427
 Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., 304 U. S. 333, and its progeny, it is not an unfair labor practice under the NLRA for an employer to refuse to discharge replacement employees in order to make room for strikers at the end of an economic strike.  The IFFA's argument that the Mackay Radio rule is inapplicable to junior crossovers, because those workers must be treated differently than newly hired permanent replacements (who, the union concedes, need not be displaced) is rejected, since full-term strikers at TWA, once reinstated, have lost no seniority either in absolute or relative terms, and will be able to displace junior flight attendants -- whether new hires, crossovers, or full-term strikers -- with regard to future reductions in force, vacancies in desirable assignments or domiciles, or periodic bids on job scheduling, and since any ""cleavage"" between junior crossovers and reinstated full-term strikers is merely the inevitable effect of TWA's lawful use of the economic weapons available to it during a period of self-help.  NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U. S. 221, distinguished.  To differentiate between crossovers and new hires in the manner the IFFA proposes would have the effect of penalizing those who exercised their right not to strike, which is protected both by the RLA and the NLRA, in order to benefit those who did strike, a result that is not required by the NLRA.  Pp.  489 U. S. 432-439.
(b) TWA's crossover policy is not forbidden by the RLA itself, which, in fact, provides greater avenues of self-help to parties that have exhausted the statute's extensive dispute resolution mechanisms than would be available under the NLRA.  Section 2 Fourth of the RLA -- which prohibits carriers from ""influenc[ing] or coerc[ing] employees . . . not to join . . . any labor organization"" -- does not prohibit the policy, since that section is addressed primarily to the precertification rights of unorganized employees to organize and choose their representatives, with the intent of protecting the dispute-resolution procedures' effectiveness by assuring that the employees' putative representative is not subject to employer control, and that neither party will be able to enlist the courts to further its own partisan ends.  Where, as here, the parties have exhausted those procedures and have reached an impasse, they are free, without threat of judicial involvement, to turn to any peaceful, self-help measures that do not strike a fundamental blow to union or employer activity and the collective bargaining process itself.  Moreover, as the IFFA concedes, nothing in the collective bargaining agreement or any post-strike agreement prohibits TWA's crossover policy.  Pp.  489 U. S. 439-442.
(c) TWA's decision to guarantee to crossovers the same protections lawfully applied to new hires was a decision to apply the preexisting seniority terms of the collective bargaining agreement uniformly to all employees.  That this decision had the effect of encouraging pre-strike

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting.

Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 
 Even if I did not hold these views, however, I would still grant this petition. Petitioner's argument here is that evidence was admitted at the penalty phase of his trial in violation of Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496 (1987), where we held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a capital sentencing jury from considering victim impact statement evidence. This argument is hardly frivolous. [ Farmer v. Sumner 489 U.S. 1060 (1989) ][1060-Continued.] 
The prosecutor at petitioner's trial described at some length the devastating emotional impact upon the mother of the man petitioner killed. He told the jury, among other things, that petitioner ""shattered some other lives psychologically""; that the victim's mother has ""repeated nightmares, crying, and I can see the crying for myself. Extremely emotionally traumatic""; and that petitioner ""[n]ever thought about the victims. Never gave the families of the victims, a thought."" The Nevada Supreme Court, however, refused to consider the merits of this Booth claim . It held that petitioner's claim was barred because he had not raised it below, and because this Court has given no indication that Booth operates retroactively. 
 I am unpersuaded by these arguments. The fact that petitioner did not raise a Booth claim below rather obviously reflects the fact that Booth had not been handed down at the time. Petitioner should not be penalized for not being prescient. As for the Nevada court's second ground for rejecting petitioner's appeal, I believe that the issue whether Booth should have retroactive operation very much warrants this Court's attention. The abusive use by the prosecutor in this case of references to victim impact-information we held in Booth to be thoroughly irrelevant in capital sentencing proceedings, see 482 U.S., at 502-509-2536-provides a graphic illustration of the harm done by decisions, like the one below, allowing Booth to be applied only prospectively.

Syllabus 
Petitioner is a child who was subjected to a series of beatings by his father, with whom he lived.  Respondents, a county department of social services and several of its social workers, received complaints that petitioner was being abused by his father, and took various steps to protect him; they did not, however, act to remove petitioner from his father's custody.  Petitioner's father finally beat him so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage, and was rendered profoundly retarded.  Petitioner and his mother sued respondents under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that respondents had deprived petitioner of his liberty interest in bodily integrity, in violation of his rights under the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, by failing to intervene to protect him against his father's violence.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondents' failure to provide petitioner with adequate protection against his father's violence did not violate his rights under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.  Pp.  489 U. S. 194-203.
(a) A State's failure to protect an individual against private violence generally does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause, because the Clause imposes no duty on the State to provide members of the general public with adequate protective services.  The Clause is phrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security; while it forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, and property without due process of law, its language cannot fairly be read to impose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means.  Pp.  489 U. S. 194-197.
(b) There is no merit to petitioner's contention that the State's knowledge of his danger and expressions of willingness to protect him against that danger established a ""special relationship"" giving rise to an affirmative constitutional duty to protect.  While certain ""special relationships"" created or assumed by the State with respect to particular individuals may give rise to an affirmative duty, enforceable through the Due Process 
Page 489 U. S. 190
 Clause, to provide adequate protection, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97; Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, the affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitations which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf, through imprisonment, institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty.  No such duty existed here, for the harms petitioner suffered did not occur while the State was holding him in its custody, but while he was in the custody of his natural father, who was in no sense a state actor.  While the State may have been aware of the dangers that he faced, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him more vulnerable to them.  Under these circumstances, the Due Process Clause did not impose upon the State an affirmative duty to provide petitioner with adequate protection.  Pp.  489 U. S. 197-201.
(c) It may well be that, by voluntarily undertaking to provide petitioner with protection against a danger it played no part in creating, the State acquired a duty under state tort law to provide him with adequate protection against that danger.

Other Code sections dictate the organization and composition of parties' governing bodies, limit the term of office for a party's state central committee chair, and require that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern California.  Various party governing bodies, members of such bodies, and other politically active groups and individuals brought suit in the District Court, claiming, inter alia, that these Code provisions deprived parties and their members of the rights of free speech and free association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs as to the provisions in question, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The challenged California election laws are invalid, since they burden the First Amendment rights of political parties and their members without serving a compelling state interest.  Pp.  489 U. S. 222-233.
(a) The ban on primary endorsements in  11702 and 29430 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  By preventing a party's governing body from stating whether a candidate adheres to the party's tenets or whether party officials believe that the candidate is qualified for the position sought, the ban directly hampers the party's ability to spread its message and hamstrings voters seeking to inform themselves about the candidates and issues, and thereby burdens the core right to free political speech of the party and its members.  The ban also infringes a party's protected freedom of association rights to identify the people who constitute the association and to select a standard-bearer who best represents the party's ideology and preferences, by preventing the party from promoting candidates at the crucial primary election juncture.  Moreover, the ban does not serve a compelling governmental interest.  The State has not adequately explained how the ban advances its claimed interest in a stable political system or what makes California so peculiar that it is virtually the only State to determine that such a ban 
Page 489 U. S. 215
 is necessary.  The explanation that the State's compelling interest in stable government embraces a similar interest in party stability is untenable, since a State may enact laws to prevent disruption of political parties from without, but not from within.  The claim that a party that issues primary endorsements risks intraparty friction which may endanger its general election prospects is insufficient, since the goal of protecting the party against itself would not justify a State's substituting its judgment for that of the party.  The State's claim that the ban is necessary to protect primary voters from confusion and undue influence must be viewed with skepticism, since the ban restricts the flow of information to the citizenry without any evidence of the existence of fraud or corruption that would justify such a restriction.  Pp.  489 U. S. 222-229.
(b) The restrictions on the organization and composition of the official governing bodies of political parties, the limits on the term of office for state central committee chairs, and the requirement that such chairs rotate between residents of northern and southern California cannot be upheld.  These laws directly burden the associational rights of a party and its members by limiting the party's discretion in how to organize itself, conduct its affairs, and select its leaders.  Moreover, the laws do not serve a compelling state interest.  A State cannot justify regulating a party's internal affairs without showing that such regulation is necessary to ensure that elections are orderly, fair, and honest, and California has made no such showing.  The State's claim that it has a compelling interest in the democratic management of internal party affairs is without merit, since this is not a case where intervention is necessary to prevent the derogation of party adherents' civil rights, and since the State has no interest in protecting the party's integrity against the party itself.  Nor are the restrictions justified by the State's claim that limiting the term of the state central committee chair and requiring that the chair rotate between northern and southern California help to prevent regional friction from reaching a critical mass, since a State cannot substitute its judgment for that of the party as to the desirability of a particular party structure.

Syllabus 
After respondent filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 (Code), the Government filed proof of a prepetition claim for unpaid withholding and social security taxes, penalties, and prepetition interest.  The claim was perfected through a tax lien on property owned by respondent.  Respondent's ensuing reorganization plan provided for full payment of the claim, but did not provide for post-petition interest.  The Government objected, contending that  506(b) of the Code -- which allows the holder of an oversecured claim to recover, in addition to the prepetition amount of the claim, ""interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose"" -- allowed recovery of post-petition interest, since the property securing its claim had a value greater than the amount of the principal debt.  The Bankruptcy Court overruled this objection, but the District Court reversed.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, holding that  506(b) codified the pre-Code standard that allowed post-petition interest on an oversecured claim only where the lien on the claim was consensual in nature.
Held:  Section 506(b) entitles a creditor to receive post-petition interest on a nonconsensual oversecured claim allowed in a bankruptcy proceeding.  Pp.  489 U. S. 238-249.
(a) The natural reading of the phrase in  506(b) that
""there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose""
entitles the holder of an oversecured claim to post-petition interest and, in addition, the holder of a secured claim pursuant to an agreement the right to the specified fees, costs, and charges.  Recovery of post-petition interest is unqualified, whereas recovery of those fees, costs, and charges is allowed only if they are reasonable and provided for in the agreement under which the claim arose.  Therefore, in the absence of an agreement, post-petition interest is the only added recovery available.  This reading of  506(b) is also mandated by its grammatical structure.  Since the phrase ""interest on such claim"" is set aside by commas, and separated from the reference to fees, costs, and charges by the conjunctive words ""and any,"" that phrase stands independent of the language that follows.  Pp.  489 U. S. 241-242. 
Page 489 U. S. 236

(b) Allowing post-petition interest on nonconsensual oversecured liens does not contravene the intent of the Code's framers, nor does it conflict with any other section of the Code or any important state or federal interest.  The legislative history does not suggest a contrary view.  Pp.  489 U. S. 242-243.
(c) There is no significant reason why Congress would have intended, or any policy reason would compel, that consensual and nonconsensual liens be treated differently in allowing post-petition interest.  Section 506(b)'s language clearly directs that post-petition interest be paid on all oversecured claims.  Midlantic National Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S. 494, and Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 243-246.
(d) The pre-Code practice of denying post-petition interest to holders of nonconsensual liens, while allowing it to holders of consensual liens, was an exception to the exception for oversecured claims from the rule that the running of interest ceased when a bankruptcy petition was filed, and was recognized by only a few courts and often depended on particular circumstances.  The fact that this Court has never clearly acknowledged or relied upon the refusal of some Courts of Appeals to apply the oversecured claim exception to an oversecured federal tax claim counsels against concluding that such limitation was well recognized.  Also arguing against considering this limitation a clear rule are the facts that all cases that limited the exception were tax-lien cases, that the ""rule"" has never been extended to other forms of nonconsensual liens, and that, in the few cases where it was recognized, it was only a guide to the bankruptcy trustee's exercise of his powers in the particular circumstances of the case.

Syllabus 
Petitioner's state court murder conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Court of Illinois on direct appeal, where petitioner challenged only the sufficiency of the evidence.  The trial court then dismissed his petition for postconviction relief -- which alleged ineffective assistance by his trial counsel in several respects, including the failure to call alibi witnesses -- and the Appellate Court again affirmed.  Although referring to the ""well-settled"" Illinois principle that issues that could have been, but were not, presented on direct appeal are considered waived, and finding that, ""except for the alibi witnesses,"" petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim ""could have been raised [on] direct appeal,"" the court nevertheless went on to consider and reject that claim on its merits.  Petitioner then pursued the claim by filing a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court under 28 U.S.C.  2254.  While recognizing that, absent a showing either of ""cause and prejudice"" or a ""miscarriage of justice,"" Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, would have barred its consideration of the claim had the State Appellate Court held the claim waived under state law, the federal court determined that there had been no waiver holding, and went on to consider the claim in its entirety, and to dismiss it on its merits.  In affirming the dismissal, the Court of Appeals ruled that it was precluded from reviewing the claim's merits because it believed the claim to be procedurally barred.  Finding the State Appellate Court's order to be ""ambiguous"" on the waiver question, the court nevertheless concluded that it was bound by the order's ""suggest[ed]"" intention ""to find all grounds waived except that pertaining to the alibi witnesses.""
Held:
1. The ""plain statement' rule"" of Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1042, and n. 7, is not limited to cases on direct review in this Court, but extends as well to cases on federal habeas review.  Pp.  489 U. S. 260-265.
(a) Sykes' procedural default rule is based on this Court's longstanding ""adequate and independent state ground"" doctrine, whereby the Court will not consider a federal law issue on direct review from a state court judgment if that judgment rests on a state law ground that is both ""independent"" of the federal claim's merits and an ""adequate"" basis for the court's decision.  The Long rule avoids the difficulties that arise 
Page 489 U. S. 256
 under the doctrine when the state court's reference to state law is ambiguous, by permitting the Court to reach the federal question on direct review unless the state court's opinion contains ""a plain statement"" that its decision rests upon adequate and independent state grounds, whether substantive or procedural.  Pp.  489 U. S. 260-262.
(b) Since, as Sykes made clear, the adequate and independent state ground doctrine applies on federal habeas, and since federal courts on habeas review commonly face the same problem of ambiguity that was resolved by Long, the ""plain statement"" rule is adopted for habeas cases.  Thus, a procedural default will not bar consideration of a federal claim on habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.  Pp.  489 U. S. 262-263.
(c) Respondents' claim is not persuasive that the federal court in a habeas case should presume that the state court judgment rests on a procedural bar whenever the state court decision is ambiguous on that point.  Applying the Long rule to habeas barely burdens the interests of finality, federalism, and comity, since the state court remains free under the rule to foreclose federal habeas review to the extent permitted by Sykes simply by explicitly relying on a state law procedural default.  Conversely, respondents' proposed rule would impose substantial burdens on the federal courts, which would lose much time in reviewing legal and factual issues that the state court, familiar with state law and the record before it, is better suited to address expeditiously.  Pp.  489 U. S. 263-265.
2. The State Appellate Court's statement that most of petitioner's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel allegations ""could have been raised [on] direct appeal"" does not satisfy the ""plain statement"" requirement, since it falls short of an explicit reliance on state law waiver as a ground for rejecting any aspect of petitioner's claim.  Accordingly, the statement does not preclude habeas review by the District Court.  P.  489 U. S. 266.

489 U.S. 288

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a black man, was convicted in an Illinois state court of attempted murder and other offenses by an all-white jury.  During jury selection, the prosecutor used all 10 of his peremptory challenges to exclude blacks.  Petitioner twice unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, arguing that he was ""entitled to a jury of his peers.""  The prosecutor defended the challenges by stating that he was trying to achieve a balance of men and women on the jury.  After an unsuccessful state court appeal, in which he argued that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges denied him the right to be tried by a jury that was representative of the community, petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, repeating his fair cross-section claim.  He further argued that the opinions of several Justices concurring in and dissenting from the denial of certiorari in McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. 961, had invited a reexamination of Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, as to what a defendant must show to establish a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to a peremptory challenge system.  He also argued, for the first time, that, under Swain, a prosecutor could be questioned about his use of peremptory challenges once he volunteered an explanation.  The District Court held that it was bound by Swain and Circuit precedent, and denied relief.  A panel of the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement that applied to a jury venire also applied to a petit jury, and held that he had made out a prima facie case of discrimination.  But the Court of Appeals voted to rehear the case en banc, and postponed rehearing until after this Court's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79.  Ultimately, Batson was decided, and overruled that portion of Swain setting forth the evidentiary showing necessary to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to a peremptory challenge system.  Batson held that a defendant can establish such a case by showing that he is a ""member of a cognizable racial group,"" that the prosecutor exercised ""peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race,"" and that these
""facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to 
Page 489 U. S. 289
 exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.""
476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 96.  The Court of Appeals then held that petitioner could not benefit from the Batson rule because, in the meantime, Allen v. Hardy, 478 U. S. 255, had held that Batson could not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.  The Court of Appeals also held that petitioner's Swain claim was procedurally barred and, in any event, meritless, and that the fair cross-section requirement was limited to the jury venire.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
820 F.2d 832, affirmed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that:
1. Allen v. Hardy prevented petitioner from benefiting from the rule announced in Batson, since his conviction became final before Batson was decided.  The opinions filed in McCray -- which involved the question whether the Constitution prohibits the use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of a particular group from the jury, based on the prosecutor's assumption that they would be biased in favor of other members of the same group -- did not destroy Swain's precedential effect, as petitioner urges they did, since a denial of certiorari imports no expression of opinion on the merits of the case, and, concomitantly, opinions accompanying such denial cannot have the same effect as decisions on the merits.  Pp.  489 U. S. 294-296.
2. Petitioner is procedurally barred from raising the claim that he has established a violation of the Equal Protection Clause under Swain, and that Swain did not preclude an examination of the prosecutor's stated reasons for his peremptory challenges to determine the legitimacy of his motive.  Since petitioner did not raise the Swain claim at trial or on direct appeal, he forfeited review of the claim in collateral proceedings in the state courts.  Under Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, he is barred from raising the claim in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, since he made no attempt to show cause for his default and the Illinois Appellate Court, contrary to his contention, did not address the Swain claim.  Pp.  489 U. S. 297-299.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Parts IV and V that a decision extending to the petit jury the Sixth Amendment requirement that the jury venire be drawn from a fair cross-section of the community would not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review, and therefore petitioner's fair cross-section claim will not be addressed.  Pp.  489 U. S. 299-316.
(a) Retroactivity is properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is applied to the defendant 
Page 489 U. S. 290
 in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.  Thus, before deciding whether the fair cross-section requirement should be extended to the petit jury, it should be determined whether such a rule would be applied retroactively to the case at issue.  Pp.  489 U. S. 299-305.
(b) Justice Harlan's view that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure generally should not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review is the appropriate approach.  Unless they fall within one of Justice Harlan's suggested exceptions to this general rule -- that a new rule should be applied retroactively (1) if it places ""certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe,"" Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,  401 U. S. 692, or (2) if it requires the observance of ""those procedures that . . . are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,'"" id. at  401 U. S. 693 -- such new rules will not be applicable to those cases that have become final before the new rules were announced.  Pp.  489 U. S. 305-310.
(c) Since petitioner's conviction became final six years ago, the rule he urges would not be applicable to this case, which is on collateral review, unless it falls within one of the above exceptions.  The first exception is not relevant here, since application of the fair cross-section requirement to the petit jury would not accord constitutional protection to any primary activity.  The second exception should be limited in scope to those new procedures without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.  An examination of the decision in Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, applying the fair cross-section requirement to the jury venire, leads inexorably to the conclusion that adoption of the rule petitioner urges would be a far cry from the kind of absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.""  Because the absence of a fair cross-section on the jury venire does not undermine the fundamental fairness that must underlie a conviction or seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction, a rule requiring that petit juries be composed of a fair cross-section of the community would not be a ""bedrock procedural element"" that would be retroactively applied under the second exception.  Pp.  489 U. S. 311-315.
(d) Were the new rule urged by petitioner recognized, petitioner would have to be given the benefit of that rule even though it would not be applied retroactively to others similarly situated.  A new rule will not be announced in a given case unless it would be applied retroactively to the defendant in that case and to all others similarly situated.  This not only eliminates any problems of rendering advisory opinions, it also avoids the inequity resulting from an uneven application of new rules to similarly situated defendants.  Implicit in the above retroactivity approach is the principle that habeas corpus cannot be used as a vehicle to 
Page 489 U. S. 291
 create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants on collateral review through one of the two articulated exceptions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 315-316.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that the result as to nonretroactivity of the fair cross-section rule urged by petitioner is an acceptable application in collateral proceedings of the theories embraced in United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537, Shea v. Louisiana, 470 U. S. 51, and Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, as to retroactivity of new constitutional rules of criminal procedure to all cases pending on direct review.  Pp.  489 U. S. 316-317.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN concurred in the result insofar as petitioner's claim based on Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, was concerned.  P.  489 U. S. 318.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded in Part I, joined by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, that petitioner had alleged a Sixth Amendment violation and that the Court should decide the question in his favor.  Nonetheless, petitioner's conviction should not be set aside for, as a matter of stare decisis, the Court's opinion in Allen v. Hardy, 478 U. S. 255, controls disposition of this retroactivity question.  In general, the Court should adopt Justice Harlan's analysis of retroactivity for habeas corpus cases as well as for cases still on direct review, but without the plurality's ""modification"" of his fundamental fairness exception.  JUSTICE STEVENS concluded in Part II that, since petitioner's claim under Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, that the prosecutor violated the Equal Protection Clause by using peremptory challenges to exclude black persons from the jury was never presented to the state courts, it should be treated as an unexhausted claim that is not ripe for review on federal habeas corpus until those courts have spoken.  Pp.  489 U. S. 318-326.

No. 87-5259
Argued October 4, 1988
Decided February 22, 1989
489 U.S. 288

Syllabus 
Petitioner, a black man, was convicted in an Illinois state court of attempted murder and other offenses by an all-white jury.  During jury selection, the prosecutor used all 10 of his peremptory challenges to exclude blacks.  Petitioner twice unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, arguing that he was ""entitled to a jury of his peers.""  The prosecutor defended the challenges by stating that he was trying to achieve a balance of men and women on the jury.  After an unsuccessful state court appeal, in which he argued that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges denied him the right to be tried by a jury that was representative of the community, petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, repeating his fair cross-section claim.  He further argued that the opinions of several Justices concurring in and dissenting from the denial of certiorari in McCray v. New York, 461 U.S. 961, had invited a reexamination of Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, as to what a defendant must show to establish a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to a peremptory challenge system.  He also argued, for the first time, that, under Swain, a prosecutor could be questioned about his use of peremptory challenges once he volunteered an explanation.  The District Court held that it was bound by Swain and Circuit precedent, and denied relief.  A panel of the Court of Appeals agreed with petitioner that the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement that applied to a jury venire also applied to a petit jury, and held that he had made out a prima facie case of discrimination.  But the Court of Appeals voted to rehear the case en banc, and postponed rehearing until after this Court's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79.  Ultimately, Batson was decided, and overruled that portion of Swain setting forth the evidentiary showing necessary to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to a peremptory challenge system.  Batson held that a defendant can establish such a case by showing that he is a ""member of a cognizable racial group,"" that the prosecutor exercised ""peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race,"" and that these
""facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to

Syllabus 
Following the Pennsylvania Superior Court's affirmance, on direct appeal, of respondent's conviction of assault, robbery, and related crimes, he filed with the State Supreme Court successive unsuccessful petitions for allocatur, which, under state law, can be granted in the court's discretion ""only when there are special and important reasons therefor.""  Respondent next filed a petition for federal habeas relief, raising various federal claims, some of which had been raised before the state courts only in one or the other of respondent's unsuccessful petitions for allocatur.  The Federal District Court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Without considering whether respondent could obtain state collateral review of his claims, the court held that their inclusion in the allocatur petitions sufficiently exhausted state remedies, since the State's highest court had thereby been given an opportunity to correct the alleged constitutional infirmities in respondent's conviction.
Held:
1. Title 28 U.S.C.  2254(c) provides that a state law judgment cannot be reviewed on federal habeas if the petitioner has a state law right ""to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.""  This bar does not apply where the petitioner has already made a ""fair presentation"" of the particular claim to the state courts and has exhausted his direct appeals, since, in such a situation, it can reasonably be assumed that, even if further state procedures are available, resort to them would be useless.

No. 87-1245
Argued November 1, 1988
Decided February 21, 1989
489 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Between October, 1984, and October, 1987, a Texas statute exempted from sales and use taxes
""[p]eriodicals . . . published or distributed by a religious faith . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings promulgating the teachings of the faith and books . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings sacred to a religious faith.""
In 1985, appellant, the publisher of a general interest magazine that was not entitled to the exemption, paid under protest sales taxes on the price of its qualifying subscription sales and sued to recover those payments in state court.  Ruling that the exclusive exemption for religious periodicals promoted religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, and declaring itself ""without power to rewrite the statute to make religious periodicals subject to tax,"" the court struck down the tax as applied to nonreligious periodicals and ordered the State to refund the tax paid by appellant, plus interest.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the exemption satisfied the tripartite test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612-613, in that it (1) served the secular purpose of preserving separation between church and state; (2) did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion; and (3) did not produce impermissible government entanglement with religion. 
Page 489 U. S. 2

Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
731 S.W.2d 160, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. Appellant has standing to challenge the exemption.  The State's contention that appellant cannot show that it has suffered or is threatened with redressable injury is misguided, since it would effectively and impermissibly insulate an under-inclusive statute from constitutional challenge.  There is no merit to the State's argument that appellant could not obtain a tax refund if this Court were to declare the exemption invalid, since the proper course under state law would be to remove the exemption, rather than to extend it to nonreligious periodicals or strike down the tax in its entirety.  It is not for this Court to decide upon the correct response as a matter of state law to a finding of unconstitutionality.  Moreover, the claim that appellant cannot qualify for injunctive relief because its subscription sales are no longer taxed under a 1987 amendment to the tax statute is irrelevant, since a live controversy persists over appellant's right to a refund, plus interest, and the State cannot strip appellant of standing by changing the law after taking its money.  Pp.  489 U. S. 7-8.
2. The exemption lacks sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.  The fact that a subsidy incidentally benefits religious groups does not deprive it of the secular purpose and effect mandated by the Clause, so long as it is conferred on a wide array of nonsectarian groups as well as religious organizations in pursuit of some legitimate secular end.  However, when, as here, government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and that either burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to the free exercise of religion, it cannot be viewed as anything but impermissible state sponsorship of religion, particularly where the subsidy is targeted at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.  Because it confines itself exclusively to such religious publications, the Texas exemption lacks a secular objective that would justify its preference along with similar benefits for nonreligious publications or groups.  Nevertheless, Texas is free to widen the exemption, so long as the class of exempt organizations is sufficiently expansive to be consonant with some legitimate secular purpose.  Pp.  489 U. S. 8-18.
3. Neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause prevents Texas from withdrawing its current exemption for religious publications if it chooses not to expand it to promote some legitimate secular aim.  Pp.  489 U. S. 17-25. 
Page 489 U. S. 3

(a) The State cannot claim persuasively that its exemption is compelled by the Free Exercise Clause in even a single instance, let alone in every case, since it has adduced no evidence that the payment of a sales tax by subscribers to religious periodicals or purchasers of religious books would offend their religious beliefs or inhibit religious activity.  Moreover, even if members of some religious group succeeded in demonstrating that payment of a sales tax -- or, less plausibly, of a sales tax which applied to printed matter -- would violate their religious tenets, it is by no means obvious that the State would be required by the Clause to make individualized exceptions for them, since a limitation on religious liberty may be justified by showing that it is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.  There has been no suggestion that members of any major religious denomination -- the principal beneficiaries of the exemption -- could demonstrate an infringement of their free exercise rights sufficiently serious to overcome the State's countervailing interest in collecting its sales tax.  Pp.  489 U. S. 17-20.
(b) The Establishment Clause does not mandate the exemption, since, by requiring that public officials determine whether some message or activity is consistent with ""the teachings of the faith,"" the exemption appears, on its face, to produce greater state entanglement with religion than would the denial of an exemption.  Although compliance with government regulations by religious organizations and the monitoring of that compliance by government agencies would itself enmesh the operation of church and state to some degree, such compliance would generally not impede the evangelical activities of religious groups.  Moreover, the routine and factual inquiries commonly associated with the enforcement of tax laws bear no resemblance to the kind of government surveillance this Court has previously held to pose an intolerable risk of entanglement.  Pp.  489 U. S. 20-21.
(c) Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, and Follett v. McCormick, 321 U. S. 573, do not bar Texas' imposing a general sales tax on religious publications.  To the extent that Murdock and Follett held that a flat license or occupation tax designed for commercial salesmen cannot constitutionally be imposed on religious missionaries whose principal work is preaching and who only occasionally sell religious tracts for small sums, where that activity is deemed central to the particular faith and where the tax burden is far from negligible, those decisions are plainly consistent with the present decision.  Texas' sales tax is neither an occupation tax levied on missionaries nor a flat tax that restrains in advance the free exercise of religion; poses little danger of stamping out missionary work involving the sale of religious publications because it is equal to a small fraction of the value of each sale and is payable by the buyer; and can hardly be viewed as a covert attempt to curtail religious activity in 
Page 489 U. S. 4
 view of its generality.  However, to the extent that unnecessarily broad language in Murdock and Follett might be read to suggest that the sale of religious or other publications may never be taxed, those dicta must be rejected.  This Court's subsequent decisions make clear that even if the denial of tax benefits will inevitably have a substantial impact on religious groups, the refusal to grant such benefits does not offend the Free Exercise Clause when it does not prevent those groups from observing their religious tenets.  In the common circumstances exemplified by this case, taxes or regulations would not subject religious organizations to undue burdens, and the government has a far weightier interest in their uniform application.  Pp.  489 U. S. 21-25.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, is directly applicable here and is the proper basis for reversing the judgment below, since the Texas law at issue violates the Press Clause of the First Amendment by taxing appellant while exempting other publishers solely on the basis of the religious content of their publications.  Pp.  489 U. S. 25-26.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concluded that the extent to which the Free Exercise Clause requires a tax exemption for the sale of religious literature by a religious organization need not be decided here, since the case should be resolved on the narrow ground that an exemption such as the one at issue that is limited to religious organizations' sales of their religious literature violates the Establishment Clause.  Regardless of whether Follett v. McCormick, 321 U. S. 573, and Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, prohibit taxing the sale of religious literature, the Texas statute engages in a preferential support for the communication of religious messages that offends the most basic understanding of what the Establishment Clause is all about.  Pp.  489 U. S. 28-29.

			"|"Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock
No. 87-1245
Argued November 1, 1988
Decided February 21, 1989
489 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Between October, 1984, and October, 1987, a Texas statute exempted from sales and use taxes
""[p]eriodicals . . . published or distributed by a religious faith . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings promulgating the teachings of the faith and books . . . consist[ing] wholly of writings sacred to a religious faith.""
In 1985, appellant, the publisher of a general interest magazine that was not entitled to the exemption, paid under protest sales taxes on the price of its qualifying subscription sales and sued to recover those payments in state court.  Ruling that the exclusive exemption for religious periodicals promoted religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, and declaring itself ""without power to rewrite the statute to make religious periodicals subject to tax,"" the court struck down the tax as applied to nonreligious periodicals and ordered the State to refund the tax paid by appellant, plus interest.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the exemption satisfied the tripartite test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612-613, in that it (1) served the secular purpose of preserving separation between church and state; (2) did not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion; and (3) did not produce impermissible government entanglement with religion. 
Page 489 U. S. 2

Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
731 S.W.2d 160, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded:
1. Appellant has standing to challenge the exemption.  The State's contention that appellant cannot show that it has suffered or is threatened with redressable injury is misguided, since it would effectively and impermissibly insulate an under-inclusive statute from constitutional challenge.  There is no merit to the State's argument that appellant could not obtain a tax refund if this Court were to declare the exemption invalid, since the proper course under state law would be to remove the exemption, rather than to extend it to nonreligious periodicals or strike down the tax in its entirety.  It is not for this Court to decide upon the correct response as a matter of state law to a finding of unconstitutionality.  Moreover, the claim that appellant cannot qualify for injunctive relief because its subscription sales are no longer taxed under a 1987 amendment to the tax statute is irrelevant, since a live controversy persists over appellant's right to a refund, plus interest, and the State cannot strip appellant of standing by changing the law after taking its money.  Pp.  489 U. S. 7-8.
2. The exemption lacks sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.  The fact that a subsidy incidentally benefits religious groups does not deprive it of the secular purpose and effect mandated by the Clause, so long as it is conferred on a wide array of nonsectarian groups as well as religious organizations in pursuit of some legitimate secular end.  However, when, as here, government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and that either burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to the free exercise of religion, it cannot be viewed as anything but impermissible state sponsorship of religion, particularly where the subsidy is targeted at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.  Because it confines itself exclusively to such religious publications, the Texas exemption lacks a secular objective that would justify its preference along with similar benefits for nonreligious publications or groups.  Nevertheless, Texas is free to widen the exemption, so long as the class of exempt organizations is sufficiently expansive to be consonant with some legitimate secular purpose.  Pp.  489 U. S. 8-18.
3. Neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause prevents Texas from withdrawing its current exemption for religious publications if it chooses not to expand it to promote some legitimate secular aim.  Pp.  489 U. S. 17-25. 
Page 489 U. S. 3

(a) The State cannot claim persuasively that its exemption is compelled by the Free Exercise Clause in even a single instance, let alone in every case, since it has adduced no evidence that the payment of a sales tax by subscribers to religious periodicals or purchasers of religious books would offend their religious beliefs or inhibit religious activity.  Moreover, even if members of some religious group succeeded in demonstrating that payment of a sales tax -- or, less plausibly, of a sales tax which applied to printed matter -- would violate their religious tenets, it is by no means obvious that the State would be required by the Clause to make individualized exceptions for them, since a limitation on religious liberty may be justified by showing that it is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.  There has been no suggestion that members of any major religious denomination -- the principal beneficiaries of the exemption -- could demonstrate an infringement of their free exercise rights sufficiently serious to overcome the State's countervailing interest in collecting its sales tax.  Pp.  489 U. S. 17-20.
(b) The Establishment Clause does not mandate the exemption, since, by requiring that public officials determine whether some message or activity is consistent with ""the teachings of the faith,"" the exemption appears, on its face, to produce greater state entanglement with religion than would the denial of an exemption.  Although compliance with government regulations by religious organizations and the monitoring of that compliance by government agencies would itself enmesh the operation of church and state to some degree, such compliance would generally not impede the evangelical activities of religious groups.  Moreover, the routine and factual inquiries commonly associated with the enforcement of tax laws bear no resemblance to the kind of government surveillance this Court has previously held to pose an intolerable risk of entanglement.  Pp.  489 U. S. 20-21.
(c) Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, and Follett v. McCormick, 321 U. S. 573, do not bar Texas' imposing a general sales tax on religious publications.  To the extent that Murdock and Follett held that a flat license or occupation tax designed for commercial salesmen cannot constitutionally be imposed on religious missionaries whose principal work is preaching and who only occasionally sell religious tracts for small sums, where that activity is deemed central to the particular faith and where the tax burden is far from negligible, those decisions are plainly consistent with the present decision.  Texas' sales tax is neither an occupation tax levied on missionaries nor a flat tax that restrains in advance the free exercise of religion; poses little danger of stamping out missionary work involving the sale of religious publications because it is equal to a small fraction of the value of each sale and is payable by the buyer; and can hardly be viewed as a covert attempt to curtail religious activity in

However, to the extent that unnecessarily broad language in Murdock and Follett might be read to suggest that the sale of religious or other publications may never be taxed, those dicta must be rejected.

In the common circumstances exemplified by this case, taxes or regulations would not subject religious organizations to undue burdens, and the government has a far weightier interest in their uniform application.  Pp.  489 U. S. 21-25.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, is directly applicable here and is the proper basis for reversing the judgment below, since the Texas law at issue violates the Press Clause of the First Amendment by taxing appellant while exempting other publishers solely on the basis of the religious content of their publications.

No. 87-470
Argued October 3, 1988
Decided February 21, 1989*
489 U.S. 46

Syllabus 
In No. 87-470, the State of Indiana and a local prosecutor (respondents) filed a civil action in state court against petitioner operator of an ""adult bookstore,"" alleging that it had violated the state Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of repeated violations of the state laws barring the distribution of obscene books and films.  Respondents sought injunctive relief under the state Civil Remedies for Racketeering Activity (CRRA) statute, including forfeiture of all of petitioner's property used in the alleged racketeering activity, and moved, in a separate petition, for a court order for immediate seizure of all property subject to forfeiture, as authorized by statute.  After the court, ex parte, heard testimony in support of this petition, it ordered the immediate seizure of petitioner's bookstore and its contents.  Following petitioner's unsuccessful attempts to vacate the seizure order on federal constitutional grounds, the court certified the constitutional issues to the Indiana Court of Appeals, which held that the relevant RICO/CRRA provisions violated the Federal Constitution.  The Indiana Supreme Court reversed, upholding both the constitutionality of the CRRA statute and the pretrial seizure.  In No. 87-614, petitioner ""adult bookstore"" operator was charged with distributing obscene matter in violation of an Indiana statute (a misdemeanor) and in addition with RICO violations (felonies) based on these alleged predicate acts of obscenity.  The trial court dismissed the RICO charges on the ground that the RICO statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to obscenity predicate offenses.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the charges, holding that the RICO statute was not unconstitutional as applied to the state obscenity statute, and the Indiana Supreme Court declined review.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear No. 87-614.  Under the general rule defining finality in the context of a criminal prosecution by a judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence, this Court would usually conclude that, since neither a conviction nor sentence was present here, the judgment below was not final, and hence not reviewable under 28 U.S.C.  1257, which limits review to ""[f]inal judgments or 
Page 489 U. S. 47
 decrees.""  But the case merits review under the exception to the general finality rule recognized in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469,  420 U. S. 482-483,
""[w]here the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action.""
Petitioner could well prevail on nonfederal grounds at a subsequent trial, and reversal of the Indiana Court of Appeals' holding would bar further prosecution on the RICO charges.  Moreover, the case clearly involves a First Amendment challenge to the Indiana RICO statute's facial validity.  Adjudicating the proper scope of First Amendment protection is a ""federal policy"" that merits application of an exception to the general finality rule.  Resolution of the important issue of the possible limits the First Amendment places on state and federal efforts to control organized crime should not remain in doubt.  Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 54-57.
2. There is no constitutional bar to the State's inclusion of substantive obscenity violations among the predicate offenses under its RICO statute.  Pp.  489 U. S. 57-60.
(a) The RICO statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to obscenity predicate offenses.  The ""racketeering activities"" that the statute forbids are a ""pattern"" of multiple violations of certain substantive crimes, of which distributing obscenity is one.  Given that the RICO statute totally encompasses the obscenity law, if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague, the former cannot be vague either.  Petitioner in No. 87-614 cannot be convicted of violating the RICO statute without first being ""found guilty"" of distributing or of attempting or conspiring to distribute obscene materials.  To argue, as petitioner does, that the ""inherent vagueness"" of the obscenity standards established by Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, are at the root of his objection to any RICO prosecution based on predicate acts of obscenity is nothing less than an invitation to overturn Miller -- an invitation that this Court rejects.  That the punishments available in a RICO prosecution are different from those for obscenity violations does not render the RICO statute void for vagueness.  Pp.  489 U. S. 57-58.
(b) While the RICO punishments are greater than those for obscenity violations, there is no constitutionally significant difference between them.  The stiffer RICO punishments may provide an additional deterrent to those who might otherwise sell obscene materials and may result in some booksellers practicing self-censorship and removing First Amendment protected materials from their shelves.  But deterrence of the sale of obscene materials is a legitimate end of state obscenity laws, 
Page 489 U. S. 48
 and the mere assertion of some possible self-censorship resulting from a statute is not enough to render an anti-obscenity law unconstitutional.  Petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that the civil sanctions available under the CRRA against RICO violations are so severe as to render the RICO statute itself unconstitutional is not ripe, since the State has not sought any civil penalties.  Pp.  489 U. S. 59-60.
(c) There is no constitutional basis for petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that the alleged predicate acts used in a RICO/obscenity prosecution must be ""affirmed convictions.""  As long as the standard of proof is proper with respect to all elements of the RICO allegation, including proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the requisite number of constitutionally proscribable predicate acts, all of the relevant constitutional requirements have been met.  This Court will not require a State to fire a ""warning shot"" in the form of misdemeanor prosecutions before it may bring felony charges for distributing obscene materials.  And there is no merit to petitioner's contention that the predicate offenses charged must have occurred in the jurisdiction where the RICO indictment is brought, not only because all of petitioner's alleged predicate acts of distributing obscenity did take place in the same jurisdiction where the RICO prosecution was initiated, but more significantly because such a rule would essentially turn the RICO statute on its head.  Pp.  489 U. S. 60-62.
(d) Nor is there any merit to petitioner's contention in No. 87-614 that he should have been provided with a prompt post-arrest adversarial hearing on the question of the obscenity of the materials he allegedly distributed.  He did not request such a hearing, and there was no seizure of any of his books or films.  Police officers' purchases of a few items in connection with their investigation of petitioner's stores did not trigger constitutional concern.  P.  489 U. S. 62.
3. The pretrial seizure of petitioner's bookstore and its contents in No. 87-470 was improper.  While a single copy of a book or film may be seized and retained for evidentiary purposes based on a finding of probable cause, books or films may not be taken out of circulation completely until there has been a determination of obscenity after an adversary hearing.  The risk of prior restraint, which is the underlying basis for the special Fourth Amendment protection accorded searches for and seizures of First Amendment materials, renders invalid the pretrial seizure here.  Even assuming that petitioner's bookstore and its contents are forfeitable when it is proved that they were used in, or derived from, a pattern of violations of the state obscenity laws, the seizure was unconstitutional.  Probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively protected books and films.  Here, there was no determination that the seized items were ""obscene"" or that a RICO violation had occurred.  The petition 
Page 489 U. S. 49
 for seizure and the hearing thereon were aimed at establishing no more than probable cause to believe that a RICO violation had occurred, and the seizure order recited no more than probable cause in that respect.  Mere probable cause to believe a violation has transpired is not adequate to remove books or film from circulation.  The elements of a RICO violation other than the predicate crimes remain to be established in this case.  Where the claimed RICO violation is a pattern of racketeering that can be established only by rebutting the presumption that expressive materials are protected by the First Amendment, that presumption is not rebutted until the claimed justification for seizing such materials is properly established in an adversary proceeding.  Pp.  489 U. S. 62-67.
No. 87-470, 504 N.E.2d 559, reversed and remanded; No. 87-614, 505 N.E.2d 504, affirmed and remanded.

489 U.S. 87

Syllabus 
After a jury awarded petitioner $10,000 in damages on his claim that respondent sheriff's deputy had beaten him and thereby deprived him of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.  1983, the Federal District Court awarded him $7,500 in attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988, which provides that the court, ""in its discretion, may allow . . . a reasonable attorney's fee"" to a prevailing party in certain federal civil rights actions, including those under  1983.  The Court of Appeals reduced the fee award to $4,000, ruling that petitioner's 40% contingent fee arrangement with his lawyer served as a cap on the amount of fees that could be awarded.  The court also found that hours billed for the time of law clerks and paralegals were not compensable, since they would be included within the contingency fee.
Held:
1. An attorney's fee allowed under  1988 is not limited to the amount provided in the plaintiff's contingent fee arrangement with his counsel.  To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the statute, which broadly requires all defendants to pay a reasonable fee to all prevailing plaintiffs if ordered to do so by the court acting in its sound judgment and in light of all the circumstances of the case.  This Court's decisions have required that the initial estimate of a reasonable court-awarded fee be calculated by multiplying prevailing billing rates by the hours reasonably expended on successful claims, which ""lodestar"" figure may then be adjusted by other factors.  The Court has never suggested that any one such factor should substitute for the lodestar approach.  In fact, the lodestar figure is entitled to a strong presumption of reasonableness, and prevents a ""windfall"" for attorneys in  1983 actions by guaranteeing that they receive only the reasonable worth of the services rendered.  Thus, as  1988's legislative history confirms, a private fee arrangement is but one of the many factors to be considered and cannot, standing alone, impose an automatic limitation on the exercise of the trial judge's discretion, which is central to the operation of the statute.  Moreover, such a limitation might place an undesirable emphasis on the importance of the recovery of damages, whereas  1988 makes no distinction between damages actions and equitable suits, but was intended to encourage meritorious claims, irrespective of their nature, because of the benefits of

Argued November 30, 1988
Decided February 21, 1989
489 U.S. 101

Syllabus 
Petitioner Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (Firestone) maintained, and was the plan administrator and fiduciary of, a termination pay plan and two other unfunded employee benefit plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq.  After Firestone sold its Plastics Division to Occidental Petroleum Co. (Occidental), respondents, Plastics Division employees who were rehired by Occidental, sought severance benefits under the termination pay plan, but Firestone denied their requests on the ground that there had not been a ""reduction in workforce"" that would authorize benefits under the plan's terms.  Several respondents also sought information about their benefits under all three plans pursuant to  1024(b)(4)'s disclosure requirements, but Firestone denied those requests on the ground that respondents were no longer plan ""participants"" entitled to information under ERISA.  Respondents then brought suit for severance benefits under  1132(a)(1)(B) and for damages under  1132(a)(1)(A) and (c)(1)(B) based on Firestone's breach of its statutory disclosure obligation.  The Federal District Court granted summary judgment for Firestone, holding that the company had satisfied its fiduciary duty as to the benefits requests because its decision not to pay was not arbitrary or capricious, and that it had no disclosure obligation to respondents because they were not plan ""participants"" within the meaning of  1002(7) at the time they requested the information.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that benefits denials should be subject to de novo judicial review, rather than review under the arbitrary and capricious standard, where the employer is itself the administrator and fiduciary of an unfunded plan, since deference is unwarranted in that situation, given the lack of assurance of impartiality on the employer's part.  The Court of Appeals also held that the right to disclosure of plan information extends both to people who are entitled to plan benefits and to those who claim to be, but are not, so entitled.
Held:
1. De novo review is the appropriate standard for reviewing Firestone's denial of benefits to respondents.  Pp.  489 U. S. 108-115. 
Page 489 U. S. 102

(a) The arbitrary and capricious standard -- which was developed under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA) and adopted by some federal courts for  1132(a)(1)(B) actions in light of ERISA's failure to provide an appropriate standard of review for that section -- should not be imported into ERISA on a wholesale basis.  The raison d'etre for the LMRA standard -- the need for a jurisdictional basis in benefits denial suits against joint labor-management pension plan trustees whose decisions are not expressly made reviewable by the LMRA -- is not present in ERISA, which explicitly authorizes suits against fiduciaries and plan administrators to remedy statutory violations, including breaches of fiduciary duty and lack of compliance with plans.  Without this jurisdictional analogy, LMRA principles offer no support for the adoption of the arbitrary and capricious standard insofar as  1132 (a)(1)(B) is concerned.  Pp.  489 U. S. 108-110.
(b) Principles of the law of trusts -- which must guide the present determination under ERISA's language and legislative history and this Court's decisions interpreting the statute -- establish that a denial of benefits challenged under  1132(a)(1)(B) must be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan expressly gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the plan's terms, in which cases a deferential standard of review is appropriate.  The latter exception cannot aid Firestone, since there is no evidence that, under the termination pay plan, the administrator has the power to construe uncertain plan terms or that eligibility determinations are to be given deference.  Firestone's argument that plan interpretation is inherently discretionary is belied by other settled trust law principles whereby courts construe trust agreements without deferring to either party's interpretation.  Moreover, ERISA provisions that define a fiduciary as one who ""exercises any discretionary authority,"" give him control over the plan's operation and administration, and require that he provide a ""full and fair review"" of claim denials cannot be interpreted to empower him to exercise all his authority in a discretionary manner.  Adopting Firestone's interpretation would afford employees and their beneficiaries less protection than they received under pre-ERISA cases, which applied a de novo standard in interpreting plans, a result that Congress could not have intended in light of ERISA's stated purpose of ""promot[ing] the interest of employees and their beneficiaries.""  The fact that, after ERISA's passage, Congress failed to act upon a bill to amend  1132 to provide de novo review of benefits denial decisions does not indicate congressional approval of the arbitrary and capricious standard that had by then been adopted by most courts, since the bill's demise may have resulted from events having nothing to do with Congress' views on the relative merits of the two 
Page 489 U. S. 103
 standards, and since the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.  Firestone's assertion that the de novo standard would impose higher administrative and litigation costs on plans, and thereby discourage employers from creating plans in contravention of ERISA's spirit, is likewise unpersuasive, since there is nothing to foreclose parties from agreeing upon a narrower standard of review, and since the threat of increased litigation is not sufficient to outweigh the reasons for a de novo standard.  Those reasons have nothing to do with the concern for impartiality that guided the Court of Appeals, and the de novo standard applies regardless of whether the plan at issue is funded or unfunded and whether the administrator or fiduciary is operating under a conflict of interest.  If a plan gives discretion to such an official, however, the conflict must be weighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.  Pp.  489 U. S. 110-115.
2. A ""participant"" entitled to disclosure under  1024(b)(4) and to damages for failure to disclose under  1132(c)(1)(B) does not include a person who merely claims to be, but is not, entitled to a plan benefit.  The Court of Appeals' interpretation to the contrary strays far from the statutory language, which does not say that all ""claimants"" are entitled to disclosure; begs the question of who is a ""participant""; and renders the  1002(7) definition of ""participant"" superfluous.  Rather, that definition of a ""participant"" as ""any employee or former employee . . . who is or may become eligible"" for benefits must be naturally read to mean either an employee in, or reasonably expected to be in, currently covered employment, or a former employee who has a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or a colorable claim to vested benefits.  Moreover, a claimant must have a colorable claim that (1) he will prevail in a suit for benefits, or that (2) eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future in order to establish that he ""may be eligible.""  This view attributes conventional meanings to the statutory language, since the ""may become eligible"" phrase clearly encompasses all employees in covered employment and former employees with a colorable claim to vested benefits, but simply does not apply to a former employee who has neither a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment nor a colorable claim to vested benefits.  Congress' purpose in enacting the ERISA disclosure provisions -- ensuring that the individual participant knows exactly where he stands -- will not be thwarted by this natural reading of ""participant,"" since a rational plan administrator or fiduciary faced with the possibility of $100-a-day penalties under  1132(c)(1)(B) for failure to disclose would likely opt to provide a claimant with the requested information if there were any doubt that he was a participant, especially since the claimant could be required to pay the reasonable 
Page 489 U. S. 104
 costs of producing the information under  1024(b)(4) and Department of Labor regulations.  Since the Court of Appeals did not attempt to determine whether respondents were ""participants"" with respect to the plans about which they sought information, it must do so on remand.  Pp.  489 U. S. 115-118.

Syllabus 
Petitioner mail truck drivers, employees of the United States Postal Service, were separately charged in state criminal complaints with traffic violations arising out of unrelated incidents while they were operating their trucks, and they were arraigned in a California Municipal Court.  The United States attorney filed petitions for removal of the complaints to Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1442(a)(1) -- which provides for removal of a civil or criminal prosecution commenced in a state court against ""[a]ny officer of the United States . . or person acting under him, for any act under color of such office . . ."" -- because petitioners were federal employees at the time of the incidents and because the charges arose from accidents involving petitioners that occurred while they were on duty and acting in the course and scope of their employment.  The District Court granted the petitions.  The Court of Appeals, after consolidating the petitions, issued a writ of mandamus ordering the District Court to deny the petitions and remand the prosecutions for trial in state court, holding that
""federal postal workers may not remove state criminal prosecutions to federal court when they raise no colorable claim of federal immunity or other federal defense.""
Held:  Federal officer removal under  1442(a) must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.  Pp.  489 U. S. 124-139.
(a) For almost 125 years, this Court's decisions have understood  1442(a) and its predecessor statutes to require such an averment.  The test for federal officer removal under which ""[t]here must be a causal connection between what the officer has done under asserted official authority and the state prosecution,""  Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9,  270 U. S. 33, did not eliminate the federal defense requirement.  And since petitioners have not and could not present an official immunity defense to the state prosecutions against them, the liberal pleadings sufficient to allege such a defense that were permitted in Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402,  395 U. S. 405, are inapplicable to removal of those prosecutions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 125-134.
(b) There is no merit to the Government's argument that the language ""in the performance of his duties"" used in  1442(a)(3) that permits removal of actions or prosecutions against federal court officers ""for any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties"" must mean 
Page 489 U. S. 122
 something besides ""under color of office"" in that provision, and that therefore  1442(a)(1) must be construed broadly to permit removal of any actions or prosecutions brought against a federal officer for acts done during the performance of his duties, regardless of whether that officer raises a federal defense.  There is no reason to depart from the longstanding interpretation that Congress meant by both ""in the performance of his duties"" and ""under color of office"" to preserve the preexisting requirement of a federal defense for removal.  Pp.  489 U. S. 134-135.
(c) Section 1442(a) is a pure jurisdictional statute, granting district court jurisdiction over cases in which a federal officer is a defendant.  The section, therefore, cannot independently support Art. III ""arising under"" jurisdiction.  Rather, it is the raising of a federal question in the officer's removal petition that constitutes the federal law under which the action against the officer arises for Art. III purposes.  Adopting the Government's view, which would eliminate the federal defense requirement, would in turn eliminate the substantive Art. III foundation of  1442(a)(1) and unnecessarily present grave constitutional problems.  There is no need to adopt a theory of ""protective jurisdiction"" to support Art. III ""arising under"" jurisdiction, as the Government urges, because in this case there are no federal interests that are not protected by limiting removal to situations in which a federal defense is alleged.  In the prosecutions at issue, no state court hostility or interference has even been alleged, and there is no federal interest in potentially forcing local district attorneys to choose between prosecuting traffic violations hundreds of miles from the municipality in which the violations occurred or abandoning those prosecutions.  It is hardly consistent with the ""strong judicial policy"" against federal interference with state criminal proceedings to permit removal of state criminal prosecutions of federal officers, and thereby impose potentially extraordinary burdens on the States when absolutely no federal question is even at issue in those prosecutions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 136-139.
813 F.2d 960, affirmed.

The Court of Appeals, after consolidating the petitions, issued a writ of mandamus ordering the District Court to deny the petitions and remand the prosecutions for trial in state court, holding that
""federal postal workers may not remove state criminal prosecutions to federal court when they raise no colorable claim of federal immunity or other federal defense.""
Held:  Federal officer removal under  1442(a) must be predicated upon averment of a federal defense.  Pp.  489 U. S. 124-139.
(a) For almost 125 years, this Court's decisions have understood  1442(a) and its predecessor statutes to require such an averment.  The test for federal officer removal under which ""[t]here must be a causal connection between what the officer has done under asserted official authority and the state prosecution,""  Maryland v. Soper (No. 1), 270 U. S. 9,  270 U. S. 33, did not eliminate the federal defense requirement.  And since petitioners have not and could not present an official immunity defense to the state prosecutions against them, the liberal pleadings sufficient to allege such a defense that were permitted in Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402,  395 U. S. 405, are inapplicable to removal of those prosecutions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 125-134.
(b) There is no merit to the Government's argument that the language ""in the performance of his duties"" used in  1442(a)(3) that permits removal of actions or prosecutions against federal court officers ""for any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties"" must mean 
Page 489 U. S. 122
 something besides ""under color of office"" in that provision, and that therefore  1442(a)(1) must be construed broadly to permit removal of any actions or prosecutions brought against a federal officer for acts done during the performance of his duties, regardless of whether that officer raises a federal defense.  There is no reason to depart from the longstanding interpretation that Congress meant by both ""in the performance of his duties"" and ""under color of office"" to preserve the preexisting requirement of a federal defense for removal.  Pp.  489 U. S. 134-135.
(c) Section 1442(a) is a pure jurisdictional statute, granting district court jurisdiction over cases in which a federal officer is a defendant.  The section, therefore, cannot independently support Art. III ""arising under"" jurisdiction.  Rather, it is the raising of a federal question in the officer's removal petition that constitutes the federal law under which the action against the officer arises for Art. III purposes.  Adopting the Government's view, which would eliminate the federal defense requirement, would in turn eliminate the substantive Art. III foundation of  1442(a)(1) and unnecessarily present grave constitutional problems.  There is no need to adopt a theory of ""protective jurisdiction"" to support Art. III ""arising under"" jurisdiction, as the Government urges, because in this case there are no federal interests that are not protected by limiting removal to situations in which a federal defense is alleged.  In the prosecutions at issue, no state court hostility or interference has even been alleged, and there is no federal interest in potentially forcing local district attorneys to choose between prosecuting traffic violations hundreds of miles from the municipality in which the violations occurred or abandoning those prosecutions.  It is hardly consistent with the ""strong judicial policy"" against federal interference with state criminal proceedings to permit removal of state criminal prosecutions of federal officers, and thereby impose potentially extraordinary burdens on the States when absolutely no federal question is even at issue in those prosecutions.  Pp.  489 U. S. 136-139.

498 U.S. 141

Syllabus 
Petitioner developed a hull design for a fiberglass recreational boat that it marketed under the trade name Bonito Boat Model 5VBR.  The manufacturing process involved creating a hardwood model that was then sprayed with fiberglass to create a mold.  The mold then served to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale.  No patent application was filed to protect the utilitarian or design aspects of the hull or the manufacturing process by which the finished boats were produced.  After the Bonito 5VBR had been on the market for six years, the Florida Legislature enacted a statute that prohibits the use of a direct molding process to duplicate unpatented boat hulls, and forbids the knowing sale of hulls so duplicated.  Petitioner subsequently filed an action in a Florida Circuit Court, alleging that respondent had violated the statute by using the direct molding process to duplicate the Bonito 5VBR fiberglass hull and by knowingly selling such duplicates.  Petitioner sought damages, injunctive relief, and an award of attorney's fees under the Florida law.  The trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute conflicted with federal patent law, and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.  The Florida Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The Florida statute is preempted by the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  489 U. S. 146-168.
(a) This Court's decisions have made clear that state regulation of intellectual property must yield to the extent that it clashes with the federal patent statute's balance between public right and private monopoly designed to promote certain creative activity.  The efficient operation of the federal patent system depends upon substantially free trade in publicly known, unpatented design and utilitarian conceptions.  Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225; Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234.  A state law that interferes with the enjoyment of such a conception contravenes the ultimate goal of public disclosure and use that is the centerpiece of federal patent policy.  Moreover, through the creation of patent-like rights, the States could essentially redirect inventive efforts away from the careful criteria of patentability developed by Congress over the last 200 years.  Pp.  489 U. S. 146-157. 
Page 489 U. S. 142

(b) By offering patent-like protection for ideas deemed unprotected under the federal patent scheme, the Florida statute conflicts with the ""strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.""  Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653,  395 U. S. 656.  The Florida statute does not prohibit ""unfair competition"" in the usual sense of that term, but rather is aimed at promoting inventive effort by preventing the efficient exploitation of the design and utilitarian conceptions embodied in the product itself.  It endows the original boat manufacturer with rights against the world, similar in scope and operation to the rights accorded the federal patentee.  This protection is made available for an unlimited number of years to all boat hulls and their component parts.  Protection is available for subject matter for which patent protection has been denied or has expired, as well as for designs which have been freely revealed to the consuming public by their creators.  In this case, the statute operates to allow petitioner to assert a substantial property right in a design idea which has already been available to the public for over six years.  Pp.  489 U. S. 157-160.
(c) That the Florida statute does not restrict all means of reproduction does not eliminate the conflict with the federal patent scheme.  In essence, the statute grants the original manufacturer the right to prohibit a form of reverse engineering of a product in general circulation.  This is one of the rights granted to the federal patent holder, but has never been part of state protection under the law of unfair competition or trade secrets.  The study and recomposition of unpatented articles available to the public at large may lead to significant advances in technology and design.  Moreover, the threat of reverse engineering of unpatented articles creates a significant spur to the achievement of the rigorous standards of patentability established by Congress.  By substantially altering this competitive reality, the Florida statute and similar state laws may erect themselves as substantial competitors to the federal patent scheme.  Such a result would contravene the congressional intent to create a uniform system for determining the boundaries of public and private right in utilitarian and design ideas.  Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, distinguished.  Pp.  489 U. S. 160-165.
(d) The Patent and Copyright Clauses of the Federal Constitution do not by their own force, or by negative implication, deprive the States of the power to adopt rules to promote intellectual creation within their own jurisdictions where Congress has left the field free of federal regulation.  Goldstein v. California, 412 U. S. 546.  Even as to design and utilitarian conceptions within the subject matter of the patent laws, the States may place limited regulations on the exploitation of unpatented ideas to prevent consumer confusion as to source or the tortious appropriation of trade secrets.  Both the law of unfair competition and state trade secret law have coexisted harmoniously with federal patent protection

 for almost 200 years, and Congress has demonstrated its full awareness of the operation of state law in these areas without any indication of disapproval.  Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238.  The same cannot be said of the Florida scheme at issue here, where Congress has explicitly considered the need for additional protections for industrial designs and declined to act.  By according patent-like protection to the otherwise unprotected design and utilitarian aspects of products in general circulation, the Florida statute enters a field of regulation which the patent laws have reserved to Congress, and is therefore preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution.

Syllabus 
As part of the merger of a company that they owned with another company, petitioners exchanged stock in their company for stock in the other company.  In approving the merger, petitioners allegedly relied on the other company's financial statements prepared by respondent accounting firm.  Subsequently, petitioners concluded that certain of those statements misrepresented the company's financial condition.  They then filed an action in Federal District Court against respondent and others, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and state common law.  While returning a verdict against some of the defendants, the jury found in favor of respondent and another defendant.  After judgment was entered, petitioners filed a timely motion for prejudgment interest.  While that motion was still pending, petitioners filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in favor of respondent and the other defendant.  Ultimately, the court granted the motion for prejudgment interest and ordered that the judgment be amended to include that interest.  The Court of Appeals held that petitioners' motion for prejudgment interest was a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), which rendered the notice of appeal ineffective under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), which provides that, if a party files a timely motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of that motion ""shall have no effect.""  The court also rejected petitioners' contention that Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384, required it to hear their appeal because they had relied on several actions of the District Court that indicated that the judgment was final and appealable notwithstanding the pending motion for prejudgment interest.
Held:  Petitioners' motion for prejudgment interest constituted a Rule 59(e) motion, and rendered ineffective under Rule 4(a)(4) their notice of appeal filed before a ruling on that motion.  Pp.  489 U. S. 173-179.
(a) Prejudgment interest is part of the compensation due a plaintiff.  A postjudgment motion for discretionary prejudgment interest involves the kind of reconsideration of matters encompassed within the merits of a judgment to which Rule 59(e) was intended to apply.  Pp.  489 U. S. 174-176.
(b) To conclude that a postjudgment motion for discretionary prejudgment interest is a Rule 59(e) motion helps further the important goal of

 avoiding piecemeal appellate review of judgments.  Moreover, by preventing appellate review before such a motion is resolved, that conclusion gives added assurance that an appellate court will have the benefit of the district court's plenary findings with regard to factual and legal issues subsumed in the decision to grant prejudgment interest.

(c) On the record, the Court of Appeals correctly declined to apply the reasoning of Thompson, supra, to excuse petitioners' failure to file an effective notice of appeal.

 Robert DUDLEYv. John STUBBS. No. 88-975. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 21, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and Justice KENNEDY join, dissenting. 
 Because the judgment below rests upon a fundamental misconception of this Court's decision in Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986), and conflicts with the approach taken by the vast majority of the Courts of Appeals, including a prior decision of the Second Circuit itself, I would grant the petition for certiorari. Under the decision which the Court declines to review today, prison officials are essentially held strictly liable under the Eighth Amendment for split- second decisions made in the face of serious threats to the security of the prison facility. This is precisely the result that our decision in Whitley was designed to avoid. 
 I [ Dudley v. Stubbs 489 U.S. 1034 (1989) ][1034-Continued.] 
 On February 4, 1977, the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility was the site of an institution-wide sitdown strike orchestrated and controlled by a group of prisoners known as the ""Muslims."" That evening, as respondent, John Stubbs, an inmate at the institution, was walking down the main corridor of C control area of the prison to make a telephone call, he was confronted by a gang of 20 to 30 Muslim prisoners. The gang was armed with homemade knives up to 16 inches in length as well as other weapons wrapped in sheets. The mob began to chase respondent through the corridors of the prison, throwing garbage cans and table legs down the hallways. As respondent ran toward the telephone room, he noticed petitioner, Robert Dudley, and another guard standing in front of a door leading to the administrative control center of the prison. Neither Officer Dudley nor the correctional officer with him had a firearm, a baton, or a two-way radio. The prison arsenal, the offices of the prison superintendent, and the prison hospital are all accessible from the administration corridor. 
 When respondent approached the door to the administration area with the armed mob directly behind him, Officer Dudley and the other corrections officer entered the administration corridor and secured the door from the other side. Officer Dudley refused 
Page 489 U.S. 1034 , 1035
 to open the door to the administration corridor, despite the entreaties of respondent. Respondent then ran down another corridor and jumped over the counter of the telephone room and cried for help. The correctional officers in the telephone room, and one inmate present there, immediately removed themselves to positions of safety. At this point the angry mob caught up with respondent and beat him severely. 
 Respondent brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against petitioner and other corrections officials, alleging that the failure to aid him during the disturbance constituted a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. The case was tried to a jury before a Magistrate. Officer Dudley testified that he did not open the administration door because he never had the chance to, but indicated that he would not have done so in any event, given the fact that the prison arsenal and the superintendent's office lay on the other side. As he put it at trial, ""[T] here is no way you are to allow inmates to go up into that area, especially in that type of situation."" Pet. for Cert. 5. In addition, there was expert testimony at trial that Officer Dudley had followed proper procedure in securing the administration corridor door. At the close of the evidence, petitioner asked for an instruction to the jury that his conduct must have been ""malicious and sadistic"" to support Eighth Amendment liability under this Court's decision in Whitley v. Albers, supra. The trial court rejected petitioner's proposed instruction and instead delivered a ""deliberate indifference"" charge. The jury returned a verdict against Officer Dudley in the amount of $26,000 for alleged violations of respondent's Eighth Amendment rights. 
 The Magistrate subsequently granted petitioner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Magistrate found this case "" akin"" to the situation presented in Whitley, and emphasized that "" 'prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.' "" App. to Pet. for Cert. 5b, quoting Whitley, supra, at 321-322, 106 S. t., at 1085 (citation omitted). The Magistrate cited three factors which justified the entry of judgment for petitioner. First, ""there was a serious threat to prison security at the time Stubbs sought Dudley's protection."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 7b. Second, ""Dudley acted without ill will or malice""; and third, ""prior to the attack upon [489 U.S. 1034 , 1036]

 Robert DUDLEYv. John STUBBS. No. 88-975. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 21, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 The motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and Justice KENNEDY join, dissenting. 
 Because the judgment below rests upon a fundamental misconception of this Court's decision in Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312 (1986), and conflicts with the approach taken by the vast majority of the Courts of Appeals, including a prior decision of the Second Circuit itself, I would grant the petition for certiorari. Under the decision which the Court declines to review today, prison officials are essentially held strictly liable under the Eighth Amendment for split- second decisions made in the face of serious threats to the security of the prison facility. This is precisely the result that our decision in Whitley was designed to avoid. 
 I [ Dudley v. Stubbs 489 U.S. 1034 (1989) ][1034-Continued.] 
 On February 4, 1977, the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility was the site of an institution-wide sitdown strike orchestrated and controlled by a group of prisoners known as the ""Muslims."" That evening, as respondent, John Stubbs, an inmate at the institution, was walking down the main corridor of C control area of the prison to make a telephone call, he was confronted by a gang of 20 to 30 Muslim prisoners. The gang was armed with homemade knives up to 16 inches in length as well as other weapons wrapped in sheets. The mob began to chase respondent through the corridors of the prison, throwing garbage cans and table legs down the hallways. As respondent ran toward the telephone room, he noticed petitioner, Robert Dudley, and another guard standing in front of a door leading to the administrative control center of the prison. Neither Officer Dudley nor the correctional officer with him had a firearm, a baton, or a two-way radio. The prison arsenal, the offices of the prison superintendent, and the prison hospital are all accessible from the administration corridor. 
 When respondent approached the door to the administration area with the armed mob directly behind him, Officer Dudley and the other corrections officer entered the administration corridor and secured the door from the other side. Officer Dudley refused 
Page 489 U.S. 1034 , 1035
 to open the door to the administration corridor, despite the entreaties of respondent. Respondent then ran down another corridor and jumped over the counter of the telephone room and cried for help. The correctional officers in the telephone room, and one inmate present there, immediately removed themselves to positions of safety. At this point the angry mob caught up with respondent and beat him severely. 
 Respondent brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against petitioner and other corrections officials, alleging that the failure to aid him during the disturbance constituted a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. The case was tried to a jury before a Magistrate. Officer Dudley testified that he did not open the administration door because he never had the chance to, but indicated that he would not have done so in any event, given the fact that the prison arsenal and the superintendent's office lay on the other side. As he put it at trial, ""[T] here is no way you are to allow inmates to go up into that area, especially in that type of situation."" Pet. for Cert. 5. In addition, there was expert testimony at trial that Officer Dudley had followed proper procedure in securing the administration corridor door. At the close of the evidence, petitioner asked for an instruction to the jury that his conduct must have been ""malicious and sadistic"" to support Eighth Amendment liability under this Court's decision in Whitley v. Albers, supra. The trial court rejected petitioner's proposed instruction and instead delivered a ""deliberate indifference"" charge. The jury returned a verdict against Officer Dudley in the amount of $26,000 for alleged violations of respondent's Eighth Amendment rights. 
 The Magistrate subsequently granted petitioner's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Magistrate found this case "" akin"" to the situation presented in Whitley, and emphasized that "" 'prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.' "" App. to Pet. for Cert. 5b, quoting Whitley, supra, at 321-322, 106 S. t., at 1085 (citation omitted). The Magistrate cited three factors which justified the entry of judgment for petitioner. First, ""there was a serious threat to prison security at the time Stubbs sought Dudley's protection."" App. to Pet. for Cert. 7b. Second, ""Dudley acted without ill will or malice""; and third, ""prior to the attack upon [489 U.S. 1034 , 1036]

 Eddie Crawford was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of Georgia reversed on the grounds that the jury might actually have convicted Crawford not of murder but felony murder, a crime not charged in the indictment. On retrial, Crawford's attorney filed a motion for change of venue, which was denied. He also objected to the seating of any juror who had knowledge of the prior proceeding.

The jury that was finally empaneled contained eight persons who knew about the prior trial; five who knew that Crawford had been convicted, and three who knew that he had been sentenced to death.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold these views, I would still grant the petition for certiorari.

Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 2471 (1986), quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643, 1871 (1974). 
Page 489 U.S. 1042 , 1043
 Petitioner was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death. The Ohio Supreme Court identified four instances of prosecutorial misconduct, but concluded that, because of the brutal nature of the crime, they neither singly nor cumulatively deprived petitioner of a fair trial. 
 The first was the prosecution's inquiry, during cross-examination of a defense witness, into a ""knife fight"" during which petitioner had allegedly been cut. The knife fight was wholly unrelated to the alleged murder, and the judge accordingly admonished the jury to disregard the prosecutor's reference to it. 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 284, 528 N.E.2d 542, 553 ( 1988). 
 The second was the prosecutor's comment during closing argument that, if petitioner had taken the stand, the prosecutor would have inquired into petitioner's criminal convictions after the date of the alleged murder. The judge again ordered that the jury disregard the prosecutor's comment, and the prosecutor apologized to the jury, saying: "" 'I shouldn't have said that. I wish you would just forget that because there's nothing like th t here.' "" Ibid. 
 The third was the prosecutor's introduction into evidence, during the penalty phase, of a photograph of petitioner standing next to a marijuana plant. The prosecutor adverted to this photograph during the penalty phase. The State Supreme Court found the introduction of this photograph to be error, but concluded: ""The factors supporting death as a penalty were so persuasive and so numerous that this single photograph cannot be regarded as having materially prejudiced [petitioner]."" Id., at 287, 528 N.E.2d, at 555. 
 Fourth and finally, the prosecutor made various improper closing- argument comments, ""by reminding the jury that any sentence less than death could result in eventual parole, by alluding to facts not in evidence, by asking the jury why [petitioner] did not call certain persons to the stand, and by appealing to the jury's desire for law and order."" Ibid. The State Supreme Court again found these comments only harmless error. 
 In my view, it is beyond serious dispute that these prosecutorial actions cumulatively deprived petitioner of a fair trial. The dissenting State Supreme Court judge characterized these actions, quite properly in my view, as ""prosecutorial misconduct of the worst sort.""

 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether a jury instruction that sympathy should not influence a decision regarding the imposition of the death penalty violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. [ Britz v. Illinois 489 U.S. 1044 (1989) ][1044-Continued.] 
 I  
 DeWayne C. Britz was convicted of murder, aggravated kidnaping, aggravated criminal sexual assault, armed robbery, and concealment of a homicidal death. At the penalty phase, the trial judge charged the jury that "" '[n]either sympathy nor prejudice should influence you.' "" 123 Ill. 2d 446, 479, 124 Ill.Dec. 15, 31, 528 N.E.2d 703, 719 (1988), quoting Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 1.01 (2d ed. 1981). Defense counsel specifically objected to this instruction. The jury unanimously found that statutory aggravating factors existed and that no mitigating factors precluded the imposition of the death sentence. Petitioner was sentenced to death. 
 The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed. 123 Ill.2d 446, 124 Ill.Dec. 15, 528 N.E.2d 703 (1988). The court held that the trial court's no-sympathy jury instruction was similar to the instruction approved in Californi v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538 (1987). Relying on its decision in People v. Stewart, 104 Ill.2d 463, 85 Ill.Dec. 422, 473 N.E.2d 1227 (1984), cert. 
Page 489 U.S. 1044 , 1045
 denied, 471 U.S. 1120 (1985), the court further held that the instruction did not deny petitioner a fair trial because the jury was also instructed that it could consider any other facts or circumstances that favored imposition of a sentence other than death, and because the defendant was permitted to introduce all evidence he considered mitigating, including evidence ruled inadmissible during the guilt phase. 
 II  
 We have recognized repeatedly that, in a capital case, the sentencer must not be precluded from considering any mitigating evidence relating to the defendant or the crime. See, e.g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 111-112, 874-875 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 2964 (1978) (plurality opinion). Mitigating evidence is allowed at the penalty phase so the sentencer may consider ""compassionate . . . factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind."" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 2991 (1976) (plurality opinion). "" Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution."" Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. at 199, 96 S.Ct. at 2937 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); see also Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 330- 331, 2640-2641 (1985). 
 The Court reaffirmed the importance of considering mitigating evidence in California v. Brown, supra. There, the trial judge instructed the jury that it must not be swayed by "" 'mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.' "" 479 U.S., at 542. The majority held that this instruction did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for two reasons. First, it found that the word ""mere"" informed the jury ""to ignore only the sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the penalty phase."" Ibid. (emphasis added). ""By concentrating on the noun 'sympathy,' "" the defendant had ""ignore[d] the crucial fact that the jury was instructed to avoid basing its decision on mere sympathy."" Ibid. (emphasis in original). Second, the majority deemed it ""highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would almost perversely single out the word 'sympathy' from the other nouns which accompany it in the instruction : conjecture, passion, prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling."" Id., at 542-543. ""Reading the instruction as a whole,"" id., at 543, a rational juror could only conclude that the instruction was intended simply to confine- [489 U.S. 1044 , 1046]

Mitigating evidence is allowed at the penalty phase so the sentencer may consider ""compassionate . . . factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind."" Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 2991 (1976) (plurality opinion). "" Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution."" Gregg v. Georgia, supra, 428 U.S. at 199, 96 S.Ct. at 2937 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.); see also Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 330- 331, 2640-2641 (1985). 
 The Court reaffirmed the importance of considering mitigating evidence in California v. Brown, supra. There, the trial judge instructed the jury that it must not be swayed by "" 'mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.' "" 479 U.S., at 542. The majority held that this instruction did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments for two reasons. First, it found that the word ""mere"" informed the jury ""to ignore only the sort of sympathy that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the penalty phase."" Ibid. (emphasis added). ""By concentrating on the noun 'sympathy,' "" the defendant had ""ignore[d] the crucial fact that the jury was instructed to avoid basing its decision on mere sympathy."" Ibid. (emphasis in original). Second, the majority deemed it ""highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would almost perversely single out the word 'sympathy' from the other nouns which accompany it in the instruction : conjecture, passion, prejudice, public opinion, or public feeling."" Id., at 542-543. ""Reading the instruction as a whole,"" id., at 543, a rational juror could only conclude that the instruction was intended simply to confine- [489 U.S. 1044 , 1046]

|488 u.s. 428|"Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp.
No. 87-1372
Argued December 6, 1988
Decided January 23, 1989
488 U.S. 428

Syllabus 
A crude oil tanker owned by respondent United Carriers, Inc., a Liberian corporation, and chartered to respondent Amerada Hess Corp., also a Liberian corporation, was severely damaged when it was attacked in international waters by Argentine military aircraft during the war between Great Britain and petitioner Argentine Republic over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) off the Argentine coast.  Respondents brought separate actions against petitioner in Federal District Court for the damage they sustained in the attack.  They invoked the District Court's jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), which confers original jurisdiction on district courts over civil actions by an alien for a tort committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.  Amerada Hess also brought suit under the general admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of federal courts, 28 U.S.C.  1333, and ""the principle of universal jurisdiction, recognized in customary international law.""  The District Court dismissed respondents' complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, ruling that their actions were barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA).  The FSIA provides in 28 U.S.C.  1604 that
""[s]ubject to existing international agreements to which the United States [was] a party at the time of the enactment of this Act[,] a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction""
of United States courts except as provided in 28 U.S.C.  1605-1607, and further provides in 28 U.S.C.  1330(a) that
""[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state . . . as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity""
under  1605-1607 or any applicable international agreement.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had jurisdiction over respondents' consolidated action under the ATS.
Held:  The FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in United States courts, and the District Court correctly dismissed the action because the FSIA did not authorize jurisdiction over petitioner under the facts of this case.  Pp.  488 U. S. 433-443.
(a) The FSIA's text and structure demonstrate Congress' intention that the FSIA be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign 
Page 488 U. S. 429
 state in United States courts.  Sections 1604 and 1330(a) work in tandem:   1604 bars United States courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state is entitled to immunity, and  1330(a) confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by both United States citizens and aliens when a foreign state is not entitled to immunity.  Pp.  488 U. S. 433-435.
(b) From Congress' decision in the FSIA to deny immunity to foreign states in cases involving property taken in violation of international law in  1605(a)(3), the plain implication is that immunity is granted in those cases involving alleged violations of international law that do not come within one of the FSIA's exceptions.  Pp.  488 U. S. 435-436.
(c) Congress' failure in the FSIA to enact a pro tanto repealer of the ATS when it passed the FSIA in 1976 may be explained at least in part by the lack of certainty as to whether the ATS conferred jurisdiction in suits against foreign states.  In light of the comprehensiveness of the FSIA's scheme, it is doubtful that even the most meticulous draftsman would have concluded that Congress also needed to amend pro tanto the ATS and presumably other grants of subject matter jurisdiction in Title 28.  Pp.  488 U. S. 436-438.
(d) The rule of statutory construction under which repeals by implication are disfavored does not apply here.  This case does not involve two statutes that supplement one another, nor is it a case where a more general statute is claimed to have repealed by implication an earlier statute dealing with a narrower subject.  Congress' decision to deal comprehensively with the subject of foreign sovereign immunity in the FSIA, and the express provision in  1604 that ""a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction"" of United States courts except as provided in  1605-1607, preclude a construction of the ATS that permits the instant action.  P.  488 U. S. 438.
(e) Congress dealt with the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts when it enacted the FSIA.  Section 1605(b) expressly permits an in personam suit in admiralty to enforce a maritime lien against a vessel or cargo of a foreign state.  Unless the present case is within  1605(b) or another exception to the FSIA, the statute conferring general admiralty and maritime jurisdiction on the federal courts does not authorize this suit against petitioner.  Pp.  488 U. S. 438-439.
(f) The District Court correctly determined that none of the exceptions enumerated in the FSIA applies to the facts of this case.  The exception for noncommercial torts in  1605(a)(5) is limited by its terms to cases in which the damage to or loss of property occurs in the United States.  The FSIA's definition of ""United States"" in  1603(c) as including all ""territory and waters, continental and insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States"" cannot be construed to include petitioner's attack on the high seas.  Pp.  488 U. S. 439-441 
Page 488 U. S. 430

(g) The Geneva Convention on the High Seas and the Pan American Maritime Neutrality Convention entered into by petitioner and the United States do not create an exception to the FSIA.  A foreign state cannot waive its immunity under  1605(a)(1) by signing an international agreement that does not mention a waiver of immunity to suit in United States courts or even the availability of a cause of action in the United States.  Nor does the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Liberia carve out an exception to the FSIA.  That Treaty provides that United States and Liberian nationals shall have access to the courts of each country ""on conforming to the local laws,"" and the FSIA is clearly one of the ""local laws"" to which respondents must conform before bringing suit in United States courts.  Pp.  488 U. S. 441-443.

No. 87-764
Argued October 3, 1988
Decided January 23, 1989
488 U.S. 445

Syllabus 
A Florida county sheriff's office received an anonymous tip that marijuana was being grown on respondent's property.  When an investigating officer discovered that he could not observe from Found level the contents of a greenhouse on the property -- which was enclosed on two sides and obscured from view on the other, open sides by trees, shrubs, and respondent's nearby home -- he circled twice over the property in a helicopter at the height of 400 feet and made naked-eye observations through openings in the greenhouse roof and its open sides of what he concluded were marijuana plants.  After a search pursuant to a warrant obtained on the basis of these observations revealed marijuana growing in the greenhouse, respondent was charged with possession of that substance under Florida law.  The trial court granted his motion to suppress the evidence.  Although reversing, the State Court of Appeals certified the case to the State Supreme Court on the question whether the helicopter surveillance from 400 feet constituted a ""search"" for which a warrant was required under the Fourth Amendment.  Answering that question in the affirmative, the court quashed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the trial court's suppression order.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
511 So.2d 282, reversed.
JUSTICE WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that the Fourth Amendment does not require the police traveling in the public airways at an altitude of 400 feet to obtain a warrant in order to observe what is visible to the naked eye.  California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 -- which held that a naked-eye police inspection of the backyard of a house from a fixed-wing aircraft at 1,000 feet was not a ""search"" -- is controlling.  Thus, respondent could not reasonably have expected that the contents of his greenhouse were protected from public or official inspection from the air, since he left the greenhouse's sides and roof partially open.  The fact that the inspection was made from a helicopter is irrelevant, since, as in the case of fixed-wing planes, private and commercial flight by helicopter is routine.  Nor, on the facts of this case, does it make a difference for Fourth Amendment purposes that the helicopter was flying below 500 feet, the Federal Aviation Administration's lower limit upon the navigable airspace for fixed-wing craft.  Since the FAA permits helicopters to fly 
Page 488 U. S. 446
 below that limit, the helicopter here was not violating the law, and any member of the public or the police could legally have observed respondent's greenhouse from that altitude.  Although an aerial inspection of a house's curtilage may not always pass muster under the Fourth Amendment simply because the aircraft is within the navigable airspace specified by law, there is nothing in the record here to suggest that helicopters flying at 400 feet are sufficiently rare that respondent could have reasonably anticipated that his greenhouse would not be observed from that altitude.  Moreover, there is no evidence that the helicopter interfered with respondent's normal use of his greenhouse or other parts of the curtilage, that intimate details connected with the use of the home or curtilage were observed, or that there was undue noise, wind, dust, or threat of injury.  Pp.  488 U. S. 449-452.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR concluded that the plurality's approach rests the scope of Fourth Amendment protection too heavily on compliance with FAA regulations, which are intended to promote air safety, and not to protect the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Whether respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy from aerial observation of his curtilage does not depend on whether the helicopter was where it had a right to be, but, rather, on whether it was in the public airways at an altitude at which members of the public travel with sufficient regularity that respondent's expectation was not one that society is prepared to recognize as ""reasonable.""  Because there is reason to believe that there is considerable public use of airspace at altitudes of 400 feet and above, and because respondent introduced no evidence to the contrary before the state courts, it must be concluded that his expectation of privacy here was not reasonable.  However, public use of altitudes lower than 400 feet -- particularly public observations from helicopters circling over the curtilage of a home -- may be sufficiently rare that police surveillance from such altitudes would violate reasonable expectations of privacy, despite compliance with FAA regulations.

No. 87-998
Argued October 5, 1988
Decided January 23, 1989
488 U.S. 469

Syllabus 
Appellant city adopted a Minority Business Utilization Plan (Plan) requiring prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least 30% of the dollar amount of each contract to one or more ""Minority Business Enterprises"" (MBE's), which the Plan defined to include a business from anywhere in the country at least 51% of which is owned and controlled by black, Spanish-speaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut citizens.  Although the Plan declared that it was ""remedial"" in nature, it was adopted after a public hearing at which no direct evidence was presented that the city had discriminated on the basis of race in letting contracts, or that its prime contractors had discriminated against minority subcontractors.  The evidence that was introduced included:  a statistical study indicating that, although the city's population was 50% black, only 0.67% of its prime construction contracts had been awarded to minority businesses in recent years; figures establishing that a variety of local contractors' associations had virtually no MBE members; the city's counsel's conclusion that the Plan was constitutional under Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448; and the statements of Plan proponents indicating that there had been widespread racial discrimination in the local, state, and national construction industries.  Pursuant to the Plan, the city adopted rules requiring individualized consideration of each bid or request for a waiver of the 30% set-aside, and providing that a waiver could be granted only upon proof that sufficient qualified MBE's were unavailable or unwilling to participate.  After appellee construction company, the sole bidder on a city contract, was denied a waiver and lost its contract, it brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the Plan was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The Federal District Court upheld the Plan in all respects, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, applying a test derived from the principal opinion in Fullilove, supra, which accorded great deference to Congress' findings of past societal discrimination in holding that a 10% minority set-aside for certain federal construction grants did not violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  However, on appellee's petition for certiorari in this case, this Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of its intervening decision in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U. S. 267, in 
Page 488 U. S. 470
 which the plurality applied a strict scrutiny standard in holding that a race-based layoff program agreed to by a school board and the local teachers' union violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  On remand, the Court of Appeals held that the city's Plan violated both prongs of strict scrutiny, in that (1) the Plan was not justified by a compelling governmental interest, since the record revealed no prior discrimination by the city itself in awarding contracts, and (2) the 30% set-aside was not narrowly tailored to accomplish a remedial purpose.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
822 F.2d 1355, affirmed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III-B, and IV, concluding that:
1. The city has failed to demonstrate a compelling governmental interest justifying the Plan, since the factual predicate supporting the Plan does not establish the type of identified past discrimination in the city's construction industry that would authorize race-based relief under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  488 U. S. 498-506.
(a) A generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in the entire construction industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota, since it provides no guidance for the city's legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy, and would allow race-based decisionmaking essentially limitless in scope and duration.  The city's argument that it is attempting to remedy various forms of past societal discrimination that are alleged to be responsible for the small number of minority entrepreneurs in the local contracting industry fails, since the city also lists a host of nonracial factors which would seem to face a member of any racial group seeking to establish a new business enterprise, such as deficiencies in working capital, inability to meet bonding requirements, unfamiliarity with bidding procedures, and disability caused by an inadequate track record.  Pp.  488 U. S. 498-499.
(b) None of the ""facts"" cited by the city or relied on by the District Court, singly or together, provide a basis for a prima facie case of a constitutional or statutory violation by anyone in the city's construction industry.  The fact that the Plan declares itself to be ""remedial"" is insufficient, since the mere recitation of a ""benign"" or legitimate purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no weight.  Similarly, the views of Plan proponents as to past and present discrimination in the industry are highly conclusory, and of little probative value.  Reliance on the disparity between the number of prime contracts awarded to minority businesses and the city's minority population is also misplaced, since the proper statistical evaluation would compare the percentage of MBE's 
Page 488 U. S. 471
 in the relevant market that are qualified to undertake city subcontracting work with the percentage of total city construction dollars that are presently awarded to minority subcontractors, neither of which is known to the city.  The fact that MBE membership in local contractors' associations was extremely low is also not probative, absent some link to the number of MBE's eligible for membership, since there are numerous explanations for the dearth of minority participation, including past societal discrimination in education and economic opportunities, as well as both black and white career and entrepreneurial choices.  Congress' finding in connection with the set-aside approved in Fullilove that there had been nationwide discrimination in the construction industry also has extremely limited probative value, since, by including a waiver procedure in the national program, Congress explicitly recognized that the scope of the problem would vary from market area to market area.  In any event, Congress was acting pursuant to its unique enforcement powers under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  488 U. S. 499-504.
(c) The ""evidence"" relied upon by JUSTICE MARSHALL's dissent -- the city's history of school desegregation and numerous congressional reports -- does little to define the scope of any injury to minority contractors in the city or the necessary remedy, and could justify a preference of any size or duration.  Moreover, JUSTICE MARSHALL's suggestion that discrimination findings may be ""shared"" from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is unprecedented, and contrary to this Court's decisions.  Pp.  488 U. S. 504-506.
(d) Since there is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against Spanish-speaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut persons in any aspect of the city's construction industry, the Plan's random inclusion of those groups strongly impugns the city's claim of remedial motivation.  Pp.  488 U. S. 506.
2. The Plan is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination, since it entitles a black, Hispanic, or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in the country to an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race.  Although many of the barriers to minority participation in the construction industry relied upon by the city to justify the Plan appear to be race neutral, there is no evidence that the city considered using alternative, race-neutral means to increase minority participation in city contracting.  Moreover, the Plan's rigid 30% quota rests upon the completely unrealistic assumption that minorities will choose to enter construction in lockstep proportion to their representation in the local population.  Unlike the program upheld in Fullilove, the Plan's waiver system focuses upon the availability of MBE's, and does not inquire whether the particular MBE seeking a racial preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors.  Given the fact that the city must already consider bids and 
Page 488 U. S. 472
 waivers on a case-by-case basis, the city's only interest in maintaining a quota system, rather than investigating the need for remedial action in particular cases, would seem to be simply administrative convenience, which, standing alone, cannot justify the use of a suspect classification under equal protection strict scrutiny.  Pp.  488 U. S. 507-508.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE WHITE, concluded in Part II that, if the city could identify past discrimination in the local construction industry with the particularity required by the Equal Protection Clause, it would have the power to adopt race-based legislation designed to eradicate the effects of that discrimination.  The principal opinion in Fullilove cannot be read to relieve the city of the necessity of making the specific findings of discrimination required by the Clause, since the congressional finding of past discrimination relied on in that case was made pursuant to Congress' unique power under  5 of the Amendment to enforce, and therefore to identify and redress violations of, the Amendment's provisions.  Conversely,  1 of the Amendment, which includes the Equal Protection Clause, is an explicit constraint upon the power of States and political subdivisions, which must undertake any remedial efforts in accordance with the dictates of that section.  However, the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it followed by rote the Wygant plurality's ruling that the Equal Protection Clause requires a showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved, since that ruling was made in the context of a race-based policy that affected the particular public employer's own workforce, whereas this case involves a state entity which has specific state law authority to address discriminatory practices within local commerce under its jurisdiction.  Pp.  488 U. S. 486-493.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Parts III-A and V that:
1. Since the Plan denies certain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public contracts based solely on their race, Wygant's strict scrutiny standard of review must be applied, which requires a firm evidentiary basis for concluding that the underrepresentation of minorities is a product of past discrimination.  Application of that standard, which is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by the racial classification, assures that the city is pursuing a remedial goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool, and that the means chosen ""fit"" this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.  The relaxed standard of review proposed by JUSTICE MARSHALL's dissent does not provide a means for determining that a racial classification is in fact ""designed to further remedial goals,"" since it accepts the remedial nature of the classification 
Page 488 U. S. 473
 before examination of the factual basis for the classification's enactment and the nexus between its scope and that factual basis.  Even if the level of equal protection scrutiny could be said to vary according to the ability of different groups to defend their interests in the representative process, heightened scrutiny would still be appropriate in the circumstances of this case, since blacks comprise approximately 50% of the city's population and hold five of nine seats on the City Council, thereby raising the concern that the political majority may have acted to disadvantage a minority based on unwarranted assumptions or incomplete facts.  Pp.  488 U. S. 493-498.
2. Even in the absence of evidence of discrimination in the local construction industry, the city has at its disposal an array of race-neutral devices to increase the accessibility of city contracting opportunities to small entrepreneurs of all races who have suffered the effects of past societal discrimination, including simplification of bidding procedures, relaxation of bonding requirements, training, financial aid, elimination or modification of formal barriers caused by bureaucratic inertia, and the prohibition of discrimination in the provision of credit or bonding by local suppliers and banks.  Pp.  488 U. S. 509-511.
JUSTICE STEVENS, although agreeing that the Plan cannot be justified as a remedy for past discrimination, concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit permissible racial classifications to those that remedy past wrongs, but requires that race-based governmental decisions be evaluated primarily by studying their probable impact on the future.  Pp.  488 U. S. 511-518.
(a) Disregarding the past history of racial injustice, there is not even an arguable basis for suggesting that the race of a subcontractor or contractor on city projects should have any relevance to his or her access to the market.  Although race is not always irrelevant to sound governmental decisionmaking, the city makes no claim that the public interest in the efficient performance of its construction contracts will be served by granting a preference to minority business enterprises.  Pp.  488 U. S. 512-513.
(b) Legislative bodies such as the city council, which are primarily policymaking entities that promulgate rules to govern future conduct, raise valid constitutional concerns when they use the political process to punish or characterize past conduct of private citizens.  Courts, on the other hand, are well equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed, and should have the same broad discretion in racial discrimination cases that chancellors enjoy in other areas of the law to fashion remedies against persons who have been proved guilty of violations of law.  Pp.  488 U. S. 513-514. 
Page 488 U. S. 474

(c) Rather than engaging in debate over the proper standard of review to apply in affirmative action litigation, it is more constructive to try to identify the characteristics of the advantaged and disadvantaged classes that may justify their disparate treatment.  Here, instead of carefully identifying those characteristics, the city has merely engaged in the type of stereotypical analysis that is the hallmark of Equal Protection Clause violations.  The class of persons benefited by the Plan is not limited to victims of past discrimination by white contractors in the city, but encompasses persons who have never been in business in the city, minority contractors who may have themselves been guilty of discrimination against other minority group members, and firms that have prospered notwithstanding discriminatory treatment.  Similarly, although the Plan unquestionably disadvantages some white contractors who are guilty of past discrimination against blacks, it also punishes some who discriminated only before it was forbidden by law, and some who have never discriminated against anyone.  Pp.  488 U. S. 514-517.
JUSTICE KENNEDY concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment ought not to be interpreted to reduce a State's power to eradicate racial discrimination and its effects in both the public and private sectors, or its absolute duty to do so where those wrongs were caused intentionally by the State itself, except where there is a conflict with federal law or where, as here, a state remedy itself violates equal protection.  Although a rule striking down all racial preferences which are not necessary remedies to victims of unlawful discrimination would serve important structural goals by eliminating the necessity for courts to pass on each such preference that is enacted, that rule would be a significant break with this Court's precedents that require a case-by-case test, and need not be adopted.  Rather, it may be assumed that the principle of race neutrality found in the Equal Protection Clause will be vindicated by the less absolute strict scrutiny standard, the application of which demonstrates that the city's Plan is not a remedy, but is itself an unconstitutional preference.  Pp.  488 U. S. 518-520.
JUSTICE SCALIA, agreeing that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental racial classifications, concluded that:
1. The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state and local governments from discriminating on the basis of race in order to undo the effects of past discrimination, except in one circumstance:  where that is necessary to eliminate their own maintenance of a system of unlawful racial classification.  Moreover, the State's remedial power in that instance extends no further than the scope of the constitutional violation, and does not encompass the continuing effects of a discriminatory system once the system itself has been eliminated.  Pp.  488 U. S. 520-525. 
Page 488 U. S. 475

2. The State remains free to undo the effects of past discrimination in permissible ways that do not involve classification by race -- for example, by according a contracting preference to small or new businesses or to actual victims of discrimination who can be identified.  In the latter instance, the classification would not be based on race, but on the fact that the victims were wronged.  Pp.  488 U. S. 526-528.

Syllabus 
Respondents pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracy indictments in a single proceeding in District Court.  One indictment charged respondents with entering into an agreement to rig bids on a certain highway project in violation of the Sherman Act, and the other made similar charges with respect to a different project.  After the District Court conducted a hearing, at which respondents were represented by counsel, and found the guilty pleas free and voluntary and made with an understanding of their consequences and of the nature of the charges, convictions were entered on the pleas and sentences were imposed.  Respondents subsequently filed a motion to vacate the convictions and sentences under the second indictment, contending, in reliance on the District Court's holding in another case involving the same bid-rigging conspiracy, that only one conspiracy existed and that double jeopardy principles required their convictions and sentences to be set aside.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, notwithstanding their guilty pleas, respondents were entitled to introduce evidence outside the original record to support their one-conspiracy claim, since, in pleading guilty, they admitted only the acts described in the indictments, not their legal consequences, and that, moreover, since the indictments did not expressly state that the two conspiracies were separate, no such concessions could be inferred from the pleas.  On remand, the District Court granted the motion, finding that there was only a single conspiracy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Respondents' double jeopardy challenge is foreclosed by their guilty pleas and convictions.  Pp.  488 U. S. 569-576.
(a) In holding that the admissions inherent in a guilty plea ""go only to the acts constituting the conspiracy,"" the Court of Appeals misapprehended the nature and effect of the plea.  By entering a guilty plea, the accused does not simply state that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment; he admits guilt of a substantive crime.  Here, the indictments alleged two distinct agreements, and the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, because the indictments did not explicitly state that the conspiracies were separate, respondents did not concede their separate nature by pleading guilty to both.  When respondents pleaded 
Page 488 U. S. 564
 guilty to both indictments, they conceded guilt to two separate offenses.  Pp.  488 U. S. 569-571.
(b) By pleading guilty, respondents relinquished the opportunity to receive a factual hearing on their double jeopardy claim.  That their attorney did not discuss double jeopardy issues with them prior to their pleas, and that they had not considered the possibility of raising a double jeopardy defense before pleading, did not entitle respondents to claim that they had not waived their right to raise a double jeopardy defense.  Conscious waiver is not necessary with respect to each potential defense relinquished by a guilty plea.  Pp.  488 U. S. 571-574.
(c) Under the well-settled principle that a voluntary and intelligent guilty plea by an accused who has been advised by competent counsel may not be collaterally attacked, respondents, who have not called into question the voluntary and intelligent character of their pleas, were not entitled to the collateral relief they sought.  P.  488 U. S. 574.
(d) The exception to the rule barring collateral attack on a guilty plea established by Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21, and Menna v. New York, 423 U. S. 61, in cases where a conviction under a second indictment must be set aside because the defendant's right not to be haled into court was violated, has no application in this case.  Here, in contrast to those cases which were resolved without any need to go beyond the indictments and the original record, respondents could not prove their double jeopardy claim without introducing new evidence into the record.  Pp.  488 U. S. 574-576.

 On applications for stay. 
 The applications for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him 
Page 488 U.S. 1036 , 1037
 referred to the Court are denied. 

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant the applications for stay of execution. 
 Even were I not of the foregoing view, I would grant application Nos. A-580 and A-586 pending the filing of a petition for certiorari, which I would hold for our decision in Dugger v. Adams, No. 87-121, cert. granted, 485 U.S. 933 (1988). 
 In Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 328-329, 2639-2640 (1985), we held that ""it is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death rests elsewhere."" Adams, and numerous cases that have been held for it raise the question whether the rationale of Caldwell applies to statements made by prosecutors and judges to the effect that the jury's sentence is merely advisory and that the judge remains responsible for the sentence ultimately imposed. See, e.g., Preston v. Florida, No. A-216; Ford v. Dugger, No. 88-5582; Spisak v. Ohio, No. 88-5169; Grossman v. Florida, No. 88-5136; Harich v. Dugger, No. 88-5216. In Florida cases, the notion that the jury's sentence is merely ""advisory"" appears to be at odds with that State's settled law that the jury determination must be given ""great weight"" and may be overturned by the judge only when the facts are ""so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ."" Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (Fla.1975). 
 In the present action, the jurors were repeatedly informed throughout voir dire and the sentencing instructions that their role was to ""render an advisory opinion only, just that, an opinion,"" or ""just a sort of recommendation, so to speak, from the jury as to what penalty ought to be imposed,"" and that ""[t]he law places the awesome burden upon the judge to decide what final disposition is made or penalty is imposed in a capital case."" Unlike the situation we faced recently in Daugherty v. Florida, 488 U.S. 936 (1988), these were not merely two isolated comments of the prosecutor, but [488 U.S. 1036 , 1038]

|488 u.s. 336|"Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission
of Webster County, West Virginia
No. 87-1303
Argued December 7, 1988
Decided January 18, 1989*
488 U.S. 336

Syllabus 
The West Virginia Constitution in relevant part establishes a general principle of uniform taxation so that all property, both real and personal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value.  The Webster County tax assessor, from 1975 to 1986, valued petitioners' real property on the basis of its recent purchase price.  Other properties not recently transferred were assessed based on their previous assessments with minor modifications.  This system resulted in gross disparities in the assessed value of generally comparable property.  Each year, respondent county commission affirmed the assessments, and petitioners appealed to the State Circuit Court.  Eventually, a number of these appeals were consolidated and decided.  The State Circuit Court held that the county's assessment system systematically and intentionally discriminated against petitioners in violation of the State Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution.  It ordered respondent to reduce petitioners' assessments to the levels recommended by the state tax commissioner in his guidelines for local assessors.  The State Supreme Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the record did not support a finding of intentional and systematic discrimination because petitioners' property was not assessed at more than true value, as appropriately measured by the recent arm's-length purchase price of the property.  In its view, any comparative undervaluation of other property could only be remedied by an action by petitioners to raise those other assessments.
Held:
1. The assessments on petitioners' property violated the Equal Protection Clause.  There is no constitutional defect in a scheme that bases an assessment on the recent arm's-length purchase price of the property, and uses a general adjustment as a transitional substitute for an individual reappraisal of other parcels.  But the Clause requires that such general adjustments be accurate enough to obtain, over a short period of time, rough equality in tax treatment of similarly situated property owners.  
Page 488 U. S. 337
 This action is not one involving permissible transitional inequality, since petitioners' property has been assessed at roughly 8 to 35 times more than comparable neighboring property, and these discrepancies have continued for more than 10 years with little change.  The county's adjustments to assessments that are carried over are too small to seasonably dissipate the disparity.  Pp.  488 U. S. 342-344.
2. The Equal Protection Clause permits a State to divide different kinds of property into classes and to assign to each a different tax burden so long as those divisions and burdens are neither arbitrary nor capricious.  West Virginia has not drawn such a distinction here, as its Constitution and laws provide that all property of the kind held by petitioners shall be taxed uniformly according to its estimated market value.  There is no suggestion that the State has in practice adopted a different system that authorizes individual counties to independently fashion their own substantive assessment policies.  The Webster County assessor has, apparently on her own initiative, applied state tax law in a manner resulting in significant and persistent disparity in assessed value between petitioners' and similarly situated property.  The intentional systematic undervaluation of such other property unfairly deprives petitioners of their rights under the Clause.  Pp.  488 U. S. 344-346.

			"|"Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission
of Webster County, West Virginia
No. 87-1303
Argued December 7, 1988
Decided January 18, 1989*
488 U.S. 336

Syllabus 
The West Virginia Constitution in relevant part establishes a general principle of uniform taxation so that all property, both real and personal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value.  The Webster County tax assessor, from 1975 to 1986, valued petitioners' real property on the basis of its recent purchase price.  Other properties not recently transferred were assessed based on their previous assessments with minor modifications.  This system resulted in gross disparities in the assessed value of generally comparable property.  Each year, respondent county commission affirmed the assessments, and petitioners appealed to the State Circuit Court.  Eventually, a number of these appeals were consolidated and decided.  The State Circuit Court held that the county's assessment system systematically and intentionally discriminated against petitioners in violation of the State Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution.  It ordered respondent to reduce petitioners' assessments to the levels recommended by the state tax commissioner in his guidelines for local assessors.  The State Supreme Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the record did not support a finding of intentional and systematic discrimination because petitioners' property was not assessed at more than true value, as appropriately measured by the recent arm's-length purchase price of the property.  In its view, any comparative undervaluation of other property could only be remedied by an action by petitioners to raise those other assessments.
Held:
1. The assessments on petitioners' property violated the Equal Protection Clause.  There is no constitutional defect in a scheme that bases an assessment on the recent arm's-length purchase price of the property, and uses a general adjustment as a transitional substitute for an individual reappraisal of other parcels.  But the Clause requires that such general adjustments be accurate enough to obtain, over a short period of time, rough equality in tax treatment of similarly situated property owners.  
Page 488 U. S. 337
 This action is not one involving permissible transitional inequality, since petitioners' property has been assessed at roughly 8 to 35 times more than comparable neighboring property, and these discrepancies have continued for more than 10 years with little change.  The county's adjustments to assessments that are carried over are too small to seasonably dissipate the disparity.  Pp.  488 U. S. 342-344.
2. The Equal Protection Clause permits a State to divide different kinds of property into classes and to assign to each a different tax burden so long as those divisions and burdens are neither arbitrary nor capricious.  West Virginia has not drawn such a distinction here, as its Constitution and laws provide that all property of the kind held by petitioners shall be taxed uniformly according to its estimated market value.  There is no suggestion that the State has in practice adopted a different system that authorizes individual counties to independently fashion their own substantive assessment policies.  The Webster County assessor has, apparently on her own initiative, applied state tax law in a manner resulting in significant and persistent disparity in assessed value between petitioners' and similarly situated property.  The intentional systematic undervaluation of such other property unfairly deprives petitioners of their rights under the Clause.  Pp.  488 U. S. 344-346.
3. The State might on its own initiative remove the discrimination against petitioners by raising the assessments of systematically and intentionally undervalued property in the same class.  A taxpayer in petitioners' position, however, forced to litigate for redress, may not be remitted by the State to the remedy of seeking to have the assessments of the undervalued property raised.

No. 86-1940
Argued November 7, 1988
Decided January 18, 1989
488 U.S. 347

Syllabus 
In an attempt to alleviate a financial crisis plaguing petitioner local union (Local), which is an affiliate of petitioner international union (International), the International's president appointed Richard Hawkins as trustee to supervise the Local's affairs, with authority under the International's constitution to suspend the Local's officers and business representatives.  Five days after a special meeting at which the Local's membership defeated Hawkins' proposal to increase their dues, Hawkins notified respondent Lynn, an elected business representative of the Local, that he was being removed ""indefinitely"" from his position because of his outspoken opposition to the proposal at the meeting.  After exhausting his intraunion remedies, Lynn brought suit in Federal District Court, claiming that his removal violated the free speech provision of Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA or Act).  The court granted summary judgment for petitioners under Finnegan v. Leu, 456 U. S. 431, which held that the discharge of a union's appointed business agents by the union president, following his election over the incumbent for whom the business agents had campaigned, did not violate Title I.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Finnegan did not control where the dismissed union official was elected, rather than appointed, and rejecting the contention that Lynn's removal was valid because it was carried out under Hawkins' authority as trustee.
Held:  The removal of an elected business agent, in retaliation for statements he made at a union meeting in opposition to a dues increase sought by the union trustee, violates the LMRDA.  Pp.  488 U. S. 352-359.
(a) Petitioners' argument is unpersuasive that Lynn's status as an elected, rather than an appointed, official is immaterial, and that the loss of his union employment cannot amount to a Title I violation because he remains a member of the Local and was not prevented from attending the special meeting, expressing his views on the dues proposal, or casting his vote.  Even though Lynn was not actually prevented from exercising such Title I rights, his removal interfered with those rights by forcing him to chose between them and his job.  Moreover, in contrast to the discharge of an appointed union official, the removal of an elected 
Page 488 U. S. 348
 official denies the members who voted for him the representative of their choice, and has a more pronounced chilling effect upon their exercise of their own Title I rights, thereby contravening the LMRDA's basic objective of ensuring that unions are democratically governed and responsive to the will of the membership, which must be free to discuss union policies and criticize the leadership without fear of reprisal.  Finnegan, supra, distinguished.
(b) The cause of action of an elected union official removed for exercising his Title I rights is not affected by the fact that the removal is carried out during a trusteeship lawfully imposed under Title III of the Act.  Nothing in the LMRDA's language or legislative history suggests that Title I rights are lost whenever a trusteeship is imposed.  Given this congressional silence, a trustee's Title III authority ordinarily should be construed in a manner consistent with Title I's protections.  As petitioners concede, the imposition of a trusteeship does not destroy the critical right to vote on dues increases which Title I guarantees to local union members.  That right would not be meaningful if a trustee were able to control the members' debate over the issue.  In the instant case, Lynn's statements concerning the proposed dues increase were entitled to protection, since nothing in the International's constitution suggests that the imposition of the trusteeship changed the nature of his office so that he was obligated to support Hawkins' positions.

Syllabus 
Because the existing indeterminate sentencing system resulted in serious disparities among the sentences imposed by federal judges upon similarly situated offenders and in uncertainty as to an offender's actual date of release by Executive Branch parole officials, Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act), which, inter alia, created the United States Sentencing Commission as an independent body in the Judicial Branch with power to promulgate binding sentencing guidelines establishing a range of determinate sentences for all categories of federal offenses and defendants according to specific and detailed factors.  After the District Court upheld the constitutionality of the Commission's resulting Guidelines against claims by petitioner Mistretta, who was under indictment on three counts centering in a cocaine sale, that the Commission was constituted in violation of the separation-of-powers principle, and that Congress had delegated excessive authority to the Commission to structure the Guidelines, Mistretta pleaded guilty to a conspiracy-to-distribute count, was sentenced under the Guidelines to 18 months' imprisonment and other penalties, and filed a notice of appeal.  This Court granted his petition and that of the United States for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals in order to consider the. Guidelines' constitutionality.
Held:  The Sentencing Guidelines are constitutional, since Congress neither (1) delegated excessive legislative power to the Commission nor (2) violated the separation-of-powers principle by placing the Commission in the Judicial Branch, by requiring federal judges to serve on the Commission and to share their authority with nonjudges, or by empowering the President to appoint Commission members and to remove them for cause.  The Constitution's structural protections do not prohibit Congress from delegating to an expert body within the Judicial Branch the intricate task of formulating sentencing guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as is present here, nor from calling upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of the Judicial Branch in creating policy on a matter uniquely within the ken of judges.

No. 87-1160
Argued November 7, 1988
Decided January 11, 1989
488 U.S. 299

Syllabus 
In 1967, appellant Pennsylvania electric utilities joined a venture to construct seven nuclear generating units.  But in 1980, because of intervening events, including the Arab oil embargo and the accident at Three Mile Island, the participants canceled plans for construction of four of the plants.  Thereafter appellant Duquesne Light Co. applied to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to obtain a rate increase and to amortize its expenditures on the canceled plants over 10 years.  The PUC granted a rate increase that included an amount representing the first payment of the 10-year amortized recovery of Duquesne's costs in the aborted plants.  Shortly before the close of the rate proceeding, a state law (Act 335) was enacted that provided that an electric utility's cost of construction of a generating facility shall not be made part of a ratebase nor otherwise included in rates charged until such time as the facility ""is used and useful in service to the public.""  The State Office of the Consumer Advocate moved the PUC to reconsider in light of this law, but the PUC, on reconsideration, affirmed its original rate order, reading the new law as excluding the costs of canceled plants from the ratebase, but not as preventing their recovery through amortization.  Meanwhile, the PUC similarly granted appellant Pennsylvania Power Co. a rate increase, and authorized it to amortize its share of the canceled plants over a 10-year period.  The Consumer Advocate appealed both PUC decisions to the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court, which held that the PUC had correctly construed Act 336.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed, holding that Act 336 prohibited recovery of the costs in question either by inclusion in the ratebase or by amortization, and that the statute did not take appellants' property in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court remanded the case to the PUC for further proceedings to correct its rate orders, giving effect to the exclusion required by Act 336.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to decide the case under 28 U.S.C.  1267(2), which authorizes the Court to review by appeal
""[f]inal judgments . . . rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution . . .  
Page 488 U. S. 300
 and the decision is in favor of its validity.""
Although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings to revise the rate orders, that court's judgment is final for purposes of this Court's appellate jurisdiction.  The state court's last word on Act 336's constitutionality has been presented, and all that remains is the straightforward application of its clear directive to otherwise complete rate orders.  Pp.  488 U. S. 306-307.
2. A state scheme of utility regulation, such as is involved here, does not ""take"" property simply because it disallows recovery of capital investments that are not ""used and useful in service to the public.""  Pp.  488 U. S. 307-316.
(a) Under the ""prudent investment"" or ""historical cost"" rule, a utility is compensated for all prudent investments at their actual cost when made (their ""historical"" cost), irrespective of whether individual investments are deemed necessary or beneficial in hindsight.  It was ruled in FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, that historical cost was a valid basis on which to calculate utility compensation.  Pp.  488 U. S. 307-312.
(b) The Constitution does not require that subsidiary aspects of Pennsylvania's ratemaking methodology be examined piecemeal, as appellants argue.  State legislatures are competent bodies to set utility rates, and the PUC is essentially an administrative arm of the legislature.  Similarly, an otherwise reasonable rate is not subject to constitutional attack by questioning the theoretical consistency of the method that produced it, as appellants do here by noting Act 335's theoretical inconsistency in suddenly and selectively applying the ""used and useful requirement,"" normally associated with the fair value method of ratesetting, in the context of Pennsylvania's system based on historical costs.  Pp.  488 U. S. 313-314.
(c) In this case, at all relevant times, Pennsylvania's rate system has been predominantly, but not entirely, based on historical costs, and it has not been shown that the rate orders in question, as modified by Act 335, failed to give a reasonable rate of return on equity given the risk under such a regime.  Therefore, Act 335's limited effect on those rate orders does not result in constitutionally impermissible rates.  Pp.  488 U. S. 314-315.
(d) But adoption of the ""prudent investment"" rule as the single constitutional standard of valuation would be inconsistent with the view of the Constitution that this Court has taken since Hope Natural Gas, and would unnecessarily foreclose alternatives that could benefit both consumers and investors.  The Constitution, within broad limits, leaves the States free to decide what ratesetting methodology best meets their needs in balancing the interests of the utility and the public.  Pp.  488 U.

Syllabus 
Two years after the last of the complained-of events occurred, petitioner, an officer of a local chapter of respondent union, filed suit against the union and various of its officers, alleging that they had violated his right to free speech as to union matters under  101(a)(2) of Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA).  There is no statute of limitations expressly applicable to  101 actions.  The District Court denied respondents' summary judgment motion, rejecting their argument that petitioner had filed his suit out of time and holding that the action was governed by North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions.  The Court of Appeals reversed, construing DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, to require that petitioner's  101(a)(2) claim be governed by the 6-month statute of limitations set forth in  10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) for filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board.

(a) The well-established general rule requires that the most closely analogous state statute of limitations be borrowed for a federal cause of action not supplied by Congress with its own limitations period.  However, a narrow exception to that rule requires the application of a statute of limitations from elsewhere in federal law when the analogous state statute will frustrate or significantly interfere with federal policies, the federal law clearly provides a closer analogy, and the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation render the federal rule significantly more appropriate.

(b) The general borrowing rule requires that state general or residual personal injury statutes of limitations be applied to  101(a)(2) suits.

S. 235, where it was held that suits under 42 U.S.C.  1983, which also protects the exercise of First Amendment rights, are governed by state general or residual personal injury statutes of limitations.  Moreover, since such state limitations periods are of sufficient length to accommodate the practical difficulties faced by  101(a)(2) plaintiffs -- which include identifying the injury, deciding in the first place to sue and thereby to antagonize union leadership, and finding an attorney -- the practicalities of litigation do not require a search for a more analogous statute of limitations.  Pp.  488 U. S. 325-327.
(c) The narrow exception to the general borrowing rule does not require the adoption of the  10(b) limitations period for  101(a)(2) claims.  Respondents' argument to the contrary fails to take seriously the requirement that analogous state statutes of limitations are to be used unless they frustrate or significantly interfere with federal policies.  The 6-month  10(b) statute of limitations was crafted to accommodate federal interests in stable bargaining relationships between employers and unions and in private dispute resolution under collective bargaining agreements.  Insofar as those interests are implicated by  101(a)(2) claims, however, the relationship will generally be tangential or remote -- as in the present case, which involves an internal union dispute that can have only an indirect impact on economic relations between union and employer and on labor peace.  More importantly, the core federal interest furthered by  101(a)(2) -- the interest in union democracy promoted by union members' free speech and assembly rights -- simply had no part in the design of the  10(b) statute of limitations for unfair labor practice charges.  Indeed, Title I of the LMRDA was a response to a perception that the NLRA, including its unfair labor practices provisions, had failed to provide the necessary protections for free speech and other union members' rights.

Argued November 2, 1988
Decided January 11, 1989
488 U.S. 319

Syllabus 
Two years after the last of the complained-of events occurred, petitioner, an officer of a local chapter of respondent union, filed suit against the union and various of its officers, alleging that they had violated his right to free speech as to union matters under  101(a)(2) of Title I of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA).  There is no statute of limitations expressly applicable to  101 actions.  The District Court denied respondents' summary judgment motion, rejecting their argument that petitioner had filed his suit out of time and holding that the action was governed by North Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions.  The Court of Appeals reversed, construing DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, to require that petitioner's  101(a)(2) claim be governed by the 6-month statute of limitations set forth in  10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) for filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board.
Held:  Section 101(a)(2) claims are governed by state general or residual personal injury statutes of limitations.  Pp.  488 U. S. 323-334.

Syllabus 
Twenty-two months after respondent was allegedly unlawfully arrested and beaten by petitioners, two State University of New York police officers, he brought suit against them in the Federal District Court, seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 on the ground that he had sustained personal injuries, mental anguish, shame, humiliation, legal expenses, and the deprivation of his constitutional rights.  In denying petitioners' motion to dismiss the suit as time-barred, the court rejected their contention that  1983 actions were governed by New York's 1-year statute of limitations covering assault, battery, false imprisonment, and five other intentional torts.  The court concluded instead that the State's 3-year residual statute of limitations for personal injury claims not embraced by specific statutes of limitations was applicable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Where state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering  1983 claims should borrow the State's general or residual personal injury statute of limitations.  Pp.  488 U. S. 239-250.
(a) Although Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.

Pp.  488 U. S. 239-242.
(b) In light of Wilson's practical approach of eliminating uncertainty by providing ""one simple, broad characterization"" of all  1983 actions, id. at  471 U.

In contrast, every State has one general or residual personal injury statute of limitations, which is easily identifiable by language or application.  Petitioners' argument that intentional tort limitations periods should be borrowed because such torts are most analogous to  1983 claims fails to recognize the enormous practical disadvantages of such a selection in terms of the confusion and unpredictability the selection would cause for potential  1983 plaintiffs and defendants.

Syllabus 
In light of recent technological changes creating billions of possible electronic paths that an interstate telephone call can take from one point to another, which paths are often indirect, typically bear no relation to state boundaries, and are virtually impossible to trace and record, Illinois passed its Telecommunications Excise Tax Act (Tax Act), which, inter alia, imposes a 5% tax on the gross charges of interstate telecommunications originated or terminated in the State and charged to an Illinois service address, regardless of where a particular call is billed or paid; provides a credit to any taxpayer upon proof that another State has taxed the same call; and requires telecommunications retailers, like appellant GTE Sprint Communications Corporation (Sprint), to collect the tax from consumers.  The Illinois trial court held that the tax violates the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution in a class action brought by appellant Illinois residents, who were subject to and paid the tax, against appellee Director of the State's Department of Revenue and various long-distance telephone carriers, including Sprint, which crossclaimed against the Director.  However, the State Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the tax satisfies the four-pronged test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, and its progeny, for determining compliance with the Commerce Clause.  All parties concede in this Court that the tax satisfies the first prong of the Complete Auto test; i.e., it is applied to an activity having a substantial nexus with Illinois.
Held:  The Illinois tax does not violate the Commerce Clause, since it satisfies the final three prongs of the Complete Auto test.  Pp.  488 U. S. 259-267.
(a) The tax is fairly apportioned.  It is internally consistent, since it is so structured that, if every State were to impose an identical tax on only those interstate phone calls which are charged to an in-state service address, only one State would tax each such call and, accordingly, no multiple taxation would result.  The tax is also externally consistent even though it is assessed on the gross charges of an interstate activity, since 
Page 488 U. S. 253
 it is reasonably limited to the in-state business activity which triggers the taxable event in light of its practical or economic effects on interstate activity.  Because it is assessed on the individual consumer, collected by the retailer, and accompanies the retail purchase of an interstate call, the tax's economic effect is like that of a sales tax, such that it reasonably reflects the way that consumers purchase interstate calls and can permissibly be based on gross charges even though the retail purchase, which triggers simultaneous activity in several States, is not a purely local event.  Moreover, the risk of multiple taxation is low, since only two types of States -- a State like Illinois which taxes interstate calls billed to an in-state address and a State which taxes calls billed or paid in state -- have a substantial enough nexus to tax an interstate call.  In any event, actual multiple taxation is precluded by the Tax Act's credit provision.  Furthermore, an apportionment formula based on mileage or some other geographic division of interstate calls would produce insurmountable administrative and technical barriers, since such calls involve the intangible movement of electronic impulses through vast computerized networks.  Pp.  488 U. S. 260-265.
(b) The tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce by allocating a larger share of its burden to interstate calls, since that burden falls on in-state consumers, rather than on out-of-state consumers, and since, unlike mileage on state highways, the exact path of thousands of electronic signals can neither be traced nor recorded.  American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, distinguished.  Pp.  488 U. S. 265-266.
(c) The tax is fairly related to services which the State provides to the benefit of taxpayers.  Such services are not limited to those provided to telecommunications equipment used during interstate calls, but also include the ability to subscribe to telephone service and to own or rent telephone equipment at an address within the State, as well as police and fire protection and other general services.

488 U.S. 272

Syllabus 
At the conclusion of petitioner's direct testimony in his state court trial for murder and related offenses, the trial judge declared a 15-minute recess and ordered that petitioner not be allowed to talk to anyone, including his lawyer, during the break.  In affirming petitioner's conviction, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Geders v. United States, 425 U. S. 80 -- in which it was held that a trial court's order directing a defendant not to consult his attorney during an overnight recess, called while the defendant was on the witness stand, violated his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel -- did not require reversal, since this Court had there emphasized the fact that a defendant would ""normally confer"" with counsel during an overnight recess, and had explicitly disclaimed any intent to deal with limitations imposed in other circumstances.  The state court declared that, normally, counsel is not permitted to confer with his client between direct and cross-examination.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted petitioner a writ of habeas corpus, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Although agreeing with the District Court that Geders applied, and that constitutional error had occurred, the court disagreed with the lower court's ruling that a defendant subjected to a Geders violation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to have his conviction set aside.  The court concluded that petitioner's conviction should stand because the trial court's error was not prejudicial under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, in that the evidence against petitioner was overwhelming, and there was no basis for believing that his testimony on cross-examination would have been different had he been given an opportunity to confer with his counsel during the recess.
Held:
1. A showing of prejudice is not an essential component of a violation of the Geders rule, in light of the fundamental importance of the criminal defendant's constitutional right to be represented by counsel.  By citing Geders in distinguishing between direct governmental interference with that right and denial of the right by virtue of counsel's ineffective assistance, Strickland made clear that the complete denial of the right by the government is not subject to the kind of prejudice analysis that is appropriate 
Page 488 U. S. 273
 in determining whether the quality of a lawyer's performance itself has been constitutionally ineffective.  Pp.  488 U. S. 278-280.
2. However, the Federal Constitution does not compel a trial judge to allow a criminal defendant to confer with his attorney during a brief break in his testimony.  It is an empirical predicate of our system of justice that, quite apart from any question of unethical ""coaching,"" cross-examination of an uncounseled witness, whether the defendant or a nondefendant, following direct examination is more likely to lead to the discovery of truth than is cross-examination of a witness given time to pause and consult with his lawyer.  Thus, although it may be appropriate to permit such consultation in individual cases, the trial judge must nevertheless be allowed the discretion to maintain the status quo during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and his lawyer would relate exclusively to his ongoing testimony.  The long interruption in Geders was of a different character, because the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs during an overnight recess would encompass matters that the defendant does have a constitutional right to discuss with his lawyer -- such as the availability of other witnesses, trial tactics, or even the possibility of negotiating a plea bargain -- and the fact that such discussions will inevitably include some consideration of the defendant's ongoing testimony does not compromise that basic right in that instance.  Pp.  488 U. S. 280-285.

S. 668, in that the evidence against petitioner was overwhelming, and there was no basis for believing that his testimony on cross-examination would have been different had he been given an opportunity to confer with his counsel during the recess.
Held:
1. A showing of prejudice is not an essential component of a violation of the Geders rule, in light of the fundamental importance of the criminal defendant's constitutional right to be represented by counsel.  By citing Geders in distinguishing between direct governmental interference with that right and denial of the right by virtue of counsel's ineffective assistance, Strickland made clear that the complete denial of the right by the government is not subject to the kind of prejudice analysis that is appropriate

 in determining whether the quality of a lawyer's performance itself has been constitutionally ineffective.  Pp.  488 U. S. 278-280.
2. However, the Federal Constitution does not compel a trial judge to allow a criminal defendant to confer with his attorney during a brief break in his testimony.  It is an empirical predicate of our system of justice that, quite apart from any question of unethical ""coaching,"" cross-examination of an uncounseled witness, whether the defendant or a nondefendant, following direct examination is more likely to lead to the discovery of truth than is cross-examination of a witness given time to pause and consult with his lawyer.  Thus, although it may be appropriate to permit such consultation in individual cases, the trial judge must nevertheless be allowed the discretion to maintain the status quo during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and his lawyer would relate exclusively to his ongoing testimony.  The long interruption in Geders was of a different character, because the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs during an overnight recess would encompass matters that the defendant does have a constitutional right to discuss with his lawyer -- such as the availability of other witnesses, trial tactics, or even the possibility of negotiating a plea bargain -- and the fact that such discussions will inevitably include some consideration of the defendant's ongoing testimony does not compromise that basic right in that instance.  Pp.  488 U. S. 280-285.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 9, 1989
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 314, 2764 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., concurring), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition to determine the applicable standard for reviewing Brady violations in the sentencing phase of a capital trial.

 Petitioner Judith Ann Neelley was convicted of the capital offense of murder during a kidnaping. She did not deny that she had kidnaped and killed the victim. She testified, however, that she had acted at the direction and under the control of her husband, Alvin Neelley, who, petitioner contended, had physically and sexually abused her. Petitioner claimed that she was willing to do anything to avoid further abuse. A clinical psychologist 
Page 488 U.S. 1020 , 1021
 who had examined Neelley testified that she "" 'probably fits the battered women's syndrome to the most severe extent that [she had] seen.' "" The psychologist noted that "" 'Alvin's mental state was substituted' "" for petitioner's so that she had "" 'no intents of her own.' "" Neelley v. State, 494 So.2d 669, 681 (Ala.Crim.App.1985). 
 To substantiate her defense further, petitioner's attorney sought disclosure of evidence seized by investigators from her mobile home-in particular, several letters petitioner sent to her husband. These letters contained references to her husband's ""hypnotizing eyes"" and the fact that petitioner had been hearing her husband's voice by mental telepathy. One letter also contained the suggestion that petitioner believed her letters might lead her husband to kill her. The prosecution denied that it had such letters and the trial court denied petitioner's request. The jury subsequently imposed a sentence of life without parole. Although the trial judge found that petitioner ""was substantially influenced by her husband,"" he overruled the jury and sentenced petitioner to death. Id., at 693. 
 After petitioner's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, Ex parte Neelley, 494 So.2d 697 (1986), her attorney learned that the investigator who had seized the letters did not deliver them to the appropriate law enforcement officials. Petitioner then filed a motion for relief from conviction and sentence, contending, inter alia, that the State's failure to disclose the seized evidence violated her due process rights. As a preliminary matter, a state court found that the investigator's failure to disclose the letters could be imputed to the prosecutor. Brief in opposition 10. After reviewing the letters, however, the court concluded that "" 'there is no reasonable probability that any of the evidence would have altered either the guilt or punishment stage of petitioner's trial.'
