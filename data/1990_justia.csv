No. 89-1166
Argued Oct. 10, 1990
Decided Dec. 10, 1990
498 U.S. 168

Syllabus 
After petitioner employees were discharged from their jobs, they and petitioner union invoked the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreements between the union and respondent company.  Those agreements provide for voluntary grievance procedures, including arbitration, and reserve the parties' respective rights to resort to economic weapons when the procedures fail to resolve a dispute, but are silent as to judicial remedies.  Upon failure of the grievance procedures, petitioners filed an action under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), which provides a judicial remedy for the breach of a collective bargaining agreement.  The District Court granted the company's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the agreements brought about an inference that a strike or other job action was the perceived remedy for failure of successful resolution of a grievance absent agreed arbitration, such that recourse to the courts under  301 was barred.
Held:  Petitioners may seek a judicial remedy under  301.  While  301's strong presumption favoring judicial enforcement of collective bargaining agreements may be overcome whenever the parties expressly agree to a different method for adjustment of their disputes, Congress, in passing the LMRA, envisaged peaceful methods of dispute resolution.  Thus, the statute does not favor an agreement to resort to economic warfare rather than to mediation, arbitration, or judicial review.  A contract provision reserving the union's right to resort to economic weapons cannot be construed as an agreement to divest the courts of jurisdiction to resolve disputes.  Such an agreement would have to be written much more clearly.  Pp.  498 U. S. 172-176.

No. 89-5867
Argued Oct. 1, 1990
Decided Dec. 3, 1990
498 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
Petitioner Irwin filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that he had been unlawfully fired by respondent Veterans Administration on the basis of his race and disability.  The EEOC dismissed the complaint on March 19, 1987, mailing copies of a right-to-sue letter to both Irwin and his attorney.  Irwin received the letter on April 7.  His attorney received actual notice of the letter on April 10, having been out of the country when it was delivered to his office on March 23.  Forty-four days after his attorney's office received the letter and twenty-nine days after Irwin received his copy, he filed an action in the District Court, alleging, inter alia, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the complaint was not filed within the time specified by 42 U.S.C.  2000e-16(c), which provides that a complaint against the Federal Government must be filed within 30 days ""of receipt of notice of final action taken"" by the EEOC.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a notice of final action is ""received"" when the EEOC delivers its notice to a claimant or his attorney's offices, whichever comes first, and that the 30-day span operates as an absolute jurisdictional limit.
Held:
1. Irwin's complaint was untimely.  Section 2000e-16(c) requires that the EEOC's letter be ""received,"" but does not specify that receipt must be by the claimant, rather than by his representative.  Congress may depart from the common and established practice of providing notification through counsel only if it does so expressly.  Irwin's argument that there is a material difference between receipt by an attorney and receipt by his office for purposes of  2000e-16(c) is rejected.  Lower courts have consistently held that notice to an attorney's office which is acknowledged by a representative of that office qualifies as notice to the client, and the practical effect of a contrary rule would be to create uncertainty by encouraging factual disputes about when actual notice was received.  Pp.  498 U. S. 92-93.
2. Statutes of limitations in actions against the Government are subject to the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits 
Page 498 U. S. 90
 against private defendants.  Applying the same rule amounts to little, if any, broadening of a congressional waiver of sovereign immunity.  Pp.  498 U. S. 93-96.
3. Irwin's failure to file may not be excused under equitable tolling principles.  Federal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly in suits against private litigants, allowing tolling where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading or where he has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.  Such equitable tolling principles do not extend to Irwin's claim that his untimely filing should be excused because his attorney was out of the office when the notice was received and he filed within 30 days of the date he personally received notice, which is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.

|498 u.s. 103|"Moskal v. United States
No. 89-964
Argued Oct. 1, 1990
Decided Dec. 3, 1990
498 U.S. 103

Syllabus 
Petitioner participated in a ""title washing"" scheme in which automobile titles that had been altered to reflect rolled-back odometer mileage figures were sent from Pennsylvania to Virginia.  After Virginia authorities, unaware of the alterations, issued Virginia titles incorporating the false figures, Moskal received the ""washed"" titles in Pennsylvania, where they were used in connection with car sales to unsuspecting buyers.  Moskal was convicted of receiving two washed titles under 18 U.S.C.  2314, which prohibits the knowing transportation of ""falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities"" in interstate commerce.  (Emphasis added.)  In affirming Moskal's conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected his contention that, because the washed titles were genuine, inasmuch as the Virginia officials who issued them did not know of the falsity, the titles therefore were not ""falsely made.""
Held:  A person who receives genuine vehicle titles, knowing that they incorporate fraudulently tendered odometer readings, receives those titles knowing them to have been ""falsely made"" in violation of  2314.  Pp.  498 U. S. 106-118.
(a) Moskal misconstrues the doctrine of lenity when he contends that because it is possible to read  2314 as applying only to forged or counterfeited securities, and because some courts have so read it, this Court should simply resolve the issue in his favor under that doctrine.  The doctrine applies only to those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute's intended scope even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute.  Such factors demonstrate that  2314 unambiguously applies to Moskal's conduct.  Pp.  498 U. S. 106-108.
(b) Both the plain meaning of the words ""falsely made"" and the legislative purpose underlying them provide ample support for applying  2314 to a fraudulent scheme for washing vehicle titles.  The quoted words are broad enough, on their face, to encompass washed titles containing fraudulently tendered odometer readings, since such titles are made to contain false, or incorrect, information.  The fact that the state officials responsible for issuing such titles did not know that they were incorporating false readings is irrelevant, since  2314 liability depends on transporting the ""falsely made"" security with unlawful or fraudulent intent, 
Page 498 U. S. 104
 and not on the scienter of the person who physically produces the security.  Moskal's construction of  2314 as excluding any security that is ""genuine"" or valid deprives the ""falsely made"" phrase of any meaning independent of the statutory terms ""forged"" and ""counterfeited,"" and therefore violates the established principle that a court should give effect, if possible, to every clause or word of a statute.  That ""falsely made"" encompasses genuine documents containing false information is also supported by  2314's purpose of curbing the type of trafficking in fraudulent securities that depends for its success on the exploitation of interstate commerce to avoid detection by individual states, such as a title washing operation. The fact that the legislative history contains references to counterfeit securities but not to odometer rollback schemes does not require a different conclusion, since, in choosing the broad phrase ""falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities,"" Congress sought to reach a class of frauds that exploited interstate commerce.  This Court has never required that every permissible application of a statute be expressly referred to in its legislative history.  Moreover, the Court's  2314 precedents specifically reject constructions that limit the statute to instances of fraud, rather than the class of fraud encompassed by its language.  See United States v. Sheridan, 329 U. S. 379,  329 U. S. 390,  329 U. S. 391; McElroy v. United States, 455 U. S. 642,  455 U. S. 655,  455 U. S. 656,  455 U. S. 658.   498 U. S.  108-114.
(c) The foregoing reading of  2314 is not precluded by the principle of statutory construction requiring that, where a federal criminal statute uses a common law term of established meaning without otherwise defining it, the term must generally be given that meaning.  Although, at the time Congress enacted the relevant clause of  2314, many courts had interpreted ""falsely made"" to exclude documents that were false only in content, that interpretation was not universal, other courts having taken divergent views.  Where no fixed usage existed at common law, it is more appropriate to inquire which of the common law readings of the term best accords with the overall purpose of the statute, rather than simply to assume, for example, that Congress adopted the reading that was followed by the largest number of common law courts.  Moreover, Congress' general purpose in enacting a law may prevail over the ""common law meaning"" rule of construction.  Since the position of those common law courts that define ""falsely made"" to exclude documents that are false only in content does not accord with Congress' broad purpose in enacting  2314 -- namely to criminalize trafficking in fraudulent securities that exploits interstate commerce -- it is far more likely that Congress adopted the common law view of ""falsely made"" that encompasses ""genuine"" documents that are false in content.  Pp.  498 U. S. 114-118. 
Page 498 U. S. 105

(d) Moskal's policy arguments for narrowly construing ""falsely made"" are unpersuasive.  First, there is no evidence to suggest that States will deem washed titles automatically invalid -- thereby creating chaos in the stream of automobile commerce -- simply because federal law punishes those responsible for introducing such fraudulent securities into commerce.  Second, construing ""falsely made"" to apply to securities containing false information will not criminalize a broad range of ""innocent"" conduct.  A person who transports such securities in interstate commerce violates  2314 only if he does so with unlawful or fraudulent intent and if the false information is itself material, and conduct that satisfies these tests is not ""innocent.""

|498 u.s. 133|"Ingersoll-Rand Company v. McClendon
No. 89-1298
Argued Oct. 9, 1990
Decided Dec. 3, 1990
498 U.S. 133

Syllabus 
After petitioner company fired respondent McClendon, he filed a wrongful discharge action under various state law tort and contract theories, alleging that a principal reason for his termination was the company's desire to avoid contributing to his pension fund.  The Texas court granted the company summary judgment, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that McClendon's employment was terminable at will.  The State Supreme Court reversed and remanded for trial, holding that public policy required recognition of an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.  Therefore, recovery would be permitted in a wrongful discharge action if the plaintiff could prove that
""the principal reason for his termination was the employer's desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee's pension fund.""
In distinguishing federal cases holding similar claims preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the court reasoned that McClendon was seeking future lost wages, recovery for mental anguish, and punitive damages, rather than lost pension benefits.
Held:  ERISA's explicit language and its structure and purpose demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt a state common law claim that an employee was unlawfully discharged to prevent his attainment of benefits under an ERISA-covered plan.  Pp.  498 U. S. 137-145.
(a) The cause of action in this case is expressly preempted by  514(a) of ERISA, which broadly declares that that statute supersedes all state laws (including decisions having the effect of law) that ""relate to"" any covered employee benefit plan.  In order to prevail on the cause of action, as formulated by the Texas Supreme Court, a plaintiff must plead, and the trial court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and the employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the employment.  Because the existence of a plan is a critical factor in establishing liability, and the trial court's inquiry must be directed to the plan, this judicially created cause of action ""relate[s] to"" an ERISA plan.  Cf. Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,  486 U. S. 828, and Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1,  482 U. S. 12, 23 distinguished.  In arguing that the plan is irrelevant to the cause of action because all that is at issue is the employer's improper motive, McClendon misses the point, which is that, under the state court's analysis, there simply is no cause of action if there is no plan.  Similarly unavailing 
Page 498 U. S. 134
 is McClendon's argument that  514(c)(2) -- which defines ""State"" to include any state instrumentality purporting to regulate the terms and conditions of covered plans -- causes  514(a) to preempt only those state laws that affect plan terms, conditions, or administration, and not those that focus on the employer's termination decision.  That argument misreads  514(c)(2), and consequently misapprehends its purpose of expanding ERISA's general definition of ""State"" to ""include"" state instrumentalities whose actions might not otherwise be considered state law for preemption purposes; would render  514(a)'s ""relate to"" language superfluous, since Congress need only have said that ""all"" state laws would be preempted; and is foreclosed by this Court's precedents, see Mackey, supra, at  486 U. S. 828, and n. 2,  486 U. S. 829.  Preemption here is also supported by  514(a)'s goal of ensuring uniformity in pension law, since allowing state based actions like the one at issue might subject plans and plan sponsors to conflicting substantive requirements developed by the courts of each jurisdiction.  Pp.  498 U. S. 138-142.
(b) The Texas cause of action is also preempted because it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  McClendon's claim falls squarely within ERISA  510 which prohibits the discharge of a plan participant ""for the purpose of interfering with [his] attainment of any right . . . under the plan.""  However, that in itself does not imply preemption of state remedies absent ""special features"" warranting preemption.  See, e.g., English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72,  496 U. S. 87.  Such a ""special featur[e]"" exists in the form of  502(a), which authorizes a civil action by a plan participant to enforce ERISA's or the plan's terms, gives the federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of such actions, and has been held to be the exclusive remedy for rights guaranteed by ERISA, including those provided by  510, Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41,  481 U. S. 52,  481 U. S. 54-55.  Thus, the lower court's attempt to distinguish this case as not one within ERISA's purview is without merit.  Moreover, since there is no basis in  502(a)'s language for limiting ERISA actions to only those which seek ""pension benefits,"" it is clear that the relief requested here is well within the power of federal courts; the fact that a particular plaintiff is not seeking recovery of pension benefits is no answer to a preemption argument.  Pp.  498 U. S. 142-145.

			"|"Ingersoll-Rand Company v. McClendon
No. 89-1298
Argued Oct. 9, 1990
Decided Dec. 3, 1990
498 U.S. 133

Syllabus 
After petitioner company fired respondent McClendon, he filed a wrongful discharge action under various state law tort and contract theories, alleging that a principal reason for his termination was the company's desire to avoid contributing to his pension fund.  The Texas court granted the company summary judgment, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that McClendon's employment was terminable at will.  The State Supreme Court reversed and remanded for trial, holding that public policy required recognition of an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.  Therefore, recovery would be permitted in a wrongful discharge action if the plaintiff could prove that
""the principal reason for his termination was the employer's desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee's pension fund.""
In distinguishing federal cases holding similar claims preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the court reasoned that McClendon was seeking future lost wages, recovery for mental anguish, and punitive damages, rather than lost pension benefits.
Held:  ERISA's explicit language and its structure and purpose demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt a state common law claim that an employee was unlawfully discharged to prevent his attainment of benefits under an ERISA-covered plan.  Pp.  498 U. S. 137-145.
(a) The cause of action in this case is expressly preempted by  514(a) of ERISA, which broadly declares that that statute supersedes all state laws (including decisions having the effect of law) that ""relate to"" any covered employee benefit plan.  In order to prevail on the cause of action, as formulated by the Texas Supreme Court, a plaintiff must plead, and the trial court must find, that an ERISA plan exists and the employer had a pension-defeating motive in terminating the employment.  Because the existence of a plan is a critical factor in establishing liability, and the trial court's inquiry must be directed to the plan, this judicially created cause of action ""relate[s] to"" an ERISA plan.  Cf. Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,  486 U. S. 828, and Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1,  482 U. S. 12, 23 distinguished.  In arguing that the plan is irrelevant to the cause of action because all that is at issue is the employer's improper motive, McClendon misses the point, which is that, under the state court's analysis, there simply is no cause of action if there is no plan.  Similarly unavailing 
Page 498 U. S. 134
 is McClendon's argument that  514(c)(2) -- which defines ""State"" to include any state instrumentality purporting to regulate the terms and conditions of covered plans -- causes  514(a) to preempt only those state laws that affect plan terms, conditions, or administration, and not those that focus on the employer's termination decision.  That argument misreads  514(c)(2), and consequently misapprehends its purpose of expanding ERISA's general definition of ""State"" to ""include"" state instrumentalities whose actions might not otherwise be considered state law for preemption purposes; would render  514(a)'s ""relate to"" language superfluous, since Congress need only have said that ""all"" state laws would be preempted; and is foreclosed by this Court's precedents, see Mackey, supra, at  486 U. S. 828, and n. 2,  486 U. S. 829.  Preemption here is also supported by  514(a)'s goal of ensuring uniformity in pension law, since allowing state based actions like the one at issue might subject plans and plan sponsors to conflicting substantive requirements developed by the courts of each jurisdiction.  Pp.  498 U. S. 138-142.
(b) The Texas cause of action is also preempted because it conflicts directly with an ERISA cause of action.  McClendon's claim falls squarely within ERISA  510 which prohibits the discharge of a plan participant ""for the purpose of interfering with [his] attainment of any right . . . under the plan.""  However, that in itself does not imply preemption of state remedies absent ""special features"" warranting preemption.  See, e.g., English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72,  496 U. S. 87.  Such a ""special featur[e]"" exists in the form of  502(a), which authorizes a civil action by a plan participant to enforce ERISA's or the plan's terms, gives the federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction of such actions, and has been held to be the exclusive remedy for rights guaranteed by ERISA, including those provided by  510, Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41,  481 U. S. 52,  481 U. S. 54-55.  Thus, the lower court's attempt to distinguish this case as not one within ERISA's purview is without merit.  Moreover, since there is no basis in  502(a)'s language for limiting ERISA actions to only those which seek ""pension benefits,"" it is clear that the relief requested here is well within the power of federal courts; the fact that a particular plaintiff is not seeking recovery of pension benefits is no answer to a preemption argument.  Pp.  498 U. S. 142-145.

No. 89-6332
Argued Oct. 3, 1990
Decided Dec. 3, 1990
498 U.S. 146

Syllabus 
Petitioner Minnick was arrested on a Mississippi warrant for capital murder.  An interrogation by federal law enforcement officials ended when he requested a lawyer, and he subsequently communicated with appointed counsel two or three times.  Interrogation was reinitiated by a county deputy sheriff after Minnick was told that he could not refuse to talk to him, and Minnick confessed.  The motion to suppress the confession was denied, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court rejected his argument that the confession was taken in violation of, inter alia, his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, reasoning that the rule of Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 -- that once an accused requests counsel, officials may not reinitiate questioning ""until counsel has been made available"" to him -- did not apply, since counsel had been made available.
Held:  When counsel is requested, interrogation must cease, and officials may not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present, whether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.  In context, the requirement that counsel be ""made available"" to the accused refers not to the opportunity to consult with an attorney outside the interrogation room, but to the right to have the attorney present during custodial interrogation.  This rule is appropriate and necessary, since a single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his rights and from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and may increase as it is prolonged.  The proposed exception is inconsistent with Edwards' purpose to protect a suspect's right to have counsel present at custodial interrogation and with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, where the theory that the opportunity to consult with one's attorney would substantially counteract the compulsion created by custodial interrogation was specifically rejected.  It also would undermine the advantages flowing from Edwards' clear and unequivocal character.  Since, under respondent's formulation of the rule, Edwards' protection could be reinstated by a subsequent request for counsel, it could pass in and out of existence multiple times, a vagary that would spread confusion through the justice system and lead to a loss of respect for the underlying constitutional principle.  And such an exception would leave uncertain the sort of consultation required to displace Edwards.  In addition, allowing a suspect whose counsel is 
Page 498 U. S. 147
 prompt to lose Edwards' protection while one whose counsel is dilatory would not distort the proper conception of an attorney's duty to his client and set a course at odds with what ought to be effective representation.  Since Minnick's interrogation was initiated by the police in a formal interview which he was compelled to attend, after Minnick had previously made a specific request for counsel, it was impermissible.

 Andrew Edward ROBERTSON, petitionerv. CALIFORNIA. No. 90-5774. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 3, 1990
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of California. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 I would grant the petition for certiorari to determine whether petitioner's capital sentence was imposed in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
 In 1978, a California jury convicted petitioner Andrew Edward Robertson on two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Supreme Court of California reversed that judgment as to the penalty. People v. Robertson, 33 Cal.3d 21, 188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P. 2d 279 (1982). The second sentencing proceeding was assigned to Judge Roy E. Chapman. Robertson waived his right to be sentenced by a jury, and Judge Chapman sat as trier of fact during the second penalty phase. [ Robertson v. California 498 U.S. 1004 (1990) ][1004-Continued.] 
 Robertson introduced extensive evidence in mitigation. Among this was the testimony of his mother and sister concerning Robertson's difficult childhood, during which he allegedly suffered abuse at the hands of his father and stepfather. Through these witnesses, Robertson presented evidence that he had had developmental difficulties as a young child and was slow to walk and talk; that his parents were divorced when he was young; that his father subsequently had kidnaped him; that, upon being returned from the kidnaping, he had been cared for by a disturbed mother and a strict grandmother; and that at age nine he had been diagnosed as suffering from mild mental retardation with possible brain damage. See People v. Robertson, 48 Cal.3d 18, 32, 255 Cal.Rptr. 631, 636, 767 P.2d 1109, 1114, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 879d 169 (1989). Robertson, however, was again sentenced to death, and the California Supreme Court, by a divided vote, affirmed. 48 Cal.3d, at 64, 255 Cal.Rptr., at 1131, 767 P.2d, at 1136. 
 In December 1989, Robertson's counsel for the first time learned that Judge Chapman, prior to his going on the bench, had represented Robertson's mother, Lillian Goodin, in her divorce from Robertson's stepfather. App.D. to Brief in Opposition 1. The divorce proceeding was initiated by Robertson's stepfather in 1963 and involved extensive allegations by both parties of domestic violence and child abuse. In March 1963, Judge Chapman, then Lillian Goodin's attorney, sought a temporary restraining order against Robertson's stepfather, prohibiting him from ""threatening, molesting, injuring, harassing, or annoying [Goodin] and [Goodin's] children."" App.C. to Brief in Opposition 4. In 
Page 498 U.S. 1004 , 1005
 support of the request for a temporary restraining order, Robertson's mother executed a declaration attesting that Robertson's stepfather ""has struck and beat [Goodin], the minor child of [Goodin and the stepfather], and [Goodin's] children by a prior marriage."" Id., at 3. Judge Chapman withdrew from his representation of Robertson's mother on November 16, 1967. When interviewed by Robertson's counsel in 1989, Judge Chapman acknowledged that ""the court documents demonstrated that he had represented"" Goodin, but stated that he had no present recollection of the divorce proceeding, and that he believed that he had no independent recollection of them at the time of Robertson's sentencing. App.D to Brief in Opposition 2. 
 Immediately upon learning of the past representation, Robertson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court. After the California Supreme Court denied Robertson's petition, he filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. I would grant that petition. 
 Moreover, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits consideration during the sentencing phase of evidence that the defendant has not had an opportunity to rebut. Consequently, in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 358, 1204 (1977) (plurality opinion), the Court [498 U.S. 1004 , 1006]

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 December 3, 1990
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, Middle Division. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 This case presents the question whether harmless-error analysis applies when a jury is not instructed on an essential element of the offense. Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder for the rape and killing of Tara Stowe. During the guilt phase, the trial court charged the jury as to both premeditated murder and felony murder yet failed to give a definition of rape under state law. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty. On appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that it was error to omit a definition of the felony alleged to support first- degree murder. 793 S.W.2d 236, 249 (1990). The court further held that the omitted charge was so ""fundamental in nature"" that petitioner's failure to request a definition of rape at trial did not preclude a finding of error. Id., at 249. After noting that ""[t]he law is unsettled as to whether harmless error analysis is available when a trial court fails to instruct on an essential element of an offense,"" the court concluded that the omission of a rape instruction here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 249-250. The court reasoned that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction on the properly instructed charge of premeditated murder and that the same jury received a complete instruction as to the elements 
Page 498 U.S. 1007 , 1008
 of rape as an aggravating circumstance during the sentencing phase. Id., at 250. Having rejected this and numerous other contentions, the court affirmed the conviction and death sentence. 
 As the Tennessee Supreme Court noted, a conflict of authority exists concerning the availability of harmless-error analysis in this situation. Several Courts of Appeal have held that error resulting from a failure to give proper instructions on the essential elements of an offense cannot be harmless. Hoover v. Garfield Heights Municipal Court, 802 F.2d 168, 175- 179 (CA6 1986); United States v. Howard, 506 F.2d 1131, 1133-1134 (CA2 1974); United States v. Gaither, 440 F.2d 262, 264 (CADC 1971). Others have held that harmless-error analysis can apply. Redding v. Benson, 739 F.2d 1360 (CA8 1984), cert. denied 469 U.S. 1222d 352 (1985); Bell v. Watkins, 692 F.2d 999, 1004 (CA5 1982). The depth of this conflict underscores the importance of the question. Both considerations counsel for a grant of certiorari.

|498 u.s. 52|"FMC Corporation v. Holliday
No. 89-1048
Argued Oct. 2, 1990
Decided Nov. 27, 1990
498 U.S. 52

Syllabus 
After petitioner FMC Corporation's self-funded health care plan (Plan) paid a portion of respondent's medical expenses resulting from an automobile accident, FMC informed respondent that it would seek reimbursement under the Plan's subrogation provision from any recovery she realized in her Pennsylvania negligence action against the driver of the vehicle in which she was injured.  Respondent obtained a declaratory judgment in Federal District Court that  1720 of Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law -- which precludes reimbursement from a claimant's tort recovery for benefit payments by a program, group contract, or other arrangement -- prohibits FMC's exercise of subrogation rights.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which applies to employee welfare benefit plans such as FMC's, does not preempt  1720.
Held:  ERISA preempts the application of  1720 to FMC's Plan.
(a) ERISA's preemption clause broadly establishes as an area of exclusive federal concern the subject of every state law that ""relate[s] to"" a covered employee benefit plan.  Although the statute's saving clause returns to the States the power to enforce those state laws that ""regulat[e] insurance,"" the deemer clause provides that a covered plan shall not be ""deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in the business of insurance"" for purposes of state laws ""purporting to regulate"" insurance companies or insurance contracts.  Pp.  498 U. S. 56-58.
(b) Section 1720 ""relate[s] to"" an employee benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA's preemption provision, since it has both a ""connection with"" and a ""reference to"" such a plan.  See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,  463 U. S. 96-97.  Moreover, although there is no dispute that  1720 ""regulates insurance,"" ERISA's deemer clause demonstrates Congress' clear intent to exclude from the reach of the saving clause self-funded ERISA plans by relieving them from state laws ""purporting to regulate insurance.""  Thus, such plans are exempt from state regulation insofar as it ""relates to"" them.  State laws directed toward such plans are preempted because they relate to an employee benefit plan but are not ""saved"" because they do not regulate insurance.  
Page 498 U. S. 53

			"|"FMC Corporation v. Holliday
No. 89-1048
Argued Oct. 2, 1990
Decided Nov. 27, 1990
498 U.S. 52

Syllabus 
After petitioner FMC Corporation's self-funded health care plan (Plan) paid a portion of respondent's medical expenses resulting from an automobile accident, FMC informed respondent that it would seek reimbursement under the Plan's subrogation provision from any recovery she realized in her Pennsylvania negligence action against the driver of the vehicle in which she was injured.  Respondent obtained a declaratory judgment in Federal District Court that  1720 of Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law -- which precludes reimbursement from a claimant's tort recovery for benefit payments by a program, group contract, or other arrangement -- prohibits FMC's exercise of subrogation rights.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which applies to employee welfare benefit plans such as FMC's, does not preempt  1720.
Held:  ERISA preempts the application of  1720 to FMC's Plan.
(a) ERISA's preemption clause broadly establishes as an area of exclusive federal concern the subject of every state law that ""relate[s] to"" a covered employee benefit plan.  Although the statute's saving clause returns to the States the power to enforce those state laws that ""regulat[e] insurance,"" the deemer clause provides that a covered plan shall not be ""deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in the business of insurance"" for purposes of state laws ""purporting to regulate"" insurance companies or insurance contracts.  Pp.  498 U. S. 56-58.
(b) Section 1720 ""relate[s] to"" an employee benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA's preemption provision, since it has both a ""connection with"" and a ""reference to"" such a plan.  See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,  463 U. S. 96-97.  Moreover, although there is no dispute that  1720 ""regulates insurance,"" ERISA's deemer clause demonstrates Congress' clear intent to exclude from the reach of the saving clause self-funded ERISA plans by relieving them from state laws ""purporting to regulate insurance.""  Thus, such plans are exempt from state regulation insofar as it ""relates to"" them.  State laws directed toward such plans are preempted because they relate to an employee benefit plan but are not ""saved"" because they do not regulate insurance.

|498 u.s. 73|"Arcadia, Ohio v. Ohio Power Company
No. 89-1283
Argued Oct. 1, 1990
Decided Nov. 27, 1990
498 U.S. 73

Syllabus 
Respondent Ohio Power Co. is subject to the overlapping regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Federal Power Act (FPA).  In a series of orders authorizing Ohio Power to establish and capitalize an affiliate to secure and develop a reliable source of coal, the SEC specified that the price Ohio Power paid for such coal could be no greater than (and, in one order, equal to) the affiliate's actual costs.  Subsequently, FERC declared coal charges complying with this specification unreasonable, and thus unrecoverable in Ohio Power's rates to its wholesale customers, including petitioner municipalities, rejecting Ohio Power's argument that the SEC, by the above-mentioned orders, had ""approved"" the affiliate's charges, and that  318 of the FPA ousts FERC of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding FERC's disallowance of the charges to be precluded by  318, which is captioned ""Conflict of jurisdiction,"" and which provides that
""[i]f, with respect to the issue, sale, or guaranty of a, security, or assumption of obligation or liability in respect of a security, the method of keeping accounts, the filing of reports, or the acquisition or disposition of any security, capital assets, facilities, or any other subject matter, any person is subject both to a requirement of [PUHCA] and to a requirement of [the FPA], the [PUHCA] requirement . . . shall apply . . . , and such person shall not be subject to the [FPA] requirement . . . with respect to the same subject matter. . . .""
(Emphasis added.)
Held:
1. Section 318 has no application to this case.  The phrase ""or any other subject matter"" does not, as the lower court assumed, parallel the other listed subjects ""with respect to [which]"" duplicative agency requirements will trigger the preemption rule.  Rather, it is part of the phrase that reads ""the acquisition or disposition of any security, capital assets, facilities, or any other subject matter.""  Besides being more faithful to the precise words of the text, this reading allows  318 to take on a shape that gives meaning to what otherwise seems a random listing of specific subject matters (with ""any other subject matter"" tagged on at the end).  The section addresses conflicts of jurisdiction within four 
Page 498 U. S. 74
 areas of plainly parallel authority granted both to the SEC and FERC by particular sets of PUHCA and FPA sections.  This is confirmed by expert commentary and by the practice of FERC and its predecessor, which have never decided a  318 issue except in connection with orders promulgated under one of the four enumerated categories.  Thus,  318 applies only if the ""same subject matter"" as to which the duplicative requirements exist is one of those specifically enumerated, and not some different, more general ""other subject matter,"" as the lower court believed.  Even assuming that FERC's rate order affecting the sale of electric power qualifies as a requirement ""with respect to . . . the . . . disposition of . . . any other subject matter,"" it is still a requirement with respect to a different subject matter from Ohio Power's acquisition of its affiliate, which was the subject of the SEC orders.  Pp.  498 U. S. 77-85.
2. This Court expresses no view on, but leaves to the lower court to resolve, the arguments that FERC's decision violates its own regulation providing that the price of fuel purchased from an affiliate shall be deemed to be reasonable where subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body, and that the FERC-prescribed rate is not ""just and reasonable"" because it ""traps"" costs which the SEC has implicitly approved.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
Respondents, BRG of Georgia, Inc. (BRG), and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal and Professional Publications (HBJ), entered into an agreement under which BRG was given an exclusive license to market HBJ's tradename; HBJ agreed not to compete with BRG in Georgia, and BRG agreed not to compete with HBJ outside the State; and HBJ was entitled to receive $100 per student enrolled by BRG and 40% of revenues over $350.  Immediately after the parties entered into the agreement, the price for BRG's course increased from $150 to $400.  Petitioners, who contracted to take BRG's course, filed suit, contending that BRG;s price was enhanced by reason of the agreement in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The District Court held that the agreement was lawful, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The agreement between HBJ and BRG was unlawful on its face.  The agreement's revenue-sharing formula, coupled with the immediate price increase, indicate that the agreement was ""formed for the purposes and with the effect of raising"" the bar review course's prices in violation of the Sherman Act.  See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150,  310 U. S. 223.  Agreements between competitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are illegal, United States v.

 November 18, 1990
 On Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and on Application to Stay Restraining Orders Issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. 
 The application to stay restraining orders of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida presented to Justice KENNEDY and by him referred to the Court is denied. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice O'CONNOR joins, dissenting. 
 The issue raised by this petition is whether a trial court may enjoin publication of information alleged to threaten a criminal defendant's right to a fair trial without any threshold showing that the information will indeed cause such harm and that suppression is the only means of averting it. The District Court in this case entered an order enjoining petitioner Cable News Network (CNN) from broadcasting taped communications between respondent Manuel Noriega, a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding, and his counsel. United States v. Noriega, 752 F.Supp. 1032 ( 1990). The court entered this order without any finding that suppression of the broadcast was necessary to protect Noriega's right to a fair trial, reasoning that no such determination need be made unless CNN surrendered the tapes for the court's inspection. The Court of Appeals affirmed this conclusion. 917 F.2d 1543 (1991). [ Cable News Network, Inc. v. Noriega 498 U.S. 976 (1990) ][976-Continued.] 
 In my view, this case is of extraordinary consequence for freedom of the press. Our precedents make unmistakably clear that "" '[a]ny prior restraint on expression comes to this Court with a ""heavy presumption"" against its constitutional validity,' "" and that the proponent of this drastic remedy "" 'carries a heavy burden of showing justification for [its] imposition.' "" Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 558, 2802 (1976), quoting Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, 402 U.S. 415, 419, 1577 ( 1971) (citations omitted); accord, New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 714, 2141 (1971) (per curiam ). I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled with these teachings. Even more fundamentally, if the lower courts in this case are correct in their remarkable conclusion that publication can be automatically restrained pending application of the demanding test established by Nebraska Press, then I think it is imperative that we reexamine the premises and operation of Nebraska Press itself. I would grant the stay application and the petition for certiorari.

""protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.""
In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,  397 U. S. 364.  Petitioner Cage was convicted in Louisiana of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death.  In his trial's guilt phase, the jury was instructed that guilt must be found beyond a reasonable doubt, that reasonable doubt was ""such doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty"" and ""an actual substantial doubt,"" and that what was required was a ""moral certainty.""  In affirming Cage's conviction, the State Supreme Court rejected his argument that, inter alia, the instruction violated the Due Process Clause, and concluded that, ""taking the charge as a whole,"" reasonable persons would understand the reasonable doubt definition.
Held:  The instruction was contrary to the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" requirement articulated in Winship.  The words ""substantial"" and ""grave"" suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard.  When those statements are then considered with the reference to ""moral,"" rather than evidentiary, certainty, a reasonable juror, taking the charge as a whole, could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by the Due Process Clause.

ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
Respondents held thrift and passbook savings certificates, which were issued by debtor financial institutions and represented debtors' promise to repay moneys respondents had invested.  Within the 90-day period before debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, respondents redeemed some of the certificates.  They became debtors' creditors when they filed proofs of claims against the bankruptcy estates.  Subsequently, petitioner trustee instituted adversary proceedings to recover, as avoidable preferences, the payments which respondents had received.  After a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the payments were avoidable preferences, and the District Court affirmed.  The Court of Appeals, relying on Grandfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33, and Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, reversed, ruling that respondents were entitled to a jury trial in the preference action.
Held:  Respondents were not entitled to a jury trial.  By filing claims against the bankruptcy estate, respondents triggered the process of ""allowance and disallowance of claims,"" thereby subjecting themselves to the Bankruptcy Court's equitable power.  Grandfinanciera, 492 U.S. at  492 U. S. 58- 59, and n. 14.  Thus, the trustee's preference action became an integral part of the claims-allowance process, which is triable only in equity.  As such, there is no Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.  In contrast, a party who does not submit a claim against the estate is entitled to a jury trial as a preference defendant, since the trustee could recover the transfers only by filing what amounts to a legal action.  Ibid.  Accordingly, ""a creditor's right to a jury trial on a bankruptcy trustee's preference claim depends upon whether the creditor has submitted a claim against the estate,"" id. at  492 U.

No. 89-1158
Argued Oct. 3, 1990
Decided Nov. 6, 1990
498 U.S. 19

Syllabus 
Petitioner Miles, the mother and administratrix of the estate of a seaman killed by a fellow crew member aboard the vessel of respondents (collectively Apex), docked in an American port, sued Apex in District Court, alleging negligence under the Jones Act for failure to prevent the assault and breach of the warranty of seaworthiness under general maritime law for hiring a crew member unfit to serve.  After the court ruled, inter alia, that the estate could not recover the son's lost future income, the jury found that the ship was seaworthy, but that Apex was negligent. Although it awarded damages on the negligence claim to Miles for the loss of her son's support and services and to the estate for pain and suffering, the jury found that Miles was not financially dependent on her son, and was therefore not entitled to damages for loss of society.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of negligence by Apex.  As to the general maritime claim, the court ruled that the vessel was unseaworthy as a matter of law, but held that a nondependent parent may not recover for loss of society in a general maritime wrongful death action and that general maritime law does not permit a survival action for decedent's lost future earnings.
Held:
1. There is a general maritime cause of action for the wrongful death of a seaman.  The reasoning of Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375, which created a general maritime wrongful death cause of action, extends to suits for the death of true seamen despite the fact that Moragne involved a longshoreman.  Although true seamen, unlike longshoremen, are covered under the Jones Act provision creating a negligence cause of action against the seaman's employer for wrongful death, Moragne, supra, at  398 U. S. 396, n. 12, recognized that that provision is preclusive only of state remedies for death from unseaworthiness, and does not preempt a general maritime wrongful death action.  The Jones Act evinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime law, since it does not disturb seamen's general maritime claims for injuries resulting from unseaworthiness, and does not preclude the recovery for wrongful death due to unseaworthiness created by its companion statute, the Death On the High Seas Act (DOHSA).  Rather, the Jones Act establishes a uniform system of seamen's tort law.  As the Court concluded in Moragne, supra, at  398 U. S. 396, n. 12, that case's extension of the DOHSA wrongful death action from the high seas to territorial waters furthers, rather than hinders, uniformity in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction.  There is also little question that Moragne intended to create a general maritime wrongful death action applicable beyond the situation of longshoremen, since it expressly overruled The Harrisburg, 119 U. S. 199, which held that maritime law did not afford a cause of action for the wrongful death of a seaman, and since each of the ""anomalies"" to which the Moragne cause of action was directed -- particularly the fact that recovery was theretofore available for the wrongful death in territorial waters of a longshoreman, but not a true seaman -- involved seamen.  Pp.  498 U. S. 27-30.
2. Damages recoverable in a general maritime cause of action for the wrongful death of a seaman do not include loss of society.  This case is controlled by the logic of Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, 436 U. S. 618,  436 U. S. 625, which held that recovery for nonpecuniary loss, such as loss of society, is foreclosed in a general maritime action for death on the high seas because DOHSA, by its terms, limits recoverable damages in suits for wrongful death on the high seas to ""pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is brought"" (emphasis added).  Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U. S. 573, which allowed recovery for loss of society in a general maritime wrongful death action, applies only in territorial waters and only to longshoremen.  The Jones Act, which applies to deaths of true seamen as a result of negligence, allows recovery only for pecuniary loss, and not for loss of society, in a wrongful death action.  See Michigan Central R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59,  227 U. S. 69-71.  The Jones Act also precludes recovery for loss of society in this case involving a general maritime claim for wrongful death resulting from unseaworthiness, since it would be inconsistent with this Court's place in the constitutional scheme to sanction more expansive remedies for the judicially created unseaworthiness cause of action, in which liability is without fault, than Congress has allowed in cases of death resulting from negligence.  This holding restores a uniform rule applicable to all actions for the wrongful death of a seaman, whether under DOHSA, the Jones Act, or general maritime law.  Pp.  498 U. S. 30-33.
3. A general maritime survival action cannot include recovery for decedent's lost future earnings.  Even if a seaman's personal cause of action survives his death under general maritime law, the income he would have earned but for his death is not recoverable, because the Jones Act's survival provision limits recovery to losses suffered during the decedent's lifetime.  See, e.g., Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., 300 U. S. 342,  300 U. S. 347.  Since Congress has limited the survival right for seamen's injuries 
Page 498 U. S. 21
 resulting from negligence, this Court is not free, under its admiralty powers, to exceed those limits by creating more expansive remedies in a general maritime action founded on strict liability.  Pp.  498 U. S. 33-36.
882 F.2d 976, affirmed.
O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except SOUTER, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 October 17, 1990
 The application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to THE CHIEF JUSTICE and by him referred to the Court is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 This Court's approval of the death penalty has turned on the premise that given sufficient procedural safeguards the death penalty may be administered fairly and reliably. E.g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 195-196, and n. 47, 2935-36, and n. 47 ( 1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.). Wilbert Evans' plea to be spared from execution demonstrates the fallacy of this assumption. Notwithstanding the panoply of procedural protections afforded Evans by this Court's capital jurisprudence, Evans today faces an imminent execution that even the State of Virginia appears to concede is indefensible in light of the undisputed facts proffered by Evans. Because an execution under these circumstances highlights the inherently cruel and unusual character of capital punishment, I dissent. [ Evans v. Muncy 498 U.S. 927 (1990) ][927-Continued.] 
 I  
 Evans was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. At the sentencing phase, the jury's verdict was predicated on a single aggravating circumstance: that if allowed to live Evans would pose a serious threat of future danger to society. See Va. Code 19.2-264.4(C) ( 1990). Without this finding, Evans could not have been sentenced to death . See e.g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 313, 2764 (1972) (WHITE, J., concurring) (existence of aggravating circumstance ""distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed"" from those in which it is not is a constitutional prerequisite to death sentence); Gregg v. Georgia, supra, at 188-189 ( same).1 
Page 498 U.S. 927 , 928
 While Evans was on death row at the Mecklenberg Correctional Facility, an event occurred that casts grave doubt on the jury's prediction of Evans' future dangerousness. On May 31, 1984, six death row inmates at Mecklenberg attempted to engineer an escape. Armed with makeshift knives, these inmates took hostage 12 prison guards and 2 female nurses. The guards were stripped of their clothes and weapons, bound, and blindfolded. The nurses also were stripped of their clothes, and one was bound to an inmate's bed. 
 According to uncontested affidavits presented by guards taken hostage during the uprising, Evans took decisive steps to calm the riot, saving the lives of several hostages, and preventing the rape of one of the nurses. [Footnote 2] For instance, Officer Ricardo Holmes, who was bound by the escaping inmates and forced into a closet with other hostages, states that he heard Evans imploring to the escaping inmates, "" 'Don't hurt anybody and everything will be allright.' "" Officer Holmes continues: 
 Other guards taken hostage during the uprising verify Officer Holmes' judgment that Evans protected them and the other hostages from danger. According to Officer Prince Thomas, Evans interceded to prevent the rape of Nurse Ethyl Barksdale by one of the escaping inmates. Id., Exh. 9. Officer Harold Crutchfield affirms that Evans' appeals to the escapees not to harm anyone may have meant the difference between life and death for the hostages.

The guards were stripped of their clothes and weapons, bound, and blindfolded. The nurses also were stripped of their clothes, and one was bound to an inmate's bed. 
 According to uncontested affidavits presented by guards taken hostage during the uprising, Evans took decisive steps to calm the riot, saving the lives of several hostages, and preventing the rape of one of the nurses. [Footnote 2] For instance, Officer Ricardo Holmes, who was bound by the escaping inmates and forced into a closet with other hostages, states that he heard Evans imploring to the escaping inmates, "" 'Don't hurt anybody and everything will be allright.' "" Officer Holmes continues: 
 Other guards taken hostage during the uprising verify Officer Holmes' judgment that Evans protected them and the other hostages from danger. According to Officer Prince Thomas, Evans interceded to prevent the rape of Nurse Ethyl Barksdale by one of the escaping inmates. Id., Exh. 9. Officer Harold Crutchfield affirms that Evans' appeals to the escapees not to harm anyone may have meant the difference between life and death for the hostages. ""It is . . . my firm belief that if Evans had not been present during the escape, things may have blown up and people [498 U.S. 927 , 929]

 Supreme Court of the United States October 15, 1990
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice WHITE, dissenting. 
 One of the questions presented in this case is the nature of the agreement necessary to sustain a conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 1962(d). Section 1962(d) provides that ""[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c)"" of 1962. Here, petitioners were convicted under that statute for conspiring to violate 1962(a), which provides in relevant part: 
 ""It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity . . . to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce."" 
Page 498 U.S. 924 , 925
 Title 18 U.S.C. 1961(5) defines the term ""pattern of racketeering activity"" to require at least two acts of racketeering activity. 
 The trial court in this case instructed the jury that to convict petitioners of RICO conspiracy, the Government had to prove that "" 'each defendant agreed to personally commit or aid and abet two or more acts of racketeering in violation of Section 1962(a) or that each defendant agreed that another coconspirator would commit two or more acts of racketeering in violation of 1962(a).' "" 900 F.2d 748, 760 (emphasis added.) In affirming petitioners' convictions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit joined a majority of Courts of Appeals in holding that a conviction for RICO conspiracy does not require that the defendant personally agree to commit two or more predicate acts of racketeering; rather, it is sufficient if the defendant agrees to the commission of the predicate acts by another co-conspirator. See ibid. 
 As the Fourth Circuit acknowledged, ibid., two Courts of Appeals have adopted a contrary view, holding that a RICO conspiracy conviction requires that the defendant have agreed to personally commit two or more predicate acts. See United States v. Ruggiero, 726 F.2d 913, 921 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Rabito v. United States, 469 U.S. 831 (1984); United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1136 (CA1 1981), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1011 (1983). I have voted in the past to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on this issue. See Adams v. United States, 474 U.S. 971 (1985) (dissenting opinion). As I noted there, if the majority view is correct, ""Congress' intent is being frustrated in those circuits which adhere to the narrower view of RICO conspiracy."" Id., at 973. On the other hand, if the minority view is correct, ""defendants are being exposed to conviction for behavior Congress did not intend to reach under 1962(d)."" Ibid. To resolve the conflict, I would grant certiorari, limited to Question 5 presented in the petition for certiorari.

 Paul Gregory HOUSE, petitioner v. TENNESSEE. No. 90-5395. 
 Supreme Court of the United States October 9, 1990
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In both Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367 (1988), and McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433 (1990), we vacated a death sentence based on jury instructions that, reasonably construed, prevented the jury from considering any mitigating circumstance it did not unanimously find to exist. Because I believe the instructions in this case suffer from the same infirmity, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At the penalty phase of his capital proceeding, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could not impose the death penalty unless it found "" unanimously that one or more . . . aggravating circumstances have been proven."" Union Cty. C.C.A. No. 28, 1989 WL 152742 (Tenn.Crim.App., Dec. 15, 1989), p. 2 (emphasis added). Next, the judge directed the jury to "" consider as heretofore indicated any mitigating circumstances."" Id., at 3 ( emphasis added). The form provided to the jury for recording a death sentence stated, ""We, the jury, unanimously find that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to outweigh the statutory aggravating circumstance or circumstances. . . ."" Id., at 5 ( emphasis added).* Finding that the instructions did not require juror 
Page 498 U.S. 912 , 913
 unanimity on mitigating factors, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Id., at 6. 
 Assessment of petitioner's challenge to the disputed instructions is governed by our decisions in Mills v. Maryland, supra, and McKoy v. North Carolina, supra. In those decisions, we made clear that a rule preventing individual jurors from crediting mitigating circumstances not unanimously found to exist violated the cardinal principle of our capital jurisprudence that "" 'the sentencer may not . . . be precluded from considering ""any relevant mitigating evidence."" ' "" Mills, supra, 486 U.S ., at 374-375 (quoting Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4, 1671 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings v.

The only issue in this case is whether the instructions furnished to petitioner's jury should be viewed as imposing a unanimity requirement. 
 In my view, our decision in Mills speaks directly to this question.

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 This petition for certiorari presents the significant issue whether, and under what circumstances, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to judicially immunized testimony useful to establishing his defense . I have previously expressed my view that this Court should resolve the conflict of lower court authority on this question. See Autry v. McKaskle, 465 U.S. 1085, 1087-1088, and n. 3, 1460-1461, and n. 3 (1984) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari). This petition underscores the importance of settling that conflict because it frames the issue in the most compelling possible setting: the penalty phase of a capital proceeding. 
Page 498 U.S. 887 , 888
 Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At trial, petitioner requested the court to confer use immunity upon his girl friend, who declined on Fifth Amendment grounds to testify on petitioner's behalf. Petitioner proffered at both the guilt and the penalty phases that his girl friend's testimony would show that petitioner was mentally distressed at the time of the charged murder. The trial court refused to grant immunity, and the California Supreme Court affirmed its ruling. 
 The manner in which the California Supreme Court disposed of petitioner's claim highlights the confusion engendered by this Court's failure to resolve definitively the judicial immunity issue. Noting the conflict among the lower courts, the California Supreme Court sought to avoid the question of a criminal defendant's constitutional right to judicially immunized testimony by ruling that petitioner had failed to meet the threshold showing established by Government of Virgin Islands v. Smith, 615 F.2d 964, 972 (CA3 1980), the first decision to recognize such a right. ""[T]he proffered testimony,"" the court explained, 
 The court dismissed in similar terms petitioner's claim that he was entitled to have his girl friend's immunized testimony as mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of the capital trial: 
 ""Even assuming, without purporting to decide, that the trial court had the authority to confer use immunity on the proposed witness, we cannot conclude on this record that the court erred. There is nothing in the record to demonstrate [petitioner] was denied highly relevant mitigating evidence, or to reveal the nature of that evidence. Even assuming that the evidence would have generally related to [petitioner's] state of mind on the morning of the murder, we cannot find that the absence of [the girl friend's] testimony prejudiced [petitioner].

Syllabus 
During the years at issue, West Virginia imposed a gross receipts tax on persons selling tangible property wholesale, but exempted local manufacturers.  The State Tax Commissioner upheld the tax assessed on sales by appellant Ashland Oil, Inc., a Kentucky corporation, finding that the tax was constitutional.  While Ashland's appeal was pending in the State Circuit Court, this Court, in Armco, Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, invalidated the State's tax scheme as discriminatory against interstate commerce.  The Circuit Court granted Ashland summary judgment on the basis of Armco, but the State Supreme Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Armco did not apply retroactively.  On remand, the Circuit Court affirmed the Tax Commissioner's decision.
Held: Armco applies retroactively to the taxes assessed against Ashland under the rule advocated by either the dissent or the plurality in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167.  Under the dissent's reasoning, Armco applies retroactively because constitutional decisions apply retroactively to all cases on direct review.  Under the plurality's approach, the same result obtains because Armco neither overruled clear past precedent nor decided a wholly new issue of first impression and, thus, fails to meet the first prong of the retroactivity test of Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97,  404 U. S. 106-107.

ON APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY,

Syllabus 
During the years at issue, West Virginia imposed a gross receipts tax on persons selling tangible property wholesale, but exempted local manufacturers.  The State Tax Commissioner upheld the tax assessed on sales by appellant Ashland Oil, Inc., a Kentucky corporation, finding that the tax was constitutional.  While Ashland's appeal was pending in the State Circuit Court, this Court, in Armco, Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U.

The Circuit Court granted Ashland summary judgment on the basis of Armco, but the State Supreme Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Armco did not apply retroactively.  On remand, the Circuit Court affirmed the Tax Commissioner's decision.
Held: Armco applies retroactively to the taxes assessed against Ashland under the rule advocated by either the dissent or the plurality in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167.

Federal Communications Commission
Nos. 89-453, 89-700
Argued March 28, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 547

Syllabus 
These cases consider the constitutionality of two minority preference policies adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  First, the FCC awards an enhancement for minority ownership and participation in management, which is weighed together with all other relevant factors in comparing mutually exclusive applications for licenses for new radio or television broadcast stations.  Second, the FCC's so-called ""distress sale"" policy allows a radio or television broadcaster whose qualifications to hold a license have come into question to transfer that license before the FCC resolves the matter in a noncomparative hearing, but only if the transferee is a minority enterprise that meets certain requirements.  The FCC adopted these policies in an attempt to satisfy its obligation under the Communications Act of 1934 to promote diversification of programming, taking the position that its past efforts to encourage minority participation in the broadcast industry had not resulted in sufficient broadcast diversity, and that this situation was detrimental not only to the minority audience but to all of the viewing and listening public.  Metro Broadcasting, Inc., the petitioner in No. 89-453, sought review in the Court of Appeals of an FCC order awarding a new television license to Rainbow Broadcasting in a comparative proceeding, which action was based on the ruling that the substantial enhancement granted Rainbow because of its minority ownership outweighed factors favoring Metro.  The court remanded the appeal for further consideration in light of the FCC's separate, ongoing Docket 86-484 inquiry into the validity of its minority ownership policies.  Prior to completion of that inquiry, however, Congress enacted the FCC appropriations legislation for fiscal year 1988, which prohibited the FCC from spending any appropriated funds to examine or change its minority policies.  Thus, the FCC closed its Docket 86-484 inquiry and reaffirmed its grant of the license to Rainbow, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc., one of the respondents in No. 89-700, 
Page 497 U. S. 548
 sought review in the Court of Appeals of an FCC order approving Faith Center, Inc.'s distress sale of its television license to Astroline Communications Company Limited Partnership, a minority enterprise.  Disposition of the appeal was delayed pending resolution of the Docket 86484 inquiry by the FCC, which, upon closing that inquiry as discussed supra, reaffirmed its order allowing the distress sale to Astroline.  The court then invalidated the distress sale policy, ruling that it deprived Shurberg, a nonminority applicant for a license in the relevant market, of its right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment.
Held:  The FCC policies do not violate equal protection, since they bear the imprimatur of longstanding congressional support and direction and are substantially related to the achievement of the important governmental objective of broadcast diversity.  Pp.  497 U. S. 563-601.
(a) It is of overriding significance in these cases that the minority ownership programs have been specifically approved -- indeed mandated -- by Congress.  In light of that fact, this Court owes appropriate deference to Congress' judgment, see Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448,  448 U. S. 472-478,  448 U. S. 490,  448 U. S. 491 (opinion of Burger, C.J.); id. at  448 U. S. 500-510,  448 U. S. 515-516, n. 14 (Powell, J., concurring); id. at  448 U. S. 517-520 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment), and need not apply strict scrutiny analysis, see id. at  448 U. S. 474 (opinion of Burger, C.J.); id. at  448 U. S. 519 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment).  Benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress -- even if those measures are not ""remedial"" in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination -- are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.  Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, distinguished and reconciled.  Pp.  497 U. S. 563-566.
(b) The minority ownership policies serve an important governmental objective.  Congress and the FCC do not justify the policies strictly as remedies for victims of demonstrable discrimination in the communications media, but rather have selected them primarily to promote broadcast diversity.  This Court has long recognized as axiomatic that broadcasting may be regulated in light of the rights of the viewing and listening audience, and that the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the public welfare.  Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1,  326 U. S. 20.  Safeguarding the public's right to receive a diversity of views and information over the airwaves is therefore an integral component of the FCC's mission, serves important First Amendment values, and is, at the very least, an important governmental objective that is a sufficient basis for the policies in question.  Pp.  497 U. S. 566-568. 
Page 497 U. S. 549

(c) The minority ownership policies are substantially related to the achievement of the Government's interest in broadcast diversity.  First, the FCC's conclusion that there is an empirical nexus between minority ownership and greater diversity, which is consistent with its longstanding view that ownership is a prime determinant of the range of programming available, is a product of its expertise and is entitled to deference.  Second, by means of the recent appropriations legislation and by virtue of a long history of support for minority participation in the broadcasting industry, Congress has also made clear its view that the minority ownership policies advance the goal of diverse programming.  Great weight must be given to the joint determination of the FCC and Congress.  Pp.  497 U. S. 569-579.
(d) The judgment that there is a link between expanded minority ownership and broadcast diversity does not rest on impermissible stereotyping.  Neither Congress nor the FCC assumes that, in every case, minority ownership and management will lead to more minority-oriented programming or to the expression of a discrete ""minority viewpoint"" on the airwaves.  Nor do they pretend that all programming that appeals to minorities can be labeled ""minority"" or that programming that might be so described does not appeal to nonminorities.  Rather, they maintain simply that expanded minority ownership of broadcast outlets will, in the aggregate, result in greater broadcast diversity.  This judgment is corroborated by a host of empirical evidence suggesting that an owner's minority status influences the selection of topics for news coverage and the presentation of editorial viewpoint, especially on matters of particular concern to minorities, and has a special impact on the way in which images of minorities are presented.  In addition, studies show that a minority owner is more likely to employ minorities in managerial and other important roles where they can have an impact on station policies.  The FCC's policies are thus a product of analysis, rather than a stereotyped reaction based on habit.  Cf. Fullilove, supra, 448 U.S. at  448 U. S. 604, n. 4.  The type of reasoning employed by the FCC and Congress is not novel, but is utilized in many areas of the law, including the selection of jury venires on the basis of a fair cross section and the reapportionment of electoral districts to preserve minority voting strength.  Pp.  497 U. S. 579-584.
(e) The minority ownership policies are in other relevant respects substantially related to the goal of promoting broadcast diversity.  The FCC adopted and Congress endorsed minority ownership preferences only after long study, painstaking consideration of all available alternatives, and the emergence of evidence demonstrating that race-neutral means had not produced adequate broadcasting diversity.  Moreover, the FCC did not act precipitately in devising the policies, having undertaken 
Page 497 U. S. 550
 thorough evaluations in 1960, 1971, and 1978 before adopting them.  Furthermore, the considered nature of the FCC's judgment in selecting these particular policies is illustrated by the fact that it has rejected other more expansive types of minority preferences -- e.g., set-asides of certain frequencies for minority broadcasters.  In addition, the minority ownership policies are aimed directly at the barriers that minorities face in entering the broadcasting industry.  Thus, the FCC assigned a preference to minority status in the comparative licensing proceeding in order to compensate for a dearth of minority broadcasting experience.  Similarly, the distress sale policy addresses the problem of inadequate access to capital by effectively lowering the sale price of existing stations and the problem of lack of information regarding license availability by providing existing licensees with an incentive to seek out minority buyers.  The policies are also appropriately limited in extent and duration and subject to reassessment and reevaluation before renewal, since Congress has manifested its support for them through a series of appropriations acts of finite duration, and has continued to hold hearings on the subject of minority ownership.  Provisions for administrative and judicial review also guarantee that the policies are applied correctly in individual cases and that there will be frequent opportunities to revisit their merits.  Finally, the policies impose only slight burdens on nonminorities.  Award of a preference contravenes no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation of competing applicants, since the limited number of frequencies available means that no one has First Amendment right to a license, and the granting of licenses requires consideration of public interest factors.  Nor does the distress sale policy impose an undue burden on nonminorities, since it may be invoked only with respect to a small fraction of broadcast licenses, only when the licensee chooses to sell out at a low price rather than risk a hearing, and only when no competing application has been filed.  It is not a quota or fixed quantity set-aside, and nonminorities are free to compete for the vast remainder of other available license opportunities.  Pp.  497 U. S. 584-600.

|497 u.s. 639|"Walton v. Arizona
No. 88-7351
Argued January 17, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 639

Syllabus 
Petitioner Walton was found guilty in an Arizona court of first-degree murder and was sentenced in a separate sentencing hearing before the judge, as required by state law.  Under that law, the judge, inter alia, determines the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and ""shall impose"" a death sentence if he finds one or more of several enumerated aggravating circumstances and that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.  The burden is on the prosecution to establish the existence of aggravating circumstances and on the defendant to establish mitigating ones.  The judge sentenced Walton to death, after finding the presence of two aggravating circumstances -- that the murder was committed ""in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,"" and that it was committed for pecuniary gain -- and that, considering all of the mitigating factors urged by Walton, the mitigating circumstances did not call for leniency.  The State Supreme Court upheld the sentence.  In an independent review, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove the existence of both aggravating factors.  As to the first factor, the court noted that it had previously defined ""especially cruel"" to mean that the victim had suffered mental anguish before his death and had defined ""especially depraved"" to mean that the perpetrator had relished the murder, evidencing debasement or perversion.  The court also agreed that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to call for leniency and determined that the sentence was proportional to sentences imposed in similar cases.
Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, concluding:
1. Arizona's capital sentencing scheme does not violate the Sixth Amendment.  The Constitution does not require that every finding of fact underlying a sentencing decision be made by a jury rather than by a judge.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738,  494 U. S. 745; Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638.  Since Arizona's aggravating factors are standards to guide the making of the choice between verdicts of death and life imprisonment rather than ""elements of the offense,"" the judge's finding of any particular aggravating 
Page 497 U. S. 640
 circumstance does not require the death penalty, and the failure to find any particular aggravating circumstance does not preclude that penalty.  Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147.  Moreover, if the Constitution does not require that the finding of Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 -- that the defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill -- be proved as an element of the offense of capital murder and be made by a jury, it cannot be concluded that a State is required to denominate aggravating circumstances ""elements"" of the offense or permit only a jury to determine such circumstances' existence.  Pp.  497 U. S. 647-649.
2. The especially heinous, cruel or depraved aggravating circumstance, as construed by the State Supreme Court, furnishes sufficient guidance to the sentencer to satisfy the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court's definition of ""especially cruel"" is virtually identical to the construction approved in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,  486 U. S. 364-365.  Similarly, its definition of ""depraved"" cannot be faulted.  Although juries must be instructed in more than bare terms about an aggravating circumstance that is unconstitutionally vague on its face, trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply narrower definitions in their decisions.  Maynard v. Cartwright, supra, at  486 U. S. 358-359,  486 U. S. 363-364; Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,  446 U. S. 426, distinguished.  Walton's challenge to the State Supreme Court's proportionality review -- that it should be overturned because it did not distinguish his case from others in which the death sentence was not imposed -- is rejected.  Such review is not constitutionally required where, as here, the challenged factor has been construed in a manner to give the sentencer sufficient guidance.  Furthermore, the Constitution does not require this Court to look behind the state court's conclusion where it plainly undertook its review in good faith.  Pp.  497 U. S. 652-656.
Justice WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice O'CONNOR and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Parts III and IV:
1. Walton's Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights have not been violated by placing on him the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency, since Arizona's method of allocating the burdens of proof does not lessen the State's burden to prove the existence of aggravating circumstances.  Cf., e.g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228; Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684; Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, distinguished.  Pp.  497 U. S. 649-651.
2. Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S. 299, and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, foreclose Walton's argument that the state statute creates an unconstitutional presumption under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments that death is the proper sentence by requiring that the court ""shall impose"" the death penalty under the specified circumstances.  The statute neither precludes the court from considering any 
Page 497 U. S. 641
 type of mitigating evidence nor automatically imposes a death sentence for certain types of murder.  States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence in an attempt to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.  Pp.  497 U. S. 649-652.
Justice SCALIA concluded that he will no longer seek to apply, and will not, here or in the future, vote to uphold a claim based upon, the principle of Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, that the sentencer in a capital case may not be precluded from considering any mitigating factor.  This principle is rationally irreconcilable with the principle of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 -- that a sentencer's discretion to return a death sentence must be constrained by specific standards, so that the death penalty is not inflicted in a random and capricious fashion.  Furman requires constraints on the sentencer's discretion to ""impose"" the death penalty, while Woodson-Lockett forbids constraints on the sentencer's discretion to ""decline to impose"" it -- which are one and the same.  Although the Eighth Amendment's text arguably supports the view in Furman that unfettered discretion makes death sentences so random and infrequent as to make their imposition cruel and unusual, the Woodson-Lockett principle bears no relation to the Amendment's text.  Nor does the doctrine of stare decisis require adherence to Woodson-Lockett, since the objectives of the doctrine, certainty and predictability, have been demonstrably undermined rather than furthered by the attempt to rest a jurisprudence upon two incompatible principles.  Thus, even if correct, Walton's assertion that in two respects the state procedure deprived the sentencer of discretion to consider all mitigating circumstances cannot state an Eighth Amendment violation.  Pp.  497 U. S. 656-674.

			"|"Walton v. Arizona
No. 88-7351
Argued January 17, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 639

Syllabus 
Petitioner Walton was found guilty in an Arizona court of first-degree murder and was sentenced in a separate sentencing hearing before the judge, as required by state law.  Under that law, the judge, inter alia, determines the existence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and ""shall impose"" a death sentence if he finds one or more of several enumerated aggravating circumstances and that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.  The burden is on the prosecution to establish the existence of aggravating circumstances and on the defendant to establish mitigating ones.  The judge sentenced Walton to death, after finding the presence of two aggravating circumstances -- that the murder was committed ""in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner,"" and that it was committed for pecuniary gain -- and that, considering all of the mitigating factors urged by Walton, the mitigating circumstances did not call for leniency.  The State Supreme Court upheld the sentence.  In an independent review, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove the existence of both aggravating factors.  As to the first factor, the court noted that it had previously defined ""especially cruel"" to mean that the victim had suffered mental anguish before his death and had defined ""especially depraved"" to mean that the perpetrator had relished the murder, evidencing debasement or perversion.  The court also agreed that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to call for leniency and determined that the sentence was proportional to sentences imposed in similar cases.
Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and V, concluding:
1. Arizona's capital sentencing scheme does not violate the Sixth Amendment.  The Constitution does not require that every finding of fact underlying a sentencing decision be made by a jury rather than by a judge.  See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738,  494 U. S. 745; Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638.  Since Arizona's aggravating factors are standards to guide the making of the choice between verdicts of death and life imprisonment rather than ""elements of the offense,"" the judge's finding of any particular aggravating 
Page 497 U. S. 640
 circumstance does not require the death penalty, and the failure to find any particular aggravating circumstance does not preclude that penalty.  Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147.  Moreover, if the Constitution does not require that the finding of Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 -- that the defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill -- be proved as an element of the offense of capital murder and be made by a jury, it cannot be concluded that a State is required to denominate aggravating circumstances ""elements"" of the offense or permit only a jury to determine such circumstances' existence.  Pp.  497 U. S. 647-649.
2. The especially heinous, cruel or depraved aggravating circumstance, as construed by the State Supreme Court, furnishes sufficient guidance to the sentencer to satisfy the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court's definition of ""especially cruel"" is virtually identical to the construction approved in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,  486 U. S. 364-365.  Similarly, its definition of ""depraved"" cannot be faulted.  Although juries must be instructed in more than bare terms about an aggravating circumstance that is unconstitutionally vague on its face, trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply narrower definitions in their decisions.  Maynard v. Cartwright, supra, at  486 U. S. 358-359,  486 U. S. 363-364; Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,  446 U. S. 426, distinguished.  Walton's challenge to the State Supreme Court's proportionality review -- that it should be overturned because it did not distinguish his case from others in which the death sentence was not imposed -- is rejected.  Such review is not constitutionally required where, as here, the challenged factor has been construed in a manner to give the sentencer sufficient guidance.  Furthermore, the Constitution does not require this Court to look behind the state court's conclusion where it plainly undertook its review in good faith.  Pp.  497 U. S. 652-656.
Justice WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice O'CONNOR and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Parts III and IV:
1. Walton's Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights have not been violated by placing on him the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency, since Arizona's method of allocating the burdens of proof does not lessen the State's burden to prove the existence of aggravating circumstances.  Cf., e.g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228; Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684; Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, distinguished.  Pp.  497 U. S. 649-651.
2. Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S. 299, and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, foreclose Walton's argument that the state statute creates an unconstitutional presumption under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments that death is the proper sentence by requiring that the court ""shall impose"" the death penalty under the specified circumstances.  The statute neither precludes the court from considering any

 type of mitigating evidence nor automatically imposes a death sentence for certain types of murder.  States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence in an attempt to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.  Pp.  497 U. S. 649-652.
Justice SCALIA concluded that he will no longer seek to apply, and will not, here or in the future, vote to uphold a claim based upon, the principle of Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.

Syllabus 
Respondents, members of a political advocacy group, set up a table on a sidewalk near the entrance to a United States Post Office to solicit contributions, sell books and subscriptions to the organization's newspaper, and distribute literature on a variety of political issues.  The sidewalk is the sole means by which customers may travel from the parking lot to the post office building and lies entirely on Postal Service property.  When respondents refused to leave the premises, they were arrested and subsequently convicted by a Federal Magistrate of violating, inter alia, 39 CFR  232.1(h)(1), which prohibits solicitation on postal premises.  The District Court affirmed the convictions.  It rejected respondents' argument that  232.1(h)(1) violated the First Amendment, holding that the postal sidewalk was not a public forum and that the ban on solicitation is reasonable.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Finding that the sidewalk is a public forum and analyzing the regulation as a time, place, and manner restriction, it determined that the Government has no significant interest in banning solicitation and that the regulation is not narrowly tailored to accomplish the asserted governmental interest.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
866 F.2d 699, (CA4 1989) reversed.
Justice O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice SCALIA, concluded that the regulation, as applied, does not violate the First Amendment.
(a) Although solicitation is a recognized form of speech protected by the First Amendment, the Government may regulate such activity on its property to an extent determined by the nature of the relevant forum.  Speech activity on governmental property that has been traditionally open to the public for expressive activity or has been expressly dedicated by the Government to speech activity is subject to strict scrutiny.  Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45.  However, where the property is not a traditional public forum and the Government has not dedicated its property to First Amendment activity, such regulation is examined only for reasonableness.  Id. at  460 U. S. 46.  Pp.  497 U. S. 725-727. 
Page 497 U. S. 721

(b) Section 232.1(h)(1) must be analyzed under the standards applicable to nonpublic fora:  it must be reasonable and ""not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.""  Ibid.  The postal sidewalk is not a traditional public forum.  The fact that the sidewalk resembles the municipal sidewalk across the parking lot from the post office is irrelevant to forum analysis.  See Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828.  The sidewalk was constructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business, not as a public passageway.  Nor has the Postal Service expressly dedicated its sidewalk to any expressive activity.  Postal property has only been dedicated to the posting of public notices on designated bulletin boards.  A practice of allowing individuals and groups to leaflet, speak, and picket on postal premises and a regulation prohibiting disruptive conduct do not add up to such dedication.  Even conceding that the forum has been dedicated to some First Amendment uses, and thus is not a purely nonpublic forum, regulation of the reserved nonpublic uses would still require application of the reasonableness test.  Pp.  497 U. S. 727-730.
(c) It is reasonable for the Postal Service to prohibit solicitation where it has determined that the intrusion creates significant interference with Congress' mandate to ensure the most effective and efficient distribution of the mails.  The categorical ban is based on the Service's long, real-world experience with solicitation, which has shown that, because of continual demands from a wide variety of groups, administering a program of permits and approvals had distracted postal facility managers from their primary jobs.  Whether or not the Service permits other forms of speech, it is not unreasonable for it to prohibit solicitation on the ground that it inherently disrupts business by impeding the normal flow of traffic.  See Heffron v. ISKCON, 452 U. S. 640,  452 U. S. 653.  Confrontation by a person asking for money disrupts passage and is more intrusive and intimidating than an encounter with a person giving out information.  Even if more narrowly tailored regulations could be promulgated, the Service is only required to promulgate reasonable regulations, not the most reasonable or the only reasonable regulation possible.  Clearly, the regulation does not discriminate on the basis of content or viewpoint.  The Service's concern about losing customers because of the potentially unpleasant situation created by solicitation per se does not reveal an effort to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.  Pp.  497 U. S. 731-737.
Justice KENNEDY, agreeing that the regulation does not violate the First Amendment, concluded that it is unnecessary to determine whether the sidewalk is a nonpublic forum, since the regulation meets the traditional standards applied to time, place, and manner restrictions of protected expression.  See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 
Page 497 U. S. 722
 468 U. S. 288,  468 U. S. 293.  The regulation expressly permits respondents and all others to engage in political speech on topics of their choice and to distribute literature soliciting support, including money contributions, provided there is no in-person solicitation for immediate payments on the premises.  The Government has a significant interest in protecting the integrity of the purposes to which it has dedicated its property, that is, facilitating its customers' postal transactions.  Given the Postal Service's past experience with expressive activity on its property, its judgment that in-person solicitation should be treated differently from alternative forms of solicitation and expression should not be rejected.   497 U. S.  738-739.

No. 89-189
Argued Feb. 21, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 764

Syllabus 
In affirming respondent Jeffers' first-degree murder conviction and death sentence, the Arizona Supreme Court, inter alia, independently reviewed the evidence supporting the trial court's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstance that the crime was committed ""in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner.""  The court noted its recent ruling that the infliction of gratuitous violence on the victim is among the factors to be considered in determining whether the murder was ""especially heinous . . . and depraved,"" and found the presence of this factor in light of evidence that Jeffers had climbed on top of the dead victim and hit her in the face several times, causing additional wounds and bleeding.  Noting further that the apparent relish with which the defendant commits the murder is another relevant factor under its decisions, the court concluded that Jeffers' relish for his crime was evidenced by testimony that, while he was beating the dead victim, he called her a ""bitch"" and a ""dirty snitch"" and stated, as each blow landed, that ""[t]his one is for"" someone on whom he felt she had informed.  The Federal District Court denied Jeffers' habeas corpus petition.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the ""especially heinous . . . or depraved"" aggravating circumstance, as interpreted and narrowed by the State Supreme Court, was not void on its face, but vacated Jeffers' death sentence on the ground that the circumstance was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Arizona's construction of the ""especially heinous . . . or depraved"" aggravating circumstance in this case contravened Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,  446 U. S. 428, and Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,  486 U. S. 364.  There is no dispute here that the Arizona Supreme Court applied its narrowing construction to the facts of Jeffers' case.  More important, the Court of Appeals noted that the circumstance, as construed by the state courts, was not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  Even if it had not so held, Jeffers' claim that Arizona has not construed the circumstance in a constitutionally narrow manner is disposed of by Walton v. Arizona, ante, at  497 U. S. 652-655, which upheld, against a vagueness challenge, the precise aggravating circumstance at issue here.  Moreover, a claim identical to Jeffers' assertion that the aggravating circumstance may nevertheless be vague ""as applied"" 
Page 497 U. S. 765
 to him was rejected in Walton, supra, at  497 U. S. 655-656, which makes clear that if a State has adopted a constitutionally narrow construction of a facially vague aggravating circumstance and has applied that construction to the facts of the particular case, the fundamental constitutional requirement of channeling and limiting the capital sentencer's discretion has been satisfied.  Pp.  497 U. S. 773-780.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in conducting a de novo, case-by-case comparison of the facts of those cases with the facts of this case to decide Jeffers' as-applied challenge.  That challenge reduces, in essence, to a claim that the state court simply misapplied its own aggravating circumstance to the facts of Jeffers' case.  Because federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law, federal habeas review of a state court's application of a constitutionally narrowed aggravating circumstance is limited, at most, to determining whether the state court's finding was so arbitrary or capricious as to constitute an independent due process or Eighth Amendment violation.  In making that determination, the appropriate standard of review is the ""rational factfinder"" standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307,  443 U. S. 319, under which the federal court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether ""any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Under the standard, a rational factfinder could have found that Jeffers both relished his crime and inflicted gratuitous violence, given the evidence of his conduct toward the victim's body.  Pp.  497 U. S. 780-784.

1. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Arizona's construction of the ""especially heinous . . . or depraved"" aggravating circumstance in this case contravened Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,  446 U. S. 428, and Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,  486 U. S. 364.  There is no dispute here that the Arizona Supreme Court applied its narrowing construction to the facts of Jeffers' case.  More important, the Court of Appeals noted that the circumstance, as construed by the state courts, was not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  Even if it had not so held, Jeffers' claim that Arizona has not construed the circumstance in a constitutionally narrow manner is disposed of by Walton v. Arizona, ante, at  497 U. S. 652-655, which upheld, against a vagueness challenge, the precise aggravating circumstance at issue here.  Moreover, a claim identical to Jeffers' assertion that the aggravating circumstance may nevertheless be vague ""as applied"" 
Page 497 U. S. 765
 to him was rejected in Walton, supra, at  497 U. S. 655-656, which makes clear that if a State has adopted a constitutionally narrow construction of a facially vague aggravating circumstance and has applied that construction to the facts of the particular case, the fundamental constitutional requirement of channeling and limiting the capital sentencer's discretion has been satisfied.  Pp.  497 U. S. 773-780.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in conducting a de novo, case-by-case comparison of the facts of those cases with the facts of this case to decide Jeffers' as-applied challenge.  That challenge reduces, in essence, to a claim that the state court simply misapplied its own aggravating circumstance to the facts of Jeffers' case.  Because federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law, federal habeas review of a state court's application of a constitutionally narrowed aggravating circumstance is limited, at most, to determining whether the state court's finding was so arbitrary or capricious as to constitute an independent due process or Eighth Amendment violation.  In making that determination, the appropriate standard of review is the ""rational factfinder"" standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307,  443 U. S. 319, under which the federal court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether ""any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Under the standard, a rational factfinder could have found that Jeffers both relished his crime and inflicted gratuitous violence, given the evidence of his conduct toward the victim's body.  Pp.  497 U. S. 780-784.

No. 89-260
Argued April 18, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 805

Syllabus 
Respondent Wright was charged under Idaho law with two counts of lewd conduct with a minor, specifically her 5 1/2- and 2 1/2-year-old daughters.  At the trial, it was agreed that the younger daughter was not ""capable of communicating to the jury.""  However, the court admitted, under Idaho's residual hearsay exception, certain statements she had made to a pediatrician having extensive experience in child abuse cases.  The doctor testified that she had reluctantly answered questions about her own abuse, but had spontaneously volunteered information about her sister's abuse.  Wright was convicted on both counts, but appealed only from the conviction involving the younger child.  The State Supreme Court reversed, finding that the admission of the doctor's testimony under the residual hearsay exception violated Wright's rights under the Confrontation Clause.  The court noted that the child's statements did not fall within a traditional hearsay exception and lacked ""particularized guarantees of trustworthiness"" because the doctor had conducted the interview without procedural safeguards:  he failed to videotape the interview, asked leading questions, and had a preconceived idea of what the child should be disclosing.  This error, the court found, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
Held:  The admission of the child's hearsay statements violated Wright's Confrontation Clause rights.  Pp.  497 U. S. 813-827.
(a) Incriminating statements admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule are not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless the prosecution produces, or demonstrates the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use and unless the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability.  The reliability requirement can be met where the statement either falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or is supported by a showing of ""particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.""  Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56.  Although it is presumed here that the child was unavailable within the meaning of the Clause, the evidence will be barred unless the reliability requirement is met.  Pp.  497 U. S. 813-817.
(b) Idaho's residual hearsay exception is not a firmly rooted hearsay exception for Confrontation Clause purposes.  It accommodates ad hoc instances in which statements not otherwise falling within a recognized hearsay exception might be sufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial, 
Page 497 U. S. 806
 and thus does not share the same tradition of reliability supporting the admissibility of statements under a firmly rooted hearsay exception.  To rule otherwise would require that virtually all codified hearsay exceptions be found to assume constitutional stature, something which this Court has declined to do.  California v. Green, 399 U. S. 149,  399 U. S. 155-156.  Pp.  497 U. S. 817-818.
(c) In determining that ""particularized guarantees of trustworthiness"" were not shown, the State Supreme Court erred in placing dispositive weight on the lack of procedural safeguards at the interview, since such safeguards may in many instances be inappropriate or unnecessary to a determination whether a given statement is sufficiently trustworthy for Confrontation Clause purposes.  Rather, such trustworthiness guarantees must be shown from the totality of those circumstances that surround the making of the statement and render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.  As is the case with statements admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, see e.g., Green, supra, at  399 U. S. 161, evidence possessing ""particularized guarantees of trustworthiness"" must be so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.  In child abuse cases, factors used to determine trustworthiness guarantees --  such as the declarant's mental state and the use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age -- must relate to whether the child was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made.  The State's contention that evidence corroborating a hearsay statement may properly support a finding that the statement bears such trustworthiness guarantees is rejected, since this would permit admission of presumptively unreliable statements, such as those made under duress, by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial.  That result is at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility.  Also rejected is Wright's contention that the child's statements are per se or presumptively unreliable on the ground that the trial court found the child incompetent to testify at trial.  The court found only that she was not capable of communicating to the jury, and implicitly found that, at the time she made the statements, she was capable of receiving just impressions of the facts and of relating them truly.  Moreover, the Clause does not erect a per se rule barring the admission of prior statements of a declarant who is unable to communicate to the jury at the time of trial.  See, e. g., Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237,  156 U. S. 243-244.  Pp.  497 U. S. 818-825.
(d) In admitting the evidence, the trial court identified only two factors -- whether the child had a motive to make up her story and whether, given her age, the statements were of the type that one would expect a child to fabricate -- relating to circumstances surrounding the making of 
Page 497 U. S. 807
 the statements.  The State Supreme Court properly focused on the presumptive unreliability of the out-of-court statements and on the suggestive manner in which the doctor conducted his interview.  Viewing the totality of the circumstances, there is no special reason for supposing that the incriminating statements about the child's own abuse were particularly trustworthy.  Her statement about her sister presents a closer question.  Although its spontaneity and the change in her demeanor suggest that she may have been telling the truth, spontaneity may be an inaccurate indicator of trustworthiness where there has been prior interrogation, prompting, or manipulation by adults.  Moreover, the statement was not made under circumstances of reliability comparable to those required, for example, for the admission of excited utterances or statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.  Because the State does not challenge the State Supreme Court's determination that the Confrontation Clause error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, this Court will not revisit the issue.  Pp.  497 U. S. 825-827.
116 Idaho 382, 775 P.2d 1224 (1989), affirmed.

|497 u.s. 836|"Maryland v. Craig
No. 89-478
Argued April 18, 1990
Decided June 27, 1990
497 U.S. 836

Syllabus 
Respondent Craig was tried in a Maryland court on several charges related to her alleged sexual abuse of a six-year-old child.  Before the trial began, the State sought to invoke a state statutory procedure permitting a judge to receive, by one-way closed circuit television, the testimony of an alleged child abuse victim upon determining that the child's courtroom testimony would result in the child's suffering serious emotional distress such that he or she could not reasonably communicate.  If the procedure is invoked, the child, prosecutor, and defense counsel withdraw to another room, where the child is examined and cross-examined; the judge, jury, and defendant remain in the courtroom, where the testimony is displayed.  Although the child cannot see the defendant, the defendant remains in electronic communication with counsel, and objections may be made and ruled on as if the witness were in the courtroom.  The court rejected Craig's objection that the procedure's use violates the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, ruling that Craig retained the essence of the right to confrontation.  Based on expert testimony, the court also found that the alleged victim and other allegedly abused children who were witnesses would suffer serious emotional distress if they were required to testify in the courtroom, such that each would be unable to communicate.  Finding that the children were competent to testify, the court permitted testimony under the procedure, and Craig was convicted.  The State Court of Special Appeals affirmed, but the State Court of Appeals reversed.  Although it rejected Craig's argument that the Clause requires in all cases a face-to-face courtroom encounter between the accused and accusers, it found that the State's showing was insufficient to reach the high threshold required by Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012, before the procedure could be invoked.  The court held that the procedure usually cannot be invoked unless the child initially is questioned in the defendant's presence, and that, before using the one-way television procedure, the trial court must determine whether a child would suffer severe emotional distress if he or she were to testify by two-way television.
Held:
1. The Confrontation Clause does not guarantee criminal defendants an absolute right to a face-to-face meeting with the witnesses against 
Page 497 U. S. 837
 them at trial.  The Clause's central purpose, to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact, is served by the combined effects of the elements of confrontation:  physical presence, oath, cross-examination, and observation of demeanor by the trier of fact.  Although face-to-face confrontation forms the core of the Clause's values, it is not an indispensable element of the confrontation right.  If it were, the Clause would abrogate virtually every hearsay exception, a result long rejected as unintended and too extreme, Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56,  448 U. S. 63.  Accordingly, the Clause must be interpreted in a manner sensitive to its purpose and to the necessities of trial and the adversary process.  See, e.g., Kirby v. United States, 174 U. S. 47.  Nonetheless, the right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy, and only where the testimony's reliability is otherwise assured.  Coy, supra, at  487 U. S. 1021.  Pp.  497 U. S. 844-850.
2. Maryland's interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of its special procedure, provided that the State makes an adequate showing of necessity in an individual case.  Pp.  497 U. S. 851-857.
(a) While Maryland's procedure prevents the child from seeing the defendant, it preserves the other elements of confrontation and, thus, adequately ensures that the testimony is both reliable and subject to rigorous adversarial testing in a manner functionally equivalent to that accorded live, in-person testimony.  These assurances are far greater than those required for the admission of hearsay statements.  Thus, the use of the one-way closed circuit television procedure, where it is necessary to further an important state interest, does not impinge upon the Confrontation Clause's truth-seeking or symbolic purposes.  Pp.  497 U. S. 851-852.
(b) A State's interest in the physical and psychological wellbeing of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to outweigh, at least in some cases, a defendant's right to face his or her accusers in court.  The fact that most States have enacted similar statutes attests to widespread belief in such a public policy's importance, and this Court has previously recognized that States have a compelling interest in protecting minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment, see, e.g., Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U. S. 596,  457 U. S. 607.  The Maryland Legislature's considered judgment regarding the importance of its interest will not be second-guessed, given the State's traditional and transcendent interest in protecting the welfare of children and the growing body of academic literature 
Page 497 U. S. 838
 documenting the psychological trauma suffered by child abuse victims who must testify in court.  Pp.  497 U. S. 852-855.
(c) The requisite necessity finding must be case-specific.  The trial court must hear evidence and determine whether the procedure's use is necessary to protect the particular child witness' welfare; find that the child would be traumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the defendant's presence; and find that the emotional distress suffered by the child in the defendant's presence is more than de minimis.  Without determining the minimum showing of emotional trauma required for the use of a special procedure, the Maryland statute, which requires a determination that the child will suffer serious emotional distress such that the child cannot reasonably communicate, clearly suffices to meet constitutional standards.  Pp.  497 U. S. 855-857.
(d) Since there is no dispute that, here, the children testified under oath, were subject to full cross-examination, and were able to be observed by the judge, jury and defendant as they testified, admitting their testimony is consonant with the Confrontation Clause, provided that a proper necessity finding has been made.  P.  497 U. S. 857.
3. The Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it may have rested its conclusion that the trial court did not make the requisite necessity finding on the lower court's failure to observe the children's behavior in the defendant's presence and its failure to explore less restrictive alternatives to the one-way television procedure.  While such evidentiary requirements could strengthen the grounds for the use of protective measures, only a case-specific necessity finding is required.  This Court will not establish, as a matter of federal constitutional law, such categorical evidentiary prerequisites for the use of the one-way procedure.  Pp.  497 U. S. 857-860.

497 U.S. 871

Syllabus 
The National Wildlife Federation (hereinafter respondent) filed this action in the District Court against petitioners, the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal parties, alleging that, in various respects, they had violated the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in the course of administering the BLM's ""land withdrawal review program,"" and that the complained-of actions should be set aside because they were ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"" within the meaning of  10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.  706.  Under the program, petitioners make various types of decisions affecting the status of public lands and their availability for private uses such as mining, a number of which decisions were listed in an appendix to the complaint.  The court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, holding that respondent lacked standing to seek judicial review of petitioners' actions under the APA,  702. The court ruled that affidavits by two of respondent's members, Peterson and Erman, claiming use of public lands ""in the vicinity"" of lands covered by two of the listed decisions, were insufficient to confer standing as to those particular decisions, and that, even if they had been adequate for that limited purpose, they could not support respondent's attempted APA challenge to each of the 1,250 or so individual actions effected under the program.  The court rejected as untimely four more member affidavits pertaining to standing, which were submitted after argument on the summary judgment motion and in purported response to the District Court's postargument request for additional briefing.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Peterson and Erman affidavits were sufficient in themselves, that it was an abuse of discretion not to consider the four additional affidavits, and that standing to challenge the individual decisions conferred standing to challenge all such decisions.
Held:
1. The Peterson and Erman affidavits are insufficient to establish respondent's  702 entitlement to judicial review as ""[a] person . . . 
Page 497 U. S. 872
 adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.""  Pp.  497 U. S. 882-889.
(a) To establish a right to relief under  702, respondent must satisfy two requirements.  First, it must show that it has been affected by some ""agency action,"" as defined in  551(13).  See  701(b)(2).  Since neither the FLPMA nor NEPA provides a private right of action, the ""agency action"" in question must also be ""final agency action"" under  704.  Second, respondent must prove that it is ""adversely affected or aggrieved"" by that action ""within the meaning of a relevant statute,"" which requires a showing that the injury complained of falls within the ""zone of interests"" sought to be protected by the FLPMA and NEPA.  Cf. Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U. S. 388,  479 U. S. 396-397.  Pp.  497 U. S. 882-883.
(b) When a defendant moves for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to establish a right to relief under  702, the burden is on the plaintiff, under Rule 56(e), to set forth specific facts (even though they may be controverted by the defendant) showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Cf. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317,  477 U. S. 322.  Where no such showing is made, the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id. at  477 U. S. 323.  Pp.  497 U. S. 883-885.
(c) The specific facts alleged in the two affidavits do not raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether respondent has a right to relief under  702.  It may be assumed that the allegedly affected interests set forth in the affidavits -- ""recreational use and aesthetic enjoyment"" -- are sufficiently related to respondent's purposes that respondent meets  702's requirements if any of its members do.  Moreover, each affidavit can be read to complain of a particular ""agency action"" within  551's meaning; and whatever ""adverse effect"" or ""aggrievement"" is established by the affidavits meets the ""zone of interests"" test, since ""recreational use and aesthetic enjoyment"" are among the sorts of interests that the FLPMA and NEPA are designed to protect.  However, there has been no showing that those interests of Peterson and Erman were actually ""affected"" by petitioners' actions, since the affidavits alleged only that the affiants used unspecified lands ""in the vicinity of"" immense tracts of territory, only on some portions of which, the record shows, mining activity has occurred or probably will occur by virtue of the complained-of actions.  The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the District Court had to presume specific facts sufficient to support the general allegations of injury to the affiants, since such facts are essential to sustaining the complaint and, under Rule 56(e), had to be set forth by respondent.  United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U. S. 669, distinguished.  Pp.  497 U. S. 885-889. 
Page 497 U. S. 873

2. Respondent's four additional member affidavits did not establish its right to  702 review.  Pp.  497 U. S. 890-898.
(a) The affidavits are insufficient to enable respondent to challenge the entirety of petitioners' ""land withdrawal review program.""  That term does not refer to a single BLM order or regulation, or even to a completed universe of particular BLM orders and regulations, but is simply the name by which petitioners have occasionally referred to certain continuing (and thus constantly changing) BLM operations regarding public lands, which currently extend to about 1,250 individual decisions and presumably will include more actions in the future.  Thus, the program is not an identifiable ""agency action"" within  702's meaning, much less a ""final agency action"" under  704.  Absent an explicit congressional authorization to correct the administrative process on a systemic level, agency action is not ordinarily considered ""ripe"" for judicial review under the APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to manageable proportions, and its factual components fleshed out, by concrete action that harms or threatens to harm the complainant.  It may well be, due to the scope of the ""program,"" that the individual BLM actions identified in the affidavits will not be ""ripe"" for challenge until some further agency action or inaction more immediately harming respondent occurs.  But it is entirely certain that the flaws in the entire ""program"" cannot be laid before the courts for wholesale correction under the APA simply because one of them that is ripe for review adversely affects one of respondent's members.  Respondent must seek such programmatic improvements from the BLM or Congress.  Pp.  497 U. S. 890-894.
(b) The District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit the supplemental affidavits.  Since the affidavits were filed in response to the court's briefing order following the summary judgment hearing, they were untimely under, inter alia, Rule 6(d), which provides that ""opposing affidavits may be served not later than 1 day before the hearing.""  Although Rule 6(b) allows a court, ""in its discretion,"" to extend any filing deadline ""for cause shown,"" a post-deadline extension must be ""upon motion made,"" and is permissible only where the failure to meet the deadline ""was the result of excusable neglect.""  Here, respondent made no motion for extension, nor any showing of ""cause.""  Moreover, the failure to timely file did not result from ""excusable neglect,"" since the court's order setting the hearing on the summary judgment motion put respondent on notice that its right to sue was at issue, and that (absent proper motion) the time for filing additional evidentiary materials was, at the latest, the day before the hearing.  Even if the court could have overcome these obstacles to admit the affidavits, it was not compelled, in exercising its discretion, to do so.  Pp.  497 U. S. 894-898. 
Page 497 U. S. 874

3. Respondent is not entitled to seek  702 review of petitioners' actions in its own right.  The brief affidavit submitted to the District Court to show that respondent's ability to fulfill its informational and advocacy functions was ""adversely affected"" by petitioners' alleged failure to provide adequate information and opportunities for public participation with respect to the land withdrawal review program fails to identify any particular ""agency action"" that was the source of respondent's alleged injuries, since that program is not an identifiable action or event.  Thus, the affidavit does not set forth the specific facts necessary to survive a Rule 56 motion.  Pp.  497 U. S. 898-899.
278 U.S.App.D.C. 320, 878 F.2d 422, reversed.

No. 88-1503
Argued Dec. 6, 1989
Decided June 25, 1990
497 U.S. 261

Syllabus 
Petitioner Nancy Cruzan is incompetent, having sustained severe injuries in an automobile accident, and now lies in a Missouri state hospital in what is referred to as a persistent vegetative state:  generally, a condition in which a person exhibits motor reflexes but evinces no indications of significant cognitive function.  The State is bearing the cost of her care.  Hospital employees refused, without court approval, to honor the request of Cruzan's parents, copetitioners here, to terminate her artificial nutrition and hydration, since that would result in death.  A state trial court authorized the termination, finding that a person in Cruzan's condition has a fundamental right under the State and Federal Constitutions to direct or refuse the withdrawal of death-prolonging procedures, and that Cruzan's expression to a former housemate that she would not wish to continue her life if sick or injured unless she could live at least halfway normally suggested that she would not wish to continue on with her nutrition and hydration.  The State Supreme Court reversed.  While recognizing a right to refuse treatment embodied in the common-law doctrine of informed consent, the court questioned its applicability in this case.  It also declined to read into the State Constitution a broad right to privacy that would support an unrestricted right to refuse treatment and expressed doubt that the Federal Constitution embodied such a right.  The court then decided that the State Living Will statute embodied a state policy strongly favoring the preservation of life, and that Cruzan's statements to her housemate were unreliable for the purpose of determining her intent.  It rejected the argument that her parents were entitled to order the termination of her medical treatment, concluding that no person can assume that choice for an incompetent in the absence of the formalities required by the Living Will statute or clear and convincing evidence of the patient's wishes.
Held:
1. The United States Constitution does not forbid Missouri to require that evidence of an incompetent's wishes as to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment be proved by clear and convincing evidence.  Pp.  497 U. S. 269-285. 
Page 497 U. S. 262

(a) Most state courts have based a right to refuse treatment on the common law right to informed consent, see, e.g., In re Storar, 52 N.Y.2d 363, 438 N.Y.S.2d 266, 420 N.E.2d 64, or on both that right and a constitutional privacy right, see, e.g., Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz, 373 Mass. 728, 370 N.E.2d 417.  In addition to relying on state constitutions and the common law, state courts have also turned to state statutes for guidance, see, e.g., Conservatorship of Drabick, 200 Cal.App.3d 185, 245 Cal.Rptr. 840.  However, these sources are not available to this Court, where the question is simply whether the Federal Constitution prohibits Missouri from choosing the rule of law which it did.
(b) A competent person has a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in refusing unwanted medical treatment.  Cf., e.g., Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11,  197 U. S. 24-30.  However, the question whether that constitutional right has been violated must be determined by balancing the liberty interest against relevant state interests.  For purposes of this case, it is assumed that a competent person would have a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition.  This does not mean that an incompetent person should possess the same right, since such a person is unable to make an informed and voluntary choice to exercise that hypothetical right or any other right.  While Missouri has in effect recognized that, under certain circumstances, a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to withdraw hydration and nutrition and thus cause death, it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the surrogate's action conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent.  Pp.  497 U. S. 280-285,
(c) It is permissible for Missouri, in its proceedings, to apply a clear and convincing evidence standard, which is an appropriate standard when the individual interests at stake are both particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of money, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745,  455 U. S. 756.  Here, Missouri has a general interest in the protection and preservation of human life, as well as other, more particular interests, at stake.  It may legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of an individual's choice between life and death.  The State is also entitled to guard against potential abuses by surrogates who may not act to protect the patient.  Similarly, it is entitled to consider that a judicial proceeding regarding an incompetent's wishes may not be adversarial, with the added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings with it.  The State may also properly decline to make judgments about the ""quality"" of a particular individual's life, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.  It is self-evident that these interests are more substantial, both on 
Page 497 U. S. 263
 an individual and societal level, than those involved in a common civil dispute.  The clear and convincing evidence standard also serves as a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the litigants.  Missouri may permissibly place the increased risk of an erroneous decision on those seeking to terminate life-sustaining treatment.  An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance of the status quo, with at least the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its impact mitigated by an event such as an advancement in medical science or the patient's unexpected death.  However, an erroneous decision to withdraw such treatment is not susceptible of correction.  Although Missouri's proof requirement may have frustrated the effectuation of Cruzan's not-fully-expressed desires, the Constitution does not require general rules to work flawlessly.  Pp.  497 U. S. 280-285.
2. The State Supreme Court did not commit constitutional error in concluding that the evidence adduced at trial did not amount to clear and convincing proof of Cruzan's desire to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn.  The trial court had not adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard, and Cruzan's observations that she did not want to live life as a ""vegetable"" did not deal in terms with withdrawal of medical treatment or of hydration and nutrition.  P.  497 U. S. 285.
3. The Due Process Clause does not require a State to accept the ""substituted judgment"" of close family members in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the patient's.  This Court's decision upholding a State's favored treatment of traditional family relationships, Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, may not be turned into a constitutional requirement that a State must recognize the primacy of these relationships in a situation like this.  Nor may a decision upholding a State's right to permit family decisionmaking, Parham v. J.R., 442 U. S. 584, be turned into a constitutional requirement that the State recognize such decisionmaking.  Nancy Cruzan's parents would surely be qualified to exercise such a right of ""substituted judgment"" were it required by the Constitution.  However, for the same reasons that Missouri may require clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wishes, it may also choose to defer only to those wishes, rather than confide the decision to close family members.  Pp.  497 U. S. 285-287.

While Missouri has in effect recognized that, under certain circumstances, a surrogate may act for the patient in electing to withdraw hydration and nutrition and thus cause death, it has established a procedural safeguard to assure that the surrogate's action conforms as best it may to the wishes expressed by the patient while competent.  Pp.  497 U. S. 280-285,
(c) It is permissible for Missouri, in its proceedings, to apply a clear and convincing evidence standard, which is an appropriate standard when the individual interests at stake are both particularly important and more substantial than mere loss of money, Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745,  455 U. S. 756.  Here, Missouri has a general interest in the protection and preservation of human life, as well as other, more particular interests, at stake.  It may legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of an individual's choice between life and death.  The State is also entitled to guard against potential abuses by surrogates who may not act to protect the patient.  Similarly, it is entitled to consider that a judicial proceeding regarding an incompetent's wishes may not be adversarial, with the added guarantee of accurate factfinding that the adversary process brings with it.  The State may also properly decline to make judgments about the ""quality"" of a particular individual's life, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.  It is self-evident that these interests are more substantial, both on 
Page 497 U. S. 263
 an individual and societal level, than those involved in a common civil dispute.  The clear and convincing evidence standard also serves as a societal judgment about how the risk of error should be distributed between the litigants.  Missouri may permissibly place the increased risk of an erroneous decision on those seeking to terminate life-sustaining treatment.  An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance of the status quo, with at least the potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its impact mitigated by an event such as an advancement in medical science or the patient's unexpected death.  However, an erroneous decision to withdraw such treatment is not susceptible of correction.  Although Missouri's proof requirement may have frustrated the effectuation of Cruzan's not-fully-expressed desires, the Constitution does not require general rules to work flawlessly.  Pp.  497 U. S. 280-285.
2. The State Supreme Court did not commit constitutional error in concluding that the evidence adduced at trial did not amount to clear and convincing proof of Cruzan's desire to have hydration and nutrition withdrawn.  The trial court had not adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard, and Cruzan's observations that she did not want to live life as a ""vegetable"" did not deal in terms with withdrawal of medical treatment or of hydration and nutrition.  P.  497 U. S. 285.
3. The Due Process Clause does not require a State to accept the ""substituted judgment"" of close family members in the absence of substantial proof that their views reflect the patient's.  This Court's decision upholding a State's favored treatment of traditional family relationships, Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, may not be turned into a constitutional requirement that a State must recognize the primacy of these relationships in a situation like this.  Nor may a decision upholding a State's right to permit family decisionmaking, Parham v. J.R., 442 U. S. 584, be turned into a constitutional requirement that the State recognize such decisionmaking.  Nancy Cruzan's parents would surely be qualified to exercise such a right of ""substituted judgment"" were it required by the Constitution.  However, for the same reasons that Missouri may require clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wishes, it may also choose to defer only to those wishes, rather than confide the decision to close family members.  Pp.  497 U. S. 285-287.

497 U.S. 358

Syllabus 
A fire erupted in the washer/dryer area of petitioner Sisson's pleasure yacht while it was docked at a Lake Michigan marina, destroying the yacht and damaging several neighboring vessels and the marina.  Respondents filed claims against Sisson for over $275,000 in damages.  Invoking a Limited Liability Act provision that limits a vessel owner's liability for any damage done without the owner's privity or knowledge to the value of the vessel and its freight, Sisson filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Federal District Court to limit his liability to $800, his yacht's salvage value after the fire.  The court dismissed the petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, rejecting Sisson's argument that it had, inter alia, jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1333(1), which grants district courts maritime jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court has jurisdiction over Sisson's limitation claim pursuant to  1333(1).  Maritime jurisdiction is appropriate when a potential hazard to maritime commerce arises out of an activity that bears a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.  Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, 457 U. S. 668,  457 U. S. 675, n. 5.  The first half of the test -- that there be a potential hazard to maritime activity -- is met because the fire, which began on a noncommercial vessel at a marina on a navigable waterway, could have spread to nearby commercial vessels or made the marina inaccessible to such vessels.  Respondents' argument that the potential effect on maritime commerce was minimal because no commercial vessels were docked in the marina misunderstands the nature of the inquiry, which determines an activity's potential impact by examining its general character, not the actual effects on maritime commerce nor the particular facts about the incident that may have rendered it more or less likely to disrupt commercial activity.  See Executive Jet Aviation v. City of Cleveland, 409 U. S. 249, Foremost, supra.  In determining, as to the second half of the  test, whether there is a substantial relationship between the activity giving rise to the incident and traditional maritime activity, the relevant activity in this case was the storage and maintenance of a vessel at a marina on navigable waters.  A vessel's storage and maintenance is substantially related to a traditional maritime activity.  Respondents' contention that navigation is the sole instance, rather 
Page 497 U. S. 359
 than an example, of an activity substantially related to traditional maritime activity is incorrect.  Were navigation the only activity, Foremost could have stated the jurisdictional test much more clearly and economically.  Moreover, a narrow focus on navigation would not serve the federal policies underlying the jurisdictional test, since the need for uniform rules of maritime conduct and liability is not limited to navigation, but extends at least to any other activities traditionally undertaken by commercial or noncommercial vessels.

No. 74, Orig.
Argued Jan. 8, 1990

497 U.S. 376

Syllabus 
This suit involves a dispute between Georgia and South Carolina over the location of their boundary along the Savannah River, downstream from the city of Savannah and at the river's mouth, and their lateral seaward boundary.  In 1787, the parties agreed in the Treaty of Beaufort that the boundary along the river was the river's ""most northern branch or 
Page 497 U. S. 377
 stream,"" ""reserving all islands in [the river] to Georgia. . . .""  In 1922, the Treaty was interpreted to mean, inter alia, that where there is no island in the river, the boundary is midway between the banks, and where there is an island, the boundary is midway between the island and the South Carolina shore.  Georgia v. South Carolina, 259 U. S. 572.  The Special Master has submitted two Reports, making several boundary recommendations.  Both States have filed exceptions.
Held:
1. The Special Master's determination that the Barnwell Islands are in South Carolina is adopted.  Georgia's exception is overruled.  South Carolina has established sovereignty over the islands by prescription and acquiescence, as evidenced by its grant of the islands in 1813, and its taxation, policing, and patrolling of the property.  Georgia cannot avoid this evidence's effect by contending that it had no reasonable notice of South Carolina's actions.  Inaction alone may constitute acquiescence when it continues for a sufficiently long period, See Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 15 Pet. 233,  40 U. S. 274, and there has been more than inaction on Georgia's part.  It was charged with knowing that the Treaty placed all of the Savannah River islands in Georgia, yet, despite the fact that cultivation was readily discernible, there is virtually no record of its taxation of, or other sovereign action over, these lands.  A 1955 Court of Appeals' decision in a condemnation proceeding by the Federal Government, which recognized Georgia's sovereignty over the islands, cannot be regarded as fixing the boundary between the States.  Pp.  497 U. S. 388-393.
2. The Special Master's determination that the islands emerging in the river after the 1787 Treaty do not affect the boundary line between the States is adopted, and Georgia's exception is overruled.  Georgia's suggestion that the boundary in the vicinity of each new island runs between that island and the South Carolina shore would create a regime of continually shifting jurisdiction, by creating a new ""northern branch or stream"" for even the smallest emerging island no matter how near the South Carolina shoreline, and would frustrate the purpose of the Treaty, which purports to fix the boundary ""forever hereafter.""  Construing the Treaty to avoid sudden boundary changes would be more consistent with this language, and also comports with the simplicity and finality of the Court's 1922 reading of the Treaty and with the respect for settled expectations that generally attends the drawing of interstate boundaries, cf. Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,  148 U. S. 522-525.  Pp.  497 U. S. 394-398.
3. The Special Master's conclusion that Oyster Bed Island is in South Carolina and that the southern side of the Savannah's mouth is Tybee Island while the northern side is an underwater shoal is adopted.  Georgia's exception is overruled.  Customarily, a boundary would be drawn to an opposing headland.  However, due to the uncommon type of river mouth here, Tybee Island has no counterpart of high land on the northern side.  Rather, the geographical feature taking its place is the shoal, long recognized as confining the river.  To accept Georgia's proposition that the northern side should be the closest South Carolina headlands -- islands that are so distant that they cannot even be said to touch the river -- would result in having Georgia's waters lie directly seaward of South Carolina's coast and waters.  Pp.  497 U. S. 398-400.
4. In drawing the boundary line around islands on the South Carolina side of the river's thread, when the midline of the stream encounters an island and must move northward to become the line midway between the island bank and the South Carolina shore, the Special Master erred in invoking a right-angle principle -- i.e., using the line midway between the island and the shore until the island ends and the boundary reverts to the middle of the river, and then using right-angle lines to connect the island-to-bank center line with the bank-to-bank center line by the shortest distance.  Georgia's exception is sustained.  Georgia's approach -- to use a point ""triequidistant"" from the South Carolina shore, the island shore, and the Georgia shore, resulting in a boundary that would pass through this point and otherwise be equidistant from the South Carolina shore and the Georgia shore, or island -- is sensible, less artificial, fair to both States, and generally in line with what the Court said in 1922.  Pp.  497 U. S. 400-402.
5. The Special Master's determination that additions to Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal be awarded to Georgia is adopted, and South Carolina's exception is overruled.  The rapidity of some aspects of dredging and other processes used by the Army Corps of Engineers to improve the river's navigation channel support the Master's recommendation that the changes in the Savannah River were caused primarily by avulsion rather than the natural and gradual process of erosion and accretion.  Pp.  497 U. S. 402-405. 
Page 497 U. S. 378

6. Since the Special Master's Second Report clarified any confusion that may have existed with regard to how the recommended boundary line affects Bird Island, the boundary dispute as to this island has been eliminated, and South Carolina's exception, initially made, is overruled.  P.  497 U. S. 405.
7. The Special Master's determination of the lateral seaward boundary between the States is adopted.  His line continues down the river's mouth until it intersects a line, from Tybee Island's most northern point to Hilton Head Island's most southern point, where it proceeds out to sea perpendicularly to that line.  His recommendation gives equitable balance and recognition to the so-called equidistant principle, Texas v. Louisiana, 426 U. S. 465, and to the inland boundary between the States, and does so with the least possible offense to any claimed parallel between offshore territory and the coast itself.  The States' respective exceptions are overruled.  Pp.  497 U. S. 405-408.
Exceptions of South Carolina overruled; Exception of Georgia to Special Master's use of right-angle principle sustained; Other exceptions of Georgia overruled; Special Master's recommendations, as to which no exceptions have been taken or as to which exceptions have been advanced but overruled, are adopted.
BLACKMUN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and VIII, and the opinion of the Court with respect to Part IV, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined; with respect to Part V, in which BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and KENNEDY, J., joined except for a portion thereof; with respect to Part VI, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined; with respect to Part VII, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined; and with respect to Part IX, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, O'CONNOR, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined.

Syllabus 
Subdivision 2 of Minn.Stat.  144.343 provides that no abortion shall be performed on a woman under 18 years of age until at least 48 hours after both of her parents have been notified.  The two-parent notice requirement is mandatory unless, inter alia, the woman declares that she is a victim of parental abuse or neglect, in which event notice of her declaration must be given to the proper authorities.  Subdivision 6 provides that, if a court enjoins the enforcement of subdivision 2, the same two-parent notice requirement is effective unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders the abortion to proceed without notice upon proof by the minor that she is ""mature and capable of giving informed consent"" or that an abortion without notice to both parents would be in her best interest.  Two days before the statute's effective date, a group consisting of doctors, clinics, pregnant minors, and the mother of a pregnant minor filed suit in the District Court, alleging that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court declared the statute unconstitutional in its entirety, and enjoined its enforcement.  The Court of Appeals, sitting in banc, reversed.  Although it rejected the State's submission that subdivision 2's two-parent notice requirement was constitutional without any bypass procedure, the court held that subdivision 6 was valid and that its bypass procedure saved the statute as a whole.  The court also rejected the argument that the 48-hour waiting period imposed a significant burden on the minor's abortion right.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
853 F.2d 1452 (CA8 1988), affirmed.
Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IV, and VII, concluding that subdivision 2 of  144.343 violates the Constitution insofar as it requires two-parent notification.
(a) Since none of this Court's abortion decisions dealing with parental consent or notification statutes focused on the possible significance of making the consent or notice applicable to both parents instead of just 
Page 497 U. S. 418
 one, the District Court's extensive and unchallenged findings on the question are significant.  On the basis of extensive trial testimony, the District Court found, inter alia, that the two-parent notification requirement had particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent when the parents were divorced or separated, especially in the context of an abusive or dysfunctional family; that the requirement also had adverse effects in families in which the minor lives with both parents, particularly where family violence is a serious problem; that the requirement actually impairs family communication in many instances, since minors who otherwise would inform one parent were unwilling to do so when such notification would involve going to court for a bypass in any event; that few minors can take advantage of the abuse exception because of the obligation to report the information to the authorities and the attendant loss of privacy; and that the two-parent requirement did not further the State's interests in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity.  The court also found that, in many cases, the statutory 48-hour waiting period was extended to a week or more by scheduling considerations, thereby increasing the risk associated with the abortion to a statistically significant degree.  Pp.  497 U. S. 436-444.
(b) The requirement that both parents be notified, whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed responsibility for the upbringing of the child, does not reasonably further any legitimate state interest.  Any such interest in supporting the authority of a parent, who is presumed to act in the minor's best interest, to assure that the abortion decision is knowing, intelligent, and deliberate, would be fully served by a one-parent notification requirement as to functioning families, where notice to either parent would normally constitute notice to both.  As to the many families in which the parent notified would not notify the other parent, the State has no legitimate interest in questioning the first parent's judgment or in presuming him or her incompetent to make decisions regarding the child's health and welfare.  Moreover, as the record demonstrates, the two-parent requirement actually disserves the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with respect to the thousands of dysfunctional families affected by the statute, where the requirement proved positively harmful.  There is no merit to the argument that the two-parent requirement is justified because, in the ideal family, the minor should make her decision only after consultation with both parents, who should naturally be concerned with her welfare.  The State has no legitimate interest in conforming family life to a state-designed ideal by requiring family members to talk together.  Nor can the State's interest in protecting a parent's interest in shaping a child's values and lifestyle overcome the liberty interests of a minor acting with the consent of a single parent or court.  The combined force of the separate 
Page 497 U. S. 419
 interest of one parent and the minor's privacy interest outweighs the separate interest of the second parent, and the justification for any rule requiring parental involvement in the abortion decision rests entirely on the best interests of the child.  The fact that the two-parent requirement is virtually an oddity among state and federal consent provisions governing childrens' health, welfare, and education further demonstrates its unreasonableness and the ease with which the State can adopt less burdensome means to protect the minor's welfare.  Pp.  497 U. S. 450-455.
Justice STEVENS, joined by Justice O'CONNOR, concluded in Parts V and VI that:
1. Three separate but related interests are relevant to the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period and the two-parent notification requirement.  First, the State has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.  That interest justifies a state-imposed requirement that the minor notify and consult with a parent before terminating her pregnancy.  See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post, at  497 U. S. 510-511.  Second, parents have an interest in controlling their childrens' education and upbringing, and a natural parent's stake in the relationship with a child may rise to the level of a protected liberty interest if the parent has demonstrated his commitment by assuming personal, financial, or custodial responsibility for the child.  Third, the family has a privacy interest in its childrens' upbringing and education which is constitutionally protected against undue state interference.  When government intrudes on the family's choices, the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation must be carefully examined.  Pp.  497 U. S. 444-448.
2. To the extent that subdivision 2 of the state statute requires that a minor wait 48 hours after notifying a single parent of her intention to obtain an abortion, it reasonably furthers the legitimate state interest in ensuring that the minor's decision is knowing and intelligent.  The State may properly enact laws designed to aid a parent who has assumed ""primary responsibility"" for a minor's wellbeing in discharging that responsibility, and the 48-hour delay provides the parent the opportunity to consult with his or her spouse and a family physician, to inquire into the competency of the abortion doctor, and to discuss the decision's religious and moral implications with the minor and provide needed guidance and counsel as to how the decision will affect her future.  The delay imposes only a minimal burden on the minor's rights.  The statute does not impose any period of delay if the parents or a court, acting in loco parentis, provide consent to the procedure.  Moreover, the record reveals that 
Page 497 U. S. 420
 the waiting period may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the abortion.  Pp.  497 U. S. 448-449.
Justice O'CONNOR concluded that subdivision 6 of the state statute -- two-parent notification plus judicial bypass -- passes constitutional muster because the interference with the family's internal operation required by subdivision 2's two-parent notice requirement simply does not exist where the minor can avoid notifying one or both parents by using the bypass procedure.  See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52,  428 U. S. 90-91.  P.  497 U. S. 461.
Justice KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice SCALIA, concluded:
1. The state statute's 48-hour waiting period is necessary to enable notified parents to consult with their daughter or her physician, if they so wish, results in little or no delay, and is therefore constitutional.  Pp.  497 U. S. 496-497.
2. Subdivision 6 of the statute -- which requires two-parent notification unless the pregnant minor obtains a judicial bypass --  is constitutional.  By creating a judicial mechanism to identify, and exempt from the strictures of the law, those cases in which the minor is mature or in which parental notification is not in her best interest, subdivision 6 precisely addresses the concern underlying the Court's invalidation of subdivision 2:  the possibility that, in some cases, two-parent notification would not work to the benefit of minors or their parents.  In providing for the bypass, moreover, Minnesota has simply attempted to fit its legislation into the framework supplied by this Court's previous cases, particularly Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, which stands for the proposition that a two-parent consent law is constitutional if it provides for a sufficient judicial bypass alternative.  See id. at  443 U. S. 643 (opinion of Powell, J.); id. at  443 U. S. 656-657 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  The conclusion that subdivision 6 must be sustained is compelled not only by Bellotti but also by H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398, in which the Court held that a two-parent notice statute without a bypass was constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests would be served by notice.  If that is the case, but if such a law is not constitutional as applied to minors who are mature or whose best interests are not so served, a judicial bypass is an expeditious and efficient means by which to separate the applications of the law which are constitutional from those which are not.

Syllabus 
Subdivision 2 of Minn.Stat.  144.343 provides that no abortion shall be performed on a woman under 18 years of age until at least 48 hours after both of her parents have been notified.  The two-parent notice requirement is mandatory unless, inter alia, the woman declares that she is a victim of parental abuse or neglect, in which event notice of her declaration must be given to the proper authorities.  Subdivision 6 provides that, if a court enjoins the enforcement of subdivision 2, the same two-parent notice requirement is effective unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders the abortion to proceed without notice upon proof by the minor that she is ""mature and capable of giving informed consent"" or that an abortion without notice to both parents would be in her best interest.  Two days before the statute's effective date, a group consisting of doctors, clinics, pregnant minors, and the mother of a pregnant minor filed suit in the District Court, alleging that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court declared the statute unconstitutional in its entirety, and enjoined its enforcement.  The Court of Appeals, sitting in banc, reversed.  Although it rejected the State's submission that subdivision 2's two-parent notice requirement was constitutional without any bypass procedure, the court held that subdivision 6 was valid and that its bypass procedure saved the statute as a whole.  The court also rejected the argument that the 48-hour waiting period imposed a significant burden on the minor's abortion right.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
853 F.2d 1452 (CA8 1988), affirmed.
Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IV, and VII, concluding that subdivision 2 of  144.343 violates the Constitution insofar as it requires two-parent notification.
(a) Since none of this Court's abortion decisions dealing with parental consent or notification statutes focused on the possible significance of making the consent or notice applicable to both parents instead of just

 one, the District Court's extensive and unchallenged findings on the question are significant.

Syllabus 
As enacted, Ohio's Amended Substitute House Bill 319 (H.B. 319) makes it a crime for a physician or other person to perform an abortion on an unmarried, unemancipated, minor woman, unless, inter alia, the physician provides timely notice to one of the minor's parents or a juvenile court issues an order authorizing the minor to consent.  To obtain a judicial bypass of the notice requirement, the minor must present clear and convincing proof that she has sufficient maturity and information to make the abortion decision herself, that one of her parents has engaged in a pattern of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse against her, or that notice is not in her best interests.  Among other things, H.B. 319 also allows the physician to give constructive notice if actual notice to the parent proves impossible ""after a reasonable effort""; requires the minor to file a bypass complaint in the juvenile court on prescribed forms; requires that court to appoint a guardian ad litem and an attorney for the minor if she has not retained counsel; mandates expedited bypass hearings and decisions in that court and expedited review by a court of appeals; provides constructive authorization for the minor to consent to the abortion if either court fails to act in a timely fashion; and specifies that both courts must maintain the minor's anonymity and the confidentiality of all papers.  Shortly before H.B. 319's effective date, appellees -- an abortion facility, one of its doctors, and an unmarried, unemancipated, minor woman seeking an abortion there -- and others filed a facial challenge to the statute's constitutionality in the Federal District Court, which ultimately issued an injunction preventing H.B. 319's enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that various of the statute's provisions were constitutionally defective.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
854 F.2d 852 (CA6 1988), reversed.
Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and IV, concluding that, on its face, H.B. 319 does not impose an undue, or otherwise unconstitutional, burden on a minor seeking an abortion.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-519.
1. House Bill 319 accords with this Court's cases addressing the constitutionality of parental notice or consent statutes in the abortion context.  
Page 497 U. S. 503
 Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52; Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622; H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476; Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-517.
(a) Whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment requires parental notice statutes, as opposed to parental consent statutes, to contain judicial bypass procedures, H.B. 319's bypass procedure is sufficient because it meets the requirements identified in Danforth, Bellotti, Ashcroft, and Akron for the more intrusive consent statutes, particularly the four criteria set forth by the plurality in Bellotti, supra, 443 U.S. at  443 U. S. 643-644.  First, the statute satisfies the requirement that the minor be allowed to show the maturity to make her abortion decision without regard to her parents' wishes.  Second, by requiring the juvenile court to authorize her consent upon determining that the abortion is in her best interests and in cases where she has shown a pattern of abuse, H.B. 319 satisfies the requirement that she be allowed to show that, even if she cannot make the decision by herself, the abortion would be in her best interests.  Third, the requirement that a bypass procedure ensure the minor's anonymity is satisfied, since H.B. 319 prohibits the juvenile court from notifying the parents that the complainant is pregnant and wants an abortion and requires both state courts to preserve her anonymity and the confidentiality of court papers, and since state law makes it a crime for any state employee to disclose documents not designated as public records.  Neither the mere possibility of unauthorized, illegal disclosure by state employees nor the fact that the H.B. 319 complaint forms require the minor to provide identifying information for administrative purposes is dispositive.  Complete anonymity is not critical under this Court's decisions, and H.B. 319 takes reasonable steps to prevent the public from learning of the minor's identity.  Fourth, H.B. 319's time limits on judicial action satisfy the requirement that a bypass procedure be conducted with expedition.  Even if, as appellees contend, the bypass procedure could take up to 22 calendar days, including weekends and legal holidays, that possibility does not suffice to invalidate the statute on its face.  See, e.g., Ashcroft, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 477, n. 4,  462 U. S. 491, n. 16.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-514.
(b) The Bellotti criteria need not be extended by imposing appellees' suggested additional requirements on bypass procedures.  First, H.B. 319 is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that its constructive authorization provisions do not require an affirmative order authorizing the physician to act in the event that either state court fails to act within the prescribed time limits.  Absent a showing that those limits will be ignored, the State may expect that its judges will follow 
Page 497 U. S. 504
 mandated procedural requirements.  Moreover, Ashcroft, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 479-480, n. 4, does not require constructive authorization provisions, which were added by Ohio out of an abundance of caution and concern for the minor's interests.  Second, a bypass procedure such as Ohio's does not violate due process by placing the burden of proof on the issues of maturity or best interests on the minor or by requiring a heightened, clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.  The plurality in Bellotti, supra, 443 U.S. at  443 U. S. 634, indicated that a State may require the minor to bear the burden of proof on these issues.  Moreover, a State may require a heightened standard of proof when, as here, the bypass procedure contemplates an ex parte proceeding at which no one opposes the minor's testimony and she is assisted by an attorney and a guardian ad litem.  Third, H.B. 319's statutory scheme and the bypass complaint forms do not deny an unwary and unrepresented minor the opportunity to prove her case by requiring her to choose among three forms, the first of which relates only to maturity, the second to best interests, and the third to both.  Even assuming some initial confusion, it is unlikely that the Ohio courts will treat a minor's choice of forms without due care and understanding for her unrepresented status.  Moreover, she does not make a binding election by her initial form choice, since H.B. 319 provides her with appointed counsel after filing the complaint and allows her to move to amend the pleadings.  Pp.  497 U. S. 514-517.
2. Even assuming that H.B. 319 gives a minor a substantive, state-law liberty or property right ""to avoid unnecessary or hostile parental involvement"" upon proof of maturity or best interests, the statute does not deprive her of this right without due process, since its confidentiality provisions, expedited procedures, pleading form requirements, clear and convincing evidence standard, and constructive authorization provisions are valid on their face.  Pp.  497 U. S. 517-518.
3. House Bill 319 is not facially invalid simply because it requires parental notice to be given by the physician, rather than by some other qualified person.  Since the physician has a superior ability to garner and use important medical and psychological data supplied by a parent upon receiving notice, a State may require the physician himself to take reasonable steps to notify the parent.  See Matheson, supra, 450 U.S. at  450 U. S. 400,  450 U. S. 411. In addition, the conversation with an experienced and detached physician may assist the parent in approaching the problem in a mature and balanced way and thereby enable him to provide better advice to the minor than would a conversation with a less experienced person.  Any imposition on the physician's schedule is diminished by provisions allowing him to give notice by mail if he cannot reach the parent ""after a reasonable effort"" and to forgo notice in the event of certain emergencies, 
Page 497 U. S. 505
 which provisions constitute an adequate recognition of his professional status.  Akron, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 446-449.  Pp.  497 U. S. 518-519.
Justice KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice SCALIA, concluded in Part V that H.B. 319 constitutes a rational way to further legitimate ends.  A free and enlightened society may decide that each of its members should attain a clearer, more tolerant understanding of the profound philosophic choices confronting a woman considering an abortion, which decision will affect her own destiny and dignity and the origins of the other human life within the embryo.  It is both rational and fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, the beginnings of that understanding will be within the family, which will strive to give a lonely or even terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature.  Pp.  497 U. S. 519-520.
Justice STEVENS, agreeing that H.B. 319 is not unconstitutional on its face, concluded that, in some of its applications, the one-parent notice requirement will not reasonably further the State's legitimate interest in protecting the welfare of its minor citizens.  The question whether the judicial bypass is so obviously inadequate for such exceptional situations that the entire statute should be invalidated must await the statute's implementation and the evaluation of the significance of its restrictions in light of its administration.  The State must provide an adequate mechanism for avoiding parental notification for cases in which the minor is mature or notice would not be in her best interests.  See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 441, n. 31.  Pp.  497 U. S. 521-523.

Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided June 25, 1990
497 U.S. 502

Syllabus 
As enacted, Ohio's Amended Substitute House Bill 319 (H.B. 319) makes it a crime for a physician or other person to perform an abortion on an unmarried, unemancipated, minor woman, unless, inter alia, the physician provides timely notice to one of the minor's parents or a juvenile court issues an order authorizing the minor to consent.  To obtain a judicial bypass of the notice requirement, the minor must present clear and convincing proof that she has sufficient maturity and information to make the abortion decision herself, that one of her parents has engaged in a pattern of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse against her, or that notice is not in her best interests.  Among other things, H.B. 319 also allows the physician to give constructive notice if actual notice to the parent proves impossible ""after a reasonable effort""; requires the minor to file a bypass complaint in the juvenile court on prescribed forms; requires that court to appoint a guardian ad litem and an attorney for the minor if she has not retained counsel; mandates expedited bypass hearings and decisions in that court and expedited review by a court of appeals; provides constructive authorization for the minor to consent to the abortion if either court fails to act in a timely fashion; and specifies that both courts must maintain the minor's anonymity and the confidentiality of all papers.  Shortly before H.B. 319's effective date, appellees -- an abortion facility, one of its doctors, and an unmarried, unemancipated, minor woman seeking an abortion there -- and others filed a facial challenge to the statute's constitutionality in the Federal District Court, which ultimately issued an injunction preventing H.B. 319's enforcement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that various of the statute's provisions were constitutionally defective.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
854 F.2d 852 (CA6 1988), reversed.
Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and IV, concluding that, on its face, H.B. 319 does not impose an undue, or otherwise unconstitutional, burden on a minor seeking an abortion.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-519.
1. House Bill 319 accords with this Court's cases addressing the constitutionality of parental notice or consent statutes in the abortion context.  
Page 497 U. S. 503
 Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52; Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622; H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476; Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-517.
(a) Whether or not the Fourteenth Amendment requires parental notice statutes, as opposed to parental consent statutes, to contain judicial bypass procedures, H.B. 319's bypass procedure is sufficient because it meets the requirements identified in Danforth, Bellotti, Ashcroft, and Akron for the more intrusive consent statutes, particularly the four criteria set forth by the plurality in Bellotti, supra, 443 U.S. at  443 U. S. 643-644.  First, the statute satisfies the requirement that the minor be allowed to show the maturity to make her abortion decision without regard to her parents' wishes.  Second, by requiring the juvenile court to authorize her consent upon determining that the abortion is in her best interests and in cases where she has shown a pattern of abuse, H.B. 319 satisfies the requirement that she be allowed to show that, even if she cannot make the decision by herself, the abortion would be in her best interests.  Third, the requirement that a bypass procedure ensure the minor's anonymity is satisfied, since H.B. 319 prohibits the juvenile court from notifying the parents that the complainant is pregnant and wants an abortion and requires both state courts to preserve her anonymity and the confidentiality of court papers, and since state law makes it a crime for any state employee to disclose documents not designated as public records.  Neither the mere possibility of unauthorized, illegal disclosure by state employees nor the fact that the H.B. 319 complaint forms require the minor to provide identifying information for administrative purposes is dispositive.  Complete anonymity is not critical under this Court's decisions, and H.B. 319 takes reasonable steps to prevent the public from learning of the minor's identity.  Fourth, H.B. 319's time limits on judicial action satisfy the requirement that a bypass procedure be conducted with expedition.  Even if, as appellees contend, the bypass procedure could take up to 22 calendar days, including weekends and legal holidays, that possibility does not suffice to invalidate the statute on its face.  See, e.g., Ashcroft, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 477, n. 4,  462 U. S. 491, n. 16.  Pp.  497 U. S. 510-514.
(b) The Bellotti criteria need not be extended by imposing appellees' suggested additional requirements on bypass procedures.  First, H.B. 319 is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that its constructive authorization provisions do not require an affirmative order authorizing the physician to act in the event that either state court fails to act within the prescribed time limits.  Absent a showing that those limits will be ignored, the State may expect that its judges will follow 
Page 497 U. S. 504
 mandated procedural requirements.  Moreover, Ashcroft, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 479-480, n. 4, does not require constructive authorization provisions, which were added by Ohio out of an abundance of caution and concern for the minor's interests.  Second, a bypass procedure such as Ohio's does not violate due process by placing the burden of proof on the issues of maturity or best interests on the minor or by requiring a heightened, clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.  The plurality in Bellotti, supra, 443 U.S. at  443 U. S. 634, indicated that a State may require the minor to bear the burden of proof on these issues.  Moreover, a State may require a heightened standard of proof when, as here, the bypass procedure contemplates an ex parte proceeding at which no one opposes the minor's testimony and she is assisted by an attorney and a guardian ad litem.  Third, H.B. 319's statutory scheme and the bypass complaint forms do not deny an unwary and unrepresented minor the opportunity to prove her case by requiring her to choose among three forms, the first of which relates only to maturity, the second to best interests, and the third to both.  Even assuming some initial confusion, it is unlikely that the Ohio courts will treat a minor's choice of forms without due care and understanding for her unrepresented status.  Moreover, she does not make a binding election by her initial form choice, since H.B. 319 provides her with appointed counsel after filing the complaint and allows her to move to amend the pleadings.  Pp.  497 U. S. 514-517.
2. Even assuming that H.B. 319 gives a minor a substantive, state-law liberty or property right ""to avoid unnecessary or hostile parental involvement"" upon proof of maturity or best interests, the statute does not deprive her of this right without due process, since its confidentiality provisions, expedited procedures, pleading form requirements, clear and convincing evidence standard, and constructive authorization provisions are valid on their face.  Pp.  497 U. S. 517-518.
3. House Bill 319 is not facially invalid simply because it requires parental notice to be given by the physician, rather than by some other qualified person.  Since the physician has a superior ability to garner and use important medical and psychological data supplied by a parent upon receiving notice, a State may require the physician himself to take reasonable steps to notify the parent.  See Matheson, supra, 450 U.S. at  450 U. S. 400,  450 U. S. 411. In addition, the conversation with an experienced and detached physician may assist the parent in approaching the problem in a mature and balanced way and thereby enable him to provide better advice to the minor than would a conversation with a less experienced person.  Any imposition on the physician's schedule is diminished by provisions allowing him to give notice by mail if he cannot reach the parent ""after a reasonable effort"" and to forgo notice in the event of certain emergencies, 
Page 497 U. S. 505
 which provisions constitute an adequate recognition of his professional status.  Akron, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 446-449.  Pp.  497 U. S. 518-519.
Justice KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice SCALIA, concluded in Part V that H.B. 319 constitutes a rational way to further legitimate ends.  A free and enlightened society may decide that each of its members should attain a clearer, more tolerant understanding of the profound philosophic choices confronting a woman considering an abortion, which decision will affect her own destiny and dignity and the origins of the other human life within the embryo.  It is both rational and fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, the beginnings of that understanding will be within the family, which will strive to give a lonely or even terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature.  Pp.  497 U. S. 519-520.
Justice STEVENS, agreeing that H.B. 319 is not unconstitutional on its face, concluded that, in some of its applications, the one-parent notice requirement will not reasonably further the State's legitimate interest in protecting the welfare of its minor citizens.  The question whether the judicial bypass is so obviously inadequate for such exceptional situations that the entire statute should be invalidated must await the statute's implementation and the evaluation of the significance of its restrictions in light of its administration.  The State must provide an adequate mechanism for avoiding parental notification for cases in which the minor is mature or notice would not be in her best interests.  See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S. 416,  462 U. S. 441, n. 31.  Pp.  497 U. S. 521-523.
KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court, and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and IV, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, and SCALIA, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part V, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE and SCALIA, JJ., joined.

No. 89-6985
Decided June 25, 1990
497 U.S. 543

Syllabus 
Petitioner Alvarado claimed at his criminal trial that the Government used peremptory challenges to remove black jurors solely because of race, contrary to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79.  The District Court accepted the Government's explanations for its challenges, and Alvarado was convicted.  In affirming the conviction, the Court of Appeals did not rule on Alvarado's argument that the Government's explanations were pretextual or the Government's arguments that he had not made out a prima facie Batson error, and that it had race-neutral reasons for the challenges.  The court held, instead, that no appellate inquiry was required into the merits of a Batson claim if the jury finally chosen represented a fair cross section of the community.
Held:  The case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to pass on the adequacy of the Government's reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges.  The Government agrees that the Court of Appeals' judgment rests on an improvident ground.  Thus, it is appropriate for this Court to grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and direct reconsideration in light of the representations made by the United States in this Court.  See, e.g., Biddle v. United States, 484 U.S. 1054.  This result is not unusual even when, as here, the Government has suggested that there is another ground on which the decision below could be affirmed if the case were brought in this Court.

No. 89-645
Argued April 24, 1990
Decided June 21, 1990
497 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
While petitioner Milkovich was a high school wrestling coach, his team was involved in an altercation at a match with another high school's team.  Both he and School Superintendent Scott testified at an investigatory hearing before the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which placed the team on probation.  They testified again during a suit by several parents, in which a county court overturned OHSAA's ruling.  The day after the court's decision, respondent Lorain Journal Company's newspaper published a column authored by respondent Diadiun, which implied that Milkovich lied under oath in the judicial proceeding.  Milkovich commenced a defamation action against respondents in the county court, alleging that the column accused him of committing the crime of perjury, damaged him in his occupation of teacher and coach, and constituted libel per se.  Ultimately, the trial court granted summary judgment for respondents.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, considering itself bound by the State Supreme Court's determination in Superintendent Scott's separate action against respondents that, as a matter law, the article was constitutionally protected opinion.
Held:
1. The First Amendment does not require a separate ""opinion"" privilege limiting the application of state defamation laws.  While the Amendment does limit such application, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, the breathing space that freedoms of expression require to survive is adequately secured by existing constitutional doctrine.  
Page 497 U. S. 2
 Foremost, where a media defendant is involved, a statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before liability can be assessed, Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767, thus ensuring full constitutional protection for a statement of opinion having no provably false factual connotation.  Next, statements that cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual are protected, see, e.g., Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler, 398 U. S. 6, thus assuring that public debate will not suffer for lack of ""imaginative expression"" or the ""rhetorical hyperbole"" which has traditionally added much to the discourse of this Nation.  The reference to ""opinion"" in dictum in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323,  418 U. S. 339-340, was not intended to create a wholesale defamation exemption for ""opinion.""  Read in context, the Gertz dictum is merely a reiteration of Justice Holmes' ""marketplace of ideas"" concept, see Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616,  250 U. S. 630.  Simply couching a statement -- ""Jones is a liar"" -- in terms of opinion -- ""In my opinion, Jones is a liar"" -- does not dispel the factual implications contained in the statement.  Pp.  497 U. S. 11-21.
2. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statements in the Diadiun column imply an assertion that Milkovich perjured himself in a judicial proceeding.  The article did not use the sort of loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language that would negate the impression that Diadiun was seriously maintaining Milkovich committed perjury.  Nor does the article's general tenor negate this impression.  In addition, the connotation that Milkovich committed perjury is sufficiently factual that it is susceptible of being proved true or false by comparing, inter alia, his testimony before the OHSAA board with his subsequent testimony before the trial court.  Pp.  497 U. S. 21-22.
3. This decision balances the First Amendment's vital guarantee of free and uninhibited discussion of public issues with the important social values that underlie defamation law and society's pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.  Pp.  497 U. S. 22-23.

Decided June 21, 1990
497 U.S. 37

Syllabus 
Respondent was convicted in a Texas state court of aggravated sexual assault and sentenced to life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.  After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, he applied for a writ of habeas corpus in state court, arguing that Texas law did not authorize both a fine and prison term for his offense, and thus that his judgment and sentence were void and he was entitled to a new trial.  The court, bound by a State Court of Criminal Appeals' decision, recommended that the writ be granted.  Before the writ was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeals, however, a new statute was passed allowing an appellate court to reform an improper verdict assessing a punishment not authorized by law.  Thus, the Court of Criminal Appeals reformed the verdict by ordering that the fine be deleted and denied the request for a new trial.  Arguing that the new Texas law's retroactive application violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. 1,  10, respondent filed a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, which was denied.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Relying on the statement in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, that retroactive procedural statutes violate the Ex Post Facto Clause unless they ""leave untouched all the substantial protections with which existing law surrounds the . . . accused,"" the court held that respondent's right to a new trial under former Texas law was a ""substantial protection.""
Held:
1. Although the rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 -- which prohibits the retroactive application of new rules to cases on collateral review -- is grounded in important considerations of federal-state relations, it is not jurisdictional in the sense that this Court, despite a limited grant of certiorari, must raise and decide the issue sua sponte.  Since Texas has chosen not to rely on Teague, the merits of respondent's claim will be considered.  Pp.  497 U. S. 40-41.
2. The application of the Texas statute to respondent is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Pp.  497 U. S. 41-52.
(a) The definition of an ex post facto law as one that (1) punishes as a crime an act previously committed which was innocent when done, (2) 
Page 497 U. S. 38
 makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission, or (3) deprives one charged with a crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, is faithful to this Court's best knowledge of the original understanding of the Clause:  Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.  Respondent concedes that Texas' statute does not fall within the Beazell categories, since it is a procedural change in the law.  However, he errs in arguing that this Court's decisions have not limited the Clause's scope to those categories, but have stated more broadly that retroactive legislation contravenes the Clause if it deprives an accused of a ""substantial protection"" under law existing at the time of the crime, and that the new trial guaranteed by Texas law is such a protection.  When cases have described as ""procedural"" those changes that do not violate the Clause even though they work to the accused's disadvantage, see, e.g., Beazell, supra at  269 U. S. 171, it is logical to presume that ""procedural"" refers to changes in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated, as opposed to substantive changes in the law.  The ""substantial protection"" discussion in Beazell, Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 377,  152 U. S. 382-383, and Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180,  237 U. S. 183, has imported confusion into the Clause's interpretation, and should be read to mean that a legislature does not immunize a law from scrutiny under the Clause simply by labeling the law ""procedural.""  It should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Clause.  Pp.  497 U. S. 41-46.
(b) Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, and Thompson v. Utah, supra, are inconsistent with the understanding of the term ""ex post facto law"" at the time the Constitution was adopted, rely on reasoning that this Court has not followed since Thompson was decided, and have caused confusion in state and lower federal courts about the Clause's scope.  Kring and Thompson are therefore overruled.  Pp.  497 U. S. 47-52.

However, he errs in arguing that this Court's decisions have not limited the Clause's scope to those categories, but have stated more broadly that retroactive legislation contravenes the Clause if it deprives an accused of a ""substantial protection"" under law existing at the time of the crime, and that the new trial guaranteed by Texas law is such a protection.  When cases have described as ""procedural"" those changes that do not violate the Clause even though they work to the accused's disadvantage, see, e.g., Beazell, supra at  269 U. S. 171, it is logical to presume that ""procedural"" refers to changes in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated, as opposed to substantive changes in the law.  The ""substantial protection"" discussion in Beazell, Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 377,  152 U. S. 382-383, and Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180,  237 U. S. 183, has imported confusion into the Clause's interpretation, and should be read to mean that a legislature does not immunize a law from scrutiny under the Clause simply by labeling the law ""procedural.""  It should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Clause.  Pp.  497 U. S. 41-46.
(b) Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, and Thompson v. Utah, supra, are inconsistent with the understanding of the term ""ex post facto law"" at the time the Constitution was adopted, rely on reasoning that this Court has not followed since Thompson was decided, and have caused confusion in state and lower federal courts about the Clause's scope.  Kring and Thompson are therefore overruled.  Pp.  497 U. S. 47-52.

Syllabus 
The Illinois Governor issued an executive order instituting a hiring freeze, whereby state officials are prohibited from hiring any employee, filling any vacancy, creating any new position, or taking any similar action without the Governor's ""express permission.""  Petitioners and cross-respondents -- an applicant for employment, employees who had been denied promotions or transfers, and former employees who had not been recalled after layoffs -- brought suit in the District Court, alleging that, by means of the freeze, the Governor was operating a political patronage system; that they had suffered discrimination in state employment because they had not been Republican Party supporters; and that this discrimination violates the First Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Noting that Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507, had found that the patronage practice of discharging public employees on the basis of their political affiliation violates the First Amendment, the court held that other patronage practices violate the Amendment only when they are the ""substantial equivalent of a dismissal,"" i.e., when they would lead reasonable persons to resign.  The court concluded, based on Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Education, 476 U. S. 267, that rejecting an employment application did not impose a hardship comparable to the loss of a job.  Thus, it dismissed the hiring claim, but remanded the others for further proceedings.
Held:  The rule of Elrod and Branti extends to promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions based on party affiliation and support, and petitioners and cross-respondents have stated claims upon which relief may be granted.  Pp.  497 U. S. 68-79.
(a) Promotions, transfers, and recalls based on political affiliation or support are an impermissible infringement on public employees' First Amendment rights.  Even though petitioners and cross-respondents 
Page 497 U. S. 63
 have no legal entitlement to the promotions, transfers, and recalls, the government may not rely on a basis that infringes their constitutionally protected interests to deny them these valuable benefits.  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593,  408 U. S. 597.  Significant penalties are imposed on those employees who exercise their First Amendment rights.  Those who do not compromise their beliefs stand to lose the considerable increases in pay and job satisfaction attendant to promotions, the shorter commuting hours and lower maintenance expenses incident to transfers to more convenient work locations, and even the jobs themselves in the case of recalls.  As in Elrod and Branti, these patronage practices are not narrowly tailored to serve vital government interests.  A government's interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting, or transferring persons whose work is deficient, and its interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing high-level employees on the basis of their political views.  Likewise, the ""preservation of the democratic process"" is not furthered by these patronage decisions, since political parties are nurtured by other less intrusive and equally effective methods, and since patronage decidedly impairs the elective process by discouraging public employees' free political expression.  Pp.  497 U. S. 71-75.
(b) The standard used by the Court of Appeals to measure alleged patronage practices in government employment is unduly restrictive because it fails to recognize that there are deprivations less harsh than dismissal that nevertheless press state employees and applicants to conform their beliefs and associations to some state-selected orthdoxy.  Pp.  497 U. S. 75-76.
(c) Patronage hiring places burdens on free speech and association similar to those imposed by patronage promotions, transfers, and recalls.  Denial of a state job is a serious privation, since such jobs provide financial, health, and other benefits; since there may be openings with the State when business in the private sector is slow; and since there are occupations for which the government is the sole or major employer.  Under this Court's sustained precedent, conditioning hiring decisions on political belief and association plainly constitutes an unconstitutional condition unless the government has a vital interest in doing so.  See, e.g., Branti, supra, 445 U.S. at  445 U. S. 515-516.  There is no such government interest here, for the same reasons that the government lacks justification for patronage promotions, transfers, and recalls.  It is inappropriate to rely on Wygant to distinguish hiring from dismissal in this context, since that case was concerned with the least harsh means of remedying past wrongs, and did not question that some remedy was permissible when there was sufficient evidence of past discrimination.  Here, however, it is unnecessary to consider whether not being hired is less burdensome

No. 89-624
Argued April 16, 1990

497 U.S. 116

Syllabus 
The Interstate Commerce Act (Act) requires motor common carriers to publish their rates in tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), 49 U.S.C.  10762, and prohibits both carriers and shippers from deviating from those rates,  10761.  The Act also specifies that a carrier's rates must be nondiscriminatory,  10741, and that its rates and practices must be reasonable,  10701, and charges the ICC, upon determining that a rate or practice violates the statute, with prescribing the rate or practice to be followed,  10704(b)(1).  Purportedly pursuant to this authority, the ICC, in its recent Negotiated Rates decisions, has adopted a policy that relieves a shipper of the obligation to pay the filed rate when it has privately negotiated a lower rate with the carrier.  From 1981 to 1983, Quinn Freight Lines, a motor common carrier and a subsidiary of petitioner Maislin Industries, Inc., privately negotiated interstate shipment rates with respondent Primary Steel, Inc., that were lower than Quinn's filed rates.  Quinn never filed the negotiated rates with the ICC.  In 1983, Maislin filed for bankruptcy, and the bankrupt estate issued balance due bills to Primary for the difference between the filed rates and the negotiated rates.  When Primary refused to pay the undercharges, the estate brought suit in the District Court, which referred the matter to the ICC.  Rejecting the argument that it lacked the statutory power to release a shipper from liability for such undercharges, the ICC relied on its Negotiated Rates policy to hold that  10701 authorized it to consider all the circumstances surrounding an undercharge suit to determine whether collection of the filed rate would constitute an unreasonable practice.  The ICC concluded that Maislin was not entitled to recover, since Quinn and Primary had negotiated other rates, and since Primary had relied on Quinn to file those rates, had reasonably believed that the amounts quoted and billed were the correct total charges, and had made full payment.  The case returned to the District Court, which granted summary judgment for Primary on the basis of the ICC's decision.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing with the District Court that the approach taken by the ICC was consistent with the Act. 
Page 497 U. S. 117

Held:  The ICC's Negotiated Rates policy is inconsistent with the Act, and is therefore invalid.  Pp.  497 U. S. 126-136.
(a) Since the duty to file rates under  10762 and the obligation to charge only those rates under  10761 have always been considered essential to preventing price discrimination violative of  10741, Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370,  284 U. S. 384, this Court has long held that the filed rate alone governs the legal rights of a shipper against a carrier, see, e.g., Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U. S. 156,  260 U. S. 163, and that the statute forbids equitable defenses to collection of the filed tariff, see, e.g., Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242,  202 U. S. 245, including the shipper's ignorance or the carrier's misquotation of rates, see, e.g., Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94,  237 U. S. 97.  Despite its sometimes harsh effects, this rigid ""filed rate doctrine"" has been strictly applied and consistently adhered to by the Court.  See, e.g., Thurston Motor Lines, Inc. v. Jordan K. Rand, Ltd., 460 U. S. 533,  460 U. S. 535.  Pp.  497 U. S. 126-128.
(b) Although, under the filed rate doctrine, the tariff rate is not enforceable if the ICC finds it to be unreasonable, see, e.g., Maxwell, supra, 237 U.S. at  237 U. S. 97, that exception is not applicable here.  The ICC's determination that a carrier engages in an ""unreasonable practice"" when it attempts to collect the filed rate after the parties have negotiated a lower rate is not entitled to deference, since it conflicts with this Court's interpretation, from which Congress has not diverged, that the secret negotiation and collection of rates lower than the filed rate is discriminatory under  10741.  See, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U. S. 56,  209 U. S. 81.  Stripped of its semantic cover, the Negotiated Rates policy and, more specifically, the ICC's interpretation of ""unreasonable practices,"" thus stand revealed as flatly inconsistent with the Act's scheme as a whole and  10761 and 10762 in particular.  Nor can the ICC's policy be justified on the ground that it prevents the carrier from receiving a windfall, i.e., the higher filed rate, from its failure to comply with  10762's directive to file the negotiated rate, since such ""equities"" are irrelevant to the application of  10761, which requires the carrier to collect the filed rate.  Compliance with  10761 and 10762 is utterly central to the administration of the Act, and, by sanctioning adherence to unfiled rates, the Negotiated Rates policy effectively renders those sections nugatory and conflicts directly with the Act's core purposes.  Pp.  497 U. S. 128-133.
(c) The passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 (MCA) --which substantially deregulated the motor carrier industry for the avowed purpose of promoting competitive and efficient transportation services -- does not justify the ICC's Negotiated Rates policy.  Although the ICC has both the authority and the expertise generally to adopt new policies when 
Page 497 U. S. 118
 faced with new developments in the industry, its power does not extend to a policy that directly conflicts with its governing statute.  Nothing in the MCA repeals  10761 and 10762, and generalized congressional exhortations to ""increase competition"" cannot provide the ICC authority to alter the requirements of those sections as interpreted by this Court.  Cf. Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Traffic Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409,  476 U. S. 420.  The fact that, even before the MCA's passage, Congress had allowed the ICC to exempt motor contract carriers from the requirement that they adhere to the published tariff, see  10761(b), demonstrates that Congress is aware of the requirement, and has deliberately chosen not to disturb it with respect to motor common carriers.

No. 89-530
Argued April 17, 1990
Decided June 21, 1990
497 U.S. 154

Syllabus 
As a nonprofit corporation that owns and operates a private social club, petitioner's income derived from membership fees and other receipts from members is exempt from income tax.  However, all other income is nonexempt ""unrelated business taxable income,"" defined in  512(a)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code as
""the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income).""
Petitioner has nonexempt income from sales of food and drink to nonmembers, and from return on its investments.  During its 1980 and 1981 tax years, petitioner offset net losses on nonmember sales against the earnings from its investments, and reported no unrelated business taxable income.  In computing its losses, petitioner identified two categories of expenses incurred in nonmember sales:  (1) variable (direct) expenses, such as the cost of food, which, in each year in question, were exceeded by gross income from nonmember sales; and (2) fixed (indirect) overhead expenses, which would have been incurred whether or not sales had been made to nonmembers.  It determined what portions of fixed expenses were attributable to nonmember sales by employing an allocation formula known as the ""gross-to-gross method,"" based on the ratio that nonmember sales bore to total sales.  The total of these fixed expenses and variable costs exceeded petitioner's gross income from nonmember sales.  On audit, the Commissioner determined that petitioner could deduct expenses associated with nonmember sales up to the amount of receipts from the sales themselves, but could not use losses from those activities to offset its investment income because it had failed to show that its nonmember sales were undertaken with an intent to profit.  Petitioner sought redetermination, and the Tax Court ruled in petitioner's favor, concluding that petitioner had adequately demonstrated that it had a profit motive, since its gross receipts from nonmember sales consistently exceeded the variable costs associated with those activities.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Tax Court had applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that petitioner had demonstrated an intent to profit, because profit in this context meant the production of gains in excess of all direct and indirect

 costs.  The court remanded the case for a determination whether petitioner engaged in its nonmember activities with the required intent to profit from those activities.
Held:  Petitioner may use losses incurred in sales to nonmembers to offset investment income only if those sales were motivated by an intent to profit, which is to be determined by using the same allocation method as petitioner used to compute its actual profit or loss.  Pp.  497 U. S. 163-166.
(a) The statutory scheme for the taxation of social clubs was intended to achieve tax neutrality by ensuring that members are not subject to tax disadvantages as a consequence of their decision to pool their resources for the purchase of social or recreational services, but was not intended to provide clubs with a tax advantage.  Pp.  497 U. S. 160-163.
(b) By limiting deductions from unrelated business income to those expenses allowable as deductions under ""this chapter,""  512(a)(3)(A) limits such deductions to expenses allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code.  Since only  162 of Chapter 1 serves as a basis for the deductions claimed here, and since a taxpayer's activities fall within  162's scope only if an intent, to profit is shown, see Commissioner v. Groetzinger, 480 U. S. 23,  480 U. S. 35, petitioner's nonmember sales must be motivated by an intent to profit.  Dispensing with the profit-motive requirement in this case would run counter to the principle of tax neutrality underlying the statutory scheme.  Pp.  497 U. S. 163-166.
(c) The Commissioner correctly concluded that the same allocation method must be used in determining petitioner's intent to profit as in computing its actual profit or loss.  It is an inherent contradiction to argue that the same fixed expenses that are attributable to nonmember sales in calculating actual losses can also be attributed to membership activities in determining whether petitioner acted with the requisite intent to profit.  Having chosen to calculate its actual losses on the basis of the gross-to-gross formula, petitioner is foreclosed from attempting to demonstrate its intent to profit based on some other allocation method.  Pp.  497 U. S. 166-170.
(d) Petitioner has failed to show that it intended to earn gross income from nonmember sales in excess of its total costs where fixed expenses are allocated using the gross-to-gross method.  P.  497 U. S. 171.

			"|"Portland Golf Club v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
No. 89-530
Argued April 17, 1990
Decided June 21, 1990
497 U.S. 154

Syllabus 
As a nonprofit corporation that owns and operates a private social club, petitioner's income derived from membership fees and other receipts from members is exempt from income tax.  However, all other income is nonexempt ""unrelated business taxable income,"" defined in  512(a)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code as
""the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income).""
Petitioner has nonexempt income from sales of food and drink to nonmembers, and from return on its investments.  During its 1980 and 1981 tax years, petitioner offset net losses on nonmember sales against the earnings from its investments, and reported no unrelated business taxable income.  In computing its losses, petitioner identified two categories of expenses incurred in nonmember sales:  (1) variable (direct) expenses, such as the cost of food, which, in each year in question, were exceeded by gross income from nonmember sales; and (2) fixed (indirect) overhead expenses, which would have been incurred whether or not sales had been made to nonmembers.  It determined what portions of fixed expenses were attributable to nonmember sales by employing an allocation formula known as the ""gross-to-gross method,"" based on the ratio that nonmember sales bore to total sales.  The total of these fixed expenses and variable costs exceeded petitioner's gross income from nonmember sales.  On audit, the Commissioner determined that petitioner could deduct expenses associated with nonmember sales up to the amount of receipts from the sales themselves, but could not use losses from those activities to offset its investment income because it had failed to show that its nonmember sales were undertaken with an intent to profit.  Petitioner sought redetermination, and the Tax Court ruled in petitioner's favor, concluding that petitioner had adequately demonstrated that it had a profit motive, since its gross receipts from nonmember sales consistently exceeded the variable costs associated with those activities.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Tax Court had applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that petitioner had demonstrated an intent to profit, because profit in this context meant the production of gains in excess of all direct and indirect 
Page 497 U. S. 155
 costs.  The court remanded the case for a determination whether petitioner engaged in its nonmember activities with the required intent to profit from those activities.
Held:  Petitioner may use losses incurred in sales to nonmembers to offset investment income only if those sales were motivated by an intent to profit, which is to be determined by using the same allocation method as petitioner used to compute its actual profit or loss.  Pp.  497 U. S. 163-166.

497 U.S. 177

Syllabus 
Respondent was arrested in his apartment and charged with possession of illegal drugs, which the police had observed in plain view and seized.  The officers did not have an arrest or search warrant, but gained entry to the apartment with the assistance of Gail Fischer, who represented that the apartment was ""our[s]"" and that she had clothes and furniture there, unlocked the door with her key, and gave the officers permission to enter.  The trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the seized evidence, holding that at the time she consented to the entry Fischer did not have common authority because she had moved out of the apartment.  The court also rejected the State's contention that, even if Fischer did not have common authority, there was no Fourth Amendment violation if the police reasonably believed at the time of their entry that she possessed the authority to consent.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed.
Held:
1. The record demonstrates that the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that Fischer had ""joint access or control for most purposes"" over respondent's apartment, as is required under United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164,  415 U. S. 171, n. 7, to establish ""common authority.""  Pp.  497 U. S. 181-182.
2. A warrantless entry is valid when based upon the consent of a third party whom the police, at the time of the entry, reasonably believe to possess common authority over the premises, but who in fact does not.  Pp.  497 U. S. 182-189.
(a) Because the Appellate Court's opinion does not contain a ""plain statement"" that its decision rests on an adequate and independent state ground, it is subject to review by this Court.  See Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1040-1042.  P.  497 U. S. 182.
(b) What respondent is assured by the Fourth Amendment is not that no government search of his house will occur unless he consents; but that no such search will occur that is ""unreasonable.""  As with the many other factual determinations that must regularly be made by government agents in the Fourth Amendment context, the ""reasonableness"" of a police determination of consent to enter must be judged not by whether the police were correct in their assessment, but by the objective 
Page 497 U. S. 178
 standard of whether the facts available at the moment would warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises.  If not, then warrantless entry without further inquiry is unlawful unless authority actually exists.  But if so, the search is valid.  Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483 reconciled.  Pp.  497 U.

Syllabus 
The respondent -- an investor-owned public utility operating in the petitioner States -- and other utilities and natural gas purchasers filed suit in the District Court against a pipeline company and five gas producers under  4 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes any person injured by a violation of the antitrust laws to sue for treble damages.  The utilities alleged that the defendants had unlawfully conspired to inflate the price of gas that they supplied to the utilities and sought treble damages for both the amount overcharged and the decrease in sales to customers caused by the overcharge.  The petitioner States filed separate  4 actions in the District Court against the same defendants for the alleged antitrust violation, asserting, inter alia, parens patriae claims on behalf of all natural persons residing in the States who had purchased gas from any utility at inflated prices.  The court consolidated all of the actions and granted the utilities partial summary judgment with respect to the defendants' defense that, since the utilities had passed through all of the alleged overcharge to their customers, the utilities lacked standing because they had suffered no antitrust injury as required by  4.  In light of its conclusion that, under Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U. S. 481, and Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, the utilities had suffered antitrust injury as direct purchasers but their customers, as indirect purchasers, had not, the court dismissed the States' parens patriae claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissals.
Held: When suppliers violate antitrust laws by overcharging a public utility for natural gas, and the utility passes on the overcharge to its customers, only the utility has a cause of action under  4, because it alone has suffered antitrust injury.  Pp.  497 U. S. 206-219.
1. Three rationales underlie the indirect purchaser rule adopted in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick:  (1) establishing the amount of an overcharge shifted to indirect purchasers would normally prove insurmountable in light of the wide range of considerations influencing a company's pricing decisions; (2) a pass-on defense would reduce the effectiveness of  4 actions by diminishing the recovery available to any potential plaintiff; and (3) allowing suits by indirect purchasers would risk multiple liability 
Page 497 U. S. 200
 because the alleged antitrust violators could not use a pass-on defense in an action by the direct purchasers.  Pp.  497 U. S. 206-208.
2. The aforesaid rationales compel the conclusion that no exception to the indirect purchaser rule should be made for suits involving regulated public utilities that pass on all of their costs to their customers.  Pp.  497 U. S. 208-218.
(a) Allowing indirect suits in such cases might necessitate complex cost apportionment calculations, since a utility bears at least some portion of a passed-on overcharge to the extent that it could have sought and gained state permission to raise its rates in the absence of the overcharge, cf. Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. at  392 U. S. 493, and n. 9, and since various factors, such as the need to seek regulatory approval, may delay the passing on process and thereby require the utility, in the interim, to bear some of the overcharge's costs in the form of lower earnings.  Here, the certified question leaves unclear whether the respondent could have raised its prices prior to the overcharge, whether it had passed on ""most or all"" of its costs at the time of its suit, and even the means by which the pass through occurred.  Proof of these preliminary issues, which are irrelevant to the defendants' liability, would turn upon the intricacies of state law, and, if it were determined that respondent had borne some of the costs, would require the adoption of an apportionment formula, the very complexity that Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick sought to avoid.  Moreover, creating an exception in such cases would make little sense when, in light of all its difficulty, its practical significance is diminished by the fact that some States require utilities to pass on at least some of the recovery obtained in a  4 suit to their customers.  Pp.  497 U. S. 208-212.
(b) Even if the risk of multiple recoveries would be eliminated by allowing the petitioners to recover only the amount of the overcharge and the respondent to recover only damages for its lost sales in a single lawsuit, the additional complexity thereby introduced into a case that already has become quite complicated argues strongly for retaining the indirect purchaser rule.  See Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at  431 U. S. 731, n. 11.  Pp.  497 U. S. 212-213.
(c) Allowing indirect suits by utility customers would not better promote the goal of vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.  Petitioners' argument that utilities lack incentives to sue overcharging suppliers is unpersuasive, since utilities may bring  4 actions in some instances for fear that regulators will not allow them to shift known and avoidable overcharges on to their customers; since there is no authority indicating that utilities, which may have to pass on  4 damages recovered, would also have to pay the entire exemplary portion of these damages to customers; and since utilities, in fact, have an established record 
Page 497 U. S. 201
 of diligent and successful antitrust enforcement.  On the other hand, indirect purchaser actions might be ineffective because consumers may lack the expertise and experience necessary to detect improper pricing by a utility's suppliers, while state attorneys general may hesitate to exercise the parens patriae device in cases involving smaller, more speculative harm to consumers, and, in any event, may sue only on behalf of resident natural persons, leaving nonresidents and small businesses to fend for themselves.  Pp.  497 U. S. 214-216.
(d) Although the rationales of Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick may not apply with equal force in all instances, ample justifications exist for the Court's stated decision not to carve out exceptions to the indirect purchaser rule for particular types of markets.  Illinois Brick, supra, at  431 U. S. 744-745.  Even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the rule might be disproved in a specific case, it would be an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions.  Pp.  497 U. S. 216-217.
3. The suggestion in Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. at  392 U. S. 494, and Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at  431 U. S. 736, that a departure from the indirect purchaser rule may be necessary when such a purchaser buys under a preexisting cost-plus contract does not justify an exception in this case, since the respondent did not sell gas to its customers under such a contract.  Even if an exception could be created for situations that merely resemble those governed by such contracts, that exception could not be applied here, since there is no certainty that the respondent has borne no portion of the overcharge and otherwise suffered no injury.  Pp.  497 U. S. 217-218.
4. Section 4C of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 -- which authorizes States to bring parens patriae actions on behalf of resident natural persons to secure monetary relief for property injury sustained by reason of certain antitrust violations -- does not authorize the petitioners to sue on behalf of consumers notwithstanding the consumers' status as indirect purchasers.  Section 4G did not establish any new substantive liability, but simply created a new procedural device to enforce existing rights of recovery under  4 of the Clayton Act, Illinois Brick, supra, at  431 U. S. 734, n. 14, which rights belong to the respondent in this case.  Pp.  497 U. S. 218-219.

No. 89-5809
Argued April 25, 1990
Decided June 21, 1990
497 U.S. 227

Syllabus 
Petitioner Sawyer's conviction and death sentence for a brutal murder became final in 1984.  The Federal District Court denied his habeas corpus petition, which was based in relevant part on the argument that the prosecutor's closing argument during the penalty phase of his trial diminished the jury's sense of responsibility for the capital sentencing decision, in violation of this Court's 1985 decision in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320.  While his appeal of the denial of habeas relief was pending, this Court decided Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, under which a new rule of constitutional law established after a petitioner's conviction has become final may not be used to attack the conviction on federal habeas corpus unless the rule (1) places an entire category of primary conduct beyond the reach of criminal law, id. at  489 U. S. 311, or prohibits imposition of a certain type of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense, see Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,  492 U. S. 330, or (2) applies a new watershed rule of criminal procedure that enhances accuracy and is necessary to the fundamental fairness of the criminal proceeding, 489 U.S. at  489 U. S. 312-313.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of relief, holding that Caldwell announced a new rule within the meaning of Teague and did not fall within Teague's second exception.
Held:  Petitioner is not entitled to federal habeas relief, because Caldwell announced a new rule, as defined by Teague, that does not come within either of the Teague exceptions.  Pp.  497 U. S. 233-245.
(a) Caldwell's result was not dictated by Eighth Amendment precedent existing at the time petitioner's conviction became final.  No case prior to Caldwell invalidated a prosecutorial argument as impermissible under the Eighth Amendment.  The discussion of improper prosecutorial comment in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, a noncapital murder case, was based on the Due Process Clause's guarantees of fundamental fairness, not the Eighth Amendment's more particular guarantees of sentencing reliability.  Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104; Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586; Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349; and Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, earlier Eighth Amendment cases, spoke to the general issue of sentencing reliability, but not to the issue decided in Caldwell, and Teague would be meaningless if applied at such a level of generality.  In 1984, from a state court's point of view, 
Page 497 U. S. 228
 there were indications that Caldwell was not an Eighth Amendment requirement, see California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992; Maggio v. Williams, 464 U. S. 46, and there was some doubt as to this Court's view concerning a major premise of Caldwell, that misleading prosecutorial comment might cause a bias in favor of death sentences, see Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282,  432 U. S. 294, and n. 7.  It cannot be said that state cases were anticipating the Caldwell rule when they prohibited similar prosecutorial statements, because their decisions were based on state law, and did not purport to construe the Eighth Amendment.  Reliance on these cases misapprehends the function of federal habeas relief, which serves to ensure that state convictions comport with established federal law at the time a petitioner's conviction becomes final.  To the extent that post-Caldwell Louisiana cases reflect state court recognition that general Eighth Amendment principles pointed toward adoption of a Caldwell rule, or that Caldwell is congruent with preexisting state law, they cannot serve to show that Caldwell was dictated by this Court's Eighth Amendment precedents, since courts can be expected to apply principles announced in prior Eighth Amendment decisions that are susceptible to debate among reasonable minds.  Petitioner's argument that state courts would not have provided protection against misleading prosecutorial comment unless they had been compelled to do so by federal precedent and the threat of federal habeas review is premised on a skepticism of state courts that this Court declines to endorse.  Pp.  497 U. S. 233-241.
(b) Caldwell does not come within either of the Teague exceptions.  The first exception has no applicability here.  Petitioner's argument that the second exception should be read to include new rules of capital sentencing that preserve the accuracy and fairness of judgments looks only to the first half of the exception's definition.  To qualify under Teague, a rule must not only improve the accuracy of trial; it must also be essential to the fairness of the proceeding.  There would be no limit to the second exception if it were to be recast as suggested by petitioner, since almost all Eighth Amendment jurisprudence concerning capital sentencing is directed toward the enhancement of reliability or accuracy in some sense.  Caldwell is a systemic rule designed as an enhancement of the accuracy of capital sentencing.  However, this measure of protection against error in the context of capital sentencing was added to the already existing due process guarantee of fundamental fairness afforded by Donnelly, supra.
""[T]he only defendants who need to rely on Caldwell rather than Donnelly are those who must concede that the prosecutorial argument in their case was not so harmful as to render their sentencing trial 'fundamentally unfair.'""
881 F.2d at 1293.  Thus, it cannot be said that Caldwell is the type of absolute prerequisite to 
Page 497 U. S. 229
 fundamental fairness that may come within Teague's second exception.  Cf., e.g., Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401.  Pp.  497 U. S. 241-245.

No. 89-213
Argued Feb. 27, 1990
Decided June 18, 1990
496 U.S. 582

Syllabus 
Respondent Muniz was arrested for driving while under the influence on a Pennsylvania highway.  Without being advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, he was taken to a Booking Center where, as was the routine practice, he was told that his actions and voice would be videotaped.  He then answered seven questions regarding his name, address, height, weight, eye color, date of birth, and current age, stumbling over two responses.  He was also asked, and was unable to give, the date of his sixth birthday.  In addition, he made several incriminating statements while he performed physical sobriety tests and when he was asked to submit to a breathalyzer test.  He refused to take the breathalyzer test and was advised, for the first time, of his Miranda rights.  Both the video and audio portions of the tape were admitted at trial, and he was convicted.  His motion for a new trial on the ground that the court should have excluded, inter alia, the videotape was denied.  The Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed.  While finding that the videotape of the sobriety testing exhibited physical rather than testimonial evidence within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, the court concluded that Muniz's answers to questions and his other verbalizations were testimonial and, thus, the audio portion of the tape should have been suppressed in its entirety.
Held:  The judgment is vacated and remanded.
377 Pa.Super. 382, 547 A.2d 419, (1988), vacated and remanded.
Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, and IV, concluding that only Muniz's response to the sixth birthday question constitutes a testimonial response to custodial interrogation for purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  496 U. S. 588-600,  496 U. S. 602-605.
(a) The privilege against self-incrimination protects an ""accused from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature,"" Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757,  384 U. S. 761, but not from being compelled by the State to produce ""real or physical evidence,"" id. at  384 U. S. 764.  To be testimonial, the communication must, ""explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.""  Doe v. United States, 487 U. S. 201,  487 U. S. 210.  Pp.  496 U. S. 588-590. 
Page 496 U. S. 583

(b) Muniz's answers to direct questions are not rendered inadmissible by Miranda merely because the slurred nature of his speech was incriminating.  Under Schmerber and its progeny, any slurring of speech and other evidence of lack of muscular coordination revealed by his responses constitute nontestimonial components of those responses.  Requiring a suspect to reveal the physical manner in which he articulates words, like requiring him to reveal the physical properties of the sound of his voice by reading a transcript, see United States v. Dionisio, 410 U. S. 1, does not, without more, compel him to provide a ""testimonial"" response for purposes of the privilege.  Pp.  496 U. S. 590-592.
(c) However, Muniz's response to the sixth birthday question was incriminating not just because of his delivery, but also because the content of his answer supported an inference that his mental state was confused.  His response was testimonial because he was required to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief and, thus, was confronted with the ""trilemma"" of truth, falsity, or silence, the historical abuse against which the privilege against self-incrimination was aimed.  By hypothesis, the custodial interrogation's inherently coercive environment precluded the option of remaining silent, so he was left with the choice of incriminating himself by admitting the truth that he did not then know the date of his sixth birthday, or answering untruthfully by reporting a date that he did not know was accurate (which would also have been incriminating).  Since the state court's holdings that the sixth birthday question constituted an unwarned interrogation and that Muniz's answer was incriminating were not challenged, this testimonial response should have been suppressed.  Pp.  496 U. S. 592-600.
(d) Muniz's incriminating utterances during the sobriety and breathalyzer tests were not prompted by an interrogation within the meaning of Miranda, and should not have been suppressed.  The officer's dialogue with Muniz concerning the physical sobriety tests consisted primarily of carefully scripted instructions as to how the tests were to be performed that were not likely to be perceived as calling for any verbal response.  Therefore, they were not ""words or actions"" constituting custodial interrogation, and Muniz's incriminating utterances were ""voluntary.""  The officer administering the breathalyzer test also carefully limited her role to providing Muniz with relevant information about the test and the implied consent law.  She questioned him only as to whether he understood her instructions and wished to submit to the test.  These limited and focused inquiries were necessarily ""attendant to"" a legitimate police procedure, and were not likely to be perceived as calling for any incriminating response.  Pp.  496 U. S. 602-605.
Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice O'CONNOR, Justice SCALIA, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Part III-C that the first seven 
Page 496 U. S. 584
 questions asked Muniz fall outside Miranda protections and need not be suppressed.  Although they constituted custodial interrogation, see Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, they are nonetheless admissible because the questions were asked ""for recordkeeping purposes only,"" and therefore they fall within a ""routine booking question"" exception which exempts from Miranda's coverage questions to secure the ""biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services,"" United States v. Horton, 873 F.2d 180, 181, n. 2.  Pp.  496 U. S. 600-602.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by Justice WHITE, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS, concluded that Muniz's responses to the ""booking"" questions were not testimonial, and therefore do not warrant application of the privilege.  P.  496 U. S. 608.
BRENNAN, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, and IV, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined, the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III-B, in which MARSHALL, O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Part III-C, in which O'CONNOR, SCALIA, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined.

Title 42 U.S.C.  405(g), which is not further divided into subsections, provides, inter alia, that:  an individual may obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Social Security Act by filing ""a civil action"" in the district court (sentence one); in such action, that court has the power to enter ""a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the [Secretary's] decision, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing"" (sentence four) (emphasis added); that court may order a remand for the taking of additional evidence, ""but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding"" (sentence six); that court may review the Secretary's post-remand ""additional or modified findings of fact and decision"" (sentence seven); and that court's judgment ""shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions"" (sentence eight).  Respondent filed an application for widow's disability benefits under  423(d)(2)(B), which authorizes an award to a widow whose impairment is of a level of severity deemed sufficient by the Secretary's regulations to preclude an individual from engaging in any gainful activity.  Under those regulations, a surviving spouse who suffers from an impairment meeting or equaling the severity of an impairment included in the Secretary's Listing of Impairments is disabled.  After respondent's application was denied on the ground that her heart condition did not meet or equal a listed impairment, she filed suit in the District Court, invoking  405(g).  The court sustained the Secretary's conclusion that she did not meet the regulatory definition for disability, but reversed the decision and remanded the case for a determination of her ability to engage in any gainful activity without regard to the regulation.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the Secretary's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because remands to administrative agencies are not ordinarily ""final decisions"" appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291.  It held that the exception for cases in which an important legal issue is finally resolved and review of that issue would be foreclosed as a practical matter if an immediate appeal were unavailable was inapplicable because, if the Secretary persisted in refusing benefits on

 remand, the District Court might order that benefits be granted, thereby providing the Secretary with an appealable final decision.  The court also believed that Circuit precedent foreclosed the Secretary's argument that he might not be able to obtain review at a later point if he awarded benefits on remand.
Held:  The Secretary may immediately appeal a district court order effectively invalidating regulations limiting the kinds of inquiries that must be made to determine entitlement to disability insurance benefits and remanding a claim to the Secretary for consideration without those restrictions.  Pp.  496 U. S. 623-631.
(a) The District Court's order essentially invalidated, as inconsistent with the Act, regulations restricting eligibility for widow's disability benefits.  Pp.  496 U. S. 623-624.
(b) Section 405(g)'s text and structure define the court of appeals' jurisdiction.  The term ""a civil action"" in sentence one suggests that each final decision of the Secretary is reviewable by a separate piece of litigation.  Here, the District Court entered a judgment pursuant to sentence four:  it reversed the Secretary's decision and ""remand[ed] the cause for a rehearing.""  Unquestionably this is a ""judgment"" in  405(g)'s terminology, as the court terminated the civil action challenging the Secretary's final decision, set aside that decision, and decided that the Secretary could not follow his own regulations on remand.  Since there would be grave doubt whether the Secretary could appeal his own order if on remand he awarded benefits, the District Court's order was a ""final judgment"" subject to further review under sentence eight.  Pp.  496 U. S. 624-625.
(c) Respondent's several arguments countering this construction of  405(g) are unpersuasive.  First, the remand in this case was not ordered pursuant to the sixth sentence, since a sixth-sentence remand is appropriate only when the district court learns of evidence not in existence or available to the claimant at the time of the administrative proceeding that might have changed that proceeding's outcome.  Second, the post-remand judicial review contemplated by sentence seven refers only to reviews in cases that were previously remanded under sentence six, and thus does not fit the kind of remand ordered in this case.  Third, the eighth sentence does in fact compel the conclusion that a fourth-sentence judgment is immediately appealable.  That Congress may have used ""final"" to mean conclusively decided for res judicata purposes does not preclude the construction of ""final"" to include ""appealable,"" a meaning with which ""final"" is usually coupled.  Moreover, Congress is empowered to define a class of orders that are ""final judgments"" within the meaning of  1291, and that is precisely what it has done in sentence four.  Fourth, sentence four does not limit a district court's power to remand a case, since it does not require the court to choose between entering a 
Page 496 U. S. 619
 final judgment and remanding, but specifically provides that it may do both.  Finally, language in Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877 (1989), suggesting that this type of remand order is not appealable as a final decision is insufficient to sustain respondent's contentions here, since that case dealt with the interpretation of the Equal Access to Justice Act's term ""any civil action,"" not with whether a remand order could be appealed as a ""final decision"" under  1291.

Syllabus 
Title 42 U.S.C.  405(g), which is not further divided into subsections, provides, inter alia, that:  an individual may obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Social Security Act by filing ""a civil action"" in the district court (sentence one); in such action, that court has the power to enter ""a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the [Secretary's] decision, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing"" (sentence four) (emphasis added); that court may order a remand for the taking of additional evidence, ""but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding"" (sentence six); that court may review the Secretary's post-remand ""additional or modified findings of fact and decision"" (sentence seven); and that court's judgment ""shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions"" (sentence eight).  Respondent filed an application for widow's disability benefits under  423(d)(2)(B), which authorizes an award to a widow whose impairment is of a level of severity deemed sufficient by the Secretary's regulations to preclude an individual from engaging in any gainful activity.  Under those regulations, a surviving spouse who suffers from an impairment meeting or equaling the severity of an impairment included in the Secretary's Listing of Impairments is disabled.  After respondent's application was denied on the ground that her heart condition did not meet or equal a listed impairment, she filed suit in the District Court, invoking  405(g).  The court sustained the Secretary's conclusion that she did not meet the regulatory definition for disability, but reversed the decision and remanded the case for a determination of her ability to engage in any gainful activity without regard to the regulation.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the Secretary's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because remands to administrative agencies are not ordinarily ""final decisions"" appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291.  It held that the exception for cases in which an important legal issue is finally resolved and review of that issue would be foreclosed as a practical matter if an immediate appeal were unavailable was inapplicable because, if the Secretary persisted in refusing benefits on 
Page 496 U. S. 618
 remand, the District Court might order that benefits be granted, thereby providing the Secretary with an appealable final decision.  The court also believed that Circuit precedent foreclosed the Secretary's argument that he might not be able to obtain review at a later point if he awarded benefits on remand.

No. 89-390
Argued Feb. 27, 1990
Decided June 18, 1990
496 U.S. 633

Syllabus 
Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) includes a mandatory Government insurance program that protects private-sector workers participating in covered pension plans against the termination of their plans before sufficient funds have been accumulated to pay anticipated benefits.  The program is administered by petitioner Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is responsible for paying terminated plans' unfunded liabilities out of the proceeds of annual premiums collected from employers maintaining ongoing plans.  Respondent LTV Corporation and many of its subsidiaries (collectively LTV) filed reorganization petitions under the Bankruptcy Code for the purpose, inter alia, of restructuring the pension obligations of one of the subsidiaries under three ERISA-covered, chronically underfunded pension plans (the Plans), two of which could not be voluntarily terminated by LTV under ERISA's terms because they resulted from collective bargaining negotiations with the United Steelworkers of America.  In light of LTV's statement that it could no longer provide complete funding, the PBGC sought involuntary termination of the Plans to protect the insurance program from the risk of large losses.  After the District Court terminated the Plans, LTV and the Steelworkers negotiated new pension arrangements, which the PBGC characterized as ""follow-on"" plans -- i.e., arrangements designed to wrap around PBGC insurance benefits to provide substantially the same benefits as would have been received had no termination occurred.  Pursuant to its anti-follow-on policy, which considers such plans to be ""abusive"" of the insurance program, and in light of its perception that LTV's financial circumstances had dramatically improved, the PBGC issued a Notice of Restoration of the terminated Plans under  4047 of ERISA, which authorizes the PBGC to undo a termination ""in any . . . case in which [it] determines such action to be appropriate and consistent with its duties under [Title IV].""  When LTV refused to comply with the restoration decision, the PBGC filed an enforcement action, but the District Court vacated the decision upon finding, among other things, that the PBGC had exceeded its  4047 authority.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the restoration decision was, in various respects, ""arbitrary and 
Page 496 U. S. 634
 capricious"" or contrary to law under  706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
Held:  The PBGC's restoration decision was not arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law under  706(2)(A) of the APA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 645-656.
(a) The PBGC's failure to consider and discuss the ""policies and goals"" underlying federal bankruptcy and labor law did not, as the Court of Appeals held, render the restoration decision arbitrary and capricious.  That holding cannot be reconciled with the plain language of  4047, which does not direct that the decision further the ""public interest"" generally, but, rather, specifically and unambiguously requires the PBGC to focus on ERISA.  Moreover, if agency action could be disturbed whenever a reviewing court was able to pinpoint an arguably relevant statutory policy that was not explicitly considered, a very large number of agency decisions might be open to judicial invalidation in light of numerous federal statutes that could be said to embody countless goals.  Also, because the PBGC can claim no expertise in the labor and bankruptcy areas, it may be ill-equipped to undertake the difficult task of discerning and applying the ""policies and goals"" of those fields.  Pp.  496 U. S. 645-647.
(b) The PBGC's anti-follow-on policy is not contrary to law.  A clear congressional intent to avoid restoration decisions based on the existence of follow-on plans is not evinced by the text of  4047, which embodies a broad grant of authority to the PBGC, or by the legislative history of ERISA or its 1987 amendments.  Moreover, the policy is based on a ""permissible"" construction that is rational and consistent with  4047, and is therefore entitled to deference.  The policy is premised on the eminently reasonable belief that employees will object more strenuously to a company's original termination decision if a follow-on plan cannot be used to put them in the same position after termination as they were in before.  The availability of such a plan thus would remove employee resistance as a significant check against termination, and may therefore tend to frustrate one of ERISA's objectives that the PBGC is supposed to accomplish -- the continuation and maintenance of voluntary private plans.  In addition, such plans have a tendency to increase the PBGC's deficit and employers' insurance premiums, thereby frustrating a related ERISA objective -- the maintenance of low premiums.  Although the employer's financial improvement may be relevant to the restoration decision, it is not, as respondents contend, the only permissible consideration.  It is rational for the PBGC to disfavor follow-on plans where, as here, there is no suggestion that immediate retermination will be rendered necessary by the employers' financial situation.  Pp.  496 U. S. 647-652.
(c) The restoration decision in this case was not rendered arbitrary and capricious by the use of inadequate procedures.  Since the Court of Appeals did not point to any APA or ERISA provision giving LTV the 
Page 496 U. S. 635
 procedural rights identified by the court -- an apprisal of material on which the decision was to be based, an adequate opportunity to offer contrary evidence, proceedings in accordance with ascertainable standards, and a statement showing the PBGC's reasoning in applying those standards -- the court's holding ran afoul of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519,  435 U. S. 524.  Moreover, since there was no suggestion that the administrative record was inadequate to enable the court to fulfill its  706 duties, its holding finds no support in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S. 402,  401 U. S. 419.  Nor is LTV aided by the dictum of Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281,  419 U. S. 288, n. 4, that a
""party is entitled . . . to know the issues on which decision will turn and to be apprised of the factual material on which the agency relies for decision so that he may rebut it.""
That statement was made in the context of a formal agency adjudication under the trial-type procedures of  554, 556-557 of the APA, which require notice of the factual and legal matters asserted, an opportunity for the submission and consideration of facts and arguments, and an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions or exceptions.  The determination here, however, was lawfully made by informal adjudication under  555, which does not require such elements.  Pp.  496 U. S. 653-656.

|496 u.s. 661|"Eli Lilly and Company v. Medtronic, Inc.
No. 89-243
Argued Feb. 26, 1990
Decided June 18, 1990
496 U.S. 661

Syllabus 
Claiming infringement of two of its patents, petitioner Eli Lilly's predecessor-in-interest filed suit to enjoin respondent Medtronic's testing and marketing of a medical device.  Medtronic defended on the ground that its activities were undertaken to develop and submit to the Government information necessary to obtain premarketing approval for the device under  515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and were therefore exempt from a finding of infringement under 35 U.S.C.  271(e)(1), which authorizes the manufacture, use, or sale of a patented device
""solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs.""
The District Court concluded that  271(e)(1) does not apply to medical devices and, after a jury trial, entered judgment on verdicts for Eli Lilly.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that, under  271(e)(1), Medtronic's activities could not constitute infringement if they were related to obtaining regulatory approval under the FDCA, and remanded for the District Court to determine whether that condition had been met.
Held:  Section 271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of patented inventions reasonably related to the development and submission of information needed to obtain marketing approval of medical devices under the FDCA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 665-679.
(a) The statutory phrase of  271(e)(1), ""a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,"" is ambiguous.  It is somewhat more naturally read (as Medtronic asserts) to refer to the entirety of any Act, including the FDCA, at least some of whose provisions regulate drugs, rather than (as Eli Lilly contends) to only those individual provisions of federal law that regulate drugs.  However, the text, by itself, is imprecise, and not plainly comprehensible on either view.  Pp.  496 U. S. 665-669.
(b) Taken as a whole, the structure of the 1984 Act that established  271(e)(1) supports Medtronic's interpretation.  The 1984 Act was designed to remedy two unintended distortions of the standard 17-year patent term produced by the requirement that certain products receive premarket regulatory approval:  (1) the patentee would, as a practical matter, not be able to reap any financial rewards during the early years of the term while he was engaged in seeking approval; and (2) the end of 
Page 496 U. S. 662
 the term would be effectively extended until approval was obtained for competing inventions, since competitors could not initiate the regulatory process until the term's expiration.  Section 202 of the Act addressed the latter distortion by creating  271(e)(1), while  201 of the Act sought to eliminate the former distortion by creating 35 U.S.C.  156, which sets forth a patent-term extension for inventions subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process.  Eli Lilly's interpretation of  271(e)(1) would allow the patentee of a medical device or other FDCA-regulated nondrug product to obtain the advantage of  201's patent-term extension without suffering the disadvantage of  202's noninfringement provision.  It is implausible that Congress, being demonstrably aware of the dual distorting effects of regulatory approval requirements, should choose to address both distortions only for drug products, and for other products named in  201 should enact provisions which not only leave in place an anticompetitive restriction at the end of the monopoly term but simultaneously expand the term itself, thereby not only failing to eliminate but positively aggravating distortion of the 17-year patent protection.  Moreover, the fact that  202 expressly excepts from its infringement exemption ""a new animal drug or veterinary biological product"" -- each of which is subject to premarketing licensing and approval under, respectively, the FDCA and another ""Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,"" and neither of which was included in  201's patent-term extension provision -- indicates that  201 and 202 are meant generally to be complementary.  Interpreting  271(e)(1) as the Court of Appeals did appears to create a perfect ""product"" fit between the two sections.  Pp.  496 U. S. 669-674.
(c) Sections 271(e)(2) and 271(e)(4), which establish and provide remedies for a certain type of patent infringement only with respect to drug products, do not suggest that section 271(e)(1) applies only to drug products as well.  The former sections have a technical purpose relating to the new abbreviated regulatory approval procedures established by the 1984 Act, which happened to apply only to drug products.  Pp.  496 U. S. 675-678.

Medtronic defended on the ground that its activities were undertaken to develop and submit to the Government information necessary to obtain premarketing approval for the device under  515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and were therefore exempt from a finding of infringement under 35 U.S.C.  271(e)(1), which authorizes the manufacture, use, or sale of a patented device
""solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs.""
The District Court concluded that  271(e)(1) does not apply to medical devices and, after a jury trial, entered judgment on verdicts for Eli Lilly.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that, under  271(e)(1), Medtronic's activities could not constitute infringement if they were related to obtaining regulatory approval under the FDCA, and remanded for the District Court to determine whether that condition had been met.
Held:  Section 271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of patented inventions reasonably related to the development and submission of information needed to obtain marketing approval of medical devices under the FDCA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 665-679.
(a) The statutory phrase of  271(e)(1), ""a Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,"" is ambiguous.  It is somewhat more naturally read (as Medtronic asserts) to refer to the entirety of any Act, including the FDCA, at least some of whose provisions regulate drugs, rather than (as Eli Lilly contends) to only those individual provisions of federal law that regulate drugs.  However, the text, by itself, is imprecise, and not plainly comprehensible on either view.  Pp.  496 U. S. 665-669.
(b) Taken as a whole, the structure of the 1984 Act that established  271(e)(1) supports Medtronic's interpretation.  The 1984 Act was designed to remedy two unintended distortions of the standard 17-year patent term produced by the requirement that certain products receive premarket regulatory approval:  (1) the patentee would, as a practical matter, not be able to reap any financial rewards during the early years of the term while he was engaged in seeking approval; and (2) the end of 
Page 496 U. S. 662
 the term would be effectively extended until approval was obtained for competing inventions, since competitors could not initiate the regulatory process until the term's expiration.  Section 202 of the Act addressed the latter distortion by creating  271(e)(1), while  201 of the Act sought to eliminate the former distortion by creating 35 U.S.C.  156, which sets forth a patent-term extension for inventions subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process.  Eli Lilly's interpretation of  271(e)(1) would allow the patentee of a medical device or other FDCA-regulated nondrug product to obtain the advantage of  201's patent-term extension without suffering the disadvantage of  202's noninfringement provision.  It is implausible that Congress, being demonstrably aware of the dual distorting effects of regulatory approval requirements, should choose to address both distortions only for drug products, and for other products named in  201 should enact provisions which not only leave in place an anticompetitive restriction at the end of the monopoly term but simultaneously expand the term itself, thereby not only failing to eliminate but positively aggravating distortion of the 17-year patent protection.  Moreover, the fact that  202 expressly excepts from its infringement exemption ""a new animal drug or veterinary biological product"" -- each of which is subject to premarketing licensing and approval under, respectively, the FDCA and another ""Federal law which regulates the manufacture, use, or sale of drugs,"" and neither of which was included in  201's patent-term extension provision -- indicates that  201 and 202 are meant generally to be complementary.  Interpreting  271(e)(1) as the Court of Appeals did appears to create a perfect ""product"" fit between the two sections.  Pp.  496 U. S. 669-674.
(c) Sections 271(e)(2) and 271(e)(4), which establish and provide remedies for a certain type of patent infringement only with respect to drug products, do not suggest that section 271(e)(1) applies only to drug products as well.  The former sections have a technical purpose relating to the new abbreviated regulatory approval procedures established by the 1984 Act, which happened to apply only to drug products.  Pp.  496 U. S. 675-678.

496 U.S. 444
Syllabus
Petitioners, the Michigan State Police Department and its Director, established a highway sobriety checkpoint program with guidelines governing checkpoint operations, site selection, and publicity.  During the only operation to date, 126 vehicles passed through the checkpoint, the average delay per vehicle was 25 seconds, and two drivers were arrested for driving under the influence.  The day before that operation, respondents, licensed Michigan drivers, filed suit in a county court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from potential subjection to the checkpoints.  After a trial, at which the court heard extensive testimony concerning, among other things, the ""effectiveness"" of such programs, the court applied the balancing test of Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, and ruled that the State's program violated the Fourth Amendment.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing with the lower court's findings that the State has a ""grave and legitimate"" interest in curbing drunken driving; that sobriety checkpoint programs are generally ineffective and, therefore, do not significantly further that interest; and that, while the checkpoints' objective intrusion on individual liberties is slight, their ""subjective intrusion"" is substantial.
Held:  Petitioner's highway sobriety checkpoint program is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.  448-455.
(a) United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 -- which utilized a balancing test in upholding checkpoints for detecting illegal aliens -- and Brown v. Texas, supra, are the relevant authorities to be used in evaluating the constitutionality of the State's program.  Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, was not designed to repudiate this Court's prior cases dealing with police stops of motorists on public highways and, thus, does not forbid the use of a balancing test here.  Pp.  448-450.
(b) A Fourth Amendment ""seizure"" occurs when a vehicle is stopped at a checkpoint.  See Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at  556.  Thus, the question here is whether such seizures are ""reasonable.""  P.  450.
(c) There is no dispute about the magnitude of, and the States' interest in eradicating, the drunken driving problem.  The courts below accurately gauged the ""objective"" intrusion, measured by the seizure's duration and the investigation's intensity, as minimal.  However, they 
[445]
 misread this Court's cases concerning the degree of ""subjective intrusion"" and the potential for generating fear and surprise.  The ""fear and surprise"" to be considered are not the natural fear of one who has been drinking over the prospect of being stopped at a checkpoint but, rather, the fear and surprise engendered in law abiding motorists by the nature of the particular stop, such as one made by a roving patrol operating on a seldom-traveled road.  Here, checkpoints are selected pursuant to guidelines, and uniformed officers stop every vehicle.  The resulting intrusion is constitutionally indistinguishable from the stops upheld in Martinez-Fuerte.  Pp.  451-453.
(d) The Court of Appeals also erred in finding that the program failed the ""effectiveness"" part of the Brown test.  This balancing factor -- which Brown actually describes as ""the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest"" -- was not meant to transfer from politically accountable officials to the courts the choice as to which among reasonable alternative law enforcement techniques should be employed to deal with a serious public danger.  Moreover, the court mistakenly relied on Martinez-Fuerte, supra, and Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, to provide a basis for its ""effectiveness"" review.  Unlike Delaware v. Prouse, this case involves neither random stops nor a complete absence of empirical data indicating that the stops would be an effective means of promoting roadway safety.  And there is no justification for a different conclusion here than in Martinez-Fuerte, where the ratio of illegal aliens detected to vehicles stopped was approximately .5 percent, as compared with the approximately 1.5 percent detection ratio in the one checkpoint conducted by Michigan and with the 1 percent ratio demonstrated by other States' experience.

Syllabus 
In determining whether a family's income disqualifies it from receiving benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program of Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act, the appropriate agency of a participating State is required to ""disregard the first $50 of any child support payments"" received by the family in any month for which benefits are sought. 42 U.S.C.  602(a)(8)(A)(vi).  Under this provision, petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services has declined to ""disregard"" the first $50 of ""child's insurance benefits"" received under Title II of the Act, reasoning that such benefits are not ""child support"" because that term, as used throughout Title IV, invariably refers to payments from absent parents.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, custodial parents receiving AFDC benefits, in their suit challenging the Secretary's interpretation of  602(a)(8)(A)(vi).  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that, since AFDC applicants receiving Title II benefits are burdened by the same eligibility constraints as those receiving payments directly from absent parents, no rational basis exists for according one class of families the mitigating benefit of the disregard while depriving the other of that benefit.  The court added that to construe  602(a)(8)(A)(vi) to exclude the Title II benefits from the disregard would raise constitutional equal protection concerns.
Held:  Title II ""child's insurance benefits"" do not constitute ""child support"" within the meaning of  602(a)(8)(A)(vi).  The clear and unambiguous language of the statute demonstrates that Congress used ""child support"" throughout Title IV as a term of art referring exclusively to payments from absent parents.  See, e.g.,  651, the first provision in Part D of Title IV, which is devoted exclusively to ""Child Support and Enforcement of Paternity.""  Since the statute also makes plain that Congress meant for the Part D program to work in tandem with the Part A AFDC program to provide uniform levels of support for children of equal need, see  602(a)(26), 602(a)(27), 654(5), the phrase ""child support"" as used in the two Parts must be given the same meaning.  See, e.g., Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851,  475 U. S. 860.  Thus, although governmentally funded Title II child's insurance benefits might be characterized as

 ""support"" in the generic sense, they are not the sort of child support payments from absent parents envisioned by Title IV.

Syllabus 
To qualify for federal financial assistance to help defray the cost of furnishing medical care to the needy under the Medicaid Act, States must submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for approval a plan which, inter alia, establishes a scheme for reimbursing health care providers.  In 1980, Congress passed the Boren Amendment to the Act, which requires provider reimbursement according to rates that the ""State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary,"" are ""reasonable and adequate"" to meet the costs of ""efficiently and economically operated facilities.""  The State must also assure the Secretary that individuals have ""reasonable access"" to facilities of ""adequate quality.""  Virginia's Plan, under which providers are reimbursed according to a prospective formula, was approved by the Secretary in 1982 and again in 1986 after an amendment.  In 1986, respondent, a nonprofit corporation composed of public and private hospitals operating in Virginia, filed suit against petitioner state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that the State Plan violates the Act because its reimbursement rates are not ""reasonable and adequate.""  The District Court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, which was based on the claim that  1983 does not afford respondent a cause of action.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that providers may sue state official for declaratory and injunctive relief under  1983 to assure compliance with the Boren Amendment.
Held:  The Boren Amendment is enforceable in a  1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by health care providers.  Pp.  496 U. S. 508-524.
(a) Section 1983 -- which provides a cause of action for the ""deprivation of any rights . . . secured by [federal] laws"" -- is inapplicable if (1) the statute in question does not create enforceable ""rights"" within  1983's meaning, or (2) Congress has foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.  Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418,  479 U. S. 423.  P.  496 U. S. 508.
(b) The Boren Amendment creates a substantive federal ""right,"" enforceable by providers under  1983, to the adoption of reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates.  There can be little doubt that providers are the intended beneficiaries of the Amendment, See Golden State Transit 
Page 496 U. S. 499
 Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103,  493 U. S. 106, since the Amendment establishes a system for reimbursing such providers and is phrased in terms benefiting them.  Moreover, the Amendment imposes a ""binding obligation"" on the States that gives rise to enforceable rights, see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,  451 U. S. 19, since it is cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms, and since the provision of federal funds is expressly conditioned on compliance with the Amendment.  Petitioners' contention that Congress did not intend to require States to adopt rates that actually are reasonable and adequate is contrary to the statutory language, which requires the State to find that its rates satisfy these requirements and entitles the Secretary to reject a state plan upon concluding that the assurances given are unsatisfactory, and would render those requirements, and thus the entire reimbursement provision, essentially meaningless.  Petitioners' contention is quickly dispelled by a review of the Amendment's background and the legislative history, which demonstrate that the Amendment was passed to free the States from restrictive reimbursement requirements previously imposed by the Secretary, and not to relieve them of their fundamental obligation to pay reasonable rates, and that Congress intended to retain providers' preexisting right to challenge rates as unreasonable in injunctive suits under  1983.  Furthermore, a State's flexibility to adopt rates that it finds to be reasonable and adequate does not, as petitioners contend, render the obligation imposed by the Amendment too ""vague and amorphous"" to be judicially enforceable.  See Golden State, supra, 493 U.S. at  493 U. S. 106.  The statute and the Secretary's regulations set out factors which a State must consider in adopting its rates, and the statute requires the State, in making its findings, to judge the rates' reasonableness against the objective benchmark of an ""efficiently and economically operated facility"" while ensuring ""reasonable access"" to eligible participants.  Although some knowledge of the hospital industry might be required to evaluate a State's findings, such an inquiry is well within the competence of the Judiciary.  Pp.  496 U. S. 509-520.
(c) Congress has not foreclosed a private judicial remedy for enforcement of the Boren Amendment under  1983, since there is no express provision to that effect in the Act, see Wright, supra, 479 U.S. at 423, and since the statute does not create a remedial scheme that is sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate an intent to preclude the remedy of  1983 suits, see Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1,  453 U. S. 20.  Because a primary purpose of the Amendment was to reduce the Secretary's role in determining rate payment calculation methods, the Secretary's limited oversight function under the Act, which authorizes him to withhold approval of plans or to curtail federal funds in cases of noncompliance, is insufficient to demonstrate an intent 
Page 496 U. S. 500
 to foreclose  1983 relief.  Cf. Wright, supra, 479 U.S. at  479 U. S. 428.  Moreover, although a regulation requires States to adopt an appeals procedure by which individual providers may obtain administrative review of reimbursement rates, it also allows States to limit the issues that may be raised on review, and most States, including Virginia, do not allow providers to challenge the overall method by which rates are determined.  Such limited state procedures cannot be considered a ""comprehensive"" scheme that precludes reliance on  1983.  See id. at 4 479 U. S. 29.  Pp.  496 U. S. 520-523.

(b) The Boren Amendment creates a substantive federal ""right,"" enforceable by providers under  1983, to the adoption of reasonable and adequate reimbursement rates.  There can be little doubt that providers are the intended beneficiaries of the Amendment, See Golden State Transit 
Page 496 U. S. 499
 Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103,  493 U. S. 106, since the Amendment establishes a system for reimbursing such providers and is phrased in terms benefiting them.  Moreover, the Amendment imposes a ""binding obligation"" on the States that gives rise to enforceable rights, see Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,  451 U. S. 19, since it is cast in mandatory rather than precatory terms, and since the provision of federal funds is expressly conditioned on compliance with the Amendment.  Petitioners' contention that Congress did not intend to require States to adopt rates that actually are reasonable and adequate is contrary to the statutory language, which requires the State to find that its rates satisfy these requirements and entitles the Secretary to reject a state plan upon concluding that the assurances given are unsatisfactory, and would render those requirements, and thus the entire reimbursement provision, essentially meaningless.  Petitioners' contention is quickly dispelled by a review of the Amendment's background and the legislative history, which demonstrate that the Amendment was passed to free the States from restrictive reimbursement requirements previously imposed by the Secretary, and not to relieve them of their fundamental obligation to pay reasonable rates, and that Congress intended to retain providers' preexisting right to challenge rates as unreasonable in injunctive suits under  1983.  Furthermore, a State's flexibility to adopt rates that it finds to be reasonable and adequate does not, as petitioners contend, render the obligation imposed by the Amendment too ""vague and amorphous"" to be judicially enforceable.  See Golden State, supra, 493 U.S. at  493 U. S. 106.  The statute and the Secretary's regulations set out factors which a State must consider in adopting its rates, and the statute requires the State, in making its findings, to judge the rates' reasonableness against the objective benchmark of an ""efficiently and economically operated facility"" while ensuring ""reasonable access"" to eligible participants.  Although some knowledge of the hospital industry might be required to evaluate a State's findings, such an inquiry is well within the competence of the Judiciary.  Pp.  496 U. S. 509-520.
(c) Congress has not foreclosed a private judicial remedy for enforcement of the Boren Amendment under  1983, since there is no express provision to that effect in the Act, see Wright, supra, 479 U.S. at 423, and since the statute does not create a remedial scheme that is sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate an intent to preclude the remedy of  1983 suits, see Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1,  453 U. S. 20.  Because a primary purpose of the Amendment was to reduce the Secretary's role in determining rate payment calculation methods, the Secretary's limited oversight function under the Act, which authorizes him to withhold approval of plans or to curtail federal funds in cases of noncompliance, is insufficient to demonstrate an intent 
Page 496 U. S. 500
 to foreclose  1983 relief.  Cf. Wright, supra, 479 U.S. at  479 U. S. 428.  Moreover, although a regulation requires States to adopt an appeals procedure by which individual providers may obtain administrative review of reimbursement rates, it also allows States to limit the issues that may be raised on review, and most States, including Virginia, do not allow providers to challenge the overall method by which rates are determined.  Such limited state procedures cannot be considered a ""comprehensive"" scheme that precludes reliance on  1983.  See id. at 4 479 U. S. 29.  Pp.  496 U. S. 520-523.

Decided June 14, 1990
496 U.S. 530

Syllabus 
The Clean Air Act was amended in 1970 to deal with a perceived national air pollution emergency.  The amendments required that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) within 30 days, and that each State thereafter submit a state implementation plan (SIP) within nine months.  Section 110(a)(2) of the Act required the Administrator to approve a SIP within four months of its submission if the SIP met various substantive requirements.  Section 110(a)(3) authorizes a State to propose a SIP revision, and requires the Administrator to approve that revision if he determines, among other things, that it ""meets the requirements of [ 110(a)(2)].""  In 1980, EPA approved Massachusetts' proposed SIP governing certain emissions from automobile painting operations.  The SIP permitted petitioner General Motors Corporation (GMC) -- whose automobile plant's painting operation is a source of ozone -- to meet emissions limits in stages, but required full compliance by December 31, 1985.  In June, 1985, GMC sought an extension of that deadline until summer, 1987.  Massachusetts approved the revision and submitted it to EPA on the day before the existing SIP's deadline, but EPA did not reject it until September, 1988.  In the meantime, EPA sent GMC a notice of violation of the existing SIP and filed an enforcement action in the District Court.  In May, 1988, the District Court entered summary judgment for GMC, holding that  110(a)(3) imposed a 4-month time limit on EPA review of a SIP revision, and that EPA was therefore barred from enforcing the existing SIP from the end of the 4-month period until it finally acted on the revision.  Although agreeing that the Act imposed a 4-month deadline, the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the failure to meet that deadline did not preclude EPA from enforcing the existing SIP.
Held:
1. EPA is not required to act on a proposed SIP revision within four months.  Since  110(a)(2)'s 4-month requirement was enacted as one of a series of deadlines designed to assure quick implementation of pollution control requirements, that section refers only to the action required on the original SIP, and not to a revision.  Moreover, in the absence of an express requirement that the Administrator process a proposed revision within four months, this Court is not free to read such a 
Page 496 U. S. 531
 limitation into  110(a)(3).  That section incorporates only the substantive, but not the procedural, requirements of  110(a)(2). Nor does  110(g) -- which authorizes a State Governor, in certain circumstances, temporarily to suspend a SIP for which the State has submitted a proposed revision when the Administrator has not taken action ""within the required four-month period"" -- impose a 4-month limitation on EPA.  That section does not require the Administrator to do anything, and its incorporation of the mistaken presupposition that some ""four-month period"" is ""required"" does not impose a general requirement on EPA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 536-539.
2. Although subject to the Administrative Procedure Act's requirement that agencies conclude matters ""within a reasonable time,"" EPA is not barred from bringing suit to enforce an existing SIP if it unreasonably delays action on a proposed revision.  This Court will not infer an enforcement bar in the absence of a specific provision in the Clean Air Act suggesting that Congress intended to create one.  In fact, that Act plainly states that EPA may bring an enforcement action whenever a person is in violation of any ""applicable implementation plan"" requirement,  113(b)(2), and there is little doubt that the existing SIP remains the ""applicable implementation plan"" even after the State has submitted a proposed revision.  See, e.g., Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 421 U. S. 60,  421 U. S. 92.  It is significant that Congress explicitly enacted an enforcement bar elsewhere in the Act, see  113(d)(10), but failed to do so in the section at issue, and that it provided other, less drastic, remedies when EPA delays action on a SIP revision, see  304(a)(2), 113(b).

No. 87-2048
Argued Dec. 5, 1989
Decided June 14, 1990
496 U.S. 543

Syllabus 
Between 1972 and 1981, petitioner Texaco sold gasoline at its retail tank wagon prices to respondent independent Texaco' retailers but granted substantial discounts to distributors Gull and Dompier.  Gull resold the gas under its own name; the fact that it was being supplied by Texaco was unknown to respondents.  Dompier paid a higher price than Gull, and supplied its gas under the Texaco brand name to retail stations.  With the encouragement of Texaco, Dompier entered the retail market directly.  Both distributors picked up gas at the Texaco plant and delivered it directly to their retail outlets, and neither maintained any significant storage facilities.  Unlike Gull, Dompier received an additional discount from Texaco for the deliveries.  Texaco executives were well aware of Dompier's dramatic growth, and attributed it to the magnitude of the discounts.  During the relevant period, the stations supplied by the distributors increased their sales volume dramatically, while respondents' sales suffered a corresponding decline.  In 1976, respondents filed suit against Texaco under the Robinson-Patman Amendments to the Clayton Act (Act), alleging that the distributor discounts violated  2(a) of the Act, which, among other things, forbids any person to ""discriminate in price"" between different purchasers of commodities where the effect of such discrimination is substantially to
""injure . . . competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.""
The jury awarded respondents actual damages.  The District Court denied Texaco's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  Texaco had claimed that, as a matter of law, its ""functional discounts"" -- i. e., discounts that are given to a purchaser based on its role in the supplier's distributive system and reflect, at least in a generalized sense, the services performed by the purchaser for the supplier -- did not adversely affect competition within the meaning of the Act.  The District Court rejected Texaco's argument, reasoning that the ""presumed legality of functional discounts"" had been rebutted by evidence that the amount of Gull's and Dompier's discounts was not reasonably related to the cost of any function they performed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 496 U. S. 544

Held:
1. Respondents have satisfied their burden of proving that Texaco violated the Act.  Pp.  496 U. S. 554-571.
(a) Texaco's argument that it did not ""discriminate in price"" within the meaning of  2(a) by charging different prices is rejected in light of this Court's holding in FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U. S. 536,  363 U. S. 549, that ""a price discrimination within the meaning of [ 2(a)] is merely a price difference.""  Texaco's argument, which would create a blanket exemption for all functional discounts, has some support in the legislative history of the Act, but is foreclosed by the text of the Act itself, which plainly reveals a concern with competitive consequences at different levels of distribution and carefully defines two specific affirmative defenses that are unavailable.  Pp.  496 U. S. 556-559.
(b) Also rejected is Texaco's argument that, at least to the extent that Gull and Dompier acted as wholesalers, the price differentials did not ""injure . . . competition"" within the meaning of the Act.  It is true that a legitimate functional discount that constitutes a reasonable reimbursement for the purchasers' actual marketing functions does not violate the Act.  Thus, such a discount raises no inference of injury to competition under FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37,  334 U. S. 46-47.  However, the Act does not tolerate a functional discount that is completely untethered either to the supplier's savings or the wholesaler's costs.  This conclusion is consistent with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) practice, with Perkins v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 395 U. S. 642, and with the analysis of antitrust commentators.  The record here adequately supports the finding that Texaco violated the Act.  There was an extraordinary absence of evidence to connect Gull's and Dompier's discounts to any savings enjoyed by Texaco.  Both Gull and Dompier received the full discount on all purchases, even though most of their volume was resold directly to consumers, and the extra margin on those sales obviously enabled them to price aggressively in both their retail and wholesale marketing.  The Morton Salt presumption of adverse effect becomes all the more appropriate to the extent they competed with respondents in the retail market.  Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Texaco was encouraging Dompier to integrate downward, and was fully informed about the dramatic impact of the Dompier discount on the retail market at the same time that Texaco was inhibiting upward integration by respondents.  Pp.  496 U. S. 559-571.
2. There is no merit to Texaco's contention that the damages award must be judged excessive as a matter of law.  Texaco's theory improperly blurs the distinction between the liability and damages issues.  There is no doubt that respondents' proof of a continuing violation as to the discounts to both distributors throughout the 9-year damages period 
Page 496 U. S. 545
 was sufficient.  Proof of the specific amount of their damages necessarily was less precise, but the expert testimony provided a sufficient basis for an acceptable estimate of the amount of damages.  Cf., e.g., J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U. S. 557,  451 U. S. 565-566.  Pp.  496 U. S. 571-573.

Syllabus 
After this Court held, in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, that a Texas statute criminalizing desecration of the United States flag in a way that the actor knew would seriously offend onlookers was unconstitutional as applied to an individual who had burned a flag during a political protest, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989.  The Act criminalizes the conduct of anyone who ""knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon"" a United States flag, except conduct related to the disposal of a ""worn or soiled"" flag.  Subsequently, appellees were prosecuted in the District Courts for violating the Act:  some for knowingly burning several flags while protesting various aspects of the Government's policies and others, in a separate incident, for knowingly burning a flag while protesting the Act's passage.  In each case, appellees moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the Act violates the First Amendment.  Both District Courts, following Johnson, supra, held the Act unconstitutional as applied, and dismissed the charges.
Held:  Appellees' prosecution for burning a flag in violation of the Act is inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The Government concedes, as it must, that appellees' flag-burning constituted expressive conduct, and this Court declines to reconsider its rejection in Johnson of the claim that flag-burning as a mode of expression does not enjoy the First Amendment's full protection.  It is true that this Act, unlike the Texas law, contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the Government's asserted interest in protecting the ""physical integrity"" of a privately owned flag in order to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of the Nation and certain national ideals is related to the suppression, and concerned with the content, of free expression.  The mere destruction or disfigurement of a symbol's physical manifestation does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself.  The Government's interest is implicated only when a person's treatment of the flag communicates a message to others that is inconsistent with the identified ideals.  The precise language of the Act's 
Page 496 U. S. 311
 prohibitions confirms Congress' interest in the communicative impact of flag destruction, since each of the specified terms -- with the possible exception of ""burns"" -- unmistakably connotes disrespectful treatment of the flag and suggests a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag's symbolic value, and since the explicit exemption for disposal of ""worn or soiled"" flags protects certain acts traditionally associated with patriotic respect for the flag.  Thus, the Act suffers from the same fundamental flaw as the Texas law, and its restriction on expression cannot ""be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,'"" Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,  485 U. S. 320.  It must therefore be subjected to ""the most exacting scrutiny,"" id. at  485 U. S. 321, and, for the reasons stated in Johnson, supra, at  491 U. S. 413-415, the Government's interest cannot justify its infringement on First Amendment rights.  This conclusion will not be reassessed in light of Congress' recent recognition of a purported ""national consensus"" favoring a prohibition on flag-burning, since any suggestion that the Government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is foreign to the First Amendment.  While flag desecration -- like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures -- is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.  Pp.  496 U. S. 313-319.

Nos. 89-1433, 89-1434
Argued May 14, 1990
Decided June 11, 1990
496 U.S. 310

Syllabus 
After this Court held, in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, that a Texas statute criminalizing desecration of the United States flag in a way that the actor knew would seriously offend onlookers was unconstitutional as applied to an individual who had burned a flag during a political protest, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989.  The Act criminalizes the conduct of anyone who ""knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon"" a United States flag, except conduct related to the disposal of a ""worn or soiled"" flag.  Subsequently, appellees were prosecuted in the District Courts for violating the Act:  some for knowingly burning several flags while protesting various aspects of the Government's policies and others, in a separate incident, for knowingly burning a flag while protesting the Act's passage.  In each case, appellees moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the Act violates the First Amendment.  Both District Courts, following Johnson, supra, held the Act unconstitutional as applied, and dismissed the charges.
Held:  Appellees' prosecution for burning a flag in violation of the Act is inconsistent with the First Amendment.  The Government concedes, as it must, that appellees' flag-burning constituted expressive conduct, and this Court declines to reconsider its rejection in Johnson of the claim that flag-burning as a mode of expression does not enjoy the First Amendment's full protection.  It is true that this Act, unlike the Texas law, contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the Government's asserted interest in protecting the ""physical integrity"" of a privately owned flag in order to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of the Nation and certain national ideals is related to the suppression, and concerned with the content, of free expression.  The mere destruction or disfigurement of a symbol's physical manifestation does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself.  The Government's interest is implicated only when a person's treatment of the flag communicates a message to others that is inconsistent with the identified ideals.  The precise language of the Act's 
Page 496 U. S. 311
 prohibitions confirms Congress' interest in the communicative impact of flag destruction, since each of the specified terms -- with the possible exception of ""burns"" -- unmistakably connotes disrespectful treatment of the flag and suggests a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag's symbolic value, and since the explicit exemption for disposal of ""worn or soiled"" flags protects certain acts traditionally associated with patriotic respect for the flag.  Thus, the Act suffers from the same fundamental flaw as the Texas law, and its restriction on expression cannot ""be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,'"" Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,  485 U. S. 320.  It must therefore be subjected to ""the most exacting scrutiny,"" id. at  485 U. S. 321, and, for the reasons stated in Johnson, supra, at  491 U. S. 413-415, the Government's interest cannot justify its infringement on First Amendment rights.  This conclusion will not be reassessed in light of Congress' recent recognition of a purported ""national consensus"" favoring a prohibition on flag-burning, since any suggestion that the Government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is foreign to the First Amendment.  While flag desecration -- like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures -- is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.

No. 89-789
Argued April 17, 1990
Decided June 11, 1990
496 U.S. 325

Syllabus 
Police received an anonymous telephone tip that respondent White would be leaving a particular apartment at a particular time in a particular vehicle, that she would be going to a particular motel, and that she would be in possession of cocaine.  They immediately proceeded to the apartment building, saw a vehicle matching the caller's description, observed White as she left the building and entered the vehicle, and followed her along the most direct route to the motel, stopping her vehicle just short of the motel.  A consensual search of the vehicle revealed marijuana and, after White was arrested, cocaine was found in her purse.  The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama reversed her conviction on possession charges, holding that the trial court should have suppressed the marijuana and cocaine because the officers did not have the reasonable suspicion necessary under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, to justify the investigatory stop of the vehicle.
Held:  The anonymous tip, as corroborated by independent police work, exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.  Pp.  496 U. S. 328-332.
(a) Under Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143,  407 U. S. 147, an informant's tip may carry sufficient ""indicia of reliability"" to justify a Terry stop even though it may be insufficient to support an arrest or search warrant.  Moreover, Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213,  462 U. S. 230, adopted a ""totality of the circumstances"" approach to determining whether an informant's tip establishes probable cause, whereby the informant's veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge are highly relevant.  These factors are also relevant in the reasonable suspicion context, although allowance must be made in applying them for the lesser showing required to meet that standard.  Pp.  496 U. S. 328-329.
(b) Standing alone, the tip here is completely lacking in the necessary indicia of reliability, since it provides virtually nothing from which one might conclude that the caller is honest or his information reliable, and gives no indication of the basis for his predictions regarding White's criminal activities.  See Gates, supra, at  462 U. S. 227.  However, although it is a close question, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that significant aspects of the informant's story were sufficiently corroborated by the police to furnish reasonable suspicion.  Although not every detail

 mentioned by the tipster was verified -- e.g., the name of the woman leaving the apartment building or the precise apartment from which she left -- the officers did corroborate that a woman left the building and got into the described vehicle.  Given the facts that they proceeded to the building immediately after the call, and that White emerged not too long thereafter, it also appears that her departure was within the timeframe predicted by the caller.  Moreover, since her four-mile route was the most direct way to the motel, but nevertheless involved several turns, the caller's prediction of her destination was significantly corroborated, even though she was stopped before she reached the motel.  Furthermore, the fact that the caller was able to predict her future behavior demonstrates a special familiarity with her affairs.  Thus there was reason to believe that the caller was honest and well informed, and to impart some degree of reliability to his allegation that White was engaged in criminal activity.

496 U.S. 334

Syllabus 
Since 1933, federal law has provided that persons enlisting in a state National Guard unit simultaneously enlist in the National Guard of the United States, a part of the Army.  The enlistees retain their status as state Guard members unless and until ordered to active federal duty, and revert to state status upon being relieved from federal service.  The authority to order the Guard to federal duty was limited to periods of national emergency until 1952, when Congress broadly authorized orders ""to active duty or active duty for training"" without any emergency requirement, but provided that such orders could not be issued without the consent of the governor of the State concerned.  After two State Governors refused to consent to federal training missions abroad for their Guard units, the gubernatorial consent requirement was partially repealed in 1986 by the ""Montgomery Amendment,"" which provides that a governor cannot withhold consent with regard to active duty outside the United States because of any objection to the location, purpose, type, or schedule of such duty.  Petitioner, Governor of Minnesota, filed a complaint for injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that the Montgomery Amendment had prevented him from withholding his consent to a 1987 federal training mission in Central America for certain members of the state Guard, and that the Amendment violates the Militia Clauses of Article I,  8, of the Constitution, which authorize Congress to provide for (1) calling forth the militia to execute federal law, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions, and (2) organizing, arming, disciplining, and governing such part of the militia as may be employed in the federal service, reserving to the States the appointment of officers and the power to train the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.  The District Court rejected the Governor's challenge, holding that the federal Guard was created pursuant to Congress' Article I,  8, power to raise and support armies; that the fact that Guard units also have an identity as part of the state militia does not limit Congress' plenary authority to train the units as it sees fit when the Guard is called to active federal service; and that, accordingly, the Constitution neither required the gubernatorial veto nor prohibited its withdrawal.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 496 U. S. 335

Held:  Article I's plain language, read as a whole, establishes that Congress may authorize members of the National Guard of the United States to be ordered to active federal duty for purposes of training outside the United States without either the consent of a state governor or the declaration of a national emergency.  Pp.  496 U. S. 347-355.
(a) The unchallenged validity of the dual enlistment system means that Guard members lose their state status when called to active federal duty, and, if that duty is a training mission, the training is performed by the Army.  During such periods, the second Militia Clause is no longer applicable.  Pp.  496 U. S. 347-349.
(b) This view of the constitutional issue was presupposed by the Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366,  245 U. S. 375,  245 U. S. 377,  245 U. S. 381-384, which held that the Militia Clauses do not constrain Congress' Article I,  8, powers to provide for the common defense, raise and support armies, make rules for the governance of the Armed Forces, and enact necessary and proper laws for such purposes, but in fact provide additional grants of power to Congress.  Pp.  496 U. S. 349-351.
(c) This interpretation merely recognizes the supremacy of federal power in the military affairs area, and does not significantly affect either the State's basic training responsibility or its ability to rely on its own Guard in state emergency situations.  Pp.  496 U. S. 351-352.
(d) In light of the exclusivity of federal power over many aspects of military affairs, See Tarble's Case, 13 Wall. 397, the powers allowed to the States by existing statutes are significant.  Pp.  496 U. S. 353-354.
(e) Thus, the Montgomery Amendment is not inconsistent with the Militia Clauses.  Since the original gubernatorial veto was not constitutionally compelled, its partial repeal by the Amendment is constitutionally valid.  Pp.  496 U. S. 354-355.
880 F.2d 11 (CA 8 1989), affirmed.

496 U.S. 356

Syllabus 
State as well as federal courts have jurisdiction over suits brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, which creates a remedy for violations of federal rights committed by persons acting under color of state law.  Petitioner, a former high school student, filed a  1983 suit in a Florida Circuit Court seeking damages and injunctive relief against, inter alios, the local school board, alleging, among other things, that his federal constitutional rights were violated when his car was searched on school premises in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution, and that he was suspended from classes without due process.  The court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the board, and dismissed the complaint against the board with prejudice, citing Hill v. Department of Corrections, 513 So.2d 129, in which the State Supreme Court ruled that Florida's statutory waiver of sovereign immunity applied only to state court tort actions and conferred a blanket immunity on state governmental entities from federal civil rights actions under  1983 in state court.  The District Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal, holding that the availability of sovereign immunity in a  1983 action brought in state court is a matter of state law, and that, under Hill, the statutory waiver of immunity did not apply.
Held:  A state law ""sovereign immunity"" defense is not available to a school board in a  1983 action brought in a state court that otherwise has jurisdiction when such defense would not be available if the action were brought in a federal forum.  Pp.  496 U. S. 361-383.
(a) Since the defendant in Hill was a state agency protected from suit in federal court by the Eleventh Amendment, see Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332,  440 U. S. 341, and thus was not a ""person"" within the meaning of  1983, see Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, Hill's actual disposition, if not its language and reasoning, comports with Will, which established that the State and arms of the State, which have traditionally enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, are not subject to suit under  1983 in either federal or state court.  However, in construing Hill to extend absolute immunity not only to the State and its arm 
Page 496 U. S. 357
 but also to municipalities, counties, and school districts who might otherwise be subject to suit under  1983 in federal court, the District Court of Appeal's decision raises the concern that that court may be evading federal law and discriminating against federal causes of action.  The adequacy of the state law ground to support a judgment precluding litigation of the federal claim is a federal question, which this Court reviews de novo.  See, e.g., James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341,  466 U. S. 348-349.   496 U. S.  361-366,
(b) Under the Supremacy Clause, state courts have a concurrent duty to enforce federal law according to their regular modes of procedure.  See, e.g., Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130,  93 U. S. 136-137.  Such a court may not deny a federal right, when the parties and controversy are properly before it, in the absence of a ""valid excuse.""  Douglas v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 279 U. S. 377,  279 U. S. 387-389.  An excuse that is inconsistent with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse:  the Supremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.  See, e.g., Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 223 U. S. 1,  223 U. S. 57.  A valid excuse may exist when a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule of judicial administration, see, e.g., Douglas, supra, unless that rule is preempted by federal law, see Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131.  Pp.  496 U. S. 367-375.
(c) The District Court of Appeal's refusal to entertain  1983 actions against state entities such as school boards violates the Supremacy Clause.  If that refusal amounts to the adoption of a substantive rule of decision that state agencies are not subject to liability under  1983, it directly violates federal law, which makes governmental defendants that are not arms of the State liable for their constitutional violations under  1983.  See, e.g., St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112,  485 U. S. 121-122.  Conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under  1983 cannot be immunized by state law, even though the federal cause of action is being asserted in state court.  See, e.g., Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277,  444 U. S. 284, and n. 8.  If, on the other hand, the District Court of Appeal's decision meant that  1983 claims are excluded from the category of tort claims that the Circuit Court could hear against a school board, it was no less violative of federal law.  Cf. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Burnette, 239 U. S. 199,  239 U. S. 201.  The State has constituted the Circuit Court as a court of general jurisdiction, and it entertains state common law and statutory claims against state entities in a variety of their capacities, as well as  1983 actions against individual state officials.  A state policy that declines jurisdiction over one discrete category of  1983 claims, yet permits similar state law actions against state defendants, can be based only on the rationale that such defendants should not be held liable for  1983 violations.  Thus, there is no neutral or valid excuse for the refusal to hear suits like petitioner's.  Pp.  496 U. S. 375-381. 
Page 496 U. S. 358

(d) There is no merit to respondent's argument that a federal court has no power to compel a state court to entertain a claim over which it lacks jurisdiction under state law.  The fact that a rule is denominated jurisdictional does not provide a state court an excuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the rule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person and competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.  Also meritless is respondent's contention that sovereign immunity is not a creature of state law, but of long-established legal principles that Congress did not intend to abrogate in enacting  1983.  Congress did take common law principles into account in, e.g., excluding States and arms of the State from the definition of ""person,"" but individual States may not rely on their own common law heritage to exempt from federal liability persons that Congress subjected to liability.  Pp.  496 U. S. 381-383.

(a) Since the defendant in Hill was a state agency protected from suit in federal court by the Eleventh Amendment, see Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332,  440 U. S. 341, and thus was not a ""person"" within the meaning of  1983, see Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, Hill's actual disposition, if not its language and reasoning, comports with Will, which established that the State and arms of the State, which have traditionally enjoyed Eleventh Amendment immunity, are not subject to suit under  1983 in either federal or state court.  However, in construing Hill to extend absolute immunity not only to the State and its arm 
Page 496 U. S. 357
 but also to municipalities, counties, and school districts who might otherwise be subject to suit under  1983 in federal court, the District Court of Appeal's decision raises the concern that that court may be evading federal law and discriminating against federal causes of action.  The adequacy of the state law ground to support a judgment precluding litigation of the federal claim is a federal question, which this Court reviews de novo.  See, e.g., James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341,  466 U. S. 348-349.   496 U. S.  361-366,
(b) Under the Supremacy Clause, state courts have a concurrent duty to enforce federal law according to their regular modes of procedure.  See, e.g., Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130,  93 U. S. 136-137.  Such a court may not deny a federal right, when the parties and controversy are properly before it, in the absence of a ""valid excuse.""  Douglas v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 279 U. S. 377,  279 U. S. 387-389.  An excuse that is inconsistent with or violates federal law is not a valid excuse:  the Supremacy Clause forbids state courts to dissociate themselves from federal law because of disagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the superior authority of its source.  See, e.g., Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 223 U. S. 1,  223 U. S. 57.  A valid excuse may exist when a state court refuses jurisdiction because of a neutral state rule of judicial administration, see, e.g., Douglas, supra, unless that rule is preempted by federal law, see Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131.  Pp.  496 U. S. 367-375.
(c) The District Court of Appeal's refusal to entertain  1983 actions against state entities such as school boards violates the Supremacy Clause.  If that refusal amounts to the adoption of a substantive rule of decision that state agencies are not subject to liability under  1983, it directly violates federal law, which makes governmental defendants that are not arms of the State liable for their constitutional violations under  1983.  See, e.g., St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112,  485 U. S. 121-122.  Conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under  1983 cannot be immunized by state law, even though the federal cause of action is being asserted in state court.  See, e.g., Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277,  444 U. S. 284, and n. 8.  If, on the other hand, the District Court of Appeal's decision meant that  1983 claims are excluded from the category of tort claims that the Circuit Court could hear against a school board, it was no less violative of federal law.  Cf. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Burnette, 239 U. S. 199,  239 U. S. 201.  The State has constituted the Circuit Court as a court of general jurisdiction, and it entertains state common law and statutory claims against state entities in a variety of their capacities, as well as  1983 actions against individual state officials.  A state policy that declines jurisdiction over one discrete category of  1983 claims, yet permits similar state law actions against state defendants, can be based only on the rationale that such defendants should not be held liable for  1983 violations.  Thus, there is no neutral or valid excuse for the refusal to hear suits like petitioner's.  Pp.  496 U. S. 375-381. 
Page 496 U. S. 358

(d) There is no merit to respondent's argument that a federal court has no power to compel a state court to entertain a claim over which it lacks jurisdiction under state law.  The fact that a rule is denominated jurisdictional does not provide a state court an excuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the rule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person and competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional rules are designed to protect.  Also meritless is respondent's contention that sovereign immunity is not a creature of state law, but of long-established legal principles that Congress did not intend to abrogate in enacting  1983.  Congress did take common law principles into account in, e.g., excluding States and arms of the State from the definition of ""person,"" but individual States may not rely on their own common law heritage to exempt from federal liability persons that Congress subjected to liability.

Syllabus 
Respondents, the defendants in a District Court suit instituted by petitioner law firm on behalf of a client, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as having no basis in fact and a motion for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on the ground that the firm had not made sufficient prefiling inquiries to support the complaint's allegations.  Rule 11 -- after specifying, inter alia, that an attorney's signature on a pleading constitutes a certificate that he has read it and believes it to be well grounded in fact and legally tenable -- provides that, if a pleading is signed in violation of the Rule, the court ""shall"" impose upon the attorney or his client
""an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, . . . including a reasonable attorney's fee.""
Following petitioner's notice of voluntary dismissal of the complaint under Rule 41(a)(1)(i), the court held that petitioner's prefiling inquiries were grossly inadequate and imposed monetary sanctions upon it and its client.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the voluntary dismissal did not divest the District Court of jurisdiction to rule upon the Rule 11 motion; that that court's determination that petitioner had violated Rule 11 was substantially justified; and that an appellant who successfully defends a Rule 11 award is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees on appeal.  The court therefore remanded the case for the District Court to determine the amount of such fees and to enter an appropriate award.
Held:
1. A voluntary Rule 41(a)(1)(i) dismissal does not deprive a district court of jurisdiction over a Rule 11 motion.  This view is consistent with Rule 11's purposes of deterring baseless filings and streamlining federal court procedure, and is not contradicted by anything in that Rule or Rule 41(a)(1)(i).  Pp.  496 U. S. 393-398.
(a) Rule 41(a) permits a voluntary dismissal without prejudice only if the plaintiff files a notice of dismissal before the defendant files an answer or summary judgment motion and the plaintiff has never previously dismissed an action ""based on or including the same claim.""  Once the defendant has responded to the complaint, the plaintiff may dismiss only by stipulation or by order ""upon such terms and conditions as the 
Page 496 U. S. 385
 court deems proper.""  Moreover, a dismissal ""operates as an adjudication on the merits"" if the plaintiff has previously dismissed the claim.  Pp.  496 U. S. 393-394.
(b) The district court's jurisdiction, invoked by the filing of the underlying complaint, supports consideration of both the action's merits and the Rule 11 motion arising from that filing.  As the Rule 11 violation is complete when the paper is filed, a voluntary dismissal does not expunge the violation.  In order to comply with the Rule's requirement that it ""shall"" impose sanctions, the court must have the authority to consider whether there has been a violation of the signing requirement regardless of the dismissal.  Pp.  496 U. S. 394-395.
(c) The language of Rules 11 and 41(a)(1) is compatible.  Like the imposition of costs, attorney's fees, and contempt sanctions, a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the action's merits, but simply requires the determination of a collateral issue, which may be made after the principal suit's termination.  Because such a sanction does not signify a merits determination, its imposition does not deprive the plaintiff of his Rule 41(a) right to dismiss without prejudice.  Pp.  496 U. S. 395-397.
(d) Because both Rule 41(a)(1) and Rule 11 are aimed at curbing abuses of the judicial system, their policies are completely compatible.  Rule 41(a)(1) was designed to limit a plaintiff's ability to dismiss an action in order to curb abuses of preexisting state and federal procedures allowing dismissals as a matter of right up until the entry of the verdict or judgment.  It does not codify any policy that the plaintiff's right to one free dismissal also secures the right to file baseless papers.  If a litigant could purge his Rule 11 violation merely by taking a dismissal, he would lose all incentive to investigate more carefully before serving and filing papers.  Pp.  496 U. S. 397-398.
2. A court of appeals should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court's decision in a Rule 11 proceeding.  Petitioner's contention that the Court of Appeals should have applied a three-tiered standard of review -- a clearly erroneous standard for findings of historical fact, a de novo standard for the determination that counsel violated Rule 11, and an abuse-of-discretion standard for the choice of sanction -- is rejected.  Pp.  496 U. S. 399-405.
(a) Appellate courts must review the selection of a sanction under an abuse-of-discretion standard, since, in directing the district court to impose an ""appropriate"" sanction, Rule 11 itself indicates that that court is empowered to exercise its discretion.  Moreover, in the absence of any language in the Rule to the contrary, courts should adhere to their usual practice of reviewing the district court's findings of fact under a deferential standard.  In the present context, the abuse-of-discretion and clearly erroneous standards are indistinguishable:  
Page 496 U. S. 386
 a court of appeals would be justified in concluding that a district court had abused its discretion in making a factual finding only if the finding were clearly erroneous.  Furthermore, the court of appeals must defer to the district court's legal conclusions in Rule 11 proceedings, since those conclusions are rooted in factual determinations, rather than purely legal inquiries, and the district court, familiar with the issues and litigants, is better situated to marshall the pertinent facts and apply the necessary fact-dependent legal standard.  If the district court based its conclusion on an erroneous view of the law, the appellate court would be justified in concluding that it had abused its discretion.  Pp.  496 U. S. 400-402.
(b) Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552 -- which held that a District Court's determination under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) that ""the position of the United States was substantially justified"" should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion -- strongly supports applying a unitary abuse-of-discretion standard to all aspects of a Rule 11 proceeding.  Pp.  496 U. S. 403-404.
(c) Adoption of an abuse-of-discretion standard is also supported by Rule 11's policy goals of deterrence and streamlining the judicial process.  The district court is best situated to determine whether a sanction is warranted in light of the local bar's litigation practices, and deference to that court's determination will enhance its ability to control litigants, free appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence, and discourage litigants from pursuing marginal appeals.  Pp.  496 U. S. 404-405.
(d) The Court of Appeals' determination that the District Court ""applied the correct legal standard and offered substantial justification for its finding of a Rule 11 violation"" was consistent with the deferential standard of review adopted here.  P.  496 U. S. 405.
3. Rule 11 does not authorize a district court to award an attorney's fee incurred on appeal.  Pp.  496 U. S. 405-409.
(a) Neither the language of the Rule's sanctions provision -- when read in light of Rule l's statement that the Rules only govern district court procedure -- nor the Advisory Committee Note suggests that the Rule could require payment for appellate proceedings.  Respondents' interpretation that the provision covers any and all expenses incurred ""because of the filing"" is overbroad.  A more sensible reading permits an award only of those expenses directly caused by the filing -- logically, those at the trial level -- and considers the expenses of defending the award on appeal to arise from the award itself and the taking of the appeal, not from the initial filing of the complaint.  Pp.  496 U. S. 406-407.
(b) Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 -- which authorizes courts of appeals to ""award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee"" upon determining that an appeal is frivolous -- places a natural limit on Rule 11's scope.  If a Rule 11 appeal is frivolous, as it often 
Page 496 U. S. 387
 will be, given the district court's broad discretion to impose sanctions, Rule 38 gives the appellate court ample authority to award expenses.  However, if the appeal is not frivolous, Rule 38 does not require the appellee to pay the appellant's attorney's fees.  P.  496 U. S. 407.
(c) Limiting Rule 11's scope to trial court expenses accords with the policy of not discouraging meritorious appeals, since many valid challenges might not be filed if unsuccessful appellants were routinely required by the very courts which originally imposed sanctions to shoulder the appellee's fees.  Moreover, including such fees in a Rule 11 sanction might have the undesirable effect of encouraging additional satellite litigation, since a losing party subjected to fees on remand might again appeal the award.  Even if disallowing a Rule 11 appellate attorney's fees award would discourage litigants from defending the award when appellate expenses were likely to exceed the sanction's amount, the risk of expending the value of one's award while defending it is a natural concomitant of the American Rule, i.e., that the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect an attorney's fee.  Pp.  496 U. S. 408-409.

Syllabus 
Not wishing to exceed a statutory limit on earnings that would disqualify him from continuing to receive a disability annuity based on his years of civilian service with the Navy, respondent Richmond sought advice from Navy employee relations personnel and received erroneous oral and written information.  When Richmond's reliance on the information caused him to earn more than permitted by the relevant statute, petitioner, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), denied him six months of benefits.  The Merit Systems Protection Board denied his petition for review, rejecting his contention that the erroneous advice given him should estop OPM and bar its finding him ineligible for benefits under the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the misinformation estopped the Government, and that the estoppel required payment of benefits despite the statutory provision to the contrary.
Held:  Payments of money from the Federal Treasury are limited to those authorized by statute, and erroneous advice given by a Government employee to a benefit claimant cannot estop the Government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law.  Pp.  496 U. S. 419-434.
(a) Although dicta in some recent cases -- e.g., Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308,  366 U. S. 314-315; INS v. Hibi, 414 U. S. 5,  414 U. S. 8 (per curiam) -- have suggested, contrary to the Court's long-recognized rule, that there might be situations in which employee misconduct could give rise to estoppel against the Government, the Court has reversed, often summarily, every lower court finding of estoppel it has reviewed.  The Court need not, however, address the Government's suggestion that, in order to avoid confusion in this area, the Court should adopt a flat rule that no estoppel will ever lie against the Government under any circumstances.  A narrower ground of decision controls the type of suit presented in this case.  Pp.  496 U. S. 419-424.
(b) A claim for payment of money from the Public Treasury contrary to a statutory appropriation is prohibited by the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, Art. I,  9, cl. 7, which provides in effect that such money may be paid out only as authorized by a statute.  Thus, judicial use of the equitable doctrine of estoppel cannot grant respondent a 
Page 496 U. S. 415
 money remedy that Congress has not authorized.  Recognition of equitable estoppel could render the Appropriations Clause a nullity if agents of the Executive were able, by their unauthorized oral or written statements to citizens, to obligate the Treasury contrary to the wishes of Congress.  Where Congress wishes to recognize claims for estoppel, it knows how to do so, as it has done by statute in the past.  Pp.  496 U. S. 424-429.
(c) This decision is supported by the Court's estoppel precedents, which have never upheld an estoppel claim against the Government for the payment of money; by provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which authorize private suits against the Government based on its agents' torts, but exclude misrepresentation claims similar to Richmond's; and by Congress' historical and continuing practice of reserving to itself the power to address hardship claims arising from misinformation or erroneous advice given by Government officials.  Although Congress has made a general appropriation of funds to pay judgments against the Government under the FTCA and other statutory authorizations for suits against the Government, none of those provisions encompass, or authorize payment for, Richmond's claim.  A rule of estoppel would invite endless litigation over both real and imagined claims of misinformation, imposing an unpredictable and substantial drain on the public fisc, and might prompt the Government, in order to limit liability, to cut back and impose strict controls on the free and valuable information it now provides to the public.

Not wishing to exceed a statutory limit on earnings that would disqualify him from continuing to receive a disability annuity based on his years of civilian service with the Navy, respondent Richmond sought advice from Navy employee relations personnel and received erroneous oral and written information.  When Richmond's reliance on the information caused him to earn more than permitted by the relevant statute, petitioner, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), denied him six months of benefits.  The Merit Systems Protection Board denied his petition for review, rejecting his contention that the erroneous advice given him should estop OPM and bar its finding him ineligible for benefits under the statute.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the misinformation estopped the Government, and that the estoppel required payment of benefits despite the statutory provision to the contrary.
Held:  Payments of money from the Federal Treasury are limited to those authorized by statute, and erroneous advice given by a Government employee to a benefit claimant cannot estop the Government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law.  Pp.  496 U. S. 419-434.
(a) Although dicta in some recent cases -- e.g., Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308,  366 U. S. 314-315; INS v. Hibi, 414 U. S. 5,  414 U. S. 8 (per curiam) -- have suggested, contrary to the Court's long-recognized rule, that there might be situations in which employee misconduct could give rise to estoppel against the Government, the Court has reversed, often summarily, every lower court finding of estoppel it has reviewed.  The Court need not, however, address the Government's suggestion that, in order to avoid confusion in this area, the Court should adopt a flat rule that no estoppel will ever lie against the Government under any circumstances.  A narrower ground of decision controls the type of suit presented in this case.  Pp.  496 U. S. 419-424.
(b) A claim for payment of money from the Public Treasury contrary to a statutory appropriation is prohibited by the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, Art. I,  9, cl. 7, which provides in effect that such money may be paid out only as authorized by a statute.  Thus, judicial use of the equitable doctrine of estoppel cannot grant respondent a 
Page 496 U. S. 415
 money remedy that Congress has not authorized.  Recognition of equitable estoppel could render the Appropriations Clause a nullity if agents of the Executive were able, by their unauthorized oral or written statements to citizens, to obligate the Treasury contrary to the wishes of Congress.  Where Congress wishes to recognize claims for estoppel, it knows how to do so, as it has done by statute in the past.  Pp.  496 U. S. 424-429.
(c) This decision is supported by the Court's estoppel precedents, which have never upheld an estoppel claim against the Government for the payment of money; by provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which authorize private suits against the Government based on its agents' torts, but exclude misrepresentation claims similar to Richmond's; and by Congress' historical and continuing practice of reserving to itself the power to address hardship claims arising from misinformation or erroneous advice given by Government officials.  Although Congress has made a general appropriation of funds to pay judgments against the Government under the FTCA and other statutory authorizations for suits against the Government, none of those provisions encompass, or authorize payment for, Richmond's claim.  A rule of estoppel would invite endless litigation over both real and imagined claims of misinformation, imposing an unpredictable and substantial drain on the public fisc, and might prompt the Government, in order to limit liability, to cut back and impose strict controls on the free and valuable information it now provides to the public.  Pp.  496 U. S. 429-434.

496 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Respondent State Bar of California is an ""integrated bar"" -- i.e., an association of attorneys in which membership and dues are required as a condition of practicing law -- created under state law to regulate the State's legal profession.  In fulfilling its broad statutory mission to ""promote the improvement of the administration of justice,"" the Bar uses its membership dues for self-regulatory functions, such as formulating rules of professional conduct and disciplining members for misconduct.  It also uses dues to lobby the legislature and other governmental agencies, file amicus curiae, briefs in pending cases, hold an annual delegates conference for the debate of current issues and the approval of resolutions, and engage in educational programs.  Petitioners, State Bar members, brought suit in state court claiming that, through these latter activities, the Bar expends mandatory dues payments to advance political and ideological causes to which they do not subscribe, in violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.  They requested, inter alia, an injunction restraining the Bar from using mandatory dues or its name to advance political and ideological causes or beliefs.  The court granted summary judgment to the Bar on the grounds that it is a governmental agency, and therefore permitted under the First Amendment to engage in the challenged activities.  The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that, while the Bar's regulatory activities were similar to those of a government agency, its ""administration-of-justice"" functions were more akin to the activities of a labor union.  Relying on the analysis of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of 
Page 496 U. S. 2
 Education, 431 U. S. 209 -- which prohibits the agency-shop dues of dissenting nonunion employees from being used to support political and ideological union causes that are unrelated to collective bargaining activities -- the court held that the Bar's activities could be financed from mandatory dues only if a particular action served a state interest important enough to overcome the interference with dissenters' First Amendment rights.  The State Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that the Bar was a ""government agency"" that could use its dues for any purpose within the scope of its statutory authority, and that subjecting the Bar's activities to First Amendment scrutiny would place an ""extraordinary burden"" on its statutory mission.  With the exception of certain election campaigning, the court found that all of the challenged activities fell within the Bar's statutory authority.
Held:
1. The State Bar's use of petitioners' compulsory dues to finance political and ideological activities with which petitioners disagree violates their First Amendment right of free speech when such expenditures are not necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services.  Pp.  496 U. S. 9-17.
(a) The State Supreme Court's determination that the State Bar is a ""government agency"" for the purposes of state law is not binding on this Court when such a determination is essential to the decision of a federal question.  The State Bar is not a typical ""government agency.""  The Bar's principal funding comes from dues levied on its members, rather than from appropriations made by the legislature; its membership is composed solely of lawyers admitted to practice in the State, and its services by way of governance of the profession are essentially advisory in nature, since the ultimate responsibility of such governance is reserved by state law to the State Supreme Court.  By contrast, there is a substantial analogy between the relationship of the Bar and its members and that of unions and their members.  Just as it is appropriate that employees who receive the benefit of union negotiation with their employer pay their fair share of the cost of that process by paying agency-shop dues, it is entirely appropriate that lawyers who derive benefit from the status of being admitted to practice before the courts should be called upon to pay a fair share of the cost of the professional involvement in this effort.  The State Bar was created, not to participate in the general government of the State, but to provide specialized professional advice to those with the ultimate responsibility of governing the legal profession.  These differences between the State Bar and traditional government agencies render unavailing respondent's argument that it is not subject to the same constitutional rule with respect to the use of compulsory dues as are labor unions.  Pp.  496 U. S. 10-13. 
Page 496 U. S. 3

(b) Abood cannot be distinguished on the ground that the compelled association in the context of labor unions serves only a private economic interest in collective bargaining, while the Bar serves more substantial public interests.  In fact, the legislative recognition that the agency-shop arrangements serve vital national interests in preserving industrial peace indicates that they serve a substantial public interest as well.  It is not possible to determine that the Bar's interests outweigh these other interests sufficiently to produce a different result here.  P.  496 U. S. 13.
(c) The guiding standard for determining permissible Bar expenditures relating to political or ideological activities is whether the challenged expenditures are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of regulating the legal profession or improving the quality of legal services.  Precisely where the line falls between permissible and impermissible dues-financed activities will not always be easy to discern.  But the extreme ends of the spectrum are clear:  Compulsory dues may not be used to endorse or advance a gun control or nuclear weapons freeze initiative, but may be spent on activities connected with disciplining Bar members or proposing the profession's ethical codes.  Pp.  496 U. S. 13-16.
(d) Since the Bar is already required to submit detailed budgets to the state legislature before obtaining approval to set annual dues, the State Supreme Court's assumption that complying with Abood would create an extraordinary burden for the Bar is unpersuasive.  Any burden that might result is insufficient to justify contravention of a constitutional mandate, and unions have operated successfully within the boundaries of Abood procedures for over a decade.  An integrated bar could meet its Abood obligation by adopting the sort of procedures described in Teacher v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292.  Questions whether alternate procedures would also satisfy the obligation should be left for consideration upon a more fully developed record.  Pp.  496 U. S. 16-17.

Syllabus 
After Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, held that Hawaii's liquor excise tax scheme -- which allowed tax preferences for alcoholic beverages manufactured from certain products grown in the State -- violated the Commerce Clause because it had the purpose and effect of discriminating against interstate commerce, Florida revised its similar tax preference scheme to provide special rate reductions for specified products commonly grown in that State and used in alcoholic beverages produced there.  Petitioner McKesson Corporation, a wholesale liquor distributor whose products did not qualify for the rate reductions, paid the applicable taxes for a number of months.  McKesson then filed suit in state court against respondent taxing authorities, seeking, inter alia, a refund in the amount of the excess taxes it had paid as a result of its disfavored treatment.  The trial court invalidated the tax scheme under Bacchus Imports, enjoining future enforcement of the preferential rate reductions, but declined to order a refund or any other form of relief for taxes McKesson had already paid.  The court's order was stayed pending appeal, and the State continued to collect taxes with the local preferences still in effect.  The Florida Supreme Court ultimately affirmed in all respects, ruling that the refusal to order a refund was proper in light of ""equitable considerations.""
Held:
1. The Eleventh Amendment -- which provides in part that the federal ""[j]udicial power . . . shall not . . . extend to any suit . . . commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens"" -- does not preclude the Supreme Court's exercise of appellate jurisdiction over cases brought against States that arise from state courts.  This view has been implicit in the Court's consistent practice and uniformly endorsed in its cases, including cases involving state tax refund actions brought in state court, for almost 170 years.  See, e.g.,  19 U. S.  Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264,  19 U. S. 412; General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U. S. 211,  209 U. S. 233; Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803.  Pp.  496 U. S. 26-31.
2. If a State penalizes taxpayers for failure to remit their taxes in a timely fashion, thus requiring them to pay first and obtain review of the 
Page 496 U. S. 19
 tax's validity later in a refund action, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to afford them meaningful postpayment relief for taxes already paid pursuant to a tax scheme ultimately found unconstitutional.  Pp.  496 U. S. 31-52.
(a) This Court's precedents demonstrate the traditional legal analysis appropriate for determining Florida's constitutional duty to provide retrospective relief to McKesson for its payment of an unlawful tax.  Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280,  223 U. S. 285-286; Ward v. Love County Board of Comm'rs, 253 U. S. 17,  253 U. S. 24; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363,  280 U. S. 369; Montana National Bank of Billings v. Yellowstone County, 276 U. S. 499, 504,  276 U. S. 505; Iowa-Des Moines National Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S. 239,  284 U. S. 247.  Pp.  496 U. S. 32-36.
(b) Under these cases, a State must provide procedural safeguards against an unlawful tax exaction because such exaction constitutes a deprivation of property under the Due Process Clause.  A State may do so either by providing a form of predeprivation process -- e.g., by authorizing taxpayers to sue to enjoin imposition of the tax prior to its payment or to withhold payment and then interpose their objections as defenses in a state-initiated tax enforcement proceeding -- or by providing retrospective relief as part of its postdeprivation procedure.  Since Florida has established various financial sanctions and summary remedies to encourage liquor distributors to tender tax payments before resolution of any dispute over the tax's validity, the State does not provide a meaningful opportunity for predeprivation relief.  Thus, in a postdeprivation refund action, the State must provide distributors not only a fair opportunity to challenge the accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation but also a ""clear and certain remedy,"" O'Connor, supra, 223 U.S. at  223 U. S. 285, for any erroneous or unlawful tax collection.  Because the state courts did not invalidate Florida's liquor excise tax scheme in its entirety, but declared it unconstitutional only insofar as it discriminated against interstate commerce, the State is free to choose among several alternative courses in providing a meaningful remedy.  It may refund to McKesson the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it extended the same rate reductions as its competitors.  Cf. Montana National Bank, supra, and Bennett, supra.  The State may also, to the extent consistent with other constitutional restrictions, assess and collect back taxes from McKesson's competitors who benefited from the rate reductions during the contested tax period, calibrating the retroactive assessment to create in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.  Cf. id., 284 U.S. at  284 U. S. 247.  Furthermore, the State may implement a combination of a partial refund to McKesson and a partial retroactive assessment of tax increases on favored competitors, so long as the resultant tax actually assessed during the contested period reflects a 
Page 496 U. S. 20
 nondiscriminatory scheme.  However, the State may not, as respondents contend, deny McKesson retrospective relief on the theory that the highest tax rate would have been imposed on all distributors had the State known that the tax scheme actually enacted would be declared unconstitutional, such that McKesson would have paid the same tax in any event.  Since this approach in fact treats McKesson worse than distributors of the favored local products, it is inconsistent with the requirement of due process:  to place McKesson in a position equivalent to that actually occupied by the competitors so as to render valid the tax actually assessed.  If, through the State's own choice of relief, McKesson ends up paying a smaller tax than it would have paid had the State initially imposed the highest rate on everyone, McKesson will not enjoy any unpalatable ""windfall,"" but will merely be protected from the competitive economic disadvantage proscribed by the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  496 U. S. 36-43.
(c) Neither of the ""equitable considerations"" cited by the State Supreme Court is sufficient to override the constitutional requirement of retrospective relief.  First, the court's observation that ""the tax preference scheme [was] implemented . . . in good faith reliance on a presumptively valid statute"" bespeaks a concern that an obligation to provide refunds for taxes collected pursuant to what later turns out to be an unconstitutional tax scheme would undermine the State's ability to engage in sound fiscal planning.  But that ability is adequately secured by the State's freedom to impose various procedural requirements designed to allow it to predict with greater accuracy the availability of undisputed treasury funds; for example, it may specify by statute that refunds will be available only to those taxpayers paying under protest or providing some other timely notice of complaint, or it may refrain from collecting taxes pursuant to a scheme declared invalid by a competent tribunal pending further review.  Florida's failure to avail itself of such methods of self-protection weakens any ""equitable"" justification for avoiding its constitutional obligation.  Moreover, Florida's tax scheme could hardly be said to be a ""presumptively valid statute,"" since it reflected only cosmetic changes from the prior tax scheme that itself was virtually identical to the one struck down in Bacchus Imports.  Second, the state court's speculation that a refund would result in a ""windfall"" for McKesson, which has ""likely passed on"" the cost of the tax to its customers, is rejected in the context of this case.  The tax injured McKesson not only because it left it poorer in an absolute sense than before (a problem that might be rectified to the extent the economic incidence of the tax was passed on to others), but also because it increased the price of McKesson's products as compared to the preferred local products, such that McKesson most likely lost sales to the favored distributors or else incurred other costs (e.g., for advertising) in an effort to maintain its market 
Page 496 U. S. 21
 share.  The State cannot persuasively claim that ""equity"" entitles it to retain tax moneys taken unlawfully from McKesson due to its pass-on of the tax where the pass-on itself furthers the very competitive disadvantage constituting the Commerce Clause violation that rendered the deprivation unlawful in the first place.  United States v. Jefferson Electric Mfg. Co., 291 U. S. 386,  291 U. S. 402, distinguished.  Pp.  496 U. S. 44-49.
(d) The State's interests in avoiding serious economic and administrative dislocation and additional administrative costs may play a role in choosing the form of and fine-tuning the relief to be provided McKesson, though Florida's interest in financial stability does not justify a refusal to provide relief.  Pp.  496 U. S. 49-51.

Because the state courts did not invalidate Florida's liquor excise tax scheme in its entirety, but declared it unconstitutional only insofar as it discriminated against interstate commerce, the State is free to choose among several alternative courses in providing a meaningful remedy.  It may refund to McKesson the difference between the tax it paid and the tax it would have been assessed were it extended the same rate reductions as its competitors.  Cf. Montana National Bank, supra, and Bennett, supra.  The State may also, to the extent consistent with other constitutional restrictions, assess and collect back taxes from McKesson's competitors who benefited from the rate reductions during the contested tax period, calibrating the retroactive assessment to create in hindsight a nondiscriminatory scheme.  Cf. id., 284 U.S. at  284 U. S. 247.  Furthermore, the State may implement a combination of a partial refund to McKesson and a partial retroactive assessment of tax increases on favored competitors, so long as the resultant tax actually assessed during the contested period reflects a 
Page 496 U. S. 20
 nondiscriminatory scheme.  However, the State may not, as respondents contend, deny McKesson retrospective relief on the theory that the highest tax rate would have been imposed on all distributors had the State known that the tax scheme actually enacted would be declared unconstitutional, such that McKesson would have paid the same tax in any event.  Since this approach in fact treats McKesson worse than distributors of the favored local products, it is inconsistent with the requirement of due process:  to place McKesson in a position equivalent to that actually occupied by the competitors so as to render valid the tax actually assessed.  If, through the State's own choice of relief, McKesson ends up paying a smaller tax than it would have paid had the State initially imposed the highest rate on everyone, McKesson will not enjoy any unpalatable ""windfall,"" but will merely be protected from the competitive economic disadvantage proscribed by the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  496 U. S. 36-43.
(c) Neither of the ""equitable considerations"" cited by the State Supreme Court is sufficient to override the constitutional requirement of retrospective relief.  First, the court's observation that ""the tax preference scheme [was] implemented . . . in good faith reliance on a presumptively valid statute"" bespeaks a concern that an obligation to provide refunds for taxes collected pursuant to what later turns out to be an unconstitutional tax scheme would undermine the State's ability to engage in sound fiscal planning.  But that ability is adequately secured by the State's freedom to impose various procedural requirements designed to allow it to predict with greater accuracy the availability of undisputed treasury funds; for example, it may specify by statute that refunds will be available only to those taxpayers paying under protest or providing some other timely notice of complaint, or it may refrain from collecting taxes pursuant to a scheme declared invalid by a competent tribunal pending further review.  Florida's failure to avail itself of such methods of self-protection weakens any ""equitable"" justification for avoiding its constitutional obligation.  Moreover, Florida's tax scheme could hardly be said to be a ""presumptively valid statute,"" since it reflected only cosmetic changes from the prior tax scheme that itself was virtually identical to the one struck down in Bacchus Imports.  Second, the state court's speculation that a refund would result in a ""windfall"" for McKesson, which has ""likely passed on"" the cost of the tax to its customers, is rejected in the context of this case.  The tax injured McKesson not only because it left it poorer in an absolute sense than before (a problem that might be rectified to the extent the economic incidence of the tax was passed on to others), but also because it increased the price of McKesson's products as compared to the preferred local products, such that McKesson most likely lost sales to the favored distributors or else incurred other costs (e.g., for advertising) in an effort to maintain its market 
Page 496 U. S. 21
 share.  The State cannot persuasively claim that ""equity"" entitles it to retain tax moneys taken unlawfully from McKesson due to its pass-on of the tax where the pass-on itself furthers the very competitive disadvantage constituting the Commerce Clause violation that rendered the deprivation unlawful in the first place.  United States v. Jefferson Electric Mfg. Co., 291 U. S. 386,  291 U. S. 402, distinguished.  Pp.  496 U. S. 44-49.
(d) The State's interests in avoiding serious economic and administrative dislocation and additional administrative costs may play a role in choosing the form of and fine-tuning the relief to be provided McKesson, though Florida's interest in financial stability does not justify a refusal to provide relief.  Pp.  496 U. S. 49-51.

No. 89-393
Argued March 27, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 53

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code directs ""every person receiving any payment for facilities or services"" subject to excise taxes to ""collect the amount of the tax from the person making such payment.""  26 U.S.C.  4291.  It also requires an employer to ""collect"" Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes from its employees ""by deducting the amount of the tax from the wages as and when paid,""  3102(a), and to ""deduct and withhold upon such wages [the employee's federal income tax],""  3402(a)(1).  The amount of taxes ""collected or withheld"" is ""held to be in a special fund in trust for the United States.""   7501.  Thus, these taxes are often called ""trust-fund taxes.""  After American International Airlines, Inc., fell behind in its trust-fund tax payments, the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to  7512, ordered it to deposit all future taxes collected into a separate bank account.  AIA established the account, but did not deposit funds sufficient to cover the entire amount of its obligations.  Nonetheless, it remained current on the obligations, paying part of them from the separate bank account and part from its general operating funds.  In a subsequent liquidation proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, petitioner Begier was appointed AIA's trustee.  Seeking to exercise his power under  547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code -- which permits a trustee to avoid certain preferential payments made before the debtor files for bankruptcy -- Begier filed an adversary action against the Government to recover the entire amount that AIA had paid the IRS for trust-fund taxes during the 90 days before the bankruptcy filing.  The Bankruptcy Court refused to permit Begier to recover any of the money AIA had paid out of the separate account on the ground that AIA had held that money in trust for the IRS.  However, it allowed him to avoid most of the payments made out of AIA's general accounts, holding that such funds were property of the debtor.  The District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that any pre-petition payment of trust-fund taxes is a payment of funds that are not the debtor's property, and that such a payment is therefore not an avoidable preference. 
Page 496 U. S. 54

Held:  AIA's trust-fund tax payments from its general accounts were transfers of property held in trust, and therefore cannot be avoided as preferences.  Pp.  496 U. S. 58-67.
(a) Equality of distribution among creditors is a central policy of the Bankruptcy Code that is furthered by  547(b) to the extent that it permits a trustee to avoid pre-petition preferential transfers of ""property of the debtor.""  Although not defined by the Code, ""property of the debtor"" is best understood to mean property that would have been part of the estate had it not been transferred.  Its meaning is coextensive with its post-petition analog ""property of the estate,"" which includes all of the debtor's legal or equitable interests in property as of the commencement of the case.   541(a)(1). Since a debtor does not own an equitable interest in property he holds in trust for another, that interest is not ""property of the estate"" and, likewise, not ""property of the debtor.""  Pp.  496 U. S. 58-59.
(b) AIA created a trust within the meaning of 26 U.S.C.  7501 at the moment the money was withheld or collected.  The statutory trust extends to the amount of tax ""collected or withheld,"" and the language of  4291, 3102(a), and 3402(a)(1) makes clear that the acts of collecting and withholding occur at the time of payment --  the recipient's payment for the service in the case of excise taxes and the employer's payment of wages in the case of FICA and income taxes.  The fact that AIA neither put the taxes in a segregated fund nor paid them to the IRS does not somehow mean that AIA never collected or withheld them in the first place.  Mandating segregation as a prerequisite to the creation of a trust under  7501 would make  7512's requirement that funds may be segregated in special and limited circumstances superfluous and, would mean that an employer could avoid the creation of a trust simply by refusing to segregate.  Pp.  496 U. S. 60-62.
(c) The funds transferred from AIA's general accounts were trust assets.  Neither  7501 nor common law rules for tracing trust res offer guidance on how to determine whether the assets were trust property.  And the strict rule of United States v. Randall, 401 U. S. 513 -- which prohibited the IRS from recovering withheld taxes ahead of the bankruptcy proceeding's administrative expenses -- did not survive the 1978 restructuring of the Bankruptcy Code.  The 1978 Code's legislative history shows that Congress intended that the courts permit the use of ""reasonable assumptions"" under which the IRS could demonstrate that amounts of withheld taxes were still in the debtor's possession at the time the petition was filed.  Thus, Congress expected that the IRS would have to show some connection between the trust and the assets sought to be applied to a debtor's trust fund obligations.  While the Bankruptcy Code does not demonstrate how extensive this nexus must 
Page 496 U. S. 55
 be, the legislative history identifies one reasonable assumption:  that any voluntary pre-petition payment of trust fund taxes out of the debtor's assets is not a transfer of the debtor's property.  Other rules might be reasonable, but the only evidence presented suggests that Congress preferred this one.  Pp.  496 U. S. 62-67.

No. 89-152
Argued April 25, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 72

Syllabus 
Petitioner English, a laboratory technician at a nuclear facility operated by respondent General Electric Company (GE), complained to GE's management and to the Federal Government about several perceived violations of nuclear safety standards at the facility, including the failure of her coworkers to clean up radioactive spills in the laboratory.  Frustrated by GE's failure to address her concerns, English on one occasion deliberately failed to clean a work table contaminated with uranium during an earlier shift.  Instead, she outlined the contaminated areas with red tape to make them conspicuous and, a few days later, called her supervisor's attention to the fact that the marked-off areas still had not been cleaned.  Shortly after work was halted for inspection and cleaning of the laboratory, GE charged English with a knowing failure to clean up radioactive contamination, temporarily assigned her to other work, and ultimately discharged her.  She then filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, alleging that GE's actions violated  210(a) of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which makes it unlawful for a nuclear industry employer to retaliate against an employee for reporting safety violations.  Although an administrative law judge (ALJ) found a  210(a) violation, the Secretary dismissed the complaint as untimely under the 30-day limitations period provided by  210(b)(1).  Subsequently, English filed a diversity action seeking compensatory and punitive damages from GE in the District Court, raising, inter alia, a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  While rejecting GE's argument that the latter claim fell within a field -- nuclear safety -- that had been completely preempted by the Federal Government, the court nevertheless dismissed the claim on the ground that it conflicted with three particular aspects of  210 and was therefore preempted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  English's state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is not preempted by federal law.  Pp.  496 U. S. 78-90.
(a) The claim is not barred on a field preemption theory.  After reviewing the relevant statutory provisions and legislative history, the Court in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, concluded that ""the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,"" 
Page 496 U. S. 73
 id. at  461 U. S. 212, and expressed the view that Congress intended that only the ""Government should regulate the radiological safety aspects involved in the construction and operation of a nuclear plant,"" id. at  461 U. S. 205.  English's action, however, does not fall within the boundaries of the preempted field as so defined, since the state tort law at issue is not motivated by safety concerns, see id. at  461 U. S. 213, and since the claim's actual effect on the nuclear safety decisions made by those who build and run nuclear facilities is not sufficiently direct and substantial, cf. Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238.  It is thus not surprising that there is no evidence of the necessary ""clear and manifest"" intent by Congress to preempt such claims.  Pp.  496 U. S. 80-86.
(b) English's claim does not conflict with particular aspects of  210.  First, neither the text nor the legislative history of  210(g) -- which provides that ""Subsection (a) of this section [the prohibition on employer retaliation] shall not apply"" where an employee ""deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of this Act or the Atomic Energy Act"" -- reflects a congressional desire to preclude all relief, including state remedies, to a whistleblower who deliberately commits a safety violation.  Even if that were Congress' intent, the federal interest would be served by preempting recovery by violators of safety standards.  Here, the ALJ found that English did not deliberately commit a violation.  Second, absent some specific suggestion in the text or legislative history, the failure of  210 to provide general authorization for the Secretary to award punitive damages for  210(a) violations does not imply a congressional intent to bar a state action, like English's, that permits such an award.  Third, the expeditious timeframes provided for the processing of  210 claims do not reflect a congressional decision that, in order to encourage the reporting of safety violations and retaliatory behavior, no whistleblower should be able to recover under any other law after the time for filing under  210 has expired.  Since many retaliatory incidents are a response to safety complaints made to the Federal Government, the Government is already aware of these safety violations even if employees do not invoke  210's remedial provisions.  Moreover, the suggestion that employees will forgo their  210 options and rely solely on state remedies is simply too speculative a basis on which to rest a preemption finding.   496 U. S.  87-90.

No. 88-1775
Argued Jan. 17, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
Petitioner Peel is licensed to practice law in Illinois and other States.  He also has a ""Certificate in Civil Trial Advocacy"" from the National Board of Trial Advocacy (NBTA), which offers periodic certification to applicants who meet exacting standards of experience and competence in trial work.  The Administrator of respondent Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois filed a complaint alleging that Peel, by using professional letterhead that stated his name, followed by the indented notation ""Certified Civil Trial Specialist By the [NBTA]"" and the unindented notation ""Licensed: Illinois, Missouri, Arizona,"" was, inter alia, holding himself out as a certified legal specialist in violation of Rule 2-105(a)(3) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility.  The Commission recommended censure.  The State Supreme Court adopted the Commission's recommendation, concluding that the First Amendment did not protect the letterhead because the public could confuse the State and NBTA as the sources of his license to practice and of his certification, and because the certification could be read as a claim of superior quality.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
126 Ill.2d 397, 128 Ill.Dec. 535, 534 N.E.2d 980 (1989), reversed and remanded.
Justice STEVENS, joined by Justice BRENNAN, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that a lawyer has a constitutional right, under the standards applicable to commercial speech, to advertise his or her certification as a trial specialist by NBTA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 99-111.
(a) Truthful advertising related to lawful activities is entitled to First Amendment protections.  Although a State may prohibit misleading advertising entirely, it may not place an absolute prohibition on potentially misleading information if the information may also be presented in a way that is not deceptive.  In re R.M.J., 455 U. S. 191.  Pp.  496 U. S. 99-100.
(b) Peel's letterhead is not actually or inherently misleading.  The facts stated on his letterhead are true and verifiable, and there has been no finding of actual deception or misunderstanding.  The state court's focus on the implied ""claim"" as to the ""quality"" of Peel's legal services confuses the distinction between statements of opinion or quality and statements of objective facts that may support an inference of quality.  Even if NBTA standards are not well known, there is no evidence that 
Page 496 U. S. 92
 consumers, such as those in States with certification plans, are misled if they do not inform themselves of the precise standards of certification.  There also has been no finding, and there is no basis for the belief, that Peel's representation generally would be associated with governmental action.  The public understands that licenses are issued by governmental authorities and that many certificates are issued by private organizations, and it is unlikely that the public necessarily would confuse certification as a ""specialist"" by a national organization with formal state recognition.  Moreover, other States that have evaluated lawyers' advertisements of NBTA certifications have concluded that they were not misleading and were protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.  496 U. S. 101-106.
(c) The State's interest in avoiding any potential that Peel's statements might mislead is insufficient to justify a categorical ban on their use; nor does the State Supreme Court's inherent authority to supervise its own bar insulate its judgment from this Court's review for constitutional infirmity.  The need for a complete prophylactic rule against any claim of certification or specialty is undermined by the fact that the same risk of deception is posed by specified designations -- for ""Registered Patent Attorney"" and ""Proctor in Admiralty"" -- that are permitted under Rule 2-105(a).  Such information facilitates the consumer's access to legal services and better serves the administration of justice.  To the extent that such statements could confuse consumers, the State might consider screening certifying organizations or requiring a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of a specialty.

			"|"Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois
No. 88-1775
Argued Jan. 17, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
Petitioner Peel is licensed to practice law in Illinois and other States.  He also has a ""Certificate in Civil Trial Advocacy"" from the National Board of Trial Advocacy (NBTA), which offers periodic certification to applicants who meet exacting standards of experience and competence in trial work.  The Administrator of respondent Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of Illinois filed a complaint alleging that Peel, by using professional letterhead that stated his name, followed by the indented notation ""Certified Civil Trial Specialist By the [NBTA]"" and the unindented notation ""Licensed: Illinois, Missouri, Arizona,"" was, inter alia, holding himself out as a certified legal specialist in violation of Rule 2-105(a)(3) of the Illinois Code of Professional Responsibility.  The Commission recommended censure.  The State Supreme Court adopted the Commission's recommendation, concluding that the First Amendment did not protect the letterhead because the public could confuse the State and NBTA as the sources of his license to practice and of his certification, and because the certification could be read as a claim of superior quality.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
126 Ill.2d 397, 128 Ill.Dec. 535, 534 N.E.2d 980 (1989), reversed and remanded.
Justice STEVENS, joined by Justice BRENNAN, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that a lawyer has a constitutional right, under the standards applicable to commercial speech, to advertise his or her certification as a trial specialist by NBTA.  Pp.  496 U. S. 99-111.
(a) Truthful advertising related to lawful activities is entitled to First Amendment protections.  Although a State may prohibit misleading advertising entirely, it may not place an absolute prohibition on potentially misleading information if the information may also be presented in a way that is not deceptive.  In re R.M.J., 455 U. S. 191.  Pp.  496 U. S. 99-100.
(b) Peel's letterhead is not actually or inherently misleading.  The facts stated on his letterhead are true and verifiable, and there has been no finding of actual deception or misunderstanding.  The state court's focus on the implied ""claim"" as to the ""quality"" of Peel's legal services confuses the distinction between statements of opinion or quality and statements of objective facts that may support an inference of quality.  Even if NBTA standards are not well known, there is no evidence that 
Page 496 U. S. 92
 consumers, such as those in States with certification plans, are misled if they do not inform themselves of the precise standards of certification.  There also has been no finding, and there is no basis for the belief, that Peel's representation generally would be associated with governmental action.  The public understands that licenses are issued by governmental authorities and that many certificates are issued by private organizations, and it is unlikely that the public necessarily would confuse certification as a ""specialist"" by a national organization with formal state recognition.  Moreover, other States that have evaluated lawyers' advertisements of NBTA certifications have concluded that they were not misleading and were protected by the First Amendment.  Pp.  496 U. S. 101-106.
(c) The State's interest in avoiding any potential that Peel's statements might mislead is insufficient to justify a categorical ban on their use; nor does the State Supreme Court's inherent authority to supervise its own bar insulate its judgment from this Court's review for constitutional infirmity.  The need for a complete prophylactic rule against any claim of certification or specialty is undermined by the fact that the same risk of deception is posed by specified designations -- for ""Registered Patent Attorney"" and ""Proctor in Admiralty"" -- that are permitted under Rule 2-105(a).  Such information facilitates the consumer's access to legal services and better serves the administration of justice.  To the extent that such statements could confuse consumers, the State might consider screening certifying organizations or requiring a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of a specialty.  Pp.  496 U. S. 106-111.
Justice MARSHALL, joined by Justice BRENNAN, agreeing that the State may not prohibit Peel from holding himself out as a certified NBTA trial specialist because the letterhead is neither actually nor inherently misleading, concluded that the letterhead is potentially misleading and thus the State may enact regulations other than a total ban to ensure that the public is not misled by such representations.

No. 88-7164
Argued Feb. 21, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 128

Syllabus 
A California policeman determined that there was probable cause to search petitioner Horton's home for the proceeds of a robbery and the robbers' weapons.  His search warrant affidavit referred to police reports that described both the weapons and the proceeds, but the warrant issued by the Magistrate only authorized a search for the proceeds.  Upon executing the warrant, the officer did not find the stolen property, but did find the weapons in plain view and seized them.  The trial court refused to suppress the seized evidence, and Horton was convicted of armed robbery.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  Since the officer had testified that, while he was searching Horton's home for the stolen property, he was also interested in finding other evidence connecting Horton to the robbery, the seized evidence was not discovered ""inadvertently.""  However, in rejecting Horton's argument that Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, therefore required suppression of that evidence, the Court of Appeal relied on a State Supreme Court decision holding that Coolidge's discussion of the inadvertence limitation on the ""plain view"" doctrine was not binding because it was contained in a four-Justice plurality opinion.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless seizure of evidence in plain view, even though the discovery of the evidence was not inadvertent.  Although inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate plain view seizures, it is not a necessary condition.  Pp.  496 U. S. 133-142.
(a) Coolidge is a binding precedent.  However, the second of the Coolidge plurality's two limitations on the plain view doctrine -- that the discovery of evidence in plain view must be inadvertent, id. at  403 U. S. 469 -- was not essential to the Court's rejection of the State's plain view argument in that case.  Rather, the first limitation -- that plain view alone is never enough to justify a warrantless seizure, id. at  403 U. S. 468 -- adequately supports the Court's holding that gunpowder found in vacuum sweepings from one of the automobiles seized in plain view on the defendant's driveway in the course of his arrest could not be introduced against him because the warrantless seizures violated the Fourth Amendment.  In order for a warrantless seizure of an object in plain view to be valid, two conditions must be satisfied in addition to the essential predicate that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which 
Page 496 U. S. 129
 the object could be plainly viewed.  First, the object's incriminating character must be ""immediately apparent,"" id. at 466.  Although the cars in Coolidge were obviously in plain view, their probative value remained uncertain until after their interiors were swept and examined microscopically.  Second, the officer must have a lawful right of access to the object itself.  Justice Harlan, who concurred in the Coolidge judgment but did not join the plurality's plain view discussion, may well have rested his vote on the fact that the cars' seizure was accomplished by means of a warrantless trespass on the defendant's property.  Pp.  496 U. S. 133-137.
(b) There are two flaws in the Coolidge plurality's conclusion that the inadvertence requirement was necessary to avoid a violation of the Fourth Amendment's mandate that a valid warrant ""particularly describ[e] . . . [the] . . . things to be seized,'"" id. at  403 U. S. 469-471.  First, even-handed law enforcement is best achieved by applying objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend upon the officer's subjective state of mind.  The fact that an officer is interested in an item and fully expects to find it should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area and duration by a warrant's terms or by a valid exception to the warrant requirement.  Second, the suggestion that the inadvertence requirement is necessary to prevent the police from conducting general searches, or from converting specific warrants into general warrants, is not persuasive, because that interest is already served by the requirements that an unparticularized warrant not be issued and that a warrantless search be circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation.  Here, the search's scope was not enlarged by the warrant's omission of reference to the weapons; indeed, no search for the weapons could have taken place if the named items had been found or surrendered at the outset.  The prohibition against general searches and warrants is based on privacy concerns, which are not implicated when an officer with a lawful right of access to an item in plain view seizes it without a warrant.

Syllabus 
The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) directs a court to award fees and other expenses to private parties who prevail in litigation against the United States if, inter alia, the Government's position was not ""substantially justified.""  28 U.S.C.  2412(d)(1)(A).  The District Court found that respondents were prevailing parties within the meaning of the EAJA, the Government's position was not substantially justified, and there were no other special circumstances that would make a fee award unjust.  The Court of Appeals upheld these findings, but remanded for recalculation of fees.  Although the Government concedes that fees for time and expenses incurred in applying for fees are appropriate, it contends that respondents are ineligible for fees for services rendered during the substantial litigation over the fees unless the Court finds that the Government's position in the fee litigation itself was not substantially justified.
Held:  A second ""substantial justification"" finding is not required before EAJA fees are awarded for fee litigation itself.  Pp.  496 U. S. 158-166.
(a) The EAJA's ""substantial justification"" requirement is a single finding that operates as a clear threshold for determining a prevailing party's fee eligibility.  Once a litigant has met all of the eligibility conditions for fees, the district court has the discretion to adjust the amount of fees for various portions of the litigation, guided by reason and the statutory criteria.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424.  There is no textual support for the position that the Government may assert a ""substantial justification"" defense at multiple stages of an action, since the EAJA refers only to a single ""position,""  2412(d)(1)(A) and (d)(2)(D), that the Government has taken in the past,  2412(d)(1)(B), in ""any civil action,""  2412(d)(1)(A).  Pp.  496 U. S. 158-162.
(b) The Government's argument that automatic awards of ""fees for fees"" will encourage exorbitant fee requests, generate needless litigation, and unreasonably burden the federal fisc is rejected.  First, no fee award is automatic, since a district court always has discretion to fix the amount of the award once eligibility is established.  In contrast, requiring courts to make a separate ""substantial justification"" finding regarding the Government's opposition to fee requests would multiply litigation.  Second, the EAJA's purpose to eliminate the average person's financial

Syllabus 
In 1983, petitioners brought suit in an Arkansas Chancery Court, alleging that the flat tax portion of that State's Highway Use Equalization (HUE) tax discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause by imposing on out-of-state truckers greater per-mile costs than those imposed on in-state truckers, who are likely to drive many more miles on the State's highways.  Petitioners sought a refund of all HUE taxes paid.  In affirming the Chancery Court's ruling that the tax was constitutional, the State Supreme Court relied on this Court's decisions upholding flat taxes in Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice, 339 U. S. 542, Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Board of Railroad Comm'rs of Montana, 332 U. S. 495, and Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm'n, 295 U. S. 285, and explicitly rejected petitioners' argument that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, overruled the Aero Mayflower line of cases.  On June 23, 1987, this Court ruled, in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, that unapportioned flat highway use taxes penalize travel within a free trade area among the States in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Subsequently, this Court vacated the Arkansas Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Scheiner.  After that court denied petitioners' motion seeking, inter alia, an order to escrow the HUE taxes to be collected pending a final decision on the merits, Justice BLACKMUN, as Circuit Justice, ordered such an escrow on August 14, 1987.  The State Supreme Court then reconsidered the HUE tax in light of Scheiner and ruled it unconstitutional.  However, the court declined to order refunds for taxes paid before the August escrow order, holding that, under the test enunciated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97,  404 U. S. 106-107, Scheiner should not be applied retroactively.  The court nevertheless determined that the tax money paid into escrow after the August order should be refunded.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.
295 Ark. 43, 746 S.W.2d 377, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. 
Page 496 U. S. 168

Justice O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the Arkansas Supreme Court misapplied Chevron Oil in certain respects and, therefore, Scheiner applies to some taxation of highway use pursuant to the HUE tax.  Thus, the case must be remanded to that court to determine appropriate relief in light of McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Dept. of Business Regulations of Fla., ante, p.  496 U. S. 18.  Pp.  496 U. S. 176-200.
(a) Whether the State Supreme Court applied Chevron Oil correctly is a federal question.  However, it is important to distinguish that question from the distinct remedial question at issue in McKesson, ante.  While the relief provided by the State from a tax statute held invalid under the Commerce Clause must be in accord with federal due process principles, see ante  at  496 U. S. 36-43,  496 U. S. 51-52, federal-state comity dictates that state courts have the initial duty of determining appropriate relief.  Pp.  496 U. S. 176-179.
(b) Under Chevron Oil's three-factor nonretroactivity test, Scheiner does not apply to taxation of highway use prior to the date it was decided, June 23, 1987, for the HUE tax year ending June 30, 1987.  First, Scheiner clearly established a new principle of law by expressly overruling those aspects of the Aero Mayflower line of cases on which Arkansas relied in enacting and assessing the HUE tax.  In its original decision upholding the tax, the State Supreme Court correctly followed the Aero Mayflower cases rather than Complete Auto Transit, since the latter case only questioned the Aero Mayflower line, and this Court cited that line with approval in a decision subsequent to Complete Auto Transit, Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444,  435 U. S. 463-464.  Second, the purpose of the Commerce Clause does not dictate retroactive application of Scheiner, since such application would not tend to deter future free trade violations by the States.  The HUE tax when enacted was entirely consistent with the Aero Mayflower cases, and it is not the Clause's purpose to prevent legitimate state taxation of interstate commerce.  Third, applying Scheiner retroactively would produce substantial inequitable results.  Especially in light of McKesson's holding that a ruling that a tax is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause places substantial obligations on the States to provide relief, invalidating the HUE tax has the potential for severely burdening the State's current operations and future plans.  A refund, if required, could deplete the state treasury and entail potentially significant administrative costs, while retroactively increasing taxes on the favored taxpayers would also entail such administrative costs, and could at some point run afoul of the Due Process Clause under McKesson, ante, at  496 U. S. 40-41, n. 23.  Where a State can easily foresee the invalidation of its tax statutes, the burden on state operations may merit little concern.  See McKesson, 
Page 496 U. S. 169
 ante, at  496 U. S. 44-46,  496 U. S. 50.  It is unjust, however, to impose this burden when the State relied on valid existing precedent in enacting and implementing its tax.  Pp.  496 U. S. 179-186.
(c) However, the conclusion that Scheiner applies only prospectively does not protect those HUE taxes paid to the State for the tax year beginning July 1, 1987.  The State Supreme Court's refusal to order refunds for any 1987-1988 HUE taxes paid prior to Justice BLACKMUN's escrow order arose from a misapprehension of the force of Chevron Oil. Scheiner applies prospectively to the flat taxing of highway use after the date of that decision, regardless of when the taxes for such use were actually collected.  Holding otherwise would result in similarly situated taxpayers receiving different remedies depending solely and fortuitously on the date they paid the tax.  Pp.  496 U. S. 186-188.
(d) The dissent's criticisms of this decision lack merit.  First, the claim that this decision is unjust because it treats the taxpayers in this case differently from those in Scheiner is unpersuasive, since this case resolves a retroactivity question not considered in Scheiner, which was concerned only with a state court's ruling on the constitutionality of certain tax statutes and remanded for a determination of retroactivity and remedial issues.  Second, the claim that this Court has consistently applied new decisions retroactively to civil cases which are pending on direct review is an inaccurate characterization, since a review of the Court's decisions shows that it has consistently applied the principles underlying the retroactivity doctrine enunciated in Chevron Oil rather than the approach suggested by the dissent.  See, e.g., Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701.  Third, contrary to the dissent's assertion, this Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles, but has instead considered nonretroactivity to be a doctrine for determining when past precedent should be applied to a case before the Court.  As such, it is better understood as part of the doctrine of stare decisis, rather than part of the law of remedies.  See, e.g., Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358,  287 U. S. 364.  Finally, the reasons for adopting a per se rule of retroactivity in criminal cases, see Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 -- primarily, to provide expanded procedural protections to criminal defendants -- are not applicable in the civil sphere, where nonretroactivity functions to avoid injustice or hardship to civil litigants who have justifiably relied on prior law, see, e.g., Chevron Oil, supra, 404 U.S. at  404 U. S. 107.  These distinctions compel the rejection of the dissent's invitation to abandon the nonretroactivity doctrine in the civil arena as the Court did in the criminal arena.  Pp.  496 U. S. 188-120.
Justice SCALIA concluded that prospective decisionmaking by the Court cannot be reconciled with the scope of the judicial power under

 Article III.  Nonetheless, because this Court's so-called ""negative"" Commerce Clause jurisprudence has no basis in the text of the Commerce Clause, see, e.g., American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266,  483 U. S. 303-306 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and because Scheiner was therefore wrongly decided, the only reason to apply Scheiner is the doctrine of stare decisis.  The purpose underlying that doctrine, which is to protect settled expectations, justifies holding that Arkansas violated the Constitution in imposing its HUE tax after Scheiner was announced, but does not justify holding that Arkansas violated the Constitution in imposing its HUE tax before Scheiner overruled our earlier cases on which Arkansas presumably relied.  To apply Scheiner retroactively, solely in the name of stare decisis, would turn the purpose of stare decisis against itself.  Accordingly, the decision below should be affirmed with respect to the pre-Scheiner taxes, and reversed with respect to the post-Scheiner taxes.  Pp.  496 U. S. 200-205.

No. 88-325
Argued March 22, 1989
Reargued Dec. 6, 1989
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 167

Syllabus 
In 1983, petitioners brought suit in an Arkansas Chancery Court, alleging that the flat tax portion of that State's Highway Use Equalization (HUE) tax discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause by imposing on out-of-state truckers greater per-mile costs than those imposed on in-state truckers, who are likely to drive many more miles on the State's highways.  Petitioners sought a refund of all HUE taxes paid.  In affirming the Chancery Court's ruling that the tax was constitutional, the State Supreme Court relied on this Court's decisions upholding flat taxes in Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice, 339 U. S. 542, Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Board of Railroad Comm'rs of Montana, 332 U. S. 495, and Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Comm'n, 295 U. S. 285, and explicitly rejected petitioners' argument that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, overruled the Aero Mayflower line of cases.  On June 23, 1987, this Court ruled, in American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, that unapportioned flat highway use taxes penalize travel within a free trade area among the States in violation of the Commerce Clause.  Subsequently, this Court vacated the Arkansas Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Scheiner.  After that court denied petitioners' motion seeking, inter alia, an order to escrow the HUE taxes to be collected pending a final decision on the merits, Justice BLACKMUN, as Circuit Justice, ordered such an escrow on August 14, 1987.  The State Supreme Court then reconsidered the HUE tax in light of Scheiner and ruled it unconstitutional.  However, the court declined to order refunds for taxes paid before the August escrow order, holding that, under the test enunciated in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97,  404 U. S. 106-107, Scheiner should not be applied retroactively.  The court nevertheless determined that the tax money paid into escrow after the August order should be refunded.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.
295 Ark. 43, 746 S.W.2d 377, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. 
Page 496 U. S. 168

Justice O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the Arkansas Supreme Court misapplied Chevron Oil in certain respects and, therefore, Scheiner applies to some taxation of highway use pursuant to the HUE tax.  Thus, the case must be remanded to that court to determine appropriate relief in light of McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Dept. of Business Regulations of Fla., ante, p.  496 U. S. 18.  Pp.  496 U. S. 176-200.
(a) Whether the State Supreme Court applied Chevron Oil correctly is a federal question.  However, it is important to distinguish that question from the distinct remedial question at issue in McKesson, ante.  While the relief provided by the State from a tax statute held invalid under the Commerce Clause must be in accord with federal due process principles, see ante  at  496 U. S. 36-43,  496 U. S. 51-52, federal-state comity dictates that state courts have the initial duty of determining appropriate relief.  Pp.  496 U. S. 176-179.
(b) Under Chevron Oil's three-factor nonretroactivity test, Scheiner does not apply to taxation of highway use prior to the date it was decided, June 23, 1987, for the HUE tax year ending June 30, 1987.  First, Scheiner clearly established a new principle of law by expressly overruling those aspects of the Aero Mayflower line of cases on which Arkansas relied in enacting and assessing the HUE tax.  In its original decision upholding the tax, the State Supreme Court correctly followed the Aero Mayflower cases rather than Complete Auto Transit, since the latter case only questioned the Aero Mayflower line, and this Court cited that line with approval in a decision subsequent to Complete Auto Transit, Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444,  435 U. S. 463-464.  Second, the purpose of the Commerce Clause does not dictate retroactive application of Scheiner, since such application would not tend to deter future free trade violations by the States.  The HUE tax when enacted was entirely consistent with the Aero Mayflower cases, and it is not the Clause's purpose to prevent legitimate state taxation of interstate commerce.  Third, applying Scheiner retroactively would produce substantial inequitable results.  Especially in light of McKesson's holding that a ruling that a tax is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause places substantial obligations on the States to provide relief, invalidating the HUE tax has the potential for severely burdening the State's current operations and future plans.  A refund, if required, could deplete the state treasury and entail potentially significant administrative costs, while retroactively increasing taxes on the favored taxpayers would also entail such administrative costs, and could at some point run afoul of the Due Process Clause under McKesson, ante, at  496 U. S. 40-41, n. 23.  Where a State can easily foresee the invalidation of its tax statutes, the burden on state operations may merit little concern.  See McKesson, 
Page 496 U. S. 169
 ante, at  496 U. S. 44-46,  496 U. S. 50.  It is unjust, however, to impose this burden when the State relied on valid existing precedent in enacting and implementing its tax.  Pp.  496 U. S. 179-186.
(c) However, the conclusion that Scheiner applies only prospectively does not protect those HUE taxes paid to the State for the tax year beginning July 1, 1987.  The State Supreme Court's refusal to order refunds for any 1987-1988 HUE taxes paid prior to Justice BLACKMUN's escrow order arose from a misapprehension of the force of Chevron Oil. Scheiner applies prospectively to the flat taxing of highway use after the date of that decision, regardless of when the taxes for such use were actually collected.  Holding otherwise would result in similarly situated taxpayers receiving different remedies depending solely and fortuitously on the date they paid the tax.  Pp.  496 U. S. 186-188.
(d) The dissent's criticisms of this decision lack merit.  First, the claim that this decision is unjust because it treats the taxpayers in this case differently from those in Scheiner is unpersuasive, since this case resolves a retroactivity question not considered in Scheiner, which was concerned only with a state court's ruling on the constitutionality of certain tax statutes and remanded for a determination of retroactivity and remedial issues.

Syllabus 
Westside High School, a public secondary school that receives federal financial assistance, permits its students to join, on a voluntary basis, a number of recognized groups and clubs, all of which meet after school hours on school premises.  Citing the Establishment Clause and a School Board policy requiring clubs to have faculty sponsorship, petitioner school officials denied the request of respondent Mergens for permission to form a Christian club that would have the same privileges and meet on the same terms and conditions as other Westside student groups, except that it would have no faculty sponsor.  After the Board voted to uphold the denial, respondents, current and former Westside students, brought suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  They alleged, inter alia, that the refusal to permit the proposed club to meet at Westside violated the Equal Access Act, which prohibits public secondary schools that receive federal assistance and that maintain a ""limited open forum"" from denying ""equal access"" to students who wish to meet within the forum on the basis of the ""religious, political, philosophical, or other content"" of the speech at such meetings.  In reversing the District Court's entry of judgment for petitioners, the Court of Appeals held that the Act applied to forbid discrimination against respondents' proposed club on the basis of its religious content, and that the Act did not violate the Establishment Clause.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
867 F.2d 1076 (CA8 1989), affirmed.
Justice O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C, concluding that petitioners violated the Equal Access Act by denying official recognition to respondents' proposed club.  Pp.  496 U. S. 234-247.
(a) The Act provides, among other things, that a ""limited open forum"" exists whenever a covered school ""grants an offering to or opportunity for one or more noncurriculum related student groups to meet on school premises.""  Its equal access obligation is therefore triggered even if 
Page 496 U. S. 227
 such a school allows only one ""noncurriculum related"" group to meet.  Pp.  496 U. S. 234-237.
(b) Although the Act does not define the crucial phrase ""noncurriculum related student group,"" that term is best interpreted in the light of the Act's language, logic, and nondiscriminatory purpose, and Congress' intent to provide a low threshold for triggering the Act's requirements, to mean any student group that does not directly relate to the body of courses offered by the school.  A group directly relates to a school's curriculum if the group's subject matter is actually taught, or will soon be taught, in a regularly offered course; if that subject matter concerns the body of courses as a whole; or if participation in the group is required for a particular course or results in academic credit.  Whether a specific group is ""noncurriculum related"" will therefore depend on the particular school's curriculum, a determination that would be subject to factual findings well within the competence of trial courts to make.  Pp.  496 U. S. 237-243.
(c) Westside's existing student clubs include one or more ""noncurriculum related student group[s]"" under the foregoing standard.  For example, Subsurfers, a club for students interested in scuba diving, is such a group, since its subject matter is not taught in any regularly offered course; it does not directly relate to the curriculum as a whole in the same way that a student government or similar group might; and participation in it is not required by any course and does not result in extra academic credit.  Thus, the school has maintained a ""limited open forum"" under the Act and is prohibited from discriminating, based on the content of the students' speech, against students who wish to meet on school premises during noninstructional time.  Pp.  496 U. S. 243-247.
(d) Westside's denial of respondents' request to form a religious group constitutes a denial of ""equal access"" to the school's limited open forum.  Although the school apparently permits respondents to meet informally after school, they seek equal access in the form of official recognition, which allows clubs to be part of the student activities program and carries with it access to the school newspaper, bulletin boards, public address system, and annual Club Fair.  Since denial of such recognition is based on the religious content of the meetings respondents wish to conduct within the school's limited open forum, it violates the Act.  Pp.  496 U. S. 247-253. 
Page 496 U. S. 228

Justice O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice BLACKMUN, concluded in Part III that the Equal Access Act does not, on its face and as applied to Westside, contravene the Establishment Clause.  The logic of Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263,  454 U. S. 271-275 -- which applied the three-part test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602,  403 U. S. 612-613, to hold that an ""equal access"" policy, at the state university level, does not violate the Clause -- applies with equal force to the Act.
(a) Because the Act on its face grants equal access to both secular and religious speech, it meets the secular purpose prong of the test.  Pp.  496 U. S. 248-249.
(b) The Act does not have the primary effect of advancing religion.  There is a crucial difference between government and private speech endorsing religion, and, as Congress recognized in passing the Act, high school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Moreover, the Act expressly limits participation by school officials at student religious group meetings and requires that such meetings be held during ""noninstructional time,"" and thereby avoids the problems of the students' emulation of teachers as role models and mandatory attendance requirements that might otherwise indicate official endorsement or coercion.  Although the possibility of student peer pressure remains, there is little if any risk of government endorsement or coercion where no formal classroom activities are involved and no school officials actively participate.  Pp.  496 U. S. 249-252.
(c) Westside does not risk excessive entanglement between government and religion by complying with the Act, since the Act's provisions prohibit faculty monitors from participating in, nonschool persons from directing, controlling, or regularly attending, and school ""sponsorship"" of, religious meetings.  Indeed, a denial of equal access might well create greater entanglement problems in the form of invasive monitoring to prevent religious speech at meetings at which it might occur.  Pp.  496 U. S. 252-253.
Justice KENNEDY, joined by Justice SCALIA, agreeing that the Act does not violate the Establishment Clause, concluded that, since the accommodation of religion mandated by the Act is a neutral one, in the context of this case it suffices to inquire whether the Act violates either of two principles.  First, the government cannot give direct benefits to religion in such a degree that it in fact establishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,  492 U. S. 655 (KENNEDY,  J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Any incidental benefits that accompany official recognition of a religious club under the Act's criteria do not lead to the establishment of religion under this standard.  See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263.  Second, the government cannot coerce any student to participate in a religious activity.  Cf. County of Allegheny, supra, 492 U.S. at  492 U. S. 659.  The Act also satisfies this standard, since nothing on its face or in the facts of this case demonstrates that its enforcement will pressure students to participate in such an activity.  Pp.  496 U. S. 258-258,  496 U. S. 260-262.
Justice MARSHALL, joined by Justice BRENNAN, although agreeing that the Act as applied to Westside could withstand Establishment 
Page 496 U. S. 229
 Clause scrutiny, concluded that the inclusion of the Christian Club in the type of forum presently established at the school, without more, will not assure government neutrality toward religion.  Pp.  496 U. S. 263-270.
(a) The introduction of religious speech into the public schools reveals the tension between the Free Speech and Establishment Clauses, because the failure of a school to stand apart from religious speech can convey a message that the school endorses rather than merely tolerates that speech.  Thus, the particular vigilance this Court has shown in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578,  482 U. S. 583-584, must extend to monitoring of the actual effects of an ""equal access"" policy.  Pp.  496 U. S. 263-264.
(b) The plurality misplaces its reliance on Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 in light of the substantially different character of the student forum at issue here.  In Widmar, the state university maintained a wide-open and independent forum, affording many ideological organizations access to school facilities; took concrete steps to assure that the university's name was not identified with the policies or programs of any student group; and emphasized the autonomy of its students.  Here, in contrast, Westside currently does not recognize any student group that advocates a controversial viewpoint and explicitly promotes its student clubs as a vital part of its total educational program and as a means of developing citizenship, shaping character, and inculcating fundamental values.  Moreover, the absence of other advocacy-oriented clubs in the highly controlled environment provides a fertile ground for peer pressure.  In these circumstances, Westside's failure to disassociate itself from the activities and goals of the Christian Club poses a real danger that it will be viewed by students as endorsing religious activity.  Pp.  496 U. S. 264-269.
(c) Thus, Westside must take steps to fully disassociate itself from the Christian Club's religious speech and avoid appearing to sponsor or endorse the Club's goals.  It could, for example, entirely discontinue encouraging student participation in clubs, and clarify that the clubs are not instrumentally related to the school's overall mission.  Or, if Westside sought to continue its general endorsement of those clubs that did not engage in controversial speech, it could do so if it also affirmatively disclaimed endorsement of the Christian Club.  Pp.  496 U. S. 269-270.

There is a crucial difference between government and private speech endorsing religion, and, as Congress recognized in passing the Act, high school students are mature enough and are likely to understand that a school does not endorse or support student speech that it merely permits on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Moreover, the Act expressly limits participation by school officials at student religious group meetings and requires that such meetings be held during ""noninstructional time,"" and thereby avoids the problems of the students' emulation of teachers as role models and mandatory attendance requirements that might otherwise indicate official endorsement or coercion.  Although the possibility of student peer pressure remains, there is little if any risk of government endorsement or coercion where no formal classroom activities are involved and no school officials actively participate.  Pp.  496 U. S. 249-252.
(c) Westside does not risk excessive entanglement between government and religion by complying with the Act, since the Act's provisions prohibit faculty monitors from participating in, nonschool persons from directing, controlling, or regularly attending, and school ""sponsorship"" of, religious meetings.  Indeed, a denial of equal access might well create greater entanglement problems in the form of invasive monitoring to prevent religious speech at meetings at which it might occur.  Pp.  496 U. S. 252-253.
Justice KENNEDY, joined by Justice SCALIA, agreeing that the Act does not violate the Establishment Clause, concluded that, since the accommodation of religion mandated by the Act is a neutral one, in the context of this case it suffices to inquire whether the Act violates either of two principles.  First, the government cannot give direct benefits to religion in such a degree that it in fact establishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573,  492 U. S. 655 (KENNEDY,  J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Any incidental benefits that accompany official recognition of a religious club under the Act's criteria do not lead to the establishment of religion under this standard.  See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263.  Second, the government cannot coerce any student to participate in a religious activity.  Cf. County of Allegheny, supra, 492 U.S. at  492 U. S. 659.  The Act also satisfies this standard, since nothing on its face or in the facts of this case demonstrates that its enforcement will pressure students to participate in such an activity.  Pp.  496 U. S. 258-258,  496 U. S. 260-262.
Justice MARSHALL, joined by Justice BRENNAN, although agreeing that the Act as applied to Westside could withstand Establishment 
Page 496 U. S. 229
 Clause scrutiny, concluded that the inclusion of the Christian Club in the type of forum presently established at the school, without more, will not assure government neutrality toward religion.  Pp.  496 U. S. 263-270.
(a) The introduction of religious speech into the public schools reveals the tension between the Free Speech and Establishment Clauses, because the failure of a school to stand apart from religious speech can convey a message that the school endorses rather than merely tolerates that speech.  Thus, the particular vigilance this Court has shown in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578,  482 U. S. 583-584, must extend to monitoring of the actual effects of an ""equal access"" policy.  Pp.  496 U. S. 263-264.
(b) The plurality misplaces its reliance on Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 in light of the substantially different character of the student forum at issue here.  In Widmar, the state university maintained a wide-open and independent forum, affording many ideological organizations access to school facilities; took concrete steps to assure that the university's name was not identified with the policies or programs of any student group; and emphasized the autonomy of its students.  Here, in contrast, Westside currently does not recognize any student group that advocates a controversial viewpoint and explicitly promotes its student clubs as a vital part of its total educational program and as a means of developing citizenship, shaping character, and inculcating fundamental values.  Moreover, the absence of other advocacy-oriented clubs in the highly controlled environment provides a fertile ground for peer pressure.  In these circumstances, Westside's failure to disassociate itself from the activities and goals of the Christian Club poses a real danger that it will be viewed by students as endorsing religious activity.  Pp.  496 U. S. 264-269.
(c) Thus, Westside must take steps to fully disassociate itself from the Christian Club's religious speech and avoid appearing to sponsor or endorse the Club's goals.  It could, for example, entirely discontinue encouraging student participation in clubs, and clarify that the clubs are not instrumentally related to the school's overall mission.  Or, if Westside sought to continue its general endorsement of those clubs that did not engage in controversial speech, it could do so if it also affirmatively disclaimed endorsement of the Christian Club.  Pp.  496 U. S. 269-270.

No. 88-1972
Argued Feb. 20, 1990
Decided June 4, 1990
496 U.S. 292

Syllabus 
Police placed undercover agent Parisi in a jail cellblock with respondent Perkins, who was incarcerated on charges unrelated to the murder that Parisi was investigating.  When Parisi asked him if he had ever killed anybody, Perkins made statements implicating himself in the murder.  He was then charged with the murder.  The trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress his statements on the ground that Parisi had not given him the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, before their conversations.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, holding that Miranda prohibits all undercover contacts with incarcerated suspects that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.
Held:  An undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fellow inmate need not give Miranda warnings to an incarcerated suspect before asking questions that may elicit an incriminating response.  The Miranda doctrine must be enforced strictly, but only in situations where the concerns underlying that decision are present.  Those concerns are not implicated here, since the essential ingredients of a ""police dominated atmosphere"" and compulsion are lacking.  It is Miranda's premise that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation, whereby the suspect may feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of more lenient treatment should he confess.  That coercive atmosphere is not present when an incarcerated person speaks freely to someone whom he believes to be a fellow inmate and whom he assumes is not an officer having official power over him.  In such circumstances, Miranda does not forbid mere strategic deception by taking advantage of a suspect's misplaced trust.  The only difference between this case and Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293 -- which upheld the placing of an undercover agent near a suspect in order to gather incriminating information -- is that Perkins was incarcerated.  Detention, however, whether or not for the crime in question, does not warrant a presumption that such use of an undercover agent renders involuntary the incarcerated suspect's resulting confession.  Mathis v. United States, 391 U. S. 1 -- which held that an inmate's statements to a known agent were inadmissible because no Miranda warnings were given -- is distinguishable.  Where the suspect does not 
Page 496 U. S. 293
 know that he is speaking to a government agent, there is no reason to assume the possibility of coercion.  Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, and similar cases -- which held that the government may not use an undercover agent to circumvent the Sixth Amendment right to counsel once a suspect has been charged -- are inapplicable, since, here, no murder charges had been filed at the time of interrogation.  Also unavailing is Perkins' argument that a bright-line rule for the application of Miranda is desirable, since law enforcement officers will have little difficulty applying the holding of this case.  Pp.  496 U. S. 296-300.

No. A-857
Decided June 3, 1990
495 U.S. 731

Syllabus 
Thomas Baal, after being examined by three psychiatrists who found him competent to stand trial, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and robbery and was sentenced to death by a Nevada court.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.  Subsequently, he withdrew his request for state postconviction relief, testifying at an evidentiary hearing to determine his competency that he did not want to continue the proceedings and that he was aware of his impending execution and the reason for it.  The court reviewed the psychiatrists' reports and other evidence and held that Baal was sane and had made an intelligent waiver of his right to pursue postconviction relief.  A few hours before his scheduled execution, Baal's parents, applicants here, filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief as his ""next friend,"" contending that he was not competent to waive federal review.  The District Court denied their application for a stay of execution, holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition.  It found that, based on the record before the state court, Baal was legally competent, and it determined that a newly submitted affidavit by a nonexamining psychiatrist, which questioned Baal's competency, was conclusory and insufficient to warrant a psychiatric hearing or examination.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that applicants had made a minimum showing of Baal's incompetence warranting a basis for a full evidentiary hearing by the District Court.
Held:  No adequate basis for the exercise of federal power exists.  The prerequisite for ""next friend"" status -- that the real party in interest unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity -- has not been satisfied.  The state court's factual conclusion that Baal had intelligently waived his right to pursue postconviction relief was fairly supported by the record and, thus, is binding on a federal habeas court, see Maggio v. Fulford, 462 U. S. 111.  However, the Court of Appeals, rather than relying exclusively on the nonexamining psychiatrist's affidavit to show that Baal might have become incompetent since the state court hearing, based its determination on the same evidence that had been before the state court.  As there was no evidentiary basis for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court erred in declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing, the stay the court granted did not reflect the presence of substantial grounds upon which relief could be granted.
Stay vacated.

No. 89-474
Argued March 21, 1990
Decided May 29, 1990
495 U.S. 508

Syllabus 
After respondent Corbin's automobile struck oncoming vehicles on a New York highway, causing the death of one person and injury to another, he was served with two uniform traffic tickets directing him to appear at a Town Justice Court.  One ticket charged him with the misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated and the other charged him with failing to keep to the right of the median.  When Corbin pleaded guilty to the traffic tickets in the town court, the presiding judge was not informed of the fatality or of a pending homicide investigation.  Subsequently, a grand jury indicted Corbin, charging him with, among other things, reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and third-degree reckless assault.  A bill of particulars identified the three reckless or negligent acts on which the prosecution would rely to prove the charges:  (1) operating a motor vehicle on a public highway in an intoxicated condition; (2) failing to keep right of the median; and (3) driving at a speed too fast for the weather and road conditions.  Corbin's motion to dismiss the indictment on, inter alia, constitutional double jeopardy grounds was denied by the county court.  He then sought a writ of prohibition barring prosecution, which was denied by the Appellate Division.  However, the State Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the State's intention to ""rely on the prior traffic offenses as the acts necessary to prove the homicide and assault charges"" violated this Court's ""pointed"" dictum in Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, that if two successive prosecutions were not barred by the test of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299,  284 U. S. 304, the second prosecution would be barred if the prosecution sought to establish an essential element of the second crime by proving the conduct for which the defendant was convicted in the first prosecution.
Held:  The Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.  Pp.  495 U. S. 515-524.
(a) To determine whether a subsequent prosecution is barred, a court must first apply the traditional Blockburger test.  If the test's application reveals that the offenses have identical statutory elements or that one is a lesser included offense of the other, then the inquiry must cease, and the subsequent prosecution is barred.  However, a technical comparison 
Page 495 U. S. 509
 of the elements of the two offenses as required by the Blockburger test -- which was developed in the context of multiple punishments imposed in a single prosecution -- does not protect defendants sufficiently from the burdens of multiple trials, see, e.g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, and, thus, is not the exclusive means of determining whether a subsequent prosecution violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See, e.g., Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682.  Successive prosecutions, whether following acquittals or convictions, raise concerns that extend beyond merely the possibility of an enhanced sentence.  They allow the State to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense, and ordeal, and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.  They also give the State an opportunity to rehearse its presentation of proof, thus increasing the risk of an erroneous conviction for one or more of the offenses charged.  Were Blockburger the exclusive test in the context of successive prosecutions, the State could try Corbin in four consecutive trials:  for failure to keep right of the median, for driving while intoxicated, for assault, and for homicide.  Pp.  495 U. S. 515-521.
(b) The critical inquiry in determining whether the government will prove conduct in the subsequent prosecution that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted is what conduct the State will prove, not the evidence the State will use to prove it.  Thus, the test is not an ""actual evidence"" or ""same evidence"" test.  While the presentation of specific evidence in one trial does not forever prevent the government from introducing the same evidence in a subsequent proceeding, see Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, a State cannot avoid the Clause merely by altering in successive prosecutions the evidence offered to prove the same conduct.  Pp.  495 U. S. 521-522.
(c) Applying this analysis to the instant facts is straightforward.  While Blockburger does not bar prosecution of the reckless manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and third-degree reckless assault charges against Corbin, the State, in its bill of particulars, has admitted that it will prove the entirety of the conduct for which Corbin was convicted to establish essential elements of these offenses.  Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecution.  However, this holding would not bar a subsequent prosecution if the bill of particulars revealed that the State would rely solely on Corbin's driving too fast in heavy rain to establish recklessness or negligence.  Pp.  495 U. S. 522-523.
(d) That drunk driving is a national tragedy and that prosecutors are overworked and may not always have the time to monitor seemingly minor cases as they wind through the judicial system do not excuse the need for scrupulous adherence to constitutional principles.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold from their employees' paychecks money representing the employees' personal income and social security taxes.  26 U.S.C.  3102(a), 3402(a).  Because employers must hold these funds in ""trust for the United States,""  7501(a), the taxes are commonly called ""trust fund"" taxes.  Should an employer fail to pay such taxes,  6672 authorizes the Government to collect an equivalent sum directly from the employer's officers or employees who are responsible for collecting the tax, and are thus commonly referred to as ""responsible"" individuals.  Newport Offshore, Ltd., and Energy Resources Co., Inc., filed separate petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In conjunction with reorganization plans which they had approved, both Bankruptcy Courts authorized payments on the federal tax liabilities of the reorganized corporations to be applied to extinguish their trust fund debts before paying off the nontrust fund portions of the liabilities.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appealed both cases to the appropriate Federal District Courts, which, respectively, reversed as to Newport Offshore and affirmed as to Energy Resources.  Consolidating the two cases, the Court of Appeals in turn reversed the former, but affirmed the latter.
Held:  A bankruptcy court has the authority to order the IRS to treat tax payments made by Chapter 11 debtor corporations as trust fund payments where the court determines that this designation is necessary for the success of a reorganization plan.  Although the Bankruptcy Code does not explicitly authorize such a court to approve reorganization plans designating tax payments as either trust fund or nontrust fund, the orders at issue are wholly consistent with the court's broad authority under the Code to approve plans including ""any appropriate provision not inconsistent with . . . this title,"" 11 U.S.C.  1123(b)(5), and to ""issue an order . . . necessary or appropriate to carry out the [Code's] provisions,""  105.  Other Bankruptcy Code provisions protecting the Government's ability to collect delinquent taxes do not preclude the court from issuing such orders, since those restrictions do not address the court's ability to designate whether tax payments are to be applied to trust fund or non-trust-fund liabilities or assure the Government that its

 taxes will be paid even if the court is incorrect in its judgment that the reorganization plan will succeed.  Nor do the orders at issue contravene  6672 of the Internal Revenue Code -- the ""responsible"" individuals provision -- which remains both during and after the corporate Chapter 11 filing as an alternative source for collecting trust fund taxes.  By its terms, that section does not protect against the eventuality that, if the IRS cannot designate a debtor corporation's tax payments as nontrust fund, the debtor might be able to pay only the trust fund debt, leaving the Government at risk for nontrust fund taxes.

Syllabus 
The Internal Revenue Code requires employers to withhold from their employees' paychecks money representing the employees' personal income and social security taxes.  26 U.S.C.  3102(a), 3402(a).  Because employers must hold these funds in ""trust for the United States,""  7501(a), the taxes are commonly called ""trust fund"" taxes.  Should an employer fail to pay such taxes,  6672 authorizes the Government to collect an equivalent sum directly from the employer's officers or employees who are responsible for collecting the tax, and are thus commonly referred to as ""responsible"" individuals.  Newport Offshore, Ltd., and Energy Resources Co., Inc., filed separate petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

No. 89-156
Argued Feb. 20, 1990

495 U.S. 552

Syllabus 
Respondents pleaded guilty to welfare fraud and were ordered by a Pennsylvania court, as a condition of probation, to make monthly restitution payments to petitioner county probation department for petitioner state welfare department.  Subsequently, respondents filed a petition under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, listing the restitution obligation as an unsecured debt.  After the probation department commenced a probation violation proceeding in state court, alleging that respondents had failed to comply with the restitution order, respondents filed an adversary action in the Bankruptcy Court seeking both a declaration that the restitution obligation was a dischargeable debt and an injunction preventing the probation department from undertaking any further efforts to collect on the obligation.  The Bankruptcy Court held that the obligation was an unsecured debt dischargeable under Chapter 13.  The District Court reversed, relying on Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, which held that restitution obligations are nondischargeable in Chapter 7 proceedings because they fall within Code  523(a)(7)'s exception to discharge for a debt that is a government ""fine, penalty, or forfeiture . . . and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.""  The District Court emphasized the Court's dicta in Kelly that Congress did not intend to make criminal penalties ""debts"" under the Code.  The court also emphasized the federalism concerns that are implicated when federal courts intrude on state criminal proceedings.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Code's language and structure demonstrate that restitution obligations constitute ""debts"" within the meaning of  101(11), and are therefore dischargeable under Chapter 13.  Pp.   495 U. S. 557-564.
(a) Section 101(11)'s definition of ""debt"" as a ""liability on a claim"" reveals Congress' intent that the meanings of ""debt"" and ""claim"" be coextensive.  Furthermore,  101(4)(A)'s definition of a ""claim"" as a ""right to payment"" broadly contemplates any enforceable obligation of the debtor, including a restitution order.  Petitioners' reliance on Kelly's discussion emphasizing the special purposes of punishment and rehabilitation that underlie the imposition of restitution obligations is misplaced.  Unlike  523(a)(7), which explicitly ties its application to the purpose of the 
Page 495 U. S. 553
 compensation,  104(4)(A) makes no reference to the objectives the State seeks to serve in imposing an obligation.  That the probation department's enforcement mechanism is criminal rather than civil also does not alter the restitution order's character as a ""right of payment"" and, indeed, may make the right greater than that conferred by an ordinary civil obligation, since it is secured by the debtor's freedom, rather than his property.  Pp.  495 U. S. 557-560.
(b) Other Code provisions do not reflect a congressional intent to exempt restitution orders from Chapter 13 discharge.  Section 362(b)(1), which removes criminal prosecutions of the debtor from the operation of the Code's automatic stay provision, is not inconsistent with granting him sanctuary from restitution orders under Chapter 13.  Congress could well have concluded that maintaining criminal prosecutions during bankruptcy proceedings is essential to the functioning of government, but that a debtor's interest in full and complete release of his obligations outweighs society's interest in collecting or enforcing a restitution obligation outside the agreement reached in a Chapter 13 plan.  Nor must  726(a)(4) -- which in effect establishes the order for settlement of claims under such plans, assigning a low priority to a claim ""for any fine, penalty, or forfeiture"" -- be construed to apply only to civil fines, and not to criminal restitution orders in order to assure that governments do not receive disfavored treatment relative to other creditors.  That construction conflicts with Kelly's  holding that the quoted phrase, when used in  523(a)(7), applies to criminal restitution obligations.  It also highlights the tension between Kelly's interpretation of  523(a)(7) and its dictum suggesting that restitution obligations are not ""debts.""  If Congress believed that such obligations were not ""debts"" giving rise to ""claims,"" it would have had no reason to except the obligations from discharge, and  523(a)(7) would be mere surplusage.  Moreover, Kelly is faithful to the language and structure of the Code:  Congress defined ""debt"" broadly, and carefully excepted particular debts from discharge where policy considerations so warranted.  In thus securing a broader discharge of debtors under Chapter 13 than Chapter 7, Congress chose not to extend  523(a)(7)'s exception to Chapter 13.  Thus, it would override the balance Congress struck in crafting the appropriate discharge exceptions to construe ""debt"" narrowly in this context.  Pp.  495 U. S. 560-563.
(c) This holding does not signal a retreat from the principles applied in Kelly.  The Code will not be read to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure.  However, where, as here, congressional intent is clear, the Court's function is to enforce the statute according to its terms, even where this means

Syllabus 
When respondent Taylor pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1), he had four prior convictions, including two for second-degree burglary under Missouri law.  The Government sought to apply  924(e), which, inter alia, (1) provides a sentence enhancement for a ""person"" convicted under  922(g) who ""has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony,"" and (2) defines ""violent felony"" as ""(B) . . . any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" that ""(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [another's] person,"" or
""(ii) is burglary [or other specified offenses] or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.""
In imposing an enhanced sentence upon Taylor, the District Court rejected his contention that, because his burglary convictions did not present a risk of physical injury under  924(e)(2)(B)(ii), they should not count.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the word ""burglary"" in  924(e)(2)(B)(ii) ""means burglary' however a state chooses to define it.""
Held:  An offense constitutes ""burglary"" under  924(e) if, regardless of its exact definition or label, it has the basic elements of a ""generic"" burglary -- i.e., an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime -- or if the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.  Pp.  495 U. S. 581-602.
(a) The convicting State's definition of ""burglary"" cannot control the word's meaning under  924(e), since that would allow sentence enhancement for identical conduct in different States to turn upon whether the particular States happened to call the conduct ""burglary.""  That result is not required by  924(e)'s omission of a ""burglary"" definition contained in a prior version of the statute, absent a clear indication that Congress intended by the deletion, to abandon its general approach of using uniform categorical definitions for predicate offenses.  ""Burglary"" in  924(e) must have some uniform definition independent of the labels used by the various States' criminal codes.  Cf. United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S. 286,  393 U. S. 293-294.  Pp.  495 U. S. 590-592. 
Page 495 U. S. 576

(b) Nor is  924(e) limited to the common law definition of ""burglary"" -- i.e., a breaking and entering of a dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony.  Since that definition has been expanded in most States to include entry without a ""breaking,"" structures other than dwellings, daytime offenses, intent to commit crimes other than felonies, etc., the modern crime has little in common with its common law ancestor.  Moreover, absent a specific indication of congressional intent, a definition so obviously ill-suited to the statutory purpose of controlling violent crimes by career offenders cannot be read into  924(e).  The definition's arcane distinctions have little relevance to modern law enforcement concerns, and, because few of the crimes now recognized as burglaries would fall within the definition, its adoption would come close to nullifying the effect of the statutory term ""burglary.""  Under these circumstances, the general rule of lenity does not require adoption of the common law definition.  Pp.  495 U. S. 592-596.
(c) Section 924(e) is not limited to those burglaries that involve especially dangerous conduct, such as first-degree or aggravated burglaries.  If that were Congress' intent, there would have been no reason to add the word ""burglary"" to  924(e)(2)(B)(ii), since that provision already includes any crime that ""involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk"" of harm to persons.  It is more likely that Congress thought that burglary and the other specified offenses so often presented a risk of personal injury or were committed by career criminals that they should be included even though, considered solely in terms of their statutory elements, they do not necessarily involve the use or threat of force against a person.  Moreover, the choice of the unqualified language ""is burglary . . . or otherwise involves"" dangerous conduct indicates that Congress thought that ordinary burglaries, as well as those involving especially dangerous elements, should be included.  Pp.  495 U. S. 596-597.
(d) There thus being no plausible alternative, Congress meant by ""burglary"" the generic sense in which the term is now used in most States' criminal codes.  The fact that this meaning is practically identical to the omitted statutory definition is irrelevant.  That definition was not explicitly replaced with a different or narrower one, and the legislative history discloses that no alternative was ever discussed.  The omission therefore implies, at most, that Congress simply did not wish to specify an exact formulation.  Pp.  495 U. S. 598-599.
(e) The sentencing court must generally adopt a formal categorical approach in applying the enhancement provision, looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the predicate offense, rather than to the particular underlying facts.  That approach is required, since, when read in context,  924(e)(2)(B)(ii)'s ""is burglary"" phrase most likely refers to the statutory elements of the offense rather than to the 
Page 495 U. S. 577
 facts of the defendant's conduct; since the legislative history reveals a general categorical approach to predicate offenses; and since an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant's prior offenses would be impracticable and unfair.  The categorical approach, however, would still permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in the narrow range of cases in which the indictment or information and the jury instructions actually required the jury to find all of the elements of generic burglary even though the defendant was convicted under a statute defining burglary in broader terms.  Pp.  495 U. S. 599-602.
(f) The judgment must be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings, since, at the time of Taylor's convictions, most but not all of the Missouri second-degree burglary statutes included all the elements of generic burglary, and it is not apparent from the sparse record which of those statutes were the bases for the convictions.

||"Burnham v. Superior Court of California, County of Marin
No. 89-44
Argued Feb. 28, 1990
Decided May 29, 1990
495 U.S. 604

Syllabus 
During a trip to California to conduct business and visit his children, petitioner Burnham, a New Jersey resident, was served with a California court summons and his estranged wife's divorce petition.  The California Superior Court denied his motion to quash the service of process, and the State Court of Appeal denied mandamus relief, rejecting his contention that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited California courts from asserting jurisdiction over him because he lacked ""minimum contacts"" with the State.  The latter court held it to be a valid predicate for in personam jurisdiction that he was personally served while present in the forum State.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
Justice SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Parts II-A, II-B, and II-C that the Due Process Clause does not deny a State's courts jurisdiction over a nonresident, who was personally served with process while temporarily in that State, in a suit unrelated to his activities in the State.  Pp.  495 U. S. 2-12.
(a) To determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction is consistent with due process, this Court has long relied on the principles traditionally followed by American courts in marking out the territorial limits of each State's authority.  See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714,  95 U. S. 722.  The classic expression of that criterion appeared in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310,  326 U. S. 316, which held that a state court's assertion of personal jurisdiction must not violate ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.""  Pp.  495 U. S. 608-610.
(b) A formidable body of precedent, stretching from common law antecedents through decisions at or near the crucial time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption to many recent cases, reflects the near-unanimous view that service of process confers state court jurisdiction over a physically present nonresident, regardless of whether he was only briefly in the State or whether the cause of action is related to his activities there.  Pp.  495 U. S. 610-616.
(c) Burnham's contention that, in the absence of ""continuous and systematic"" contacts with the forum, a nonresident defendant can be subjected 
Page 495 U. S. 605
 to judgment only as to matters that arise out of or relate to his contacts with the forum misreads this Court's decisions applying that standard.  The standard was developed by analogy to the traditional ""physical presence"" requirement as a means of evaluating novel state procedures designed to do away with that requirement with respect to in personam jurisdiction over absent defendants.  Nothing in International Shoe or the subsequent cases supports the proposition that a defendant's presence in the forum is not only unnecessary to validate such novel assertions of jurisdiction, but is itself no longer sufficient to establish jurisdiction.  Pp.  495 U. S. 616-619.
Justice SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Parts II-D and III that:
1. Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186 -- which applied the jurisdictional rules developed under International Shoe to invalidate a Delaware court's assertion of quasi in rem jurisdiction over absent defendants whose sole contact with the State (ownership of property) was unrelated to the suit -- does not support Burnham's position.  When read in context, Shaffer's statement that ""all assertions of state court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the [International Shoe] standards,"" id. at  433 U. S. 212, means only that quasi in rem jurisdiction, like other forms of in personam jurisdiction over absent defendants, must satisfy the litigation-relatedness requirement.  Nothing in Shaffer compels the conclusion that physically present defendants must be treated identically to absent ones or expands the ""minimum contacts"" requirement beyond situations involving the latter persons.  Pp.  495 U. S. 619-622.
2. The proposal of Justice BRENNAN's concurrence to apply ""contemporary notions of due process"" to the constitutional analysis constitutes an outright break with the International Shoe standard, and, without authority, seeks to measure state court jurisdiction not only against traditional doctrines and current practice, but also against each Justice's subjective assessment of what is fair and just.  In effect, the proposed standard amounts to a ""totality of the circumstances"" test, guaranteeing uncertainty and unnecessary litigation over the preliminary issue of the forum's competence.  Pp.  495 U. S. 622-627.
Justice WHITE concluded that the traditionally accepted rule allowing jurisdiction to be obtained over a nonresident by personal service in the forum State cannot be invalidated absent a showing that, as a general proposition, it is so arbitrary and lacking in common sense in so many instances that it should be held violative of due process in every case.  Until such a difficult showing is made, claims in individual cases that the rule would operate unfairly as applied to the particular nonresident involved need not be entertained, at least in the usual instance where presence in the forum State is intentional.  P.  495 U. S. 628. 
Page 495 U. S. 606

Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice O'CONNOR, although agreeing that the traditional ""transient jurisdiction"" rule is generally valid, concluded that historical pedigree, although important, is not the only factor to be taken into account in establishing whether a jurisdictional rule satisfies due process, and that an independent inquiry into the fairness of the prevailing in-State service rule must be undertaken.  Pp.  495 U. S. 628-640.
(a) Reliance solely on historical precedent is foreclosed by International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310,  326 U. S. 316, and Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186,  433 U. S. 212, which demonstrate that all rules of state court jurisdiction, even ancient ones such as transient jurisdiction, must satisfy contemporary notions of due process.  While Shaffer's holding may have been limited to quasi in rem jurisdiction, its mode of analysis -- which discarded an ""ancient form without substantial modern justification"" -- was not.  Minimum contacts analysis represents a far more sensible construct for the exercise of state court jurisdiction.  Pp.  495 U. S. 629-633.
(b) The transient jurisdiction rule will generally satisfy due process requirements.  Tradition, although alone not dispositive, is relevant, because the fact that American courts have announced the rule since the latter part of the 19th century provides a defendant voluntarily present in a particular State today with clear notice that he is subject to suit in that forum.  Thus, the rule is consistent with reasonable expectations, and is entitled to a strong presumption that it comports with due process.  Moreover, by visiting the forum State, a transient defendant actually avails himself of significant benefits provided by the State:  police, fire, and emergency services, the freedom to travel its roads and waterways, the enjoyment of the fruits of its economy, the protection of its laws, and the right of access to its courts.  Without transient jurisdiction, the latter right would create an asymmetry, since a transient would have the full benefit of the power of the State's courts as a plaintiff while retaining immunity from their authority as a defendant.  Furthermore, the potential burdens on a transient defendant are slight in light of modern transportation and communications methods, and any burdens that do arise can be ameliorated by a variety of procedural devices.  Pp.  495 U. S. 633-640.
Justice STEVENS concluded that the historical evidence, a persisting consensus, considerations of fairness, and common sense all indicated that the judgment should be affirmed.  P.  495 U. S. 640.

495 U.S. 660

Syllabus 
Respondent Wells Fargo Asia Limited (WFAL), a Singapore-chartered bank wholly owned by a United States-chartered bank, agreed to make two time deposits in Eurodollars -- i.e., United States dollars that have been deposited with a banking institution located outside the country, with a corresponding obligation on the part of that institution to repay the deposits in United States dollars -- with Citibank/Manila, a branch of petitioner Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), which is chartered in the United States.  The parties received telexes detailing the deposits' terms from the money broker who had arranged them.  The parties also exchanged slips confirming the deposits and stating that repayment was to occur in New York.  Citibank/Manila refused to repay the deposits when they matured because a Philippine government decree prevented it from repaying them with its Philippine assets.  WFAL commenced suit in the District Court, claiming that Citibank in New York was liable for the funds deposited with Citibank/Manila.  Finding that there was a distinction between ""repayment,"" which refers to the physical location for transacting discharge of the debt, and ""collection,"" which refers to the location where assets may be taken to satisfy the debt, the court determined that the parties' confirmation slips established an agreement to repay the deposits in New York, but that there was neither an express agreement nor one that could be implied from custom or usage in the Eurodollar market on the issue of where the deposits could be collected; that no provision of Philippine law barred an agreement making WFAL's deposits collectible outside Manila; that, in the absence of such an agreement, New York law, rather than Philippine law, applied and required that Citibank be found liable for WFAL's deposits with Citibank/Manila; and that WFAL could look to Citibank's worldwide assets for satisfaction of its deposits. T he Court of Appeals affirmed on different grounds.  It concluded that the District Court's finding that the parties had agreed to repay WFAL's deposits in New York was not clearly erroneous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) and reasoned that, under general banking law principles, if parties agree that repayment of a foreign bank deposit may occur at another location, they authorize demand and collection of the deposit at that location.  Thus, it held that 
Page 495 U. S. 661
 WFAL was entitled to collect its deposits out of Citibank's New York assets.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals' factual premise that the parties agreed to permit collection from Citibank's New York assets contradicts the District Court's factual determinations, which are not clearly erroneous.  Pp.  495 U. S. 668-672.
(a) The District Court distinguished an agreement on ""repayment"" from one respecting ""collection"" and, in quite specific terms, found that the only agreement the parties made referred to repayment.  However, while saying that this finding was not clearly erroneous, the Court of Appeals appears to have viewed repayment and collection as interchangeable concepts, not divisible ones.  In responding to an argument that a bank's home office should not bear the risk of foreign restrictions on the payment of assets from the foreign branch where a deposit has been placed, unless it has an express agreement to do so, the Court of Appeals stated that its affirmance of the District Court's order was based on just such an agreement.  Furthermore, to support its holding, the court relied on authorities that all turned upon the existence, or nonexistence, of an agreement for collection.  Pp.  495 U. S. 668-670.
(b) The District Court's findings -- that the parties agreed on repayment, but not collection -- were not clearly erroneous.  While the confirmation slips are explicit that repayment would take place in New York, they do not indicate an agreement that WFAL could collect its deposits from Citibank's New York assets.  In fact, their language seems to negate such an agreement's existence.  The money broker's telexes also speak in terms of repayment, and do not indicate any agreement about where WFAL could collect its deposits if Citibank/Manilla failed to remit repayment.  Moreover, a fair reading of the contradictory testimony at trial supports the conclusion that the parties failed to establish a relevant custom or practice in the international banking community from which it could be inferred that they had a tacit understanding on this point.  Pp.  495 U. S. 670-672.
2. The case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to determine whether, in the absence of an agreement, collection is permitted by rights and duties implied by law.  On remand, the court must determine which law applies and the content of that law.  It is not a fair or necessary construction of the Court of Appeals' opinion to say that it relies on state law.  Alternatively, if the Court of Appeals is of the view that the controlling rule is supplied by Philippine law or by the federal common law rule respecting bank deposits, it should make that determination, subject to further review deemed appropriate by this Court.  Thus, it is premature to consider the parties' other contentions respecting

No. 88-6546
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided May 29, 1990
495 U.S. 676

Syllabus 
While living on one Indian Tribe's Reservation, petitioner Duro, an enrolled member of another Tribe, allegedly shot and killed an Indian youth within the Reservation's boundaries.  He was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the Reservation under the tribal criminal code, which is confined to misdemeanors.  After the tribal court denied his petition to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction, he filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court.  The court granted the writ, holding that assertion of jurisdiction by the Tribe over a nonmember Indian would constitute discrimination based on race in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the Indian Civil Rights Act, since, under Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, non-Indians are exempt from tribal courts' criminal jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the distinction drawn between a Tribe's members and nonmembers throughout United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 -- which, in upholding tribal criminal jurisdiction over tribe members, stated that tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over ""nonmembers"" -- was ""indiscriminate,"" and should be given little weight.  Finding the historical record ""equivocal,"" the court held that the applicable federal criminal statutes supported the view that the Tribes retain jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians against other Indians without regard to tribal membership.  It also rejected Duro's equal protection claim, finding that his significant contacts with the prosecuting Tribe -- such as residing with a Tribe member on the Reservation and working for the Tribe's construction company -- justified the exercise of the Tribe's jurisdiction.  Finally, it found that the failure to recognize tribal jurisdiction over Duro would create a jurisdictional void, since the relevant federal criminal statute would not apply to this charge, and since the State had made no attempt, and might lack the authority, to prosecute him. 
Page 495 U. S. 677

Held:  An Indian tribe may not assert criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember Indian.  Pp.  495 U. S. 684-698.
(a) The rationale of Oliphant, Wheeler, and subsequent cases compels the conclusion that Indian tribes lack jurisdiction over nonmembers.  Tribes lack the power to enforce laws against all who come within their borders, Oliphant, supra.  They are limited sovereigns, necessarily subject to the overriding authority of the United States, yet retaining the sovereignty needed to control their own internal relations and preserve their own unique customs and social order, Wheeler, supra.  Their power to prescribe and enforce rules of conduct for their own members falls outside that part of their sovereignty that they implicitly lost by virtue of their dependent status, but the power to prosecute an outsider would be inconsistent with this status, and could only come from a delegation by Congress.  The distinction between members and nonmembers and its relation to self-governance is recognized in other areas of Indian law.  See, e.g., Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463; Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544.  Although broader retained tribal powers have been recognized in the exercise of civil jurisdiction, such jurisdiction typically involves situations arising from property ownership within the reservation or consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, and criminal jurisdiction involves a more direct intrusion on personal liberties.  Since, as a nonmember, Duro cannot vote in tribal elections, hold tribal office, or sit on a tribal jury, his relationship with the Tribe is the same as the non-Indian's in Oliphant.  Pp.  495 U. S. 684-688.
(b) A review of the history of the modern tribal courts and the opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior on the tribal codes at the time of their enactment also indicates that tribal courts embody only the powers of internal self-governance.  The fact that the Federal Government treats Indians as a single large class with respect to federal programs is not dispositive of a question of tribal power to treat them by the same broad classification.  Pp.  495 U. S. 688-692.
(c) This case must be decided in light of the fact that all Indians are now citizens of the United States.  While Congress has special powers to legislate with respect to Indians, Indians, like all citizens, are entitled to protection from unwarranted intrusions on their personal liberty.  This Court's cases suggest constitutional limits even on the ability of Congress to subject citizens to criminal proceedings before a tribunal, such as a tribal court, that does not provide constitutional protections as a matter of right.  In contrast, retained jurisdiction over members is accepted by the Court's precedents and justified by the voluntary character 
Page 495 U. S. 678
 of tribal membership and the concomitant right of participation in a tribal government.  Duro's enrollment in one Tribe says little about his consent to the exercise of authority over him by another Tribe.  Tribes are not mere fungible groups of homogeneous persons among whom any Indian would feel at home, but differ in important aspects of language, culture, and tradition.  The rationale of adopting a ""contacts"" test to determine which nonmember Indians must be subject to tribal jurisdiction would apply to non-Indian residents as well, and is little more than a variation of the argument, already rejected for non-Indians, that any person entering the reservation is deemed to have given implied consent to tribal criminal jurisdiction.  Pp.  495 U. S. 692-696.
(d) This decision does not imply endorsement of a jurisdictional void over minor crime by nonmembers.  Congress is the proper body to address the problem if, in fact, the present jurisdictional scheme proves insufficient to meet the practical needs of reservation law enforcement.  Pp.  495 U.

			"|"Duro v. Reina
No. 88-6546
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided May 29, 1990
495 U.S. 676

Syllabus 
While living on one Indian Tribe's Reservation, petitioner Duro, an enrolled member of another Tribe, allegedly shot and killed an Indian youth within the Reservation's boundaries.  He was charged with the illegal firing of a weapon on the Reservation under the tribal criminal code, which is confined to misdemeanors.  After the tribal court denied his petition to dismiss the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction, he filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court.  The court granted the writ, holding that assertion of jurisdiction by the Tribe over a nonmember Indian would constitute discrimination based on race in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the Indian Civil Rights Act, since, under Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, non-Indians are exempt from tribal courts' criminal jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that the distinction drawn between a Tribe's members and nonmembers throughout United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313 -- which, in upholding tribal criminal jurisdiction over tribe members, stated that tribes do not possess criminal jurisdiction over ""nonmembers"" -- was ""indiscriminate,"" and should be given little weight.  Finding the historical record ""equivocal,"" the court held that the applicable federal criminal statutes supported the view that the Tribes retain jurisdiction over minor crimes committed by Indians against other Indians without regard to tribal membership.  It also rejected Duro's equal protection claim, finding that his significant contacts with the prosecuting Tribe -- such as residing with a Tribe member on the Reservation and working for the Tribe's construction company -- justified the exercise of the Tribe's jurisdiction.  Finally, it found that the failure to recognize tribal jurisdiction over Duro would create a jurisdictional void, since the relevant federal criminal statute would not apply to this charge, and since the State had made no attempt, and might lack the authority, to prosecute him. 
Page 495 U. S. 677

Held:  An Indian tribe may not assert criminal jurisdiction over a nonmember Indian.  Pp.  495 U. S. 684-698.
(a) The rationale of Oliphant, Wheeler, and subsequent cases compels the conclusion that Indian tribes lack jurisdiction over nonmembers.  Tribes lack the power to enforce laws against all who come within their borders, Oliphant, supra.  They are limited sovereigns, necessarily subject to the overriding authority of the United States, yet retaining the sovereignty needed to control their own internal relations and preserve their own unique customs and social order, Wheeler, supra.  Their power to prescribe and enforce rules of conduct for their own members falls outside that part of their sovereignty that they implicitly lost by virtue of their dependent status, but the power to prosecute an outsider would be inconsistent with this status, and could only come from a delegation by Congress.  The distinction between members and nonmembers and its relation to self-governance is recognized in other areas of Indian law.  See, e.g., Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463; Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544.  Although broader retained tribal powers have been recognized in the exercise of civil jurisdiction, such jurisdiction typically involves situations arising from property ownership within the reservation or consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, and criminal jurisdiction involves a more direct intrusion on personal liberties.  Since, as a nonmember, Duro cannot vote in tribal elections, hold tribal office, or sit on a tribal jury, his relationship with the Tribe is the same as the non-Indian's in Oliphant.  Pp.  495 U. S. 684-688.
(b) A review of the history of the modern tribal courts and the opinions of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior on the tribal codes at the time of their enactment also indicates that tribal courts embody only the powers of internal self-governance.  The fact that the Federal Government treats Indians as a single large class with respect to federal programs is not dispositive of a question of tribal power to treat them by the same broad classification.

No. 89-163
Argued Jan. 9, 1990
Decided May 29, 1990
495 U.S. 711

Syllabus 
A provision of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C.  3142(e), requires that a suspect held in pretrial custody on federal criminal charges be detained if, ""after a hearing pursuant to . . . subsection (f),"" he is found to pose a risk of flight and a danger to others or the community and if no condition of release can give reasonable assurances against these contingencies.  Section 3142(f) provides that, before detention can occur, a judicial officer ""shall"" conduct a hearing ""immediately upon the person's first appearance before the . . . officer"" unless he grants a continuance.  Respondent was arrested on federal drug charges, and a Magistrate, at a detention hearing held after respondent's ""first appearance"" and after continuances granted beyond the period permitted by the Act, ordered his release on bond.  The District Court, while finding that no conditions reasonably could assure his appearance or the community's safety, held that the detention hearing had not been held upon respondent's first appearance, and that pretrial release was the appropriate remedy for violation of the statutory requirement.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Upon issuance of the court's mandate, respondent was released, took flight, and remains at large.  He is, however, represented by counsel before this Court.
Held:
1. Respondent's flight does not render the case moot, for the resolution of this dispute determines the course of proceedings if and when he is rearrested on the charges now pending. P.  495 U. S. 713.
2. In light of the disposition of this case, the Government may detain respondent at once upon his rearrest without first seeking revocation of the existing release order. Pp.  495 U. S. 713-714.
3. The failure to comply with the Act's prompt hearing provision does not require release of a person who should otherwise be detained.  Pp.  495 U. S. 716-722.
(a) Neither the time requirements nor any other part of the Act indicates that compliance with the first appearance requirement is a precondition to holding the hearing or that failure to comply so subverts  3142(f)'s procedural scheme as to invalidate the hearing.  There is no presumption or rule that, for every mandatory duty imposed upon the court or the Government or its prosecutors, there must exist some corollary 
Page 495 U. S. 712
 punitive sanction for departures or omissions, even if negligent.  See French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506,  80 U. S. 511; Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253,  476 U. S. 260.  If Congress' mere use of the word ""shall"" operated to bar all authority to seek pretrial detention once the time limit had passed, then any other violation of subsection (f)'s procedures -- such as the right to be represented by counsel, present witnesses and evidence, testify, and cross-examine witnesses -- no matter how insignificant, would also prevent a hearing from being ""a hearing pursuant to"" the statute.  Respondent's argument that these other infringements could be subject to a harmless error analysis cannot be reconciled with his contention that absolute compliance with the timely hearing requirement is necessary.  Pp.  495 U. S. 716-719.
(b) Automatic release contravenes the statutory purpose of providing fair bail procedures while protecting the public's safety and assuring a defendant's appearance at trial.  There is no reason to bestow a windfall upon the defendant and visit a severe penalty upon the Government and citizens every time some deviation occurs where the Government and the courts have made diligent efforts, or even where the Government bears some of the responsibility for the hearing's delay.  An order of release in the face of the Government's ability to prove that detention is required has neither causal nor proportional relation to any harm caused by the delay in holding the hearing, since release would not restore the benefits of a timely hearing to a defendant who has already suffered from the inconvenience and uncertainty of the delay.  Thus, once the Government discovers that the time limits have expired, it may ask for a prompt detention hearing and make its case to detain.  P.  495 U. S. 719-722.
(c) This ruling is consistent with the rule of Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250,  487 U. S. 256, that a nonconstitutional error is harmless unless it has a ""substantial influence"" on the outcome of the proceedings.  Here, detention was harmless because respondent, as an individual likely to flee, would have been detained if his hearing had been held upon his first appearance, rather than a few days later.  P.  495 U. S. 722.

495 U.S. 641

Syllabus 
During collective bargaining, petitioner schools, which are owned and operated by the Army at a military facility, declined to negotiate with respondent Union over proposals relating to a salary increase and fringe benefits.  Respondent Federal Labor Relations Authority held that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or the Statute) required petitioner to bargain over the proposals.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Authority did not err in ruling that petitioner was required to bargain over the Union's proposals.  Pp.  495 U. S. 644-657.
(a) The Authority's conclusion that the Union's proposals related to ""conditions of employment"" within the meaning of the Statute, over which covered employers are required to bargain, is based upon a permissible construction and is entitled to deference absent an unambiguous expression of congressional intent to the contrary.  Cf.  467 U. S. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,  467 U. S. 842-843.  The Statute defines ""conditions of employment"" as matters ""affecting working conditions,"" but excludes matters (1) relating to prohibited partisan political activities; (2) relating to the classification of positions; or (3) specifically provided for by federal statute.  Although, in isolation, the term ""working conditions"" might be read to connote only the physical conditions under which an employee labors, the structure of the statutory definition tends to negate that meaning, which would render the first two exceptions unnecessary.  There is no merit to petitioner's contention that, although the term ""conditions of employment"" may generally include any matter insisted upon as a prerequisite to accepting employment, it does not include wages.  Wages are the quintessential prerequisite to accepting employment.  Nor is the inclusion in the National Labor Relations Act and the Postal Reorganization Act of specific references to ""wages"" relevant here; those statutes deal with labor-management relations in entirely different spheres, and nothing in the FSLMRS indicates that it is to be read in pari materia with them.  Statements in the legislative history suggesting that the FSLMRS duty to bargain does not extend to wage and fringe benefit proposals are also irrelevant, in light of indications that these statements were based on 
Page 495 U. S. 642
 the erroneous belief that the wages and benefits of all Executive Branch employees are fixed by law and are therefore eliminated from the ""conditions of employment"" definition by the third statutory exception.  Pp.  495 U. S. 644-650.
(b) The Union's proposals are not exempted from the statutory duty to bargain by an FSLMRS provision specifying that ""nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any [agency] management official . . . to determine the [agency's] budget.""  Under the Authority's precedents interpreting this provision, petitioner had the burden of proving that the Union's proposals would result in significant and unavoidable increases in petitioner's costs.  Since petitioner placed nothing in the record to document its total costs or even its current total teachers' salaries, the Authority reasonably determined that it could not conclude from an increase in one budget item of indeterminate amount whether petitioner's costs as a whole would be significantly and unavoidably increased.  Pp.  495 U. S. 650-653.
(c) Title 20 U.S.C.  241 -- which directs agencies establishing schools on federally owned property to limit expenditures to ""an amount per pupil which will not exceed the per pupil cost of free public education provided [by] comparable communities in the State"" -- and an implementing Army regulation -- which requires that federal school salary schedules equal those in the private sector -- do not relieve petitioner of its duty to bargain on the ground that the Union's proposed salary increase would require petitioner to pay its teachers more than employees in local civilian school systems.  In rejecting this argument, the Authority relied on an FSLMRS provision requiring, ""to the extent not inconsistent with Federal law,"" bargaining over the subject of an agency regulation ""if the Authority has determined . . . that no compelling need . . . exists for the . . . regulation,"" and on its own implementing regulation declaring that a ""compelling need"" exists if, among other things, the agency regulation in question implements a statutory mandate that is ""essentially nondiscretionary in nature.""  It cannot be said that the salary equality requirement is ""essentially nondiscretionary in nature,"" since  241 mandates equivalence only in total per pupil expenditure, not in each separate element of educational cost.

Decided May 21, 1990
495 U.S. 385

Syllabus 
After respondent pleaded guilty to two federal misdemeanors, a Federal Magistrate, inter alia, ordered him to pay, as required by 18 U.S.C.  3013, a monetary ""special assessment"" to the Crime Victims Fund established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.  He moved to correct his sentence, asserting that the assessments were unconstitutional because Congress had passed  3013 in violation of the Origination Clause, which mandates that ""all Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.""  The Magistrate denied the motion, and the District Court affirmed.  However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, while respondent's claim did not raise a nonjusticiable political question,  3013 was a bill for raising revenue that had originated in the Senate and, thus, was passed in violation of the Clause.
Held:
1. This case does not present a nonjusticiable political question.  It has none of the characteristics that Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186,  369 U. S. 217, identified as essential to a finding that a case raises such a question.  Pp.  495 U. S. 389-397.
(a) Invalidating a law on Origination Clause grounds would not evince a ""lack of . . . respect,"" within the meaning of Baker, for the House. If disrespect, as the Government uses that term, were sufficient to create a political question, every judicial resolution of a constitutional challenge to a congressional enactment would be impermissible.  Congress often explicitly considers whether bills violate constitutional provisions, and any law's enactment is predicated at least implicitly on a judgment that the law is constitutional.  These factors do not foreclose subsequent judicial scrutiny of a law's constitutionality.  To the contrary, this Court has a duty to conduct such a review.  Pp.  495 U. S. 389-391.
(b) The Government's two attempts to distinguish an Origination Clause claim from other constitutional challenges are rejected.  First, its argument that the House has the power to protect its institutional interests by refusing to pass a bill if it believes that the Clause has been violated does not absolve this Court of its responsibility to consider constitutional challenges to congressional enactments.  Even if the House had a greater incentive to safeguard its origination prerogative than it does to refuse to pass a bill that it believes is unconstitutional for other 
Page 495 U. S. 386
 purposes, the fact that one governmental institution has mechanisms available to guard against incursions into its power by other such institutions does not require that the judiciary remove itself from the controversy by labeling the issue a political question.  Second, the Government's suggestion that judicial intervention is unwarranted because this case does not involve individual rights is simply irrelevant to the political question doctrine, which is designed to restrain the judiciary from inappropriate interference in the business of the other branches.  The litigant's identity is immaterial to the presence of these concerns in a particular case.  More fundamentally, the Government's claim is in error.  This Court has repeatedly adjudicated separation of powers claims brought by people acting in their individual capacities, and provisions for the separation of powers within the Legislative Branch are not different in kind from the provisions concerning relations among the branches: both sets of provisions safeguard liberty.  Pp.  495 U. S. 392-395.
(c) Also rejected is the Government's argument that another Baker factor justifies a finding that the case is nonjusticiable:  the Court could not fashion ""judicially manageable standards"" for determining either whether a bill is ""for raising Revenue"" or where a bill ""originates.""  The Government suggests no reason why a judicial system capable of determining, e.g., when punishment is ""cruel and unusual"" and when bail is ""[e]xcessive"" will be unable to develop standards in this context.  Pp.  495 U. S. 395-396.
(d) Justice STEVENS' theory -- that, since the Constitution is silent as to the consequences of an Origination Clause violation, but provides by implication, in Art. I,  7, cl. 2, that any bill passed by both Houses and signed by the President becomes law, some improperly originated bills may become law -- is not supported by the better reading of  7, which gives effect to all of its clauses in determining what procedures the legislative and executive branches must follow to enact a law.  Although none of the Constitution's commands explicitly sets out a remedy for its violation, the principle that the courts will strike down a law when Congress has passed it in violation of such a command is well settled.  See, e.g.,  5 U. S.  Madison, 1 Cranch 137,  5 U. S. 176-180.  Moreover, the logical consequence of Justice STEVENS' view is that the Origination Clause would most appropriately be treated as a constitutional requirement separate from the provisions of  7 that govern when a bill becomes a ""law.""  Nonetheless, saying that a bill becomes ""law"" within the meaning of the second clause does not answer the question whether that ""law"" is unconstitutional.  Pp.  495 U. S. 396-397.
2. The special assessment statute is not a ""Bil[l] for raising Revenue"" and, thus, its passage does not violate the Origination Clause.  This case falls squarely within the holdings of Twin City Bank v. Nebecker, 167 U. S. 196, 
Page 495 U. S. 387
 and Millard v. Roberts, 202 U. S. 429, that a statute that creates, and raises revenue to support, a particular governmental program, as opposed to a statute that raises revenue to support government generally, is not a ""Bil[l] for raising Revenue.""  The provision was passed as part of, and to provide money for, the Crime Victims Fund.  Although any excess was to go to the Treasury, there is no evidence that Congress contemplated the possibility of a substantial excess, nor did such an excess in fact materialize.  Any revenue for the general Treasury that  3013 creates is thus incidental to that provision's primary purpose.  The fact that the bill was not designed to benefit the persons from whom the funds were collected is not relevant to a determination whether the bill is a revenue bill.  Since  3013 is not a revenue bill, there is no need to consider whether the Clause would require its invalidation if it were one.  Pp.  495 U. S. 397-401.

Syllabus 
After respondent pleaded guilty to two federal misdemeanors, a Federal Magistrate, inter alia, ordered him to pay, as required by 18 U.S.C.  3013, a monetary ""special assessment"" to the Crime Victims Fund established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.  He moved to correct his sentence, asserting that the assessments were unconstitutional because Congress had passed  3013 in violation of the Origination Clause, which mandates that ""all Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.""  The Magistrate denied the motion, and the District Court affirmed.

495 U.S. 411

Syllabus 
Pursuant to a plea agreement, petitioner Hughey pleaded guilty to using one unauthorized MBank credit card.  Under the restitution provisions of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA) which authorize federal courts to order ""a defendant convicted of an offense"" to ""make restitution to any victim of such offense,"" 18 U.S.C.  3579(a)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. 4) -- the District Court ordered Hughey to pay $90,431 in restitution, the total of MBank's losses relating to his alleged theft and use of 21 cards from various MBank cardholders.  Denying Hughey's motion to reduce and correct his sentence, the court rejected his argument that it had exceeded its authority in ordering restitution for offenses other than the offense of conviction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A VWPA restitution award is authorized only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.  Pp.  495 U. S. 415-422.
(a) VWPA's plain language clearly links restitution to the offense of conviction.  Given that the ordinary meaning of ""restitution"" is restoring someone to a position he occupied before a particular event,  3579's repeated focus on the offense of conviction suggests strongly that restitution is intended to compensate victims only for losses caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction.  The Government's view that  3579(a) merely identifies the victim, but that the restitution amount is calculated in accordance with  3580(a) -- which delineates ""[p]rocedure[s] for issuing"" restitution orders -- is unconvincing.  Section 3579(b), by giving detailed substantive guidance regarding the calculation of restitution, establishes the amount of restitution that courts can award.  In addition, to regard  3580 rather than  3579 as fixing the substantive boundaries of such orders would ignore this Court's commitment to ""giving effect to the meaning and placement of the words chosen by Congress.""  Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638,  494 U. S. 645.  More significantly, because a general statutory term should be understood in light of the specific terms that surround it,  3580(a)'s catchall phrase -- which directs courts to consider ""such other factors as the court deems appropriate"" in calculating the amount of restitution -- should not be read to introduce into the calculus losses that would 
Page 495 U. S. 412
 expand a defendant's liability beyond the offense of conviction.  That phrase is preceded by more specific considerations for determining whether to order, and the amount of, restitution, all of which are designed to limit, rather than to expand, the scope of any restitution order.  Pp.  495 U. S. 415-420.
(b) Any policy questions surrounding VWPA's offense-of-conviction limitation on restitution orders need not be resolved.  Even were the statutory language ambiguous, longstanding principles of lenity preclude the resolution of the ambiguity against Hughey on the basis of general declarations of policy in the statute and legislative history.

495 U.S. 423

Syllabus 
The United States and North Dakota exercise concurrent jurisdiction over two military bases on which the Department of Defense (DoD) operates clubs and package stores.  In 1986, in order to reduce the price the military pays for alcoholic beverages sold on such bases, Congress passed a statute directing that distilled spirits be ""procured from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered.""  A DoD regulation also requires that alcohol purchases be made in such a manner as to obtain ""the most advantageous contract, price and other considered factors.""  Although the regulation promises cooperation with state officials, it denies any obligation to submit to state control or to make purchases from in-state or state-prescribed suppliers.  Since long before 1986, North Dakota has maintained a liquor importation and distribution system, under which, inter alia, out-of-state distillers/suppliers may sell only to state-licensed wholesalers or federal enclaves, while licensed wholesalers may sell to licensed retailers, other licensed wholesalers, and federal enclaves.  One state regulation requires that all persons bringing liquor into the State file monthly reports, and another requires that out-of-state distillers selling directly to a federal enclave affix a label to each individual item indicating that the liquor is for consumption only within the enclave.  After a number of out-of-state distillers and importers informed military officials that they would not deal with, or would increase prices to, the North Dakota bases because of the burden of complying with the two state regulations, the Government filed suit in the District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the regulations' application to liquor destined for federal enclaves.  The court granted the State's motion for summary judgment, reasoning that there was no conflict between the state and federal regulations because the state regulations did not prevent the Government from obtaining beverages at the ""lowest cost.""  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the state regulations impermissibly made out-of-state distillers less competitive with local wholesalers.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
856 F.2d 1107 (CA8 1988), reversed.
Justice STEVENS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice O'CONNOR, concluded that the state regulations are not invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Pp.  495 U. S. 430-444. 
Page 495 U. S. 424

(a) Under  2 of the Twenty-first Amendment -- which prohibits the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquor into a State for delivery or use therein in violation of state law -- a State has no power to pass regulations that burden the Federal Government in an area or over a transaction that falls outside the State's jurisdiction, see, e.g., Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S. 518, but has ""virtually complete control"" over the importation and sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system within the State's jurisdiction, see California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97,  445 U. S. 110.  Since North Dakota's labeling and reporting regulations fall within the core of the State's power to regulate distribution under the Twenty-first Amendment, and unquestionably serve a valid state interest in prohibiting the diversion of liquor from military bases into the civilian market, they are supported by a strong presumption of validity, and should not be lightly set aside, see, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691,  467 U. S. 714.  Pp.  495 U. S. 430-433.
(b) The regulations do not violate the intergovernmental immunity doctrine.  Although they may indirectly affect the Federal Government's liquor costs, they do not regulate the Government directly, since they operate only against suppliers.  See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405,  304 U. S. 422.  Nor do they discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals, since the regulatory regime of which they are a part actually favors the Government.  All other liquor retailers in the State are required to purchase from state-licensed wholesalers, whereas the Government alone has the option either to do so or to purchase from out-of-state wholesalers who have complied with the labeling and reporting requirements.  Thus, the regulatory system does not discriminate with regard to the economic burdens that result from it.  See Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536,  460 U. S. 544-545.  Pp.  495 U. S. 434-439.
(c) Congress has not here spoken with sufficient clarity to preempt North Dakota's attempt to protect its liquor distribution system.  The language of the federal procurement statutes does not expressly preempt the state reporting and labeling regulations or address the problem of unlawful diversion.  The state regulations do not directly prevent the Government from obtaining covered liquor ""from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered,"" but merely raise the price charged by the most competitive source, out-of-state shippers.  Pp.  495 U. S. 439-441.
(d) The state reporting and labeling requirements are not preempted by the DoD regulation.  That regulation does not purport to carry a greater preemptive power than the federal statutes.  Nor does the regulation's text purport to preempt any such laws.  Its command to the military to consider various factors in determining ""the most advantageous 
Page 495 U. S. 425
 contract, price and other considered factors"" cannot be understood to preempt state laws that merely have the incidental effect of raising costs for the military.  Although the regulation does admonish that military cooperation with local authorities should not be construed as admitting an obligation to submit to state control or to buy from in-state or state-prescribed suppliers, the North Dakota regulations do not require such actions.  Pp.  495 U. S. 442-443.
(e) The present record does not establish the precise burdens the reporting and labeling laws will impose on the Government, but there is no evidence that they will be substantial.  It is for Congress, not this Court, to decide whether the federal interest in procuring the most inexpensive liquor outweighs the State's legitimate interest in preventing diversion.  It would be an unwise and unwarranted extension of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine for the Court to hold that the burdens associated with the regulations -- no matter how trivial -- are sufficient to make them unconstitutional.  Pp.  495 U. S. 443-444.
Justice SCALIA, although agreeing that the availability to the Government of the option of buying liquor from in-state distributors saves the labeling regulation from invalidity, concluded that it does so not because the Government is thereby relieved of the burden of having to pay higher prices than anyone else, but only because that option is not a course of action that the Government has a constitutional right to avoid.  The Twenty-first Amendment is binding on the Government, like everyone else, and empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler.  Since letting the Government choose between purchasing label-free bottles from such wholesalers and purchasing labeled bottles from out-of-state distillers provides the Government with greater, rather than lesser, prerogatives than those enjoyed by other liquor retailers, the labeling requirement does not discriminate against the United States, and thus does not violate any federal immunity.  Pp.  495 U. S. 444-448.
Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice KENNEDY, agreed that North Dakota's reporting regulation is lawful.  Pp.  495 U. S. 448,  495 U. S. 465, n.10.

(a) Under  2 of the Twenty-first Amendment -- which prohibits the transportation or importation of intoxicating liquor into a State for delivery or use therein in violation of state law -- a State has no power to pass regulations that burden the Federal Government in an area or over a transaction that falls outside the State's jurisdiction, see, e.g., Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S. 518, but has ""virtually complete control"" over the importation and sale of liquor and the structure of the liquor distribution system within the State's jurisdiction, see California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97,  445 U. S. 110.  Since North Dakota's labeling and reporting regulations fall within the core of the State's power to regulate distribution under the Twenty-first Amendment, and unquestionably serve a valid state interest in prohibiting the diversion of liquor from military bases into the civilian market, they are supported by a strong presumption of validity, and should not be lightly set aside, see, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691,  467 U. S. 714.  Pp.  495 U. S. 430-433.
(b) The regulations do not violate the intergovernmental immunity doctrine.  Although they may indirectly affect the Federal Government's liquor costs, they do not regulate the Government directly, since they operate only against suppliers.  See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405,  304 U. S. 422.  Nor do they discriminate against the Government or those with whom it deals, since the regulatory regime of which they are a part actually favors the Government.  All other liquor retailers in the State are required to purchase from state-licensed wholesalers, whereas the Government alone has the option either to do so or to purchase from out-of-state wholesalers who have complied with the labeling and reporting requirements.  Thus, the regulatory system does not discriminate with regard to the economic burdens that result from it.  See Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536,  460 U. S. 544-545.  Pp.  495 U. S. 434-439.
(c) Congress has not here spoken with sufficient clarity to preempt North Dakota's attempt to protect its liquor distribution system.  The language of the federal procurement statutes does not expressly preempt the state reporting and labeling regulations or address the problem of unlawful diversion.  The state regulations do not directly prevent the Government from obtaining covered liquor ""from the most competitive source, price and other factors considered,"" but merely raise the price charged by the most competitive source, out-of-state shippers.  Pp.  495 U. S. 439-441.
(d) The state reporting and labeling requirements are not preempted by the DoD regulation.  That regulation does not purport to carry a greater preemptive power than the federal statutes.  Nor does the regulation's text purport to preempt any such laws.  Its command to the military to consider various factors in determining ""the most advantageous 
Page 495 U. S. 425
 contract, price and other considered factors"" cannot be understood to preempt state laws that merely have the incidental effect of raising costs for the military.  Although the regulation does admonish that military cooperation with local authorities should not be construed as admitting an obligation to submit to state control or to buy from in-state or state-prescribed suppliers, the North Dakota regulations do not require such actions.  Pp.  495 U. S. 442-443.
(e) The present record does not establish the precise burdens the reporting and labeling laws will impose on the Government, but there is no evidence that they will be substantial.  It is for Congress, not this Court, to decide whether the federal interest in procuring the most inexpensive liquor outweighs the State's legitimate interest in preventing diversion.  It would be an unwise and unwarranted extension of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine for the Court to hold that the burdens associated with the regulations -- no matter how trivial -- are sufficient to make them unconstitutional.  Pp.  495 U. S. 443-444.
Justice SCALIA, although agreeing that the availability to the Government of the option of buying liquor from in-state distributors saves the labeling regulation from invalidity, concluded that it does so not because the Government is thereby relieved of the burden of having to pay higher prices than anyone else, but only because that option is not a course of action that the Government has a constitutional right to avoid.  The Twenty-first Amendment is binding on the Government, like everyone else, and empowers North Dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the State be purchased from a licensed in-state wholesaler.  Since letting the Government choose between purchasing label-free bottles from such wholesalers and purchasing labeled bottles from out-of-state distillers provides the Government with greater, rather than lesser, prerogatives than those enjoyed by other liquor retailers, the labeling requirement does not discriminate against the United States, and thus does not violate any federal immunity.  Pp.  495 U. S. 444-448.
Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice KENNEDY, agreed that North Dakota's reporting regulation is lawful.  Pp.  495 U. S. 448,  495 U. S. 465, n.10.
STEVENS, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and WHITE and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.  SCALIA, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, post, p.  495 U. S. 444.  BRENNAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, in which MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, and KENNEDY, JJ., joined, post, p.  495 U. S. 448.

495 U.S. 472

Syllabus 
Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 permits a taxpayer to claim a charitable contribution deduction only if the contribution is made ""to or for the use of"" a qualified organization.  Petitioner husband and wife, who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Church), claimed such deductions for funds transferred to their sons while they were serving as full-time, unpaid missionaries for the Church.  The Church requested the payments, set their amounts, and, through written guidelines, instructed that they be used exclusively for missionary work.  In accordance with the guidelines, petitioners' sons used the money primarily to pay for rent, food, transportation, and personal needs while on their missions.  When the Internal Revenue Service denied petitioners' claim, they filed suit in the District Court.  The court ruled in favor of the Government, holding that the payments were not ""for the use of "" the Church under  170 because the Church lacked sufficient possession and control of the funds.  The court also rejected petitioners' alternative claim that the payments were deductible under Treas.Reg. 1.170 A-1(g) -- which allows the deduction of ""unreimbursed expenditures made incident to the rendition of services to an organization contributions to which are deductible"" -- on the ground that petitioners were not themselves performing donated services.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. The funds transferred by petitioners to their sons were not donated ""for the use of "" the Church within the meaning of  170.  Pp.  495 U. S. 478-486.
(a) In choosing the phrase ""for the use of,"" Congress was most likely referring to donations made to a legally enforceable trust or a similar legal arrangement.  Although, on its face, the quoted phrase could support any number of meanings, the history of the statute indicates that Congress added the phrase to  170 in 1921 for the purpose of overruling the Government's prior interpretation that a gift to a trust for a charitable purpose was not deductible.  Construing the phrase as referring to a trust or similar arrangement comports with the accepted meaning in 1921 of ""use"" as synonymous with the term ""trust.""  Pp.  495 U. S. 479-482.
(b) Thus, the Service's contemporaneous and longstanding interpretation that the phrase ""for the use of"" is intended to convey a similar 
Page 495 U. S. 473
 meaning as ""in trust for"" is consistent with the statutory language, fully implements Congress' apparent purpose in adopting it, and must be accepted.  Pp.  495 U. S. 482-484.
(c) There is no evidence to support petitioners' contentions that Congress intended the phrase ""for the use of "" to be interpreted as referring to fiduciary relationships in general or as referring to a type of relationship that gives a qualified organization a reasonable ability to supervise the use of contributed funds.  Pp.  495 U. S. 484-485.
(d) The record does not support a finding that petitioners transferred the funds to their sons ""in trust for,"" or through a similarly enforceable legal arrangement for the benefit of, the Church.  There is no evidence that petitioners took any steps normally associated with creating a trust or similar legal arrangement; that the sons had any legal obligation to comply with their promise to use the money in accordance with the Church's guidelines; or that the Church might have a legal entitlement to the money or to a civil cause of action against missionaries using such money for purposes not approved by the Church.  Pp.  495 U. S. 485-486.
2. The transfer of funds by petitioners to their sons was not a contribution ""to"" the Church under Treas.Reg. 1.170 A-1(g).

No. 89-333
Argued March 20, 1990
Decided May 21, 1990
495 U.S. 490

Syllabus 
Pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA), respondent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a license authorizing the operation in California of a hydroelectric project, which draws, and releases a mile later, water from Rock Creek to drive its generators.  After considering the project's economic feasibility and environmental consequences, FERC set an interim ""minimum flow rate"" of water that must remain in the bypassed section of the stream and thus remains unavailable to drive the generators.  The State Water Resources Control Board (WRCB) issued a state water permit that conformed to FERC's interim minimum requirements, but reserved the right to set different permanent ones.  When WRCB later considered a draft order requiring permanent minimum flow rates well in excess of the FERC rates, the licensee petitioned FERC for a declaration that FERC possessed exclusive jurisdiction to determine the project's minimum flow rates.  FERC ordered the licensee to comply with the federal permit's rates, concluding that the task of setting such rates rested within its exclusive jurisdiction.  It reasoned that setting the rates was integral to its planning and licensing process under the FPA, and that giving effect to competing state requirements would interfere with its balancing of competing considerations in licensing and would vest in States a veto power over federal projects inconsistent with the FPA, as interpreted in First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative v. FPC, 328 U. S. 152.  WRCB adopted the higher flow requirements and intervened seeking a rehearing of FERC's order.  FERC denied the request, concluded that the State sought to impose conflicting license requirements, and reaffirmed its conclusion that it had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rates.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that FPA  27 -- which saves from supersedure state
""laws . . . relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein""
-- as construed in First Iowa, did not preserve the State's right to regulate minimum flow rates, and that the FPA preempted WRCB's minimum flow rate requirements. 
Page 495 U. S. 491

Held:  The California requirements for minimum stream flows cannot be given effect and allowed to supplement the federal flow requirements.  Pp.  495 U. S. 496-507.
(a) Were the meaning of  27 and the preemptive effect of the FPA matters of first impression, the State's argument that the stream flow requirement might relate to a use encompassed by  27 -- the generation of power or protection of fish -- could be said to present a close question.  However, First Iowa has previously construed  27, holding that it is limited to laws relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water in irrigation or for municipal or other uses of the same nature, and has primary, if not exclusive, reference to such proprietary rights.  Such rights are not implicated in the instant case.  California's request that First Iowa's interpretation be repudiated misconceives the deference the Court must accord to longstanding and well-entrenched decisions, especially those interpreting statutes that underlie complex regulatory regimes.  There has been no sufficient intervening change in the law, or indication that First Iowa has proved unworkable or has fostered confusion and inconsistency in the law, that warrants a departure from established precedent.  First Iowa's limited reading of  27 has been endorsed, see FPC v. Oregon, 349 U. S. 435, and the decision has been employed with approval in a range of cases.  In addition, Congress has amended the FPA to elaborate and reaffirm First Iowa's understanding that the FPA establishes a broad and paramount federal regulatory role.  Pp.  495 U. S. 496-500.
(b) First Iowa's narrow reading of  27 was not dictum, but was necessary for and integral to the Court's conclusion that FPA  9(b) -- which governs submission to the federal licensing agency of evidence of compliance with state law -- did not require licensees to obtain a state permit or to demonstrate compliance with the state law prerequisites to obtaining such a permit, but rather merely authorized the federal agency to require evidence of actions consistent with the federal permit.  A broad interpretation of  27 would have ""saved"" the state licensing requirements and would have created concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal authorities over the same subject matter.  Pp.  495 U. S. 500-503.
(c) Although California v. United States, 438 U. S. 645, construed  8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 -- which is similar to, and served as a model for, FPA  27 -- in a manner more generous to the States' regulatory powers than was First Iowa's reading of  27, it bears quite indirectly, at best, upon the FPA's interpretation.  In interpreting the Reclamation Act, the Court did not advert to or purport to interpret the FPA, and held simply that  8 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state laws governing the use of water employed in federal reclamation projects.  The purpose, structure, and legislative history of 
Page 495 U. S. 492
 the two statutes show that the FPA envisioned a considerably broader and more active federal oversight role in hydropower development than did the Reclamation Act.  Even if the two savings clauses were properly viewed in isolation from the remainder of their respective Acts,  8 explicitly directs that the Secretary ""shall proceed in conformity with such [state] laws,"" language which has no counterpart in  27 and which was crucial to the Court's interpretation of  8.  Pp.  495 U. S. 503-505.
(d) Section 27's legislative history does not require abandonment of First Iowa's interpretation, because a quite natural reading of the statutory language has failed to displace an intervening decision providing a contrary interpretation; because First Iowa expressly considered the history and found it to support the Court's interpretation of the FPA and  27; because it is only tangentially related to the issue at hand; and because strong interests support adherence to First Iowa.  Pp.  495 U. S. 505-506.
(e) The FPA and the federal license conditions established pursuant to the Act preempt the California stream flow requirements.  The State's requirements conflict with FERC's licensing authority and with the balance struck by the federal license condition.  Pp.  495 U. S. 506-507.

|495 u.s. 328|"Atlantic Richfield Company v. USA Petroleum Company
No. 88-1668
Argued Dec. 4, 1989
Decided May 14, 1990
495 U.S. 328

Syllabus 
Petitioner Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), an integrated oil company, increased its retail gasoline sales and market share by encouraging its dealers to match the prices of independents such as respondent USA Petroleum Company, which competes directly with the dealers at the retail level.  When USA's sales dropped, it sued ARCO in the District Court, charging, inter alia, that the vertical, maximum price-fixing scheme constituted a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The court granted summary judgment to ARCO, holding that USA could not satisfy the ""antitrust injury"" requirement for purposes of a private damages suit under  4 of the Clayton Act because it was unable to show that ARCO's prices were predatory.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that injuries resulting from vertical, nonpredatory, maximum price-fixing agreements could constitute ""antitrust injury.""  Reasoning that any form of price-fixing contravenes Congress' intent that market forces alone determine what goods and services are offered, their prices, and whether particular sellers succeed or fail, the court concluded that USA had shown that its losses resulted from a disruption in the market caused by ARCO's price-fixing.
Held:
1. Actionable ""antitrust injury"" is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent, and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.  Injury, although causally related to an antitrust violation, will not qualify unless it is attributable to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny, since it is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from continued competition.  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104,  479 U. S. 109-110.  P.  495 U. S. 334.
2. A vertical, maximum price-fixing conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act must result in predatory pricing to cause a competitor antitrust injury.  Pp.  495 U. S. 335-341.
(a) As a competitor, USA has not suffered ""antitrust injury,"" since its losses do not flow from the harmful effects on dealers and consumers that rendered vertical, maximum price-fixing per se illegal in Albrecht v. Herold Co., 390 U. S. 145.  USA was benefitted, rather than harmed, if ARCO's pricing policies restricted ARCO's sales to a few large dealers 
Page 495 U. S. 329
 or prevented its dealers from offering services desired by consumers.  Even if the maximum price agreement acquired all of the attributes of a minimum price-fixing scheme, USA still would not have suffered antitrust injury, because higher ARCO prices would have worked to USA's advantage.  Pp.  495 U. S. 335-337.
(b) USA's argument that, even if it was not harmed by any of the Albrecht anticompetitive effects, its lost business caused by ARCO's agreement lowering prices to above predatory levels constitutes antitrust injury is rejected, since cutting prices to increase business is often the essence of competition.  Pp.  495 U. S. 337-338.
(c) It is not inappropriate to require a showing of predatory pricing before antitrust injury can be established in a case under  1 of the Sherman Act.  Although under  1 the price agreement itself is illegal, all losses flowing from the agreement are not, by definition, antitrust injuries.  Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how they are set.  So long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition and, hence, cannot give rise to antitrust injury.  Pp.  495 U. S. 338-341.
3. A loss flowing from a per se violation of  1 does not automatically satisfy the antitrust injury requirement, which is a distinct matter that must be shown independently.  The purpose of per se analysis is to determine whether a particular restraint is unreasonable.  Actions per se unlawful may nonetheless have some procompetitive effects, and private parties might suffer losses therefrom.  The antitrust injury requirement, however, ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior.  Pp.  495 U.

			"|"Atlantic Richfield Company v. USA Petroleum Company
No. 88-1668
Argued Dec. 4, 1989
Decided May 14, 1990
495 U.S. 328

Syllabus 
Petitioner Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), an integrated oil company, increased its retail gasoline sales and market share by encouraging its dealers to match the prices of independents such as respondent USA Petroleum Company, which competes directly with the dealers at the retail level.  When USA's sales dropped, it sued ARCO in the District Court, charging, inter alia, that the vertical, maximum price-fixing scheme constituted a conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act.  The court granted summary judgment to ARCO, holding that USA could not satisfy the ""antitrust injury"" requirement for purposes of a private damages suit under  4 of the Clayton Act because it was unable to show that ARCO's prices were predatory.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that injuries resulting from vertical, nonpredatory, maximum price-fixing agreements could constitute ""antitrust injury.""  Reasoning that any form of price-fixing contravenes Congress' intent that market forces alone determine what goods and services are offered, their prices, and whether particular sellers succeed or fail, the court concluded that USA had shown that its losses resulted from a disruption in the market caused by ARCO's price-fixing.
Held:
1. Actionable ""antitrust injury"" is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent, and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.  Injury, although causally related to an antitrust violation, will not qualify unless it is attributable to an anticompetitive aspect of the practice under scrutiny, since it is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from continued competition.  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U. S. 104,  479 U. S. 109-110.  P.  495 U. S. 334.
2. A vertical, maximum price-fixing conspiracy in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act must result in predatory pricing to cause a competitor antitrust injury.  Pp.  495 U. S. 335-341.
(a) As a competitor, USA has not suffered ""antitrust injury,"" since its losses do not flow from the harmful effects on dealers and consumers that rendered vertical, maximum price-fixing per se illegal in Albrecht v. Herold Co., 390 U. S. 145.  USA was benefitted, rather than harmed, if ARCO's pricing policies restricted ARCO's sales to a few large dealers 
Page 495 U. S. 329
 or prevented its dealers from offering services desired by consumers.  Even if the maximum price agreement acquired all of the attributes of a minimum price-fixing scheme, USA still would not have suffered antitrust injury, because higher ARCO prices would have worked to USA's advantage.  Pp.  495 U. S. 335-337.
(b) USA's argument that, even if it was not harmed by any of the Albrecht anticompetitive effects, its lost business caused by ARCO's agreement lowering prices to above predatory levels constitutes antitrust injury is rejected, since cutting prices to increase business is often the essence of competition.  Pp.  495 U. S. 337-338.
(c) It is not inappropriate to require a showing of predatory pricing before antitrust injury can be established in a case under  1 of the Sherman Act.  Although under  1 the price agreement itself is illegal, all losses flowing from the agreement are not, by definition, antitrust injuries.  Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how they are set.  So long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition and, hence, cannot give rise to antitrust injury.  Pp.  495 U. S. 338-341.
3. A loss flowing from a per se violation of  1 does not automatically satisfy the antitrust injury requirement, which is a distinct matter that must be shown independently.  The purpose of per se analysis is to determine whether a particular restraint is unreasonable.  Actions per se unlawful may nonetheless have some procompetitive effects, and private parties might suffer losses therefrom.  The antitrust injury requirement, however, ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior.  Pp.  495 U. S. 341-345.
4. Providing competitors with a private cause of action to enforce the rule against vertical, maximum price-fixing would not protect the rights of dealers and consumers -- the class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate Albrecht's anticompetitive consequences -- under the antitrust laws.  USA's injury is not inextricably intertwined with a dealer's antitrust injury, since a competitor has no incentive to vindicate the legitimate interests of a rival's dealer, and will be injured and motivated to sue only when the arrangement has a procompetitive impact on the market.

Argued March 26, 1990

495 U.S. 362

Syllabus 
Respondents, deceased miners' survivors, filed a state law wrongful death action in Idaho state court against petitioner Union, the miners' exclusive bargaining agent, alleging that the miners' deaths in an underground fire were proximately caused by the Union's fraudulent and negligent acts in connection with mine safety inspections conducted by its representatives pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement with the mine's operator.  On remand from a State Supreme Court decision that the claims were not preempted by federal labor law, the trial court granted summary judgment for the Union.  It found that the record was devoid of evidence supporting the fraud claim, and urged the State Supreme Court to reconsider its decision that the negligence claim was not preempted.  The State Supreme Court upheld the trial court's summary judgment on the fraud claim, but again concluded that respondents' negligence claim was not preempted.  Distinguishing this Court's decision in Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 -- which held that a state law tort action against an employer may be preempted by  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, if the duty to the employee that was violated by the tort is created by a collective bargaining agreement and without existence independent of the agreement -- the court found that the instant agreement's provisions did ""not require interpretation, . . . but rather . . . determine[d] only the nature and scope of the Union's duty.""  This Court vacated the State Supreme Court's judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Electrical Workers v. Hechler, 481 U. S. 851, which extended Allis-Chalmers to a tort suit by an employee against her union.  On remand, the State Supreme Court distinguished Hechler on the ground that, there, the alleged duty of care arose from the collective bargaining agreement, whereas, here, the Union's duty to perform the inspection reasonably arose from the fact of the inspection itself rather than the fact that the provision for the Union's participation in the inspection was contained in the labor contract.  Since it was conceded that the Union undertook to inspect, the court noted, the sole issue was whether that inspection was negligent under state tort law. 
Page 495 U. S. 363

Held:
1. Respondents' tort claim is preempted by  301.  The claim cannot be described as independent of the collective bargaining agreement, since the Union's representatives were participating in the inspection process pursuant to that agreement's provisions.  Thus, if the Union failed to perform a duty in connection with the inspection, it was a duty arising out of the agreement signed by the Union as the miners' bargaining agent, not a duty of reasonable care owed to every person in society.  Preemption by federal law cannot be avoided by characterizing the Union's negligence as a state law tort.  Pp.  495 U. S. 368-372.
2. Respondents may not maintain a  301 suit against the Union.  Pp.  495 U. S. 372-376.
(a) Mere negligence, even in the enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement, does not state a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation, which is a purposely limited check on the arbitrary exercise of union power.  While a union may assume a responsibility toward employees by accepting a duty of care through a collective bargaining agreement, Hechler, supra, at  481 U. S. 860, if an employee claims that a union owes him a more far-reaching duty, he must be able to point to language in the agreement specifically indicating an intent to create obligations enforceable against the union by the individual employees.  Nothing in the agreement at issue suggests that it creates such obligations, since the pertinent part of the agreement consists of agreements between the Union and the employer, and is enforceable only by them.  Pp.  495 U. S. 372-375.
(b) Moreover, under traditional principles of contract interpretation, respondents have no claim, for, as third-party beneficiaries, they have no greater rights in the agreement than does the promisee, the employer.  Here, the employer has no enforceable right as promisee.  The agreement provisions respondents rely on are not promises made by the Union to the employer.  Rather, the limited surrender of the employer's exclusive authority over mine safety is a concession made by the employer to the Union.  P.  495 U. S. 375.
(c) Although respondents' claim that the Union had committed fraud on the membership in violation of state law might implicate the duty of fair representation, respondents did not cross-petition for review of the State Supreme Court's holding that summary judgment was properly entered on this claim.

No. A-795
Decided May 11, 1990
495 U.S. 320

Syllabus 
After respondent Stokes was convicted and sentenced to death in Missouri, he filed three unsuccessful habeas corpus petitions in the federal courts.  A few days before his scheduled execution, he filed an application for stay of execution pending consideration of a fourth habeas petition.  The District Court found that the imposition of a stay was warranted by the issues raised in his claim that the state courts had selectively applied the rules governing lesser included offense instructions in capital murder cases in violation of his right to equal protection.  The Court of Appeals denied the State's motion to vacate the stay.
Held:  The District Court abused its discretion in granting the stay.  A stay of execution pending disposition of a second or successive federal habeas petition can be granted only when there are substantial grounds upon which relief can be granted.  Here, there are no such grounds, because Stokes' fourth petition clearly constitutes an abuse of the writ.  His claim could have been raised in his first petition for federal habeas, and the principles he asserts are not novel and could have been developed long before this application.
Motion granted.

No. 89-61
Argued Feb. 28, 1990
Decided April 30, 1990
495 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
During a criminal investigation, the Government secured a series of court orders authorizing electronic surveillance of respondents, as mandated by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.  2510 et seq.  Section 2518(8)(a) requires, in pertinent part, that:  (1) recording ""shall be done in such way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations""; (2) ""[i]mmediately upon the expiration of the period of the order, or extensions thereof,"" the recordings are to be made available to the judge who issued the order and sealed under his directions; and (3) ""[t]he presence of the seal . . . or a satisfactory explanation"" for its absence is a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the evidence obtained from the recordings.  Among the orders obtained was an April 27, 1984, order for the surveillance of respondent Ojeda Rios' Levittown, Puerto Rico, residence and some nearby public telephones, which was extended until July 23 when he moved to another community.  On July 27, the Government obtained a new order covering his new home, which, with extensions, expired on September 24.  On October 13, three days after the expiration of an order authorizing surveillance of Ojeda Rios' car, all of the Ojeda Rios tapes were sealed.  The Government also obtained an order authorizing it to wiretap two public telephones in Vega Baja, effective January 18, 1985, but that order expired on February 17.  A new order, issued on March 1, expired on May 30, and the Vega Baja tapes were sealed on June 15.  After they were indicted for various offenses, respondents moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of, inter alia, these wiretaps.  The District Court suppressed the Levittown and Vega Baja tapes based solely on a delay in their sealing.  The court found that the July 27 order authorizing the wiretap of Ojeda Rios' new residence was not an extension of the Levittown order, and therefore there was at least an 82-day delay -- starting July 23 -- in sealing the Levittown tapes.  Similarly, the March 1 Vega Baja order could not be considered an extension of the January 18 order, because of the delay in seeking the extension and the Government's failure to satisfactorily explain the delay.  Thus, there was a 118-day delay in the sealing of those tapes.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 495 U. S. 258

Held:
1. Section 2518(8)(a) applies to a delay in sealing, as well as to a complete failure to seal tapes.  Its primary thrust is to insure the reliability and integrity of evidence obtained by means of electronic surveillance, and the sealing requirement is important precisely because it limits the Government's opportunity to alter the recordings.  The narrow reading suggested by the Government -- that, since tapes must either bear a seal or the Government must provide a ""satisfactory explanation"" for the seal's ""absence,"" the ""satisfactory explanation"" requirement does not apply where the tapes actually bear a seal, regardless of when or why the seal was applied -- is not a plausible interpretation of congressional intent, since  2518(8)(a) requires not just any seal, but one that has been obtained immediately upon expiration of the underlying surveillance order.  The Government's view would create the anomalous result that the prosecution could delay requesting a seal for months without risking a substantial penalty.  Pp.  495 U. S. 262-264.
2. The ""satisfactory explanation"" language requires that the Government explain not only why a delay occurred but also why it is excusable.  The Government's submission -- that the requirement is satisfied if it first explains why the delay occurred and then demonstrates that the tapes are authentic -- would nullify the requirement's function as a safeguard against tampering, and is foreclosed by the provision's plain words.  The fact that the Government has an incentive to seal tapes immediately to avoid lengthy pretrial suppression hearings is no more than a statement that only rarely would there be a delay, and does not answer the issue posed where there is a delay that is not satisfactorily explained.  Moreover, the argument is suspect, since early sealing does not foreclose a challenge to authenticity, which would also require lengthy proceedings.  Pp.  495 U. S. 264-265.
3. This case is remanded for a determination whether the Government's explanation to the District Court substantially corresponds to the one it now advances:  that the delays were the result of a good faith, objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the statutory term ""extension,"" based on the supervising attorney's interpretation of two Circuit cases which he believed indicated that the Government was not required to seek sealing until there was a meaningful hiatus in the investigation as a whole.  Those cases support the conclusion that this theory was an objectively reasonable, although incorrect, interpretation of the law at the time of the delays, and to the extent that the Court of Appeals required the Government to prove that its interpretation of the law was absolutely correct, it held the Government to too strict a standard.  Nonetheless, the explanation is not ""satisfactory"" within the meaning of the statute unless it was actually advanced at the suppression hearing to explain 
Page 495 U. S. 259
 the delays, a question not addressed by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  495 U. S. 265-267.

The Government also obtained an order authorizing it to wiretap two public telephones in Vega Baja, effective January 18, 1985, but that order expired on February 17.  A new order, issued on March 1, expired on May 30, and the Vega Baja tapes were sealed on June 15.  After they were indicted for various offenses, respondents moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of, inter alia, these wiretaps.  The District Court suppressed the Levittown and Vega Baja tapes based solely on a delay in their sealing.  The court found that the July 27 order authorizing the wiretap of Ojeda Rios' new residence was not an extension of the Levittown order, and therefore there was at least an 82-day delay -- starting July 23 -- in sealing the Levittown tapes.  Similarly, the March 1 Vega Baja order could not be considered an extension of the January 18 order, because of the delay in seeking the extension and the Government's failure to satisfactorily explain the delay.  Thus, there was a 118-day delay in the sealing of those tapes.  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
Page 495 U. S. 258

Held:
1. Section 2518(8)(a) applies to a delay in sealing, as well as to a complete failure to seal tapes.  Its primary thrust is to insure the reliability and integrity of evidence obtained by means of electronic surveillance, and the sealing requirement is important precisely because it limits the Government's opportunity to alter the recordings.  The narrow reading suggested by the Government -- that, since tapes must either bear a seal or the Government must provide a ""satisfactory explanation"" for the seal's ""absence,"" the ""satisfactory explanation"" requirement does not apply where the tapes actually bear a seal, regardless of when or why the seal was applied -- is not a plausible interpretation of congressional intent, since  2518(8)(a) requires not just any seal, but one that has been obtained immediately upon expiration of the underlying surveillance order.  The Government's view would create the anomalous result that the prosecution could delay requesting a seal for months without risking a substantial penalty.  Pp.  495 U. S. 262-264.
2. The ""satisfactory explanation"" language requires that the Government explain not only why a delay occurred but also why it is excusable.  The Government's submission -- that the requirement is satisfied if it first explains why the delay occurred and then demonstrates that the tapes are authentic -- would nullify the requirement's function as a safeguard against tampering, and is foreclosed by the provision's plain words.  The fact that the Government has an incentive to seal tapes immediately to avoid lengthy pretrial suppression hearings is no more than a statement that only rarely would there be a delay, and does not answer the issue posed where there is a delay that is not satisfactorily explained.  Moreover, the argument is suspect, since early sealing does not foreclose a challenge to authenticity, which would also require lengthy proceedings.  Pp.  495 U. S. 264-265.
3. This case is remanded for a determination whether the Government's explanation to the District Court substantially corresponds to the one it now advances:  that the delays were the result of a good faith, objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the statutory term ""extension,"" based on the supervising attorney's interpretation of two Circuit cases which he believed indicated that the Government was not required to seek sealing until there was a meaningful hiatus in the investigation as a whole.  Those cases support the conclusion that this theory was an objectively reasonable, although incorrect, interpretation of the law at the time of the delays, and to the extent that the Court of Appeals required the Government to prove that its interpretation of the law was absolutely correct, it held the Government to too strict a standard.  Nonetheless, the explanation is not ""satisfactory"" within the meaning of the statute unless it was actually advanced at the suppression hearing to explain 
Page 495 U. S. 259
 the delays, a question not addressed by the Court of Appeals.  Pp.  495 U. S. 265-267.

495 U.S. 271

Syllabus 
Shortly after respondent American Stores Co., the fourth largest supermarket chain in California, acquired all of the outstanding stock of the largest chain, the State filed suit in the District Court alleging, inter alia, that the merger constituted an anticompetitive acquisition violative of  7 of the Clayton Act, and would harm consumers throughout the State.  The court granted the State a preliminary injunction requiring American to operate the acquired stores separately pending resolution of the suit.  Although agreeing that the State had proved a likelihood of success on the merits and the probability of irreparable harm, the Court of Appeals set aside the injunction on the ground that the relief granted exceeded the District Court's authority under  16 of the Act to order ""injunctive relief.""  The court relied on an earlier decision in which it had concluded, on the basis of its reading of excerpts from subcommittee hearings, that  16's draftsmen did not intend to authorize the remedies of ""dissolution"" or ""divestiture"" in private litigants' actions.  Thus, held the court, the ""indirect divestiture"" effected by the preliminary injunction was impermissible.
Held:  Divestiture is a form of ""injunctive relief"" authorized by  16.  Pp.  495 U. S. 278-296.
(a) The plain text of  16 -- which entitles
""[a]ny person . . . to . . . have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage . . . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity""
-- authorizes divestiture decrees to remedy  7 violations.  On its face, the simple grant of authority to ""have injunctive relief"" would seem to encompass that remedy just as plainly as the comparable language in  15 of the Act, which authorizes the district courts to ""prevent and restrain violations"" in antitrust actions brought by the United States, and under which divestiture is the preferred remedy for illegal mergers.  Moreover,  16 states no restrictions or exceptions to the forms of injunctive relief a private plaintiff may seek or a court may order, but, rather, evidences Congress' intent that traditional equitable principles govern the grant of such relief.  The section's ""threatened loss or damage"" phrase does not negate the court's power to order divestiture.  Assuming, as did the lower courts, that the merger in question violated the 
Page 495 U. S. 272
 antitrust laws, and that the conduct of the merged enterprise threatens economic harm to consumers, such relief would prohibit that conduct from causing that harm.  Nor does the section's ""threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage"" phrase limit the court's power to the granting of relief against anticompetitive ""conduct,"" as opposed to ""structural relief,"" or to the issuance of prohibitory, rather than mandatory, injunctions.  That phrase is simply a part of the general reference to the standards that should be applied in fashioning injunctive relief.  Section 16, construed to authorize a private divestiture remedy, fits well in a statutory scheme that favors private enforcement, subjects mergers to searching scrutiny, and regards divestiture as the remedy best suited to redress the ills of an anticompetitive merger.  Pp.  495 U. S. 278-285.
(b) The legislative history does not require that  16 be construed narrowly.  American's reliance on the subcommittee hearing excerpts cited by the Court of Appeals and on Graves v. Cambria Steel Co., 298 F. 761 (1924) -- each of which contains statements indicating that private suits for dissolution do not lie under  16 -- is misplaced.  At the time of the Act's framing, dissolution was a vague and ill-defined concept that encompassed the drastic remedy of corporate termination as well as divestiture.  Thus, the fact that Congress may have excluded the more severe sanction does not imply that the equitable formulation of  16 cannot permit divestiture.  Since the inferences that American draws simply are not confirmed by anything else in the legislative history or contemporaneous judicial interpretation,  16 must be taken at its word when it endorses the ""conditions and principles"" governing injunctive relief in equity courts.  There being nothing in the section that restricts, courts' equitable jurisdiction, the provision should be construed generously and flexibly to enable a chancellor to impose the most effective, usual, and straightforward remedy to rescind an unlawful stock purchase.  Pp.  495 U. S. 285-295.
(c) Simply because a district court has the power to order divestiture in appropriate  16 cases does not mean that it should do so in every situation in which the Government would be entitled to such relief under  15.  A private litigant must establish standing by proving ""threatened loss or damage"" to his own interests, and his suit may be barred by equitable defenses such as laches or ""unclean hands.""

Syllabus 
Petitioner Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. (PATH) is an entity created by New York and New Jersey to operate certain transportation facilities.  Alleging that they incurred injuries during their employment. with PATH, respondents filed separate complaints against PATH in the District Court to recover damages pursuant to the Federal Employers' Liability Act.  The court dismissed the complaints on the ground that PATH enjoyed the States' sovereign immunity, and thus that the Eleventh Amendment deprived the court of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals reversed in both cases, holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the suits because, inter alia, any immunity that PATH possessed had been waived under identical statutes of both States, which provided that the States ""consent to suits . . . against [PATH],"" and that
""[t]he foregoing consent is granted upon the condition that venue in any [such] suit . . . shall be laid within a . . . judicial district, established by . . . the United States.""
Held:  The statutory consent to suit provision, as elucidated by the venue provision, establishes the States' waiver of any Eleventh Amendment immunity that might otherwise bar respondents' suits against PATH.  It is appropriate here to assume arguendo that PATH is a state agency entitled to the States' sovereign immunity.  Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, 359 U. S. 275,  359 U. S. 279.  In determining whether a State has waived such immunity, this Court applies a particularly strict standard:  a waiver will be given effect
""only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.""
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234,  473 U. S. 239-240.  Moreover, a State does not waive its immunity by consenting to suit only in its own courts, but must specify its intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.  Id. at  473 U. S. 241.  Here, the statutory venue provision suffices to resolve any ambiguity contained in the general consent to suit provision by expressly indicating that the States' consent extends to suit in federal court.  PATH's argument 
Page 495 U. S. 300
 that the venue provision cannot control the construction of the consent to suit provision is rejected.  The venue provision directly indicates the extent of the States' waiver embodied in the consent provision, because the States passed both provisions as portions of the same Acts; because the venue provision expressly refers to and qualifies the consent provision; and because venue issues are closely related to immunity issues in that a State's constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued.  PATH's related argument that the venue provision cannot broaden the consent provision begs the question what the States intended through the latter provision.  The venue provision elucidates rather than broadens the consent provision's meaning by removing an ambiguity:  the venue provision would hardly qualify ""[t]he foregoing consent"" unless the States intended that consent to include federal court suits.  Furthermore, PATH suggests no ""reasonable construction"" as an alternative to the interpretation that the phrase, ""judicial district, established . . . by the United States,"" sets forth consent to suit in federal court.

No. 88-7146
Argued Jan. 10, 1990
Decided April 24, 1990
495 U.S. 149

Syllabus 
After his trial on multiple murder charges, Ronald Simmons waived his right to direct appeal of his conviction and death sentence.  The trial court conducted a hearing and determined that Simmons was competent to waive further proceedings.  Pursuant to its rule that Arkansas law does not require a mandatory appeal in all death penalty cases, but that a defendant can forgo his direct appeal only if he has been judicially determined to have the capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to knowingly and intelligently waive any and all rights to appeal his sentence, the State Supreme Court reviewed the competency determination and affirmed the trial court's decision that Simmons had knowingly and intelligently waived the right to appeal.  The court then denied the motion of petitioner Whitmore -- a death row inmate convicted in a robbery-murder case, who had exhausted his direct appellate review, been denied state post-conviction relief, and not yet sought federal habeas corpus relief -- to intervene in the proceeding both individually and as Simmons' ""next friend,"" concluding that Whitmore lacked standing.  This Court granted Whitmore's petition for certiorari on the questions whether a third party has standing to challenge the validity of a death sentence imposed on a capital defendant who has elected to forgo his right of appeal, and whether the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the State from carrying out a death sentence without first conducting a mandatory appellate review of the conviction and sentence.
Held:  Whitmore lacks standing to proceed in this Court.  Pp.  495 U. S. 154-166.
(a) Before a federal court can consider the merits of a legal claim, the person seeking to invoke the court's jurisdiction must establish the requisite standing to sue.  To do so, he must prove the existence of an Art. III case or controversy by clearly demonstrating that he has suffered an ""injury in fact,"" which is concrete in both a qualitative and temporal sense.  He must show that the injury ""fairly can be traced to the challenged action,"" and ""is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.""  Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U. S. 26,  426 U. S. 38,  426 U. S. 41.  Pp.  495 U. S. 154-156.
(b) Whitmore does not have standing in his individual capacity based on a legal right to a system of mandatory appellate review assertedly granted to him personally and to Simmons by the Eighth Amendment. 
Page 495 U. S. 150
  His principal claim of injury in fact -- that if he obtains federal habeas relief but is convicted and resentenced to death in a new trial, then, in light of Arkansas' comparative review in death penalty cases, he has a direct and substantial interest in having the data base against which his crime is compared to be complete and to not be arbitrarily skewed by the omission of Simmons' heinous crimes -- is too speculative to invoke Art. III jurisdiction.  Even assuming that Whitmore would eventually secure habeas relief and be convicted and resentenced to death, there is no factual basis on which to conclude that the sentence imposed on a mass murderer would be relevant to a future comparative review of his robbery-murder sentence.  His theory is at least as speculative as other allegations of possible future injury that have been found insufficient to establish Art. III injury-in-fact.  See, e.g., O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488.  United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669, distinguished.  Whitmore's further contention that, as an Arkansas citizen, he is entitled to the Eighth Amendment's public interest protections and has a right to invoke this Court's jurisdiction to insure that the State does not carry out an execution without mandatory appellate review raises only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance, and is an inadequate basis on which to grant him standing.  Nor does the uniqueness of the death penalty and society's interest in its proper imposition justify creating an exception to traditional standing doctrine, since the requirement of an Art. III case or controversy is not merely a traditional ""rule of practice,"" but rather is imposed directly by the Constitution.  Pp.  495 U. S. 156-161.
(c) Whitmore's alternative argument that he has standing as Simmons' ""next friend"" is also rejected.  The scope of any federal ""next friend"" standing doctrine, assuming that one exists absent congressional authorization, is no broader than the ""next friend"" standing permitted under the federal habeas corpus statute.  Thus, one necessary condition is a showing by the proposed ""next friend"" that the real party in interest is unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity, lack of access to court, or other similar disability.  That prerequisite is not satisfied where, as here, an evidentiary hearing shows that the defendant has given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed, and his access to court is otherwise unimpeded.  Pp.  495 U. S. 161-166.

  His principal claim of injury in fact -- that if he obtains federal habeas relief but is convicted and resentenced to death in a new trial, then, in light of Arkansas' comparative review in death penalty cases, he has a direct and substantial interest in having the data base against which his crime is compared to be complete and to not be arbitrarily skewed by the omission of Simmons' heinous crimes -- is too speculative to invoke Art. III jurisdiction.  Even assuming that Whitmore would eventually secure habeas relief and be convicted and resentenced to death, there is no factual basis on which to conclude that the sentence imposed on a mass murderer would be relevant to a future comparative review of his robbery-murder sentence.  His theory is at least as speculative as other allegations of possible future injury that have been found insufficient to establish Art. III injury-in-fact.  See, e.g., O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488.  United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669, distinguished.  Whitmore's further contention that, as an Arkansas citizen, he is entitled to the Eighth Amendment's public interest protections and has a right to invoke this Court's jurisdiction to insure that the State does not carry out an execution without mandatory appellate review raises only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance, and is an inadequate basis on which to grant him standing.  Nor does the uniqueness of the death penalty and society's interest in its proper imposition justify creating an exception to traditional standing doctrine, since the requirement of an Art. III case or controversy is not merely a traditional ""rule of practice,"" but rather is imposed directly by the Constitution.  Pp.  495 U. S. 156-161.
(c) Whitmore's alternative argument that he has standing as Simmons' ""next friend"" is also rejected.  The scope of any federal ""next friend"" standing doctrine, assuming that one exists absent congressional authorization, is no broader than the ""next friend"" standing permitted under the federal habeas corpus statute.  Thus, one necessary condition is a showing by the proposed ""next friend"" that the real party in interest is unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity, lack of access to court, or other similar disability.  That prerequisite is not satisfied where, as here, an evidentiary hearing shows that the defendant has given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed, and his access to court is otherwise unimpeded.  Pp.  495 U. S. 161-166.

Syllabus 
Petitioners filed suit in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against respondents -- the Guam Government, the Guam Police Department and its Director in her official capacity, and various police officers in their official and individual capacities -- alleging that petitioners were arrested and assaulted by the officers and forced to write and sign confessions.  The District Court dismissed the claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal with respect to the Government, the Police Department, and the individual defendants in their official capacities.  Analogizing the Government of Guam to an administrative agency, the court ruled that Guam and the Police Department are no more than federal instrumentalities, and thus are not ""persons"" within the meaning of  1983, which, in its current version relates to ""[e]very person who [acts] under color of any statute . . . of any State or Territory.""  The court also found that the Guam officials could not be sued in their official capacities, because a judgment against them in such capacities would affect the public treasury and the suit essentially would be one against the Government itself.
Held:  Neither the Territory of Guam nor its officers acting in their official capacities are ""persons"" under  1983.  Pp.  495 U. S. 186-192.
(a) Since  1983's language affords no clue as to whether ""person"" includes a Territory, indicia of congressional intent at the time of enactment must be sought.  Pp.  495 U. S. 186-192.
(b) The omission of Territories from the original version of  1983 shows that Congress did not mean to subject them to liability.  Rather, in 1871, Congress was concerned with Ku Klux Klan activities that were going unpunished in the Southern States and designed  1983's remedy to combat this evil, recognizing the need for original federal court jurisdiction as a means to provide at least indirect federal control over the unconstitutional acts of state officials.  Territorial courts, in contrast, were under the Federal Government's general control, and would not have engendered such immediate concern.  Pp.  495 U. S. 187-189.
(c) The statute's successive enactments, in context, further reveal the lack of any congressional intent to include Territories as persons.  In the 1871 version, persons could not possibly have included Territories, because Territories are not States within the meaning of the Fourteenth 
Page 495 U. S. 183
 Amendment, and could not have been persons acting under color of state law.  Cf. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58,  495 U. S. 64.  This reading is supported by  1983's next enactment in 1874, when Congress first added the phrase ""or Territory,"" thus making it possible for a person acting under color of territorial law to be held liable.  At the same time, however, Congress pointedly redefined the word ""person"" in the ""Dictionary Act"" -- which supplied rules of construction for all legislation -- to exclude Territories.  Pp.  495 U. S. 189-192.
(d) Since Guam is not a person, neither are its officers acting in their official capacity.  P.  495 U. S. 192.

Syllabus 
In 1945, author Cornell Woolrich agreed to assign the motion picture rights to several of his stories, including the one at issue, to petitioners' predecessor in interest.  He also agreed to renew the copyrights in the stories at the appropriate time, and to assign the same motion picture rights to the predecessor in interest for the 28-year renewal term provided by the Copyright Act of 1909.  The film version of the story in question was produced and distributed in 1954.  Woolrich died in 1968 without a surviving spouse or child, and before he could obtain the rights in the renewal term for petitioners as promised.  In 1969, his executor renewed the copyright in the story and assigned the renewal rights to respondent Abend.  Apparently in reliance on Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 551 F.2d 484 (CA2) -- which held that the owner of the copyright in a derivative work may continue to use the existing derivative work according to the original grant from the author of the preexisting work even if the grant of rights in the preexisting work lapsed -- petitioners subsequently rereleased and publicly exhibited the film.  Abend filed suit, alleging, among other things, that the rerelease infringed his copyright in the story because petitioners' right to use the story during the renewal term lapsed when Woolrich died.  The District Court granted petitioners' motions for summary judgment based on Rohauer and the ""fair use"" defense.  The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the reasoning of Rohauer.  Relying on Miller Music Corp. v. Charles N. Daniels, Inc., 362 U. S. 373 -- which held that assignment of renewal rights by an author before the time for renewal arrives cannot defeat the right of the author's statutory successor to the renewal rights if the author dies before the right to renewal accrues -- the court concluded that petitioners received from Woolrich only an expectancy in the renewal rights that never matured, and that his executor, as his statutory successor, was entitled to renew the copyright and to assign it to Abend.  The court also determined that petitioners' use of Woolrich's story in their film was not fair use.
Held:
1. The distribution and publication of a derivative work during the copyright renewal term of a preexisting work incorporated into the derivative 
Page 495 U. S. 208
 work infringes the rights of the owner of the preexisting work where the author of that work agreed to assign the rights in the renewal term to the derivative work's owner, but died before the commencement of the renewal period, and the statutory successor does not assign the right to use the preexisting work to the owner of the derivative work.  Pp.  495 U. S. 216-236.
(a) The renewal provisions of the 1909 and 1976 Copyright Acts, their legislative history, and the case law interpreting them establish that they were intended both to give the author a second chance to obtain fair remuneration for his creative efforts and to provide his family, or his executors, absent surviving family, with a ""new estate"" if he died before the renewal period arrived.  Under Miller Music, although the author may assign all of his exclusive rights in the copyrighted work by assigning the renewal copyright without limitation, the assignee holds nothing if the author dies before commencement of the renewal period.  This being the rule with respect to all of the renewal rights, it follows, a fortiori, that assignees such as petitioners of the right to produce a derivative work or some other portion of the renewal rights also hold nothing but an unfulfilled and unenforceable expectancy if the author dies before the renewal period, unless the assignees secure a transfer of the renewal rights from the author's statutory successor.  Pp.  495 U. S. 216-221.
(b) Petitioners' contention that any right the owner of rights in the preexisting work might have had to sue for infringement that occurs during the renewal term is extinguished by creation of the new work is not supported by any express provision of the Act nor by the rationale as to the scope of protection achieved in a derivative work, and is contrary to the axiomatic principle that a person may exploit only such copyrighted literary material as he either owns or is licensed to use.  Section 7 of the 1909 Act and  103(b) of the 1976 Act made explicit the well settled rule that the owner of a derivative work receives copyright protection only for the material contributed by him, and to the extent he has obtained a grant of rights in the preexisting work.  Pp.  495 U. S. 221-224.
(c) Nor is petitioners' position supported by the termination provisions of the 1976 Act, which, for works existing in their original or renewal terms as of January 1, 1978, empowered the author to gain an additional 19 years' copyright protection by terminating any grant of rights at the end of the renewal term, except, under  304(c)(6)(A), the right to use a derivative work for which the owner of the derivative work has held valid rights in the original and renewal terms.  No overarching policy preventing authors of preexisting works from blocking distribution of derivative works may be inferred from  304(c)(6)(A), which was part of a compromise between competing special interests. 
Page 495 U. S. 209
  In fact, the plain language of the section indicates that Congress assumed that the owner of the preexisting work continued to possess the right to sue for infringement even after incorporation of that work into the derivative work, since, otherwise, Congress would not have explicitly withdrawn the right to terminate use rights in the limited circumstances contemplated by the section.  Pp.  495 U. S. 224-227.
(d) Thus, the Rohauer theory is supported by neither the 1909 nor the 1976 Act.  Even if it were, however, the ""rule"" of that case would make little sense when applied across the derivative works spectrum.  For example, although the contribution by the derivative author of a condensed book might be little as compared. to that of the original author, publication of the book would not infringe the preexisting work under the Rohauer ""rule"" even though the derivative author has no license or grant of rights in the preexisting work.  In fact, the Rohauer ""rule"" is considered to be an interest-balancing approach.  Pp.  495 U. S. 227-228.
(e) Petitioners' contention that the rule applied here will undermine the Copyright Act's policy of ensuring the dissemination of creative works is better addressed by Congress than the courts.  In attempting to fulfill its constitutional mandate to ""secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their Respective Writings,"" Congress has created a balance between the artist's right to control the work during the term of the copyright protection and the public's need for access to creative works.  Absent an explicit statement of congressional intent that the rights in the renewal term of an owner of a preexisting work are extinguished when his work is incorporated into another work, it is not the role of this Court to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.  Pp.  495 U. S. 228-230.
(f) Section 7 of the 1909 Act -- which provides that derivative works when produced with the consent of the copyright proprietor of the preexisting work
""shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright . . . ; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed . . . ,""
or be construed to affect the copyright status of the original work -- does not, as the dissent contends, give the original author the power to sell the rights to make a derivative work that, upon creation and copyright, would be completely independent of the original work.  This assertion is derived from three erroneous premises.  First, since the plain meaning of the ""force or validity"" clause is that the copyright in the ""matter employed"" -- i.e., the preexisting work when it is incorporated into the derivative work -- is not abrogated by publication of the derivative work, the dissent misreads  7 when it asserts that only the copyright in the ""original work"" survives the author's conveyance of derivative rights.  Second, the substitution of ""publication"" for ""copyright"" 
Page 495 U. S. 210
 in the final version of the force or validity clause does not, as the dissent contends, establish that it was the publication of the derivative work, and not the copyright, that was not to ""affect . . . any subsisting copyright.""  Since publication of a work without proper notice sent it into the public domain under the 1909 Act, the language change was necessary to ensure that the publication of a derivative work without proper notice, including smaller portions that had not been previously published and separately copyrighted, would not result in those sections' moving into the public domain.  Third, the dissent errs in interpreting  3 of the 1909 Act -- which provides that a copyright protects all copyrightable component parts of a work and ""all matter therein in which copyright is already subsisting, but without extending the duration or scope of such copyright"" -- as indicating, when read with  7, that the copyright on derivative work extends to both the new material and that ""in which the copyright is already subsisting,"" such that the derivative work proprietor has the right to publish and distribute the entire work absent permission from the owner of the preexisting work.  When  7 states that derivative works ""shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright,"" it simply confirms that  3's provision that one can obtain copyright in a work, parts of which were already copyrighted, extends to derivative works.  More important,  7's second clause merely clarifies what might have been otherwise unclear -- that the  3 principle of preservation of the duration or scope of the subsisting copyright applies to derivative works, and that neither the scope of the copyright in the matter employed nor the duration of the copyright in the derivative work is undermined by publication of the derivative work.  Pp.  495 U. S. 230-236.
2. Petitioners' unauthorized use of Woolrich's story in their film does not constitute a noninfringing ""fair use.""  The film does not fall into any of the categories of fair use enumerated in 17 U.S.C.  107; e.g., criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.  Nor does it meet any of the nonexclusive criteria that  107 requires a court to consider.  First, since petitioners received $12 million from the film's rerelease during the renewal term, their use was commercial, rather than educational.  Second, the nature of the copyrighted work is fictional and creative, rather than factual.  Third, the story was a substantial portion of the film, which expressly used its unique setting, characters, plot, and sequence of events.  Fourth, and most important, the record supports the conclusion that rerelease of the film impinged on Abend's ability to market new versions of the story.  Pp.  495 U. S. 236-238.
863 F.2d 1465 (CA9 1988), affirmed and remanded.

2. Petitioners' unauthorized use of Woolrich's story in their film does not constitute a noninfringing ""fair use.""  The film does not fall into any of the categories of fair use enumerated in 17 U.S.C.  107; e.g., criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.  Nor does it meet any of the nonexclusive criteria that  107 requires a court to consider.  First, since petitioners received $12 million from the film's rerelease during the renewal term, their use was commercial, rather than educational.  Second, the nature of the copyrighted work is fictional and creative, rather than factual.  Third, the story was a substantial portion of the film, which expressly used its unique setting, characters, plot, and sequence of events.  Fourth, and most important, the record supports the conclusion that rerelease of the film impinged on Abend's ability to market new versions of the story.  Pp.  495 U. S. 236-238.

495 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
Following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, respondent Wells gave the Florida Highway Patrol permission to open the trunk of his impounded car.  An inventory search of the car turned up two marijuana cigarette butts in an ashtray and a locked suitcase in the trunk.  The suitcase was opened, and a considerable amount of marijuana was discovered.  After the state trial court denied Wells' motion to suppress the marijuana on the ground that it was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, he pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of possession of a controlled substance, but retained his right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.  The intermediate appellate court held, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying suppression of the marijuana found in the suitcase.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, noting the absence of any Highway Patrol policy on the opening of closed containers found during inventory searches, and holding that Colorado v. Bertine, 479 U. S. 367, requires police to mandate either that all containers be opened during such searches or that no containers be opened, leaving no room for discretion on the part of individual officers.
Held:  Absent any Highway Patrol policy with respect to the opening of closed containers encountered during an inventory search, the instant search was insufficiently regulated to satisfy the Fourth Amendment.  Requiring standardized criteria or established routine as to such openings prevents individual police officers from having so much latitude that inventory searches are turned into a ruse for a general rummaging in order to discover incriminating evidence.  However, denying, as did

 the State Supreme Court, police officers all discretion is at odds with Bertine.  While an ""all or nothing"" policy is permissible, one that allows a police officer sufficient latitude to determine whether a particular container should be opened in light of the nature of the search and characteristics of the container itself does not violate the Fourth Amendment.

Syllabus 
Police officers, having probable cause to believe that respondent Harris committed murder, entered his home without first obtaining a warrant, read him his Miranda rights, and reportedly secured an admission of guilt.  After he was arrested, taken to the police station, and again given his Miranda rights, he signed a written inculpatory statement.  The New York trial court suppressed the first statement under Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, which held that the Fourth Amendment prohibits the police from effecting a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect's home in order to make a routine felony arrest.  However, the court admitted the second statement, and Harris was convicted of second-degree murder.  The Appellate Division affirmed, but the State Court of Appeals reversed.  Applying the rule of Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, and its progeny that the indirect fruits of an illegal search or arrest should be suppressed when they bear a sufficiently close relationship to the underlying illegality, the court deemed the second statement inadmissible because its connection with the arrest was not sufficiently attenuated.
Held:  Where the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect, the exclusionary rule does not bar the State's use of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home, even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of Payton.  The penalties imposed on the Government where its officers have violated the law must bear some relation to the purposes which the law serves.  United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268,  435 U. S. 279.  The rule in Payton was designed to protect the physical integrity of the home, not to grant criminal suspects protection for statements made outside their premises where the police have probable cause to make an arrest.  Brown v. Illinois, supra, and its progeny are distinguishable, since attenuation analysis is only appropriate where, as a threshold matter, courts determine that the challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal governmental activity.  Here, the police had a justification to question Harris prior to his arrest; therefore, his subsequent statement was not an exploitation of the illegal entry into his home.  Cf. United States v. Crews, 445 U. S. 463.  Suppressing that statement would not serve the purpose of the Payton rule, since anything incriminating gathered from Harris' in-home arrest has already been excluded.

 Payton still obtains:  the police know that a warrantless entry will lead to the suppression of evidence found or statements taken inside the home.  Moreover, the incremental deterrent value of suppressing statements like Harris' would be minimal, since it is doubtful that the desire to secure a statement from a suspect whom the police have probable cause to arrest would motivate them to violate Payton.

No. 88-1150

Decided April 18, 1990
495 U.S. 33

Syllabus 
In an action under 42 U.S.C.  1983, the District Court found that the Kansas City, Missouri, School District (KCMSD) and petitioner State had operated a segregated school system within the KCMSD.  The court issued an order detailing a desegregation remedy and the financing necessary to implement it.  Although it allocated the costs of the remedy between the governmental entities, the court determined that several state law provisions would prevent KCMSD from being able to pay its share.  Rather than exercising what it believed to be its power to order a tax increase to fund the remedy, the court chose to impose other means -- including enjoining the effect of one of the state law provisions -- to allow KCMSD to raise additional revenue.  The Court of Appeals affirmed most of the initial order, but ordered the lower court to divide the remedy's cost equally between the entities.  On remand, however, the District Court held that the State and KCMSD were 75% and 25% at fault, respectively, ordered them to share the cost of the remedy in that proportion, and held them jointly and severally liable.  Subsequently, the court determined that KCMSD had exhausted all available means of raising additional revenue, and, finding itself with no choice but to exercise its remedial powers, ordered the KCMSD property tax levy increased through the 1991-1992 fiscal year.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected the State's argument that a federal court lacks judicial power to order a tax increase.  Accepting the District Court's conclusion that state law limitations prevented KCMSD from raising sufficient funds, it held that those limitations must fall to the Constitution's command, and affirmed all of the District Court's actions taken to that point.  However, concluding that federal/state comity principles required the District Court to use minimally obtrusive methods to remedy constitutional violations, it required that, in the future, the lower court should not set the property tax rate itself, but should authorize KCMSD to submit a levy to state tax collection authorities and should enjoin the operation of state tax laws hindering KCMSD from adequately funding the remedy.  The Court of Appeals' judgment was entered on August 19, 1988.  On September 16, the State filed with the court a document styled ""State Appellants' Petition for Rehearing En Banc.""  On October 14, 1988, the Court of Appeals denied this and two 
Page 495 U. S. 34
 similarly styled petitions by other parties seeking to intervene, and issued its mandate.  One of the would-be intervenors filed with this Court an application for extension of time to file a petition for certiorari 78 days after the issuance of the order denying rehearing and 134 days after the entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment.  The application was returned as untimely pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2101(c) --which requires that a civil certiorari petition be filed within 90 days after the entry of the judgment below, and that any application for an extension of time be filed within the original 90-day period -- since, while the filing of a ""petition for rehearing"" under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40 tolls the running of the 90-day period, the filing of a ""suggestion for rehearing in banc"" under Rule 35 does not.  On January 10, 1989, the Clerk of the Court of Appeals issued an amended order, recalling the October 14 mandate and entering nunc pro tunc, effective October 14, an order denying the three ""petitions for rehearing with suggestions for rehearing en banc.""  The State filed a petition for certiorari within 90 days of the October 14, 1988, order, which was granted, limited to the question of the property tax increase.
Held:
1. The State's certiorari petition was timely filed.  The Court of Appeals appears to have interpreted and actually treated the State's papers as including a petition for rehearing before the panel.  Had it regarded the State's papers as only a suggestion for rehearing in banc, without a petition for rehearing, it would have, as required by Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 35(c) and 41(a), issued its mandate within 21 days of the entry of the panel's judgment or would have, under Rule 41(a), issued an order extending the time for the issuance of the mandate.  Although this Court of Appeals may not on every occasion have observed these technicalities, it cannot be concluded that the court has engaged in a systematic practice of ignoring them.  Although a court cannot, post hoc, amend an order to make it appear that it took an action which it never took, the Court of Appeals actually amended its order to reflect the reality of the action taken on October 14, at which time it had entered an order denying the ""petitions for rehearing en banc"" because this was the manner in which the papers filed with the court had been styled.  While the court below, unlike other Courts of Appeals, does not have a published practice of treating all suggestions for rehearing in banc as containing both petitions for rehearing and suggestions for rehearing in banc, this Court will not assume that the court's action in this case is not in accord with its regular practice.  Pp.  495 U. S. 45-50.
2. The District Court abused its discretion in imposing the tax increase, which contravened the principles of comity.  Although that court believed that it had no alternative to imposing the tax itself, it, in 
Page 495 U. S. 35
 fact, had the very alternative outlined by the Court of Appeals.  Authorizing and directing local government institutions to devise and implement remedies not only protects the function of those institutions but, to the extent possible, also places the responsibility for solutions to the problems of segregation upon those who have themselves created the problems.  While a district court should not grant local government carte blanche, local officials should at least have the opportunity to devise their own solutions to such problems.  Here, KCMSD was ready, willing, and, but for the operation of state law, able to remedy the deprivation of constitutional rights itself.  Pp.  495 U. S. 50-52.
3. The Court of Appeals' modifications of the District Court's order satisfy equitable and constitutional principles governing the District Court's power.  Pp.  495 U. S. 52-58.
(a) This Court accepts the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court's remedy was proper.  The State's argument that the funding ordered by the District Court violates the principles of equity and comity because the remedial order itself was excessive aims at the scope of the remedy, rather than the manner in which the remedy is to be funded, and thus falls outside this Court's limited grant of certiorari.  Pp.  495 U. S. 53.
(b) Under the circumstances of this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that KCMSD should be responsible for funding its share of the remedy.  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, did not hold that a district court could never set aside state laws preventing local governments from raising funds sufficient to satisfy their constitutional obligations just because those funds could also be obtained from the States.  To the contrary,  1983 is authority enough to require each tortfeasor to pay its share of the cost of a remedy if it can, and apportionment of the cost is part of the District Court's equitable powers.  Here, the court believed that the Court of Appeals had ordered it to allocate the costs between the two entities.  Had the court chosen, as the State argues, to allow the monetary obligations that KCMSD could not meet to fall on the State rather than interfere with state law to permit KCMSD to meet them, the implementation of the order might have been delayed if the State resisted efforts by KCMSD to obtain contribution.  Pp.  495 U. S. 53-54.
(c) The modifications are not invalid under the Tenth Amendment, since that Amendment's reservation of nondelegated powers to the States is not implicated by a federal court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the Fourteenth Amendment.  P.  495 U. S. 55.
(d) The Court of Appeals' order does not exceed the judicial power under Article III.  A court can direct a local government body to levy 
Page 495 U. S. 36
 its own taxes.  See, e.g., Griffin v. Prince Edward County School Bd., 377 U. S. 218,  377 U. S. 233.  The State's argument that federal courts cannot set aside state-imposed limitations on local taxing authority because that requires local governments to do more than exercise the power that is theirs has been rejected, Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, and fails to take account of local governments' obligations, under the Supremacy Clause, to fulfill the requirements that the Constitution imposes on them.  Pp.  495 U. S. 55-59.

3. The Court of Appeals' modifications of the District Court's order satisfy equitable and constitutional principles governing the District Court's power.  Pp.  495 U. S. 52-58.
(a) This Court accepts the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court's remedy was proper.  The State's argument that the funding ordered by the District Court violates the principles of equity and comity because the remedial order itself was excessive aims at the scope of the remedy, rather than the manner in which the remedy is to be funded, and thus falls outside this Court's limited grant of certiorari.

(d) The Court of Appeals' order does not exceed the judicial power under Article III.  A court can direct a local government body to levy

 its own taxes.  See, e.g., Griffin v. Prince Edward County School Bd., 377 U. S. 218,  377 U. S. 233.  The State's argument that federal courts cannot set aside state-imposed limitations on local taxing authority because that requires local governments to do more than exercise the power that is theirs has been rejected, Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, and fails to take account of local governments' obligations, under the Supremacy Clause, to fulfill the requirements that the Constitution imposes on them.  Pp.  495 U.

No. 88-1725
Argued Feb. 21, 1990
Decided April 18, 1990
495 U.S. 82

Syllabus 
In connection with petitioner Venegas' civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, he and respondent Mitchell, an attorney, entered into a contingent fee contract providing that, inter alia, Mitchell would receive a percentage of any gross recovery, which would be offset by any court-awarded attorney's fees, and would be allowed to intervene in the action to protect the fee award.  Venegas obtained a judgment and was awarded attorney's fees, $75,000 of which was attributable to work done by Mitchell.  The fees were awarded under  1988, which enables civil rights plaintiffs to employ reasonably competent lawyers without cost to themselves by authorizing the payment of a ""reasonable attorney's fee"" by a losing party to a prevailing party.  After Venegas obtained different counsel to handle his appeal, Mitchell filed a motion for leave to intervene, requesting that the District Court confirm a lien on the judgment for $406,000 in fees that were purportedly due him under the contract.  Among other things, the court held that he was not entitled to intervene, but it refused to disallow or reduce the contingent fee, holding that it was reasonable, and not a windfall to Mitchell.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's holding denying intervention, but agreed that  1988 does not prevent a lawyer from collecting a reasonable contingent fee even if it exceeds the statutory fee award, and that Mitchell's fee was reasonable and not a windfall.
Held:
1. Section 1988 does not invalidate contingent fee contracts that would require a prevailing plaintiff to pay his attorney more than the statutory award against the defendant.  Neither the section's language nor its legislative history supports the view that it prevents an attorney and client from entering into a contingent fee agreement.  Moreover, this Court, in holding that it is the prevailing party, rather than the lawyer, who is eligible for fees, has recognized that it is the party's right to waive, settle, or negotiate that eligibility, Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717,  475 U. S. 730, and has implicitly accepted that statutory fee awards can coexist with private fee arrangements, cf. Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U. S. 87,  489 U. S. 94-95; Blum v. Stenson, 465 U. S. 886,  465 U. S. 894-895.  Since a  1983 cause of action also belongs to, and can be waived by, the injured party, a contrary finding would place these plaintiffs in the peculiar position of 
Page 495 U. S. 83
 having more freedom to negotiate a waiver of their causes of action with their adversaries than a fee with their own attorneys.  The fact that Blanchard v. Bergeron, supra, does not permit a contingent fee agreement to impose a ceiling on the amount of the statutory fee award does not mean that such an agreement should also be ignored for the benefit of the client, so that he need pay only the statutory award.  Blanchard dealt with what the losing party must pay the plaintiff, not with the contractual obligations of plaintiffs and their attorneys, and entitlement to a  1988 award does not belong to the attorney.  Also unpersuasive is Venegas' argument that requiring him to pay more than the reasonable fee authorized by Congress would greatly reduce his recovery and would impose a cost on him that the defendant should pay, since the amount payable under a fee agreement is not necessarily measured by the ""reasonable attorney's fee"" that a defendant must pay under  1988, and since depriving prevailing plaintiffs of the option of promising to pay more to secure their counsel of choice would not further  1988's general purpose of enabling them to secure competent counsel.  Pp.  495 U. S. 86-90.
2. Venegas offers no reason to accept his contention, rejected by the lower courts, that, even if contingent fees exceeding statutory awards are not prohibited per se by  1988, the fee in this case is unreasonable under both federal and state law.  P.  495 U. S. 90.

495 U.S. 91

Syllabus 
Police suspected respondent Olson of being the driver of the getaway car used in a robbery-murder.  After recovering the murder weapon and arresting the suspected murderer, they surrounded the home of two women with whom they believed Olson had been staying.  When police telephoned the home and told one of the women that Olson should come out, a male voice was heard saying ""tell them I left.""  Without seeking permission, and with weapons drawn, they entered the home, found Olson hiding in a closet, and arrested him.  Shortly thereafter, he made an inculpatory statement, which the trial court refused to suppress.  He was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and assault.  The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, ruling that Olson had a sufficient interest in the women's home to challenge the legality of his warrantless arrest, that the arrest was illegal because there were no exigent circumstances to justify warrantless entry, and that his statement was tainted, and should have been suppressed.
Held:  The arrest violated Olson's Fourth Amendment rights.
(a) Olson's status as an overnight guest is alone sufficient to show that he had an expectation of privacy in the home that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.  See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128,  439 U. S. 143-144; cf. Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257.  The distinctions relied on by the State between this case and Jones -- that there, the overnight guest was left alone and had a key to the premises with which he could come and go and admit and exclude others -- are not legally determinative.  All citizens share the expectation that hosts will more likely than not respect their guests' privacy interests even if the guests have no legal interest in the premises and do not have the legal authority to determine who may enter the household.  Pp.  495 U. S. 95-100.
(b) The State Supreme Court applied essentially the correct standard in holding that there were no exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless entry:  an entry may be justified by hot pursuit of a fleeing felon, the imminent destruction of evidence, the need to prevent a suspect's escape, or the risk of danger to the police or others; but, in the absence of hot pursuit, there must be at least probable cause to believe that one or more of the other factors were present and, in assessing the risk of danger, the gravity of the crime and likelihood that the suspect is

 armed should be considered.  This Court is not inclined to disagree with the fact-specific application of this standard by the lower court, which pointed out that, although a grave crime was involved, Olson was known not to be the murderer and the murder weapon had been recovered; that there was no suggestion of danger to the women; that several police squads surrounded the house; that it was Sunday afternoon; that it was evident that the suspect was going nowhere; and that, if he came out of the house, he would have been promptly apprehended.

No. 88-5986
Argued Dec. 5, 1989
Decided April 18, 1990
495 U.S. 103

Syllabus 
After Ohio police found photographs in petitioner Osborne's home, each of which depicted a nude male adolescent posed in sexually explicit position, he was convicted of violating a state statute prohibiting any person from possessing or viewing any material or performance showing a minor who is not his child or ward in a state of nudity unless (a) the material or performance is presented for a bona fide purpose by or to a person having a proper interest therein, or (b) the possessor knows that the minor's parents or guardian has consented in writing to such photographing or use of the minor.  An intermediate appellate court and the State Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.  The latter court rejected Osborne's contention that the First Amendment prohibits the States from proscribing the private possession of child pornography.  The court also found that the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad, since, in light of its specific exceptions, it must be read as only applying to depictions of nudity involving a lewd exhibition or graphic focus on the minor's genitals, and since scienter is an essential element of the offense.  In rejecting Osborne's contention that the trial court erred in not requiring the government to prove lewd exhibition and scienter as elements of his crime, the court emphasized that he had not objected to the jury instructions given at his trial, and stated that the failures of proof did not amount to plain error.
Held:
1. Ohio may constitutionally proscribe the possession and viewing of child pornography.  Even assuming that Osborne has a valid First Amendment interest in such activities, this case is distinct from Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, which struck down a Georgia law outlawing the private possession of obscene material on the ground that the State's justifications for the law -- primarily, that obscenity would poison the minds of its viewers -- were inadequate.  In contrast, Ohio does not rely on a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne's mind, but has enacted its law on the basis of its compelling interests in protecting the physical and psychological wellbeing of minors and in destroying the market for the exploitative use of children by penalizing those who possess and view the offending materials.  See New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,  458 U. S. 756-758,  458 U. S. 761-762.  Moreover, Ohio's ban encourages possessors to destroy such materials, which permanently record the victim's abuse and thus 
Page 495 U. S. 104
 may haunt him for years to come, see id. at 759, and which, available evidence suggests, may be used by pedophiles to seduce other children.  Pp.  495 U. S. 108-111.
2. Osborne's First Amendment overbreadth arguments are unpersuasive.  Pp.  495 U. S. 111-122.
(a) The Ohio statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  Although, on its face, the statute purports to prohibit constitutionally protected depictions of nudity, it is doubtful that any overbreadth would be ""substantial"" under this Court's cases, in light of the statutory exemptions and ""proper purposes"" provisions.  In any event, the statute, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court, plainly survives overbreadth scrutiny.  By limiting the statute's operation to nudity that constitutes lewd exhibition or focuses on genitals, that court avoided penalizing persons for viewing or possessing innocuous photographs of naked children, and thereby rendered the ""nudity"" language permissible.  See Ferber, supra, at  458 U. S. 765.  Moreover, the statute's failure, on its face, to provide a mens rea requirement is cured by the court's conclusion that the State must establish scienter under the Ohio default statute specifying that recklessness applies absent a statutory intent provision.  Pp.  495 U. S. 111-115.
(b) It was not impermissible for the State Supreme Court to rely on its narrowed construction of the statute when evaluating Osborne's overbreadth claim.  A statute as construed may be applied to conduct occurring before the construction, provided such application affords fair warning to the defendant. See, e.g., Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479,  380 U. S. 491, n. 7.  It is obvious from the face of the child pornography statute, and from its placement within the ""Sexual Offenses"" chapter of the Ohio Code, that Osborne had notice that his possession of the photographs at issue was proscribed.  Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347; Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313; and Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, distinguished.  Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U. S. 87 -- which stands for the proposition that, where a State Supreme Court narrows an unconstitutionally overbroad statute, the State must ensure that defendants are convicted under the statute as it is subsequently construed, and not as it was originally written -- does not conflict with the holding in this case.  Nor does Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U. S. 576 -- in which five Justices agreed in a separate opinion that a state legislature could not cure a potential overbreadth problem through a postconviction statutory amendment -- support Osborne's view that an overbroad statute is void as written, such that a court may not narrow it, affirm a conviction on the basis of the narrowing construction, and leave the statute in full force.  Since courts routinely adopt the latter course, acceptance of Osborne's proposition would require a radical reworking of American law. 
Page 495 U. S. 105
  Moreover, the Oakes approach is based on the fear that legislators, who know they can cure their own mistakes by amendment without significant cost, may not be careful to avoid drafting overbroad laws in the first place.  A similar effect will not be likely if a judicial construction of a statute to eliminate overbreadth is allowed to be applied in the case before the Court, since legislatures cannot be sure that the statute, when examined by a court, will be saved by a narrowing construction rather than invalidated for overbreadth, and since applying even a narrowed statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause.  Furthermore, requiring that statutes be facially invalidated whenever overbreadth is perceived would very likely invite reconsideration or redefinition of the overbreadth doctrine in a way that would not serve First Amendment interests.  Pp.  495 U. S. 115-122.
3. Nevertheless, due process requires that Osborne's conviction be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, since it is unclear whether the conviction was based on a finding that the State had proved each of the elements of the offense.  It is true that this Court is precluded from reaching the due process challenge with respect to the scienter element of the crime, because counsel's failure to comply with the state procedural rule requiring an objection to faulty jury instructions constitutes an independent state law ground adequate to support the result below.  However, this Court is not so barred with respect to counsel's failure to object to the failure to instruct on lewdness, since, shortly before the brief trial, counsel moved to dismiss on the ground that the statute was overbroad in its failure to allow the viewing of innocent nude photographs.  Nothing would be gained by requiring counsel to object a second time, specifically to the jury instructions.  The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, may not be defeated under the name of local practice.  Cf. Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415,  380 U. S. 421-422.  Pp.  495 U. S. 122-125.

S. 576 -- in which five Justices agreed in a separate opinion that a state legislature could not cure a potential overbreadth problem through a postconviction statutory amendment -- support Osborne's view that an overbroad statute is void as written, such that a court may not narrow it, affirm a conviction on the basis of the narrowing construction, and leave the statute in full force.  Since courts routinely adopt the latter course, acceptance of Osborne's proposition would require a radical reworking of American law. 
Page 495 U. S. 105
  Moreover, the Oakes approach is based on the fear that legislators, who know they can cure their own mistakes by amendment without significant cost, may not be careful to avoid drafting overbroad laws in the first place.  A similar effect will not be likely if a judicial construction of a statute to eliminate overbreadth is allowed to be applied in the case before the Court, since legislatures cannot be sure that the statute, when examined by a court, will be saved by a narrowing construction rather than invalidated for overbreadth, and since applying even a narrowed statute to pending cases might be barred by the Due Process Clause.  Furthermore, requiring that statutes be facially invalidated whenever overbreadth is perceived would very likely invite reconsideration or redefinition of the overbreadth doctrine in a way that would not serve First Amendment interests.  Pp.  495 U. S. 115-122.
3. Nevertheless, due process requires that Osborne's conviction be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, since it is unclear whether the conviction was based on a finding that the State had proved each of the elements of the offense.  It is true that this Court is precluded from reaching the due process challenge with respect to the scienter element of the crime, because counsel's failure to comply with the state procedural rule requiring an objection to faulty jury instructions constitutes an independent state law ground adequate to support the result below.  However, this Court is not so barred with respect to counsel's failure to object to the failure to instruct on lewdness, since, shortly before the brief trial, counsel moved to dismiss on the ground that the statute was overbroad in its failure to allow the viewing of innocent nude photographs.  Nothing would be gained by requiring counsel to object a second time, specifically to the jury instructions.  The assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, may not be defeated under the name of local practice.  Cf. Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 415,  380 U. S. 421-422.  Pp.  495 U.

No. 88-1685
Argued Dec. 4, 1989
Decided April 17, 1990
494 U.S. 775

Syllabus 
The National Labor Relations Act's irrebuttable presumption of majority support for a certified collective-bargaining agent becomes rebuttable after one year.  According to the National Labor Relations Board, an employer may rebut the presumption by showing, inter alia, that it had a ""good-faith"" doubt, founded on a sufficient objective basis, of the union's majority support.  Station KKHI, 284 N.L.R.B. 1339.  Although the Board has changed its position over the years as to whether, in determining the good-faith doubt question, it should apply a presumption that striker replacements either oppose the union or support it in the same ratio as the strikers they replaced, the Board presently follows a no-presumption approach and determines replacements' union sentiments on a case-by-case basis.  Id. at 1344-1345.  Applying this approach in the present case, the Board concluded that respondent employer's evidence of its striker replacements' union sentiments was insufficient to rebut the presumption of the union's majority support.  Among other things, the Board therefore held that respondent had violated the Act by withdrawing recognition from the union and ordered respondent to bargain upon the union's request.  In refusing to enforce the Board's order, the Court of Appeals held that the Board must presume that striker replacements oppose the union, and that, accordingly, respondent was justified in doubting the union's majority support.
Held:  The Board acted within its discretion in refusing to adopt a presumption of replacement opposition to the union.  Pp.  494 U. S. 786-796.
(a) Since Congress has entrusted the Board with the primary responsibility for developing and applying national labor policy, a Board rule is entitled to considerable deference so long as it is rational and consistent with the Act, even if it represents a departure from the Board's prior policy.  See, e.g., NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 265-266.  Pp.  494 U. S. 786-787.
(b) The Board's refusal to adopt an antiunion presumption is rational as an empirical matter.  Although replacements often may not favor the incumbent union, the Board reasonably concluded, in light of its considerable experience in addressing these issues, that the probability of replacement 
Page 494 U. S. 776
 opposition is insufficient to justify an antiunion presumption, since the circumstances surrounding each strike and replacements' reasons for crossing a picket line may vary greatly.  For example, a replacement who otherwise supports the union and desires its representation may be forced by economic concerns to work for a struck employer.  He may also want such representation even though he disagrees with the purpose or strategy of, and refuses to support, the particular strike.  Respondent's contention that the Board's position is irrational because the interests of strikers and replacements are diametrically opposed and because unions inevitably side with strikers is unpersuasive.  Unions do not invariably demand displacement of all replacements, and the extent to which they do so will depend on the extent of their bargaining power, which will in turn vary greatly from strike to strike.  If the union's bargaining position is weak, many of the replacements justifiably may not fear that they will lose their jobs at the end of the strike, and may still want the union's representation thereafter.  Moreover, even if the interests of strikers and replacements conflict during the strike, those interests may converge after job rights have been settled; replacements surely are capable of looking past the strike in considering whether they want representation.  Thus, the Board's approach is not irreconcilable with its position in Service Electric Co., 281 N.L.R.B. 633, 641, and Leveld Wholesale, Inc., 218 N.L.R.B. 1344, 1350, that an employer has no duty to bargain with a striking union over replacements' employment terms.  Furthermore, the Board has not deemed picket line violence or a union's demands that replacements be terminated irrelevant to its evaluation of their union sentiments.  Cf. Stormor, Inc., 268 N.L.R.B. 860, 866-867; IT Services, 263 N.L.R.B. 1183, 1185-1188.  In both Station KKHI, supra, and this case, the Board noted that the picket line was peaceful, and in neither case did the employer present evidence that the union was actively negotiating for the ouster of replacements.  Pp.  494 U. S. 788-793.
(c) In light of the considerable deference accorded the Board's rules, its refusal to adopt an antiunion presumption is consistent with the Act's overriding policy of achieving industrial peace.  The Board's approach furthers this policy by promoting stability in the collective bargaining process.  It was reasonable for it to conclude that the antiunion presumption could allow an employer to eliminate the union entirely merely by hiring a sufficient number of replacements and thereby to avoid good-faith bargaining over a strike settlement.  It was also reasonable for the Board to decide that the antiunion presumption might chill employees' exercise of their statutory right to engage in concerted activity, including 
Page 494 U. S. 777
 the right to strike, by confronting them not only with the prospect of being permanently replaced, but also with the greater risk that they would lose their bargaining representative, thereby diminishing their chance of obtaining reinstatement through a strike settlement.  Pp.  494 U. S. 794-796.

Syllabus 
After respondent filed a charge against petitioner alleging employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued her a Notice of Right to Sue, which did not identify the forum in which she might sue, but did advise her that she must bring suit within 90 days.  Within that period, she filed a complaint in an Illinois county court, alleging that petitioner had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex in violation of the State Human Rights Act.  After petitioner filed a motion to dismiss -- and outside the 90-day period -- respondent moved to amend her complaint to allege that the facts already pleaded also constituted a violation of Title VII.  Petitioner removed the case to the Federal District Court and moved to dismiss, contending that, because the state court lacked jurisdiction over a Title VII claim, the original filing in state court could not toll the 90-day period.  The District Court rejected this contention and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for respondent which the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Federal courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over Title VII actions.  The fact that Title VII contains no language that expressly confines jurisdiction to federal courts or ousts state courts of their jurisdiction is strong evidence that Congress did not intend to divest state courts of concurrent jurisdiction.  Although most legislators, judges, and administrators who have been involved in the enactment and interpretation of Title VII may have expected that such litigation would be processed exclusively in federal courts, such anticipation cannot overcome the presumption, recently reaffirmed in Tafflin v.

Syllabus 
Respondents (Bonjorno), the sole stockholders of a now defunct aluminum pipe fabrication company, brought suit against petitioners (Kaiser) in the District Court, alleging that Kaiser had monopolized the market for such pipe in violation of the Sherman Act.  Judgment for Bonjorno on a jury verdict and damages award was entered on August 22, 1979.  However, the District Court found that this judgment was not supported by the evidence, and held a limited retrial on the issue of damages, which resulted in a jury award of $9,567,939 on December 2, 1981.  After judgment was entered on December 4, 1981, the District Court granted a partial judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  The Court of Appeals, inter alia, vacated the latter judgment and reinstated and affirmed the December 4 judgment, issuing its mandate in 1986.  The postjudgment interest statute in effect when Bonjorno's complaint was in filed provided that ""interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of judgment, at the rate allowed by State law.""  28 U.S.C.  1961 (1976 ed.).  In 1982, while the appeal was pending, an amended  1961 went into effect, which specified that ""interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment, at a rate"" based on the price for United States Treasury bills settled ""immediately prior to the date of judgment.""  28 U.S.C.  1961 (1982 ed.).  The District Court held that  1961 required interest to be calculated from December 2, 1981, the date of the damages verdict.  However, it rejected Bonjorno's argument that Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., 416 U. S. 696 -- which held that courts are to apply the law in effect at the time of decision except where retrospective application would result in manifest injustice to one of the parties or where there is clear congressional intent to the contrary -- required that the amended version of the statute be applied to determine the applicable interest rate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's determination of the date from which interest should be calculated, but reversed on the issue of which version of  1961 applied. 
Page 494 U. S. 828

Held:
1. Postjudgment interest properly runs from the date of the entry of judgment, not the date of the verdict.  Both versions of  1961 refer specifically to the ""date of judgment,"" which indicates a date certain, and there is no legislative history that would indicate a contrary congressional intent.  Pp.  494 U. S. 834-835.
2. Interest should be calculated from December 4, 1981, rather than August 22, 1979, the date of the District Court's legally insufficient judgment.  The purpose of postjudgment interest is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant.  It would be counterintuitive to believe that Congress intended interest to be calculated from a judgment on damages that was not supported by the evidence, since such damages have not been ""ascertained"" in any meaningful way.  Pp.  494 U. S. 835-836.
3. Amended  1961 is not applicable to judgments entered before its effective date.  The plain language of both versions of  1961 evidences clear congressional intent that the interest rate for any particular judgment is to be determined as of the date of the judgment, and that a single applicable rate of interest is to be applied to the judgment for the duration of the interest accrual period.  In addition, Congress delayed the effective date of the amended version by six months to permit courts and attorneys to prepare for the change in the law, and, therefore, at the very least, the amended version cannot be applied before its effective date.  Implicit in the amended provision's legislative history -- which indicates that Congress wished to lessen the incentives of losing defendants to take frivolous appeals in order to collect interest at the prevailing market rates while paying plaintiffs at the lower state-set rates -- is the understanding that, on the date of judgment, expectations with respect to liability would be fixed so that the parties could make informed decisions about the cost and potential benefits of paying the judgment or seeking appeal.  This Court need not reconcile the apparent tension between the two lines of precedent governing retrospective application that are represented by Bradley v. Richmond School Bd., supra, and Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, which held that congressional enactments will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.  Under either view, where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.  Pp.  494 U. S. 836-840.
4. The equities of the case do not require that the rate of interest be set at a rate higher than that afforded by  1961.  Where Congress has not seen fit to provide for a higher interest rate with respect to antitrust

494 U.S. 872

Syllabus 
Respondents Smith and Black were fired by a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of their Native American Church.  Their applications for unemployment compensation were denied by the State of Oregon under a state law disqualifying employees discharged for work-related ""misconduct.""  Holding that the denials violated respondents' First Amendment free exercise rights, the State Court of Appeals reversed.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, but this Court vacated the judgment and remanded for a determination whether sacramental peyote use is proscribed by the State's controlled substance law, which makes it a felony to knowingly or intentionally possess the drug.  Pending that determination, the Court refused to decide whether such use is protected by the Constitution.  On remand, the State Supreme Court held that sacramental peyote use violated, and was not excepted from, the state law prohibition, but concluded that that prohibition was invalid under the Free Exercise Clause.
Held:  The Free Exercise Clause permits the State to prohibit sacramental peyote use, and thus to deny unemployment benefits to persons discharged for such use.  Pp.  494 U. S. 876-890.
(a) Although a State would be ""prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]"" in violation of the Clause if it sought to ban the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts solely because of their religious motivation, the Clause does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a law that incidentally forbids (or requires) the performance of an act that his religious belief requires (or forbids) if the law is not specifically directed to religious practice and is otherwise constitutional as applied to those who engage in the specified act for nonreligious reasons.  See, e.g., Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145,  98 U. S. 166-167.  The only decisions in which this Court has held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action are distinguished on the ground that they involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but that Clause in conjunction with other constitutional

 protections. See, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296,  310 U. S. 304-307; Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205.  Pp.  494 U. S. 876-882.
(b) Respondents' claim for a religious exemption from the Oregon law cannot be evaluated under the balancing test set forth in the line of cases following Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398,  374 U. S. 402-403, whereby governmental actions that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a ""compelling governmental interest.""  That test was developed in a context -- unemployment compensation eligibility rules -- that lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.  The test is inapplicable to an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct.  A holding to the contrary would create an extraordinary right to ignore generally applicable laws that are not supported by ""compelling governmental interest"" on the basis of religious belief.  Nor could such a right be limited to situations in which the conduct prohibited is ""central"" to the individual's religion, since that would enmesh judges in an impermissible inquiry into the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith.  Cf. Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680,  490 U. S. 699.  Thus, although it is constitutionally permissible to exempt sacramental peyote use from the operation of drug laws, it is not constitutionally required.  Pp.  494 U. S. 882-890.

v. Federal Labor Relations Authority
No. 88-2123
Argued Jan. 8, 1990
Decided April 17, 1990
494 U.S. 922

Syllabus 
During collective bargaining negotiations, respondent National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) proposed that contractual grievance and arbitration provisions be designated as the ""internal appeals procedure"" required for employee complaints by an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular relating to the ""contracting out"" of work.  Petitioner Internal Revenue Service (IRS) refused to bargain over the proposal, claiming that its subject matter was nonnegotiable under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C.  7101 et seq.  The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), which is charged with administering the Act, held that the IRS was required to negotiate over the NTEU proposal by  7114, which requires agency management and employee unions to bargain in good faith to reach an agreement, and by  7121, which specifies that such agreements must contain grievance-settlement procedures.
Held:  The FLRA erred in holding that the Act requires the IRS to bargain over the NTEU proposal.  Pp.  494 U. S. 926-934.
(a) The plain text of  7106(a) -- which provides that
""nothing in this [Act] shall affect the authority of [agency management officials] in accordance with applicable laws . . . to make [contracting-out] determinations""
-- demonstrates that the section supersedes  7121.  P.  494 U. S. 928.
(b) The arguments presented by the FLRA to overcome  7106(a)'s plain meaning lack merit.  First,  7121(c), which exempts certain appointment, suspension, and removal decisions from the grievance requirements, is not rendered superfluous if such decisions are already insulated from those requirements by  7106(a), subsection (2)(A) of which refers to those same decisions as protected management rights.  Although the two provisions sometimes overlap, each also has a distinct effect on such decisions:   7121(c) removes them from the coverage of only the grievance provisions regardless of whether they are made in accordance with applicable laws, while  7106 removes them from the coverage of the entire Act, but only if they are made in accordance with such laws.  Second, agency management cannot be subjected to grievance procedures over the exercise of reserved rights on the theory that  7121 
Page 494 U. S. 923
 is among the ""applicable laws"" referred to in  7106(a), since that phrase clearly refers to laws outside the Act.  Third,  7106(a) is applicable even though the NTEU proposal would not establish any substantive limitation on management's contracting-out decisions, but would only provide for the enforcement of ""external limitations"" on those decisions contained in the OMB Circular's mandatory and nondiscretionary provisions.  Insofar as union rights are concerned, it is entirely up to the IRS whether it will comply at all with the Circular's requirements, except to the extent that such compliance is required by an ""applicable law.""  Fourth, it is not reasonable to interpret the latter phrase as being synonymous with the term ""any law, rule, or regulation"" in  7103(a)(9)(C)(ii), which defines ""grievance"" as a claimed ""violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment.""  Thus, it cannot be said that all agency contracting decisions that violate rules or regulations are, by definition, ""not in accordance with applicable laws.""  Pp.  494 U. S. 928-932.
(c) This Court will not decide in the first instance whether the OMB Circular is an ""applicable law"" under  7106(a).  Pp.  494 U. S. 932-933.
(d) The    question    whether  7117(a) -- which provides that the ""duty to bargain . . . shall, to the extent not inconsistent with . . . any Government-wide rule or regulation, extend to matters which are the subject of any [non-Government-wide] rule or regulation"" -- renders the FLRA proposal nonnegotiable as inconsistent with ""no arbitration"" language in the OMB Circular is not properly presented, since it was not raised or considered by the court below.  Nor will this Court consider whether the FLRA properly held the Circular to be a ""rule"" or ""regulation"" within  7103(a)(9)'s meaning, since the IRS did not argue that question here.  P.  494 U.

 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In 1973, Claude Killian was murdered. Police questioned petitioner Ray Charles Degraffenreid shortly after the murder, but he was not then charged. In 1977, Degraffenreid was arrested for Killian's murder while incarcerated in state prison on an unrelated conviction. Five days later, he confessed to law enforcement officials. At Degraffenreid's first trial, the state court granted his motion to suppress his confession as involuntary, and the jury was unable to reach a verdict. At Degraffenreid's retrial, a different judge admitted the confession. Degraffenreid was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the South Carolina Supreme Court. Degraffenreid then sought state postconviction relief, which was likewise denied. 
 In this federal habeas petition, petitioner renews his challenge to the admission of his confession. The District Court referred the petition to a Magistrate for findings of fact and recommendations. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the Magistrate found that the State had failed to prove that the confession was voluntary. The District Court refused to adopt the Magistrate's recommendation on the ground that the Magistrate incorrectly allocated to the State the burden of proof regarding voluntariness. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, 883 F.2d 68 (1989), and the full court denied rehearing en banc by a vote of 6 to 5.

 The record in this case is replete with factual findings by various state and federal judges. The Magistrate's findings, which set forth the essential and undisputed facts, are as follows: 
 ""The only safeguard taken to protect the petitioner's rights was the giving of Miranda warnings. Despite the presence of judicial officers on the grounds of the facility and procedures for transporting prisoners to other court officials, the petitioner was not taken before a judicial officer, was not appointed an attorney and was not given any conditions of release until after he confessed .""

 It is also uncontested that prison officials placed a notice on the wall of the prison facility indicating that petitioner was to have no visitors or phone calls. From these facts the Magistrate concluded that "" despite the advice of rights, the only way the petitioner was going to be released from solitary confinement and allowed contact with third parties was to give a confession.""

|494 u.s. 738|"Clemons v. Mississippi
No. 88-6873
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided March 28, 1990
494 U.S. 738

Syllabus 
At the sentencing hearing following petitioner Clemons' Mississippi capital murder conviction, the trial court instructed the jury, among other things, that, in deciding whether to impose the death penalty, it should consider the following statutory aggravating factors:  (1) that the murder was committed during the course of a ""robbery for pecuniary gain,"" and (2) that it was an ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel"" killing.  Finding that both aggravating factors were present and that they outweighed any mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced Clemons to death, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.  The latter court, although acknowledging that the ""especially heinous"" factor was constitutionally invalid under Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, held that that case did not require reversal, since, inter alia, the court had previously given the factor a constitutional limiting construction.  The court then declared that, ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the jury's verdict would have been the same without the ""especially heinous"" factor, and that death was not too great a punishment when the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were weighed against each other.
Held:
1. Even in a ""weighing"" State like Mississippi, it is constitutionally permissible for an appellate court to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence to uphold a jury-imposed death sentence that is based in part on an invalid or improperly defined aggravating circumstance.  Pp.  494 U. S. 744-750.
(a) Nothing in the Sixth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment, or any other constitutional provision requires the jury, as opposed to the appellate court, to impose the death sentence or to make the findings prerequisite to such an imposition after the appellate court has invalidated one of two or more aggravating circumstances found by the jury.  Cf., e.g., Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U. S. 376,  474 U. S. 385; Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447.  Pp.  494 U. S. 745-746.
(b) Clemons' assertion that, under Mississippi law, only a jury has the authority to impose a death sentence and that he therefore has an unqualified liberty interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the jury assess the consequences of the invalidation of one of the aggravating circumstances on which it has been instructed is rejected.  This Court has no basis for disputing the state 
Page 494 U. S. 739
 court's interpretation that state law did not require in these circumstances that it vacate the death sentence and remand for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury, but instead allowed it to decide for itself whether to affirm the sentence.  Cf. Bullock, supra, at  474 U. S. 387 and n. 4.  Hicks v. Oklahoma, 447 U. S. 343, distinguished.  Pp.  494 U. S. 746-747.
(c) Also rejected is Clemons' contention that, since appellate courts are unable to fully consider and give effect to a capital defendant's sentencing-phase mitigating evidence, it violates the Eighth Amendment for such a court to undertake to reweigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances in an attempt to salvage the death sentence imposed by a jury.  Nothing in appellate weighing or reweighing is at odds with contemporary standards of fairness or is inherently unreliable and likely to result in arbitrary imposition of the death sentence.  Appellate courts routinely decide whether the evidence supports a jury verdict and, in weighing-State capital cases, consider whether the evidence is such that the sentencer could have arrived at the death sentence that was imposed.  Moreover, supreme courts in death penalty States may well review many death sentences, while typical jurors will serve on only one such case during their lifetime.  Thus, state appellate courts can and do give each defendant an individualized and reliable sentencing determination based on his circumstances, background, and crime.  Furthermore, contrary to Clemons' claim, an appellate court is able adequately to evaluate any evidence relating to mitigating factors without the assistance of written jury findings.  Pp.  494 U. S. 748-750.
2. However, the case must be remanded because it is unclear whether the State Supreme Court correctly employed reweighing.  Although the opinion below contains indications that the court properly performed a weighing function either by disregarding entirely the ""especially heinous"" factor and weighing only the remaining aggravating circumstance against the mitigating evidence or by including in the balance the ""especially heinous"" factor as narrowed by its prior decisions, the opinion can also be read as creating an automatic rule that, when an aggravating circumstance relied on by the jury has been invalidated, the sentence may be affirmed as long as there remains at least one valid and undisturbed aggravating circumstance.  Such an automatic rule in a weighing State would be invalid under Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, for it would not give defendants the necessary individualized treatment that would result from actual weighing.  Moreover, in light of the virtual silence of the opinion below as to Clemons' allegedly mitigating evidence, it is unclear whether the court gave that evidence sufficient consideration.  Pp.  494 U. S. 750-752.
3. Even if, under Mississippi law, the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances were not an appellate, but a jury function, 
Page 494 U. S. 740
 it would be constitutionally permissible for the State Supreme Court to apply harmless-error analysis to the jury's consideration of the invalid aggravating circumstance.  See, e.g., Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939.  However, the case must be remanded because it is unclear whether the court below correctly employed such analysis.  If the court's cryptic holding is read to suggest that it was ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the sentence would have been the same even if there had been no ""especially heinous"" instruction and only the ""robbery for pecuniary gain"" aggravating circumstance was to be balanced against the mitigating circumstances, the ultimate conclusion that the giving of the invalid instruction was harmless requires a detailed explanation based on the record, in light of the fact that the State repeatedly emphasized and argued the invalid factor during the sentencing hearing and placed little emphasis on the other factor.  Moreover, although it is possible that the court intended to ask whether, beyond reasonable doubt, the result would have been the same had the invalid factor been properly defined in the jury instructions, and that, on this basis, it could have determined that the failure to instruct properly was harmless error, it is not clear that the court meant to follow this course.

			"|"Clemons v. Mississippi
No. 88-6873
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided March 28, 1990
494 U.S. 738

Syllabus 
At the sentencing hearing following petitioner Clemons' Mississippi capital murder conviction, the trial court instructed the jury, among other things, that, in deciding whether to impose the death penalty, it should consider the following statutory aggravating factors:  (1) that the murder was committed during the course of a ""robbery for pecuniary gain,"" and (2) that it was an ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel"" killing.  Finding that both aggravating factors were present and that they outweighed any mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced Clemons to death, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.  The latter court, although acknowledging that the ""especially heinous"" factor was constitutionally invalid under Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, held that that case did not require reversal, since, inter alia, the court had previously given the factor a constitutional limiting construction.  The court then declared that, ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the jury's verdict would have been the same without the ""especially heinous"" factor, and that death was not too great a punishment when the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were weighed against each other.

Even in a ""weighing"" State like Mississippi, it is constitutionally permissible for an appellate court to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence to uphold a jury-imposed death sentence that is based in part on an invalid or improperly defined aggravating circumstance.

|494 u.s. 652|"Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce
No. 88-1569
Argued Oct. 31, 1989
Decided March 27, 1990
494 U.S. 652

Syllabus 
Appellee Michigan State Chamber of Commerce is a nonprofit corporation, whose bylaws set forth both political and nonpolitical purposes.  Its general treasury is funded through annual dues required of all members, three-quarters of whom are for-profit corporations.  Section 54(1) of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act prohibits corporations, excluding media corporations, from using general treasury funds for, inter alia, independent expenditures in connection with state candidate elections.  However, they may make such expenditures from segregated funds used solely for political purposes.  Because the Chamber wished to use general treasury funds to place a local newspaper advertisement in support of a specific candidate for state office, it brought suit in the Federal District Court for injunctive relief against  54(1)'s enforcement, arguing that the expenditure restrictions are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court upheld the section, but the Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that, as applied to the Chamber,  54(1) violated the First Amendment.
Held:
1. Section 54(1) does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.  494 U. S. 657-666.
(a) Although  54(1)'s requirements burden the Chamber's exercise of political expression, see FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238,  479 U. S. 252 (MCFL), they are justified by a compelling state interest:  preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political arena by reducing the threat that huge corporate treasuries, which are amassed with the aid of favorable state laws and have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas, will be used to influence unfairly election outcomes.  Pp.  494 U. S. 657-660
(b) Section 54(1) is sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve its goal, because it is precisely targeted to eliminate the distortion caused by corporate spending while also allowing corporations to express their political views by making expenditures through separate segregated funds.  Because persons who contribute to segregated funds understand that their money will be used solely for political purposes, the speech generated accurately reflects contributors' support for the corporation's political views.  The fact that  54(1) covers closely held corporations that 
Page 494 U. S. 653
 do not possess vast reservoirs of capital does not make it substantially overinclusive, because all corporations receive the special benefits conferred by the corporate form and thus present the potential for distorting the political process.  Cf. FEC v. National Right to Work Committee, 459 U. S. 197,  459 U. S. 209-210.  Pp.  494 U. S. 660-661.
(c) There is no merit to the Chamber's argument that, even if  54(1) is constitutional with respect to for-profit corporations, it cannot be applied to a nonprofit ideological corporation such as itself.  The Chamber does not exhibit the crucial features identified in MCFL, supra, that would require the State to exempt it from independent spending burdens as a nonprofit corporation more akin to a voluntary political association than a business firm.  MCFL's narrow focus on the promotion of political ideas ensured that its resources reflected political support, while the Chamber's more varied bylaws do not.  Additionally, unlike MCFL members, the Chamber's members are similar to shareholders -- who have an economic disincentive for disassociating with a corporation even if they disagree with its political activity -- in that they may be reluctant to withdraw from the Chamber because they wish to benefit from its nonpolitical programs and to establish contacts with other members of the business community.  Also in contrast to MCFL, which took no contributions from business corporations, more than three-quarters of the Chamber's members are business corporations, whose political contributions and expenditures can constitutionally be regulated by the State, and who thus could circumvent  54(1)'s restrictions by funneling money through the Chamber's general treasury.  Pp.  494 U. S. 661-665.
(d) Section 54(1) is not rendered under-inclusive by its failure to regulate the independent expenditures of unincorporated labor unions that also have the capacity to accumulate wealth, because the exclusion does not undermine the State's compelling interest in regulating corporations whose unique form enhances such capacity.  Moreover, because members who disagree with a union's political activities can decline to contribute to them without giving up other membership benefits, a union's political funds more accurately reflect members' support for the organization's political views than does a corporation's general treasury.  Pp.  494 U. S. 665-666.
2. Section 54(1) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Amendment.  Even under strict scrutiny, its classifications pass muster.  The State's decision to regulate corporations and not unincorporated associations is precisely tailored to serve its compelling interest.  Similarly, the exemption of media corporations does not render the section unconstitutional.  Restrictions on the expenditures of corporations whose resources are devoted to the collection and dissemination of information to the public might discourage news broadcasters or 
Page 494 U. S. 654
 publishers from serving their crucial societal role of reporting on and publishing editorials about newsworthy events; thus, their exemption from the section's restrictions is justified.  Pp.  494 U. S. 666-668.

The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 prohibits attorneys from receiving fees for representing claimants except as approved by petitioner Department of Labor.  In implementing this provision, the Department promulgated approval procedures which, inter alia, invalidate all contractual fee arrangements.  Respondent Triplett, an attorney, violated the Department's fee scheme when he agreed to represent claimants on a contingent fee basis and collected fees without the required approval.  Petitioner Committee on Legal Ethics of the West Virginia State Bar recommended that he be suspended for these infractions and filed a complaint in the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to enforce the sanction.  The court denied enforcement, ruling that the scheme was unconstitutional because it effectively denied claimants necessary access to counsel and, alternatively, because it denied them the procedural safeguards provided by the Act.
Held:
1. Both sides have standing.  The Committee has standing on the basis of its classic interest as a government prosecuting agency in defending the law on which its prosecution is based, and there is therefore no need to inquire into the Department's standing.  Triplett has third-party standing by virtue of his claim that enforcement of the fee scheme against him deprives his clients of a due process right to obtain legal representation.  See Secretary of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947,  467 U. S. 964-958.  ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, distinguished.  There is no question that such a right is placed at issue here, since at least one of Triplett's clients received benefits that the Government was seeking to recover as erroneously paid.  Pp.  494 U. S. 719-721.
2. The Department's fee limitation scheme does not violate due process.  Pp.  494 U. S. 721-727.
(a) In light of the Government's obvious and legitimate interest in protecting claimants and others who may be required by the Act to pay 
Page 494 U. S. 716
 fees, the Department's scheme is entitled to a heavy presumption of constitutionality.  Respondent must prove that the scheme made attorneys unavailable to his prospective clients at the time he violated the Act.  See Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305.  The ""factual record"" upon which the state court relied is blatantly insufficient to meet respondent's burden.  The only nonanecdotal evidence in the record powerfully suggests that claimants whose chances of success are high enough to attract contingent-fee lawyers have no difficulty finding them.  Pp.  494 U. S. 721-726.
(b) The state court's alternative holding that the fee scheme violated due process by depriving claimants of statutory procedural safeguards, including the right to counsel, is disposed of by the conclusion that they have not been deprived of their asserted constitutional right to representation.

The only nonanecdotal evidence in the record powerfully suggests that claimants whose chances of success are high enough to attract contingent-fee lawyers have no difficulty finding them.  Pp.  494 U. S. 721-726.
(b) The state court's alternative holding that the fee scheme violated due process by depriving claimants of statutory procedural safeguards, including the right to counsel, is disposed of by the conclusion that they have not been deprived of their asserted constitutional right to representation.

No. 88-1993
Argued January 16, 1990
Decided March 21, 1990
494 U.S. 624

Syllabus 
When respondent Smith, a reporter, testified before a state grand jury about alleged improprieties committed by certain public officials, he was warned that, if he revealed his testimony in any manner, he would be subject to criminal prosecution under Fla.Stat.  905.27, which prohibits, inter alios, a witness from ever disclosing testimony given before a grand jury.  After the grand jury terminated its investigation, Smith -- who wanted to write about the investigation's subject matter, including, inter alia, his grand jury testimony -- filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that  905.27 was an unconstitutional abridgment of speech and an injunction preventing the State from prosecuting him.  The court granted summary judgment to the State, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It held that  905.27 is unconstitutional to the extent that it applies to witnesses who speak about their own testimony after the grand jury investigation is terminated.
Held:  Section 905.27 violates the First Amendment insofar as it prohibits a grand jury witness from disclosing his own testimony after the grand jury's term has ended.  Pp.  494 U. S. 629-636.
(a) To determine the validity of Florida's ban, the State's interests in preserving the confidentiality of its grand jury proceedings must be balanced against Smith's asserted First Amendment rights.  See Landmark Communications Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829,  435 U. S. 838.  Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U. S. 20 -- which held that a protective order prohibiting a newspaper from publishing information which it had obtained through discovery procedures did not offend the First Amendment -- does not govern the validity of Florida's ban, since the instant case deals with divulging information that was in a witness' possession before he testified before the grand jury, not information he may have obtained from his participation in those proceedings.  State officials may not constitutionally punish publication of lawfully obtained truthful information about a matter of public importance absent a need to further a state interest of the highest order.  Pp.  494 U. S. 629-632.
(b) Florida's interests in preserving grand jury secrecy either are not served by, or are insufficient to warrant, its ban.  Once an investigation ends, there is no need to keep information from the targeted individual 
Page 494 U. S. 625
 to prevent his escape, since he will have been either exonerated or charged.  Nor is there a need to prevent the importuning of grand jurors whose deliberations will be over.  Similarly, the concern that some witnesses will be deterred from presenting testimony due to fears about retribution is not advanced by the ban, since any witness is free not to divulge his own testimony, and since the part of  905.27 that prohibits a witness from disclosing the testimony of another witness remains enforceable.  While Florida's interest in preventing the subornation of grand jury witnesses who will later testify at trial is served by the ban to the extent that the accused will have an additional opportunity to learn of the witness' existence, its effect is marginal, at best, and insufficient to outweigh the First Amendment interest involved.  With present day criminal procedure generally requiring disclosure of witnesses by the State, the witness' name will be available to the accused before trial anyway.  In addition, Florida has substantial criminal penalties for both perjury and witness tampering, and its courts have subpoena and contempt powers available to bring recalcitrant witnesses to the stand.  Although Florida has a substantial interest in seeing that persons who are exonerated will not be held up to public ridicule, that interest alone cannot justify the proscription of truthful speech, absent exceptional circumstances.  Pp.  494 U. S. 632-634.
(c) The fact that neither the drafters of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, nor the drafters of similar rules in the majority of the States, found it necessary to impose an obligation of secrecy on grand jury witnesses to protect any of the interests asserted by Florida is probative of the weight to be assigned those interests and the extent to which the ban in question is necessary to further them.  Pp.  494 U. S. 634-635.
(d) The ban's impact on Smith's ability to make a truthful public statement is dramatic.  Here, Smith, who before testifying was free to speak about information he possessed on matters of admitted public concern, believes that he is no longer free to communicate this information.  The potential for abuse of the ban, through its employment as a device to silence those who know of unlawful conduct or irregularities on the part of public officials, is apparent.  Pp.  494 U. S. 635-636.

Argued January 17, 1990

494 U.S. 638

Syllabus 
Respondents, migrant farmworkers employed by petitioner, received benefits under Florida workers' compensation law for injuries they suffered in an automobile accident while traveling to work in petitioner's van.  They subsequently filed suit against petitioner in Federal District Court, alleging that their injuries were attributable in part to petitioner's intentional violations of the motor vehicle safety provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA), 29 U.S.C.  1801 et seq., and accompanying regulations.  They sought actual and statutory damages for such violations pursuant to AWPA's private right of action provision,  1854.  The court granted petitioner summary judgment on the ground that the state workers' compensation law provides that its remedy is exclusive, and that respondents' receipt of benefits under that law therefore precluded them from recovering damages under AWPA for the same injuries.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that such an exclusivity provision does not bar a private AWPA suit.
Held:  Exclusivity provisions in state workers' compensation laws do not bar migrant workers from availing themselves of a private right of action under  1854.  Pp.  494 U. S. 642-651.
(a) The explicit language of AWPA's enforcement provisions -- which establishes a private right of action for ""[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation,""  1854(a) -- indicates that that right is unaffected by the availability of remedies under state workers' compensation law.  A congressional intent to the contrary is not established by AWPA's motor vehicle safety provisions, which permit employers to satisfy the statute's insurance and liability bond requirements through their state workers' compensation insurance.  The safety provisions appear in a Title far removed from the enforcement provisions, and the latter provisions contain Congress' sole express limitation on the availability of relief, which applies where no attempt was made to resolve the disputed issues before litigation.  Had Congress intended to limit further the availability of AWPA relief based on the adequacy of state workers' compensation remedies, it would have made that purpose clear in AWPA's enforcement provisions.  Moreover, the insurance waiver provision is not inconsistent with the availability of overlapping remedies under workers' compensation 
Page 494 U. S. 639
 laws and AWPA, since the agricultural employer, whether or not it has enrolled in a workers' compensation plan, will be liable under AWPA's enforcement provisions if the employee's actual damages exceed the required minimum insurance coverage.  Although Congress may choose to establish state remedies as adequate alternatives to federal relief, it cannot be assumed that private federal rights of action are conditioned on the unavailability of state remedies absent some indication to that effect.  Cases in which this Court has harmonized federal statutes that provide overlapping federal remedies are not to the contrary.  Pp.  494 U. S. 643-647.
(b) AWPA preempts state law to the limited extent that it does not permit States to supplant, rather than to supplement, the statute's remedial scheme.  Section 1871 -- which provides that AWPA
""is intended to supplement State law, and compliance with [the statute] shall not excuse any person from compliance with appropriate State law and regulation""
-- does not require this Court to give effect to the Florida exclusivity provision, even if that provision were intended to withdraw AWPA's private right of action.  Although  1871 permits States to supplement the statute's remedial scheme, it cannot be viewed as authorizing them to replace or supersede AWPA remedies.  Petitioner's claim that Congress intended to preserve the particular balance state workers' compensation laws generally strike between assurance of compensation and limited and exclusive employer liability is off target, since the fact that AWPA may affect that balance does not suggest that Congress intended AWPA's remedial provisions to be effective only in certain States.  Federal law applies in all States, and the scope of federal law is not curtailed where it conflicts with the policies purportedly underlying some state regulatory schemes.  State exclusivity provisions that attempt to withdraw federal remedies directly conflict with the federal scheme's purposes, and cannot be viewed as permissible interstitial regulation.  Pp.  494 U. S. 647-649.
(c) Even if AWPA's language establishing a private right of action is ambiguous as to the statute's preemptive scope, this Court need not defer to the Department of Labor's position that state workers' compensation benefits, where applicable, are the exclusive remedy for loss under the statute.  Congress expressly established the Judiciary, and not the Department, as the adjudicator of AWPA private rights of action, and the Department's statutory authorization to promulgate motor vehicle safety standards cannot bootstrap that agency into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.

|494 u.s. 545|"Lytle v. Household Manufacturing, Inc.
No. 88-334
Argued January 8, 1990
Decided March 20, 1990
494 U.S. 545

Syllabus 
Petitioner Lytle, an Afro-American, filed an action under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.  1981, alleging that respondent Schwitzer had terminated his employment because of his race and had retaliated against him for filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by subsequently providing inadequate references to prospective employers.  He requested a jury trial on all issues triable by a jury.  After concluding that Title VII provided the exclusive remedy, the District Court dismissed the  1981 claims and conducted a bench trial on the Title VII claims.  It granted Schwitzer's motion to dismiss the discriminatory discharge claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) at the close of Lytle's case in chief and entered a judgment for Schwitzer on the retaliation claim after both parties had presented all their evidence.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but noted that the dismissal of the  1981 claims was ""apparently erroneous"" because the Title VII and  1981 remedies were separate, independent, and distinct.  Nonetheless, it ruled that the District Court's findings with respect to the Title VII claims collaterally estopped Lytle from litigating his  1981 claims, because the elements of a cause of action under the two statutes are identical.  It rejected Lytle's claim that the Seventh Amendment -- which preserves the right to trial by jury for suits involving legal, as opposed to equitable, claims -- precluded according collateral estoppel effect to the District Court's findings, reasoning that the judicial interest in economy of resources overrode Lytle's interest in relitigating the issues before a jury.
Held:
1. The Seventh Amendment precludes according collateral estoppel effect to a district court's determinations of issues common to equitable and legal claims where the court resolved the equitable claims first solely because it erroneously dismissed the legal claims.  Pp.  494 U. S. 550-556.
(a) But for the dismissal of Lytle's  1981 legal claims, he would have been entitled to a jury trial on all issues common to them and his Title VII equitable claims, Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189,  415 U. S. 196, n. 11, 
Page 494 U. S. 546
 and the jury would have been required to resolve the legal claims before the court considered the equitable claims, Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S. 500,  359 U. S. 510-511; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469,  369 U. S. 473.  The holding in Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322 -- that a court's determinations of issues in an equitable action could collaterally estop relitigation of the same issues in a subsequent legal action without violating a litigant's right to a jury trial -- cannot be extended to the present situation.  Although the trial court had no legal issues before it when it made its findings, relitigation in this case would not in effect constitute a second, separate action, because it was only the court's erroneous dismissal of the  1981 claims that enabled it to resolve the equitable claims first.  It would be anomalous to hold that a district court cannot deprive a litigant of his right to a jury trial by resolving an equitable claim before a jury hears a legal claim raising common issues, but may accomplish the same result by erroneously dismissing the legal claim.  Pp.  494 U. S. 550-552.
(b) This conclusion is consistent with this Court's approach in cases involving a wrongful denial of a petitioner's right to a jury trial on legal issues, which is to reverse and remand each case in its entirety for a jury trial, rather than to accord the trial court's factual findings collateral estoppel effect.  See, e.g., Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33.  Furthermore, the purposes served by the collateral estoppel doctrine -- to protect parties from multiple lawsuits and the possibility of inconsistent decisions, and to conserve judicial resources -- do not justify applying it here.  This case involves one suit in which the plaintiff properly joined his legal and equitable claims.  Furthermore, relitigation would not dissipate judicial resources in ""needless litigation,"" because a new trial is essential to vindicating Lytle's Seventh Amendment rights.  Pp.  494 U. S. 552-554.
2. The argument that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed because the District Court would have directed a verdict in Schwitzer's favor even if the  1981 claims had been tried before a jury is rejected.  The contention that the court would have directed a verdict on the  1981 discriminatory discharge claim because it dismissed the similar Title VII claim ignores the important distinction between dismissal under Rule 41(b), which allows the court to determine the facts and the law in deciding whether to render judgment against the plaintiff before the close of all the evidence, and a directed verdict under Rule 50(a), which requires a court to draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  The court -- which noted that Lytle's interpretation of the evidence supporting his claim was ""reasonable"" -- would not necessarily

			"|"Lytle v. Household Manufacturing, Inc.
No. 88-334
Argued January 8, 1990
Decided March 20, 1990
494 U.S. 545

Syllabus 
Petitioner Lytle, an Afro-American, filed an action under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.  1981, alleging that respondent Schwitzer had terminated his employment because of his race and had retaliated against him for filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by subsequently providing inadequate references to prospective employers.  He requested a jury trial on all issues triable by a jury.  After concluding that Title VII provided the exclusive remedy, the District Court dismissed the  1981 claims and conducted a bench trial on the Title VII claims.  It granted Schwitzer's motion to dismiss the discriminatory discharge claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) at the close of Lytle's case in chief and entered a judgment for Schwitzer on the retaliation claim after both parties had presented all their evidence.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, but noted that the dismissal of the  1981 claims was ""apparently erroneous"" because the Title VII and  1981 remedies were separate, independent, and distinct.  Nonetheless, it ruled that the District Court's findings with respect to the Title VII claims collaterally estopped Lytle from litigating his  1981 claims, because the elements of a cause of action under the two statutes are identical.  It rejected Lytle's claim that the Seventh Amendment -- which preserves the right to trial by jury for suits involving legal, as opposed to equitable, claims -- precluded according collateral estoppel effect to the District Court's findings, reasoning that the judicial interest in economy of resources overrode Lytle's interest in relitigating the issues before a jury.
Held:
1. The Seventh Amendment precludes according collateral estoppel effect to a district court's determinations of issues common to equitable and legal claims where the court resolved the equitable claims first solely because it erroneously dismissed the legal claims.  Pp.  494 U. S. 550-556.
(a) But for the dismissal of Lytle's  1981 legal claims, he would have been entitled to a jury trial on all issues common to them and his Title VII equitable claims, Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189,  415 U. S. 196, n. 11, 
Page 494 U. S. 546
 and the jury would have been required to resolve the legal claims before the court considered the equitable claims, Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U. S. 500,  359 U. S. 510-511; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U. S. 469,  369 U. S. 473.  The holding in Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U. S. 322 -- that a court's determinations of issues in an equitable action could collaterally estop relitigation of the same issues in a subsequent legal action without violating a litigant's right to a jury trial -- cannot be extended to the present situation.  Although the trial court had no legal issues before it when it made its findings, relitigation in this case would not in effect constitute a second, separate action, because it was only the court's erroneous dismissal of the  1981 claims that enabled it to resolve the equitable claims first.  It would be anomalous to hold that a district court cannot deprive a litigant of his right to a jury trial by resolving an equitable claim before a jury hears a legal claim raising common issues, but may accomplish the same result by erroneously dismissing the legal claim.  Pp.  494 U. S. 550-552.
(b) This conclusion is consistent with this Court's approach in cases involving a wrongful denial of a petitioner's right to a jury trial on legal issues, which is to reverse and remand each case in its entirety for a jury trial, rather than to accord the trial court's factual findings collateral estoppel effect.  See, e.g., Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33.  Furthermore, the purposes served by the collateral estoppel doctrine -- to protect parties from multiple lawsuits and the possibility of inconsistent decisions, and to conserve judicial resources -- do not justify applying it here.  This case involves one suit in which the plaintiff properly joined his legal and equitable claims.  Furthermore, relitigation would not dissipate judicial resources in ""needless litigation,"" because a new trial is essential to vindicating Lytle's Seventh Amendment rights.  Pp.  494 U. S. 552-554.
2. The argument that the Court of Appeals' judgment should be affirmed because the District Court would have directed a verdict in Schwitzer's favor even if the  1981 claims had been tried before a jury is rejected.  The contention that the court would have directed a verdict on the  1981 discriminatory discharge claim because it dismissed the similar Title VII claim ignores the important distinction between dismissal under Rule 41(b), which allows the court to determine the facts and the law in deciding whether to render judgment against the plaintiff before the close of all the evidence, and a directed verdict under Rule 50(a), which requires a court to draw all factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  The court -- which noted that Lytle's interpretation of the evidence supporting his claim was ""reasonable"" -- would not necessarily 
Page 494 U. S. 547
 have taken the case away from the jury.  Schwitzer's argument with respect to Lytle's retaliation claim is even further off-base, because the trial court declined to dismiss that claim, and nothing in the record indicates that the court -- after hearing all the evidence -- reached the only reasonable conclusions, or that a jury could not have found the facts differently and entered a different verdict.  Pp.  494 U. S. 554-555.

No. 88-1719

494 U.S. 558

Syllabus 
McLean Trucking Company and petitioner Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Local No. 391 (Union) were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which covered respondent employees.  When the Union declined to refer to the grievance committee respondents' charges against McLean -- arising from McLean's layoff and recall policies -- on the ground that the relevant issues had been determined in two prior proceedings concerning complaints that the Union had referred to the committee on respondents' behalf, respondents filed suit in the District Court.  Alleging that McLean had breached the collective bargaining agreement in violation of  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and that the Union had violated its duty of fair representation, they requested injunctive relief and, inter alia, compensatory damages for lost wages and health benefits.  They also made a jury demand for all issues triable by a jury.  After McLean filed for bankruptcy, the action against it, and all claims for injunctive relief, were dismissed.  The Union then moved to strike the jury demand on the ground that no right to a jury trial exists in a duty of fair representation suit.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the Seventh Amendment entitled respondents to a jury trial on their claim for monetary relief.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
863 F.2d 334, affirmed.
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-B, and IV, concluding that the Seventh Amendment entitles respondents to a jury trial.  Pp.  494 U. S. 563-564,  494 U. S. 570-574.
(a) To recover money damages in an action for breach of the duty of fair representation, an employee must prove both that the employer's action violated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement and that the union breached its duty of fair representation in handling the grievance.  DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151,  462 U. S. 163-164.  Pp.  462 U. S. 563-564.
(b) The remedy respondents seek entitles them to a jury trial on all issues presented in the suit.  That remedy -- compensatory damages -- is traditionally legal relief, and has none of the attributes that must be present before this Court will characterize money damages as equitable.  
Page 494 U. S. 559
 The relief is not restitutionary, because the backpay sought is not money wrongfully held by the Union, but wages and benefits respondents would have received from McLean had the Union processed their grievances properly.  Nor is the monetary award incidental to, or intertwined with, injunctive relief, because respondents here are seeking only money damages.  Moreover, although backpay under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is considered an equitable remedy, this characterization does not require that money damages for breach of the duty of fair representation be considered equitable as well.  Congress has specifically characterized Title VII backpay as a form of ""equitable relief,"" but it has made no similar pronouncement regarding damages for breach of the duty of fair representation.  Further, this Court has noted that Title VII backpay sought from an employer would generally be restitutionary in nature.  Pp.  494 U. S. 570-574.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concluded in Part III-A:
1. To determine whether a particular action will resolve legal (as opposed to equitable) rights, such that the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial, courts must examine both the nature of the issues involved and, more importantly, the remedy sought.  Tull v. United States, 481 U. S. 412,  481 U. S. 417-418.  Pp.  494 U. S. 564-565.
2. A comparison of respondents' action to 18th-century causes of action leaves the jury trial question in equipoise, because it reveals that this action presents both equitable and legal issues.  The duty of fair representation claim is comparable to an equitable action by a trust beneficiary against a trustee for breach of fiduciary duty.  DelCostello, supra -- which, in determining the appropriate statute of limitations in a hybrid action, noted in dicta that an attorney malpractice action, historically an action at law, is the closest state law analogy to a duty of fair representation claim -- did not consider the trust analogy, which more fully captures the relationship between the Union and the represented employees.  Nevertheless, respondents' action cannot be characterized as wholly equitable, since the  301 issue -- which respondents must prove in order to prevail -- is comparable to a breach of contract claim, a legal issue.  United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, 451 U. S. 56.  Pp.  494 U. S. 565-570.
JUSTICE BRENNAN proposed that the historical test mandated by the Seventh Amendment should turn solely on the comparison of the relief sought to relief historically available in equity or at law, and that the Court should dispense with the process of comparing the right at issue with 18th-century English forms of action.  Since the nature of the remedy is always given more weight than the nature of the analogous right, it is unlikely that the proposed analysis would result in different decisions.  
Page 494 U. S. 560
 Comparisons of contemporary rights with ancient writs have needlessly convoluted Seventh Amendment jurisprudence and embroiled courts in recondite controversies better left to legal historians.  Moreover, the nature of the rights available under modern statutes is so remote in form and concept from 18th-century forms of action that, too often, there is no firm basis for comparison.  Because the nature of remedies available today corresponds far more directly to the nature of remedies available in Georgian England, the proposed analysis would not only be more manageable than the current test, but also more reliably grounded in history.  Pp.  494 U. S. 574-581.
JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that the relevant historical question is not whether the suit was specifically recognized at common law, but whether the nature of the substantive right asserted is analogous to common law rights, and whether the relief sought is typical of an action at law.  A sufficient basis for the Court's holding is provided by the evolution of the duty of fair representation doctrine through suits tried to juries, the well-recognized duty to scrutinize any proposed curtailment of the right to a jury trial with the utmost care, and the fact that a duty of fair representation action resembles a common law attorney malpractice action more closely than it does any other action.  Pp.  494 U. S. 581-584.

|494 u.s. 596|"United States v. Dalm
No. 88-1951
Argued January 10, 1990
Decided March 20, 1990
494 U.S. 596

Syllabus 
In 1975, respondent Dalm was appointed administratrix of her deceased former employer's estate.  In 1976 and 1977, she received payments from the decedent's brother, who wanted her to share in the estate because of her years of service to the decedent.  In December, 1976, a federal gift tax return was filed, and the gift tax was paid, for that year's payment to Dalm.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) then assessed penalties and interest with respect to the 1976 transfer, which were paid in March, 1977.  No gift tax return was filed for the 1977 payment.  After auditing Dalm's 1976 and 1977 income tax returns, the IRS asserted deficiencies upon determining that she should have reported the payments from the brother as income to her as administratrix.  Arguing that the payments were gifts, she petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiencies, but made no claim for a credit or recoupment of the gift tax paid.  The parties settled the case, agreeing to a stipulated decision that Dalm owed lesser income tax deficiencies than those asserted for both tax years.  In November, 1984, she filed an administrative claim for refund of the gift tax, interest, and penalties paid with respect to the 1976 transfer, even though 26 U.S.C.  6511(a) required that any refund claim be filed within three years of when the return was filed.  When the IRS failed to act on the claim, she filed a District Court action for a refund of ""overpaid gift tax,"" alleging that the court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.  1346(a)(1).  The court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction in light of  6511(a), rejecting her contention that the suit was timely under the doctrine of equitable recoupment set forth in Bull v. United States, 295 U. S. 247.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that her claim satisfied all of the doctrine's requirements.
Held:  The District Court lacked jurisdiction over Dalm's refund suit.  Pp.  494 U. S. 601-611.
(a) Title 28 U.S.C.  1346(a)(1)'s provision of broad district court jurisdiction over civil tax refund suits must be read in conformity with other statutory provisions conditioning the right to bring such a suit, including 26 U.S.C.  7422(a), which requires the prior filing of an administrative refund claim, and  6511(a), which provides the applicable statute of limitations for filing such a claim.  Since Dalm failed to file her 
Page 494 U. S. 597
 claim within the specified time limits, the District Court was barred from entertaining her suit.  Pp.  494 U. S. 601-602.
(b) The statute of limitations long since having run, the doctrine of equitable recoupment does not support Dalm's suit.  Bull must be distinguished on the ground that, there, equitable recoupment of estate tax was sought in an action for refund of income tax, over which the court had undisputed jurisdiction, and the only issue was whether the court, in the interests of equity, could adjust the income tax owed to take account of an estate tax paid in error but which the petitioner could not recover in a separate, time-barred refund action.  Here, Dalm does not seek to invoke equitable recoupment in determining her income tax liability; she has already litigated that liability in the Tax Court without raising an equitable recoupment claim, and is foreclosed from litigating it now.  She seeks to invoke equitable recoupment only in a separate action for refund of gift tax, an action for which there is no statutory authorization by reason of the statute of limitations bar.  Bull and Stone v. White, 301 U. S. 532, stand only for the proposition that a party litigating a tax claim in a timely proceeding may, in that proceeding, seek recoupment of a related, and inconsistent, but now time-barred tax claim relating to the same transaction.  They do not allow equitable recoupment to be the sole basis for jurisdiction.  Pp.  494 U. S. 602-608.
(c) Since Dalm failed to comply with the applicable statute of limitations, the Government is immune from suit under settled principles of sovereign immunity.  See, e.g., United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834,  476 U. S. 841.  Because Dalm's action does not come within any of the statutory exceptions to the limitations period prescribed by  7422 and 6511(a), allowing her to maintain this suit would effectively override Congress' judgment as to when equity requires an exception.  Both the IRS and a court which has jurisdiction over a timely suit for refund may still consider an equitable recoupment claim for an earlier tax paid under an inconsistent theory on the same transaction.  Pp.  494 U. S. 608-610.
(d) The Court of Appeals' reasoning that recoupment should be permitted in this case because it effected, with respect to a single transaction, the recovery of a tax based upon a theory inconsistent with the theory upon which a later tax was paid mistakes the threshold requirement for such a suit.  Although this Court's precedents allowing recoupment pertain to cases where a single transaction is subject to inconsistent taxation, the reason the statute of limitations is not a bar in those cases is that, unlike here, the court has uncontested jurisdiction to adjudicate one of the taxes in question and, therefore, the equitable power to examine and consider the entire transaction.  See Rothensies v. Electric Storage Battery Co., 329 U. S. 296,  329 U. S. 299.  Pp.  329 U. S. 610-611.

Bull must be distinguished on the ground that, there, equitable recoupment of estate tax was sought in an action for refund of income tax, over which the court had undisputed jurisdiction, and the only issue was whether the court, in the interests of equity, could adjust the income tax owed to take account of an estate tax paid in error but which the petitioner could not recover in a separate, time-barred refund action.  Here, Dalm does not seek to invoke equitable recoupment in determining her income tax liability; she has already litigated that liability in the Tax Court without raising an equitable recoupment claim, and is foreclosed from litigating it now.  She seeks to invoke equitable recoupment only in a separate action for refund of gift tax, an action for which there is no statutory authorization by reason of the statute of limitations bar.  Bull and Stone v. White, 301 U. S. 532, stand only for the proposition that a party litigating a tax claim in a timely proceeding may, in that proceeding, seek recoupment of a related, and inconsistent, but now time-barred tax claim relating to the same transaction.  They do not allow equitable recoupment to be the sole basis for jurisdiction.  Pp.  494 U. S. 602-608.
(c) Since Dalm failed to comply with the applicable statute of limitations, the Government is immune from suit under settled principles of sovereign immunity.  See, e.g., United States v. Mottaz, 476 U. S. 834,  476 U. S. 841.  Because Dalm's action does not come within any of the statutory exceptions to the limitations period prescribed by  7422 and 6511(a), allowing her to maintain this suit would effectively override Congress' judgment as to when equity requires an exception.  Both the IRS and a court which has jurisdiction over a timely suit for refund may still consider an equitable recoupment claim for an earlier tax paid under an inconsistent theory on the same transaction.  Pp.  494 U. S. 608-610.
(d) The Court of Appeals' reasoning that recoupment should be permitted in this case because it effected, with respect to a single transaction, the recovery of a tax based upon a theory inconsistent with the theory upon which a later tax was paid mistakes the threshold requirement for such a suit.  Although this Court's precedents allowing recoupment pertain to cases where a single transaction is subject to inconsistent taxation, the reason the statute of limitations is not a bar in those cases is that, unlike here, the court has uncontested jurisdiction to adjudicate one of the taxes in question and, therefore, the equitable power to examine and consider the entire transaction.  See Rothensies v. Electric Storage Battery Co., 329 U. S. 296,  329 U. S. 299.  Pp.  329 U. S. 610-611.

 On the eve of his trial for several murders and robberies, petitioner William George Bonin moved to replace Earl Hanson, who had been his attorney for over a year, with William Charvet. The prosecution opposed the motion principally on the ground that substituting Charvet would create two conflicts of interest that could jeopardize the effectiveness of Charvet's representation. First, Charvet had maintained an attorney- client relationship with James Munro, Bonin's alleged accomplice and a key prosecution witness against him, during which Charvet and Munro had discussed the facts of the case. Second, the prosecution maintained that Charvet's retainer agreement likely included a provision giving him the literary rights to Bonin's life story. The trial court initially denied Bonin's motion to substitute Charvet for Hanson, in large part because it found that Charvet's relationship with Munro created an actual conflict of interest. The court later permitted Charvet to represent Bonin, however, without addressing either conflict and without obtaining a waiver from Bonin of his right to conflict-free counsel. 
 Bonin subsequently was convicted of 10 counts of murder and robbery and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court, in a split decision, affirmed the convictions and sentence, rejecting Bonin's argument that Charvet's alleged and actual conflicts of interest deprived Bonin of effective assistance of counsel. The court held that the trial court did not err by failing to explore the alleged literary rights agreement because the trial court had not been presented with sufficient evidence of such an agreement.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 March 19, 1990
 The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 In Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 797, 3376, 73 L. Ed.2d 1140 (1982), we held that imposing a death sentence on a defendant "" who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place"" violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments' prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. In Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U.S. 376, 390-391, 699-700 (1986), the Court reaffirmed and expanded upon Enmund, holding that the federal courts could not make the determination that a defendant met one of the Enmund criteria on their review of state-court judgments. Rather, we held that ""the State's judicial process leading to the imposition of the death penalty must at some point provide for a finding of that factual predicate."" 474 U.S., at 390-391. In Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 158, 107 S. Ct. 1676, 1688 (1987), this Court held that a showing of both reckless indifference to human life and major participation in a felony would be sufficient to satisfy Enmund. The Court refused to make those findings itself, however, instead remanding to the state courts for a determination whether those factors were present. 481 U.S., at 158. 
 In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that Enmund, Cabana, and Tison were satisfied solely on the basis of the Florida Supreme Court's determination that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that 
Page 494 U.S. 1047 , 1048
 defendant had the intent to kill. In refusing to review the decision below, this Court sanctions a grave departure from our precedents by a panel of a court with a major role in the administration of this Nation's death penalty law. Accordingly, I dissent. 
 Respondent does not dispute the basic rule that a State may not sentence to death a defendant ""who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place,"" Enmund, supra, 458 U.S., at 797, unless that defendant was a major participant in a felony and exhibited reckless indifference to human life, Tison, supra, 481 U.S., at 158. Nor does respondent suggest that a federal court may make the required finding. Instead, the issue in this case is whether a state court's conclusion that ""there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found [Smith] guilty of premeditated murder ,"" Smith v. State, 424 So.2d 726, 733 (1983), constitutes the culpability finding required by our cases. 
 The entirety of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning on this point is that ""[i]mplicit in [the Florida Supreme Court's sufficiency] finding is the conclusion that Smith had the intent to kill."" 840 F.2d 787, 793 ( 1988). Simply asserting a conclusion is hardly sufficient to justify it, especially where, as here, the conclusion is so plainly far-fetched. The Florida court's finding that the evidence was sufficient for Smith's jury to find him guilty of premeditated murder is nothing more than a finding that reasonable people could have found that verdict justified; it is emphatically not a finding that this jury did determine that Smith's acts were premeditated. Indeed, the Cabana Court rejected as insufficient a state court's statement far more conclusive than the one here. There, the Mississippi Supreme Court found that "" '[t]he evidence [was] overwhelming that [defendant] was an active participant in the assault and homicide.' "" Cabana, 474 U.S., at 389. Although this finding was "" sufficient to make [the defendant] liable for the murder and deserving of the death penalty in light of Mississippi law,"" it did not satisfy the Eighth Amendment. Ibid. 
 That the Florida court did not make the required finding is particularly apparent from an examination of its opinion as a whole. In response to an unrelated guilt-phase point of error, the court found that Smith could have been found guilty and sentenced to death on either of two theories, one of which was the felony-murder doctrine. 424 So.2d, at 731 .

No. 88-512
Argued Oct. 11, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 344

Syllabus 
Following respondent Harvey's arraignment on rape charges and the appointment of counsel for him, he told a police officer that he wanted to make a statement, but did not know whether he should talk to his lawyer.  Although the record is unclear as to the entire context of the discussion, the officer told Harvey that he did not need to speak with his attorney, because ""his lawyer was going to get a copy of the statement anyway.""  Harvey then signed a constitutional rights waiver form and made a statement detailing his version of the events on the night in question.  When his testimony at his state court bench trial conflicted with his statement to the police, the court allowed the State to use the statement to impeach his testimony.  He was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, but the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed.  That court ruled that the statement was inadmissible even for impeachment purposes, because it was taken in violation of Harvey's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, citing Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625.  The State concedes that the police transgressed the rule of Jackson, which held that, once a defendant invokes his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, any waiver of that right -- even if voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under traditional standards -- is presumed invalid if given in a police-initiated discussion, and that evidence obtained pursuant to that waiver is inadmissible in the prosecution's case-in-chief.
Held:  A statement to police taken in violation of Jackson may be used to impeach a defendant's testimony.  The Jackson rule is based on the identical ""prophylactic rule"" announced in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, in the context of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.  Moreover, Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, and subsequent cases have held that voluntary statements taken in violation of Fifth Amendment prophylactic rules, while inadmissible in the prosecution's case-in-chief, may nevertheless be used to impeach the defendant's conflicting testimony.  There is no reason for a different result in a Jackson case.  Harvey's argument for distinguishing such cases from Fifth Amendment cases -- that, because the adversarial process is commenced at the time of a Jackson violation, postarraignment interrogations implicate the constitutional guarantee of the Sixth Amendment itself, whereas prearraignment Fifth Amendment violations relate only to procedural safeguards that are not themselves constitutionally protected rights -- is without merit.  Nothing in the

 Sixth Amendment prevents a suspect charged with a crime and represented by counsel from voluntarily choosing, on his own, to speak with police in the absence of an attorney.  Cf. Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285.  Moreover, Harvey's view would render the Jackson rule wholly unnecessary, because even waivers given during defendant-initiated conversations would be per se involuntary or otherwise invalid, unless counsel were first notified.  Harvey's alternative assertion -- that the police officer who took his statement affirmatively mislead him as to his need for counsel and therefore violated the ""core value"" of the Sixth Amendment's constitutional guarantee, such that his purported waiver is invalid and the statement may not be used even for impeachment purposes -- is also unavailing, since the present record is insufficient to determine whether there was a knowing and voluntary waiver of Sixth Amendment rights.

|494 u.s. 370|"Boyde v. California
No. 88-6613
Argued Nov. 28, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 370

Syllabus 
All of the evidence presented by petitioner Boyde during the penalty phase of his state-court capital murder trial related to his background and character.  The trial court instructed the jury, inter alia, in accordance with instructions 8.84.1 and 8.84.2, 1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal (4th ed.) (CALJIC), both of which have since been amended.  At the time, CALJIC 8.84.1 listed 11 factors that the jury ""shall consider"" in determining whether to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment, the last of which was the so-called ""unadorned version"" of factor (k), which read:
""Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.""
The court also instructed the jury, pursuant to former CALJIC 8.84.2, to consider all applicable aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and directed that it ""shall impose"" a sentence either of death or of life imprisonment depending upon whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances or vice versa.  The jury imposed the death sentence, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting Boyde's contention that the aforesaid versions of CALJIC 8.84.1 and 8.84.2 violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. The giving of former CALJIC 8.84.2 did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Boyde's claim that the mandatory nature of the instruction's ""shall impose"" language prevented the jury from making an ""individualized assessment"" of the death penalty's appropriateness is foreclosed by Blystone v. Pennsylvania, ante p.  494 U. S. 299, which rejected a challenge to an instruction with similar mandatory language, holding that the requirement of individualized capital sentencing is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.  Boyde has not alleged that the instruction's mandatory language interfered with the consideration of such evidence.  Moreover, there is no constitutional basis for his suggestion that the jury must have unfettered discretion to decline to impose the death penalty even if it decides that the aggravating circumstances ""outweigh"" the mitigating circumstances.  States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.  Pp.  494 U. S. 376-377.
2. The giving of former CALJIC 8.84.1 did not violate the Eighth Amendment by precluding the jury from considering non-crime-related 
Page 494 U. S. 371
 factors, such as Boyde's background and character, as mitigating evidence.  Pp.  494 U. S. 377-386.
(a) Where, as here, the claim is that a challenged instruction is ambiguous, and therefore subject to erroneous interpretation, the proper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.  Although a defendant need not establish that the jury was more likely than not to have been impermissibly inhibited by the instruction, a capital sentencing proceeding does not violate the Eighth Amendment if there is only a possibility of such an inhibition.  Pp.  494 U. S. 378-381.
(b) There is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurors here interpreted the trial court's instructions to preclude consideration of mitigating evidence of Boyde's background and character.  ""Unadorned"" factor (k) standing alone did not, as Boyde seems to suggest, limit the jury's consideration to ""any other circumstance of the crime,"" but directed the jury to consider any other circumstance that might excuse a crime, which certainly includes background and character.  Moreover, when factor (k) is viewed together with other CALJIC 8.84.1 factors allowing for consideration of mitigating evidence not associated with the crime itself -- such as the absence of prior criminal activity by, or felony convictions of, the defendant, and youth -- it seems even more improbable that the jurors would have arrived at an interpretation that precluded consideration of all non-crime-related evidence.  Similarly, reasonable jurors surely would not have felt constrained by the factor (k) instruction to ignore all of Boyde's unobjected-to penalty-phase evidence -- four days of testimony consuming over 400 pages of transcript -- particularly since the jury was also instructed that it ""shall consider all of the evidence . . . received during any part of the trial.""  Pp.  494 U. S. 381-384.
(c) There is no merit to Boyde's assertion that arguments by the prosecutor immediately before the jury's sentencing deliberations made it likely that the jurors would adopt an impermissible interpretation of the factor (k) instruction.  Such arguments generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court, are subject to objection and to correction by the court, and must be judged in the context in which they are made.  Here, although the prosecutor argued that in his view the evidence did not sufficiently mitigate Boyde's conduct, he never suggested that the background and character evidence could not be considered.  In fact, he made statements that explicitly assumed that such evidence was relevant, and defense counsel stressed the necessity of a broad reading of factor (k).  Pp.  494 U. S. 384-386.

			"|"Boyde v. California
No. 88-6613
Argued Nov. 28, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 370

Syllabus 
All of the evidence presented by petitioner Boyde during the penalty phase of his state-court capital murder trial related to his background and character.  The trial court instructed the jury, inter alia, in accordance with instructions 8.84.1 and 8.84.2, 1 California Jury Instructions, Criminal (4th ed.) (CALJIC), both of which have since been amended.  At the time, CALJIC 8.84.1 listed 11 factors that the jury ""shall consider"" in determining whether to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment, the last of which was the so-called ""unadorned version"" of factor (k), which read:
""Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.""
The court also instructed the jury, pursuant to former CALJIC 8.84.2, to consider all applicable aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and directed that it ""shall impose"" a sentence either of death or of life imprisonment depending upon whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances or vice versa.  The jury imposed the death sentence, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting Boyde's contention that the aforesaid versions of CALJIC 8.84.1 and 8.84.2 violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Held:
1. The giving of former CALJIC 8.84.2 did not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Boyde's claim that the mandatory nature of the instruction's ""shall impose"" language prevented the jury from making an ""individualized assessment"" of the death penalty's appropriateness is foreclosed by Blystone v. Pennsylvania, ante p.  494 U. S. 299, which rejected a challenge to an instruction with similar mandatory language, holding that the requirement of individualized capital sentencing is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.  Boyde has not alleged that the instruction's mandatory language interfered with the consideration of such evidence.  Moreover, there is no constitutional basis for his suggestion that the jury must have unfettered discretion to decline to impose the death penalty even if it decides that the aggravating circumstances ""outweigh"" the mitigating circumstances.  States are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.  Pp.  494 U. S. 376-377.
2. The giving of former CALJIC 8.84.1 did not violate the Eighth Amendment by precluding the jury from considering non-crime-related 
Page 494 U. S. 371
 factors, such as Boyde's background and character, as mitigating evidence.  Pp.  494 U. S. 377-386.
(a) Where, as here, the claim is that a challenged instruction is ambiguous, and therefore subject to erroneous interpretation, the proper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.  Although a defendant need not establish that the jury was more likely than not to have been impermissibly inhibited by the instruction, a capital sentencing proceeding does not violate the Eighth Amendment if there is only a possibility of such an inhibition.  Pp.  494 U. S. 378-381.
(b) There is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurors here interpreted the trial court's instructions to preclude consideration of mitigating evidence of Boyde's background and character.  ""Unadorned"" factor (k) standing alone did not, as Boyde seems to suggest, limit the jury's consideration to ""any other circumstance of the crime,"" but directed the jury to consider any other circumstance that might excuse a crime, which certainly includes background and character.  Moreover, when factor (k) is viewed together with other CALJIC 8.84.1 factors allowing for consideration of mitigating evidence not associated with the crime itself -- such as the absence of prior criminal activity by, or felony convictions of, the defendant, and youth -- it seems even more improbable that the jurors would have arrived at an interpretation that precluded consideration of all non-crime-related evidence.

Pp.  494 U. S. 381-384.
(c) There is no merit to Boyde's assertion that arguments by the prosecutor immediately before the jury's sentencing deliberations made it likely that the jurors would adopt an impermissible interpretation of the factor (k) instruction.  Such arguments generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court, are subject to objection and to correction by the court, and must be judged in the context in which they are made.

494 U.S. 407

Syllabus 
Six weeks after Pamela Lane was murdered, petitioner Butler was arrested on an unrelated assault charge for which he retained counsel.  While in custody, Butler was informed that he was a suspect in Lane's murder.  After receiving Miranda warnings, he signed waiver of rights forms and made incriminating statements about the Lane murder during interrogation.  At his capital murder trial, the court denied his motion to suppress these statements, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.  After his conviction became final on direct appeal, he filed a petition for federal habeas relief, which was dismissed by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting his argument that Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, requires the police, during continuous custody, to refrain from all further questioning once an accused invokes his right to counsel on any offense.  Subsequently, this Court handed down Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, which held that the Fifth Amendment bars police-initiated interrogation following a suspect's request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation.  The Court of Appeals denied Butler's request for rehearing.  It reasoned that he was not entitled to the retroactive benefit of Roberson.  According to the court, the Edwards-Roberson limitations on police interrogation are only tangentially related to the truthfinding function.  It viewed those limitations as part of the prophylactic protection of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel created to be ""guidelines"" for the law enforcement profession, and held that Butler's interrogation, while contrary to present ""guidelines,"" had been conducted in strict accordance with established law at the time.
Held:
1. Roberson announced a ""new rule,"" since its result was not dictated by a precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final, and is therefore inapplicable to cases on collateral review under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  The fact that a majority of this Court said that Roberson's case was directly controlled by Edwards is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether Roberson is a new rule under Teague.  Courts frequently view their decisions as ""controlled"" or ""governed"" by prior opinions, even when aware of reasonable contrary conclusions reached by other courts.  It would not have been an illogical or even a grudging 
Page 494 U. S. 408
 application of Edwards to decide that it did not extend to Roberson's facts, since -- as evidenced by the significant difference of opinion on the part of several lower courts that had considered the question previously -- Roberson's outcome was susceptible to debate among reasonable minds.  Pp.  494 U. S. 412-415.
2. Roberson's rule does not come within either of the exceptions under which a new rule is available on collateral review.  The first exception -- for a rule that places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe -- is clearly inapplicable.  The proscribed conduct in the instant case is capital murder, the prosecution of which is not prohibited by the Roberson rule, and Roberson did not address any categorical guarantees accorded by the Constitution, see Penry, supra, at  492 U. S. 329.  Nor did Roberson establish any principle that would come within the second exception.  The scope of that exception -- for a rule that requires the observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty -- is limited to those new procedures without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.  However, a violation of Roberson's added restrictions on police investigatory procedures may instead increase the likelihood of obtaining an accurate determination.  Pp.  494 U. S. 415-416.

No. 88-5909
Argued Oct. 10, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 433

Syllabus 
Petitioner was convicted in a North Carolina court of first-degree murder.  In the trial's sentencing phase, the jury made a binding recommendation of death after finding unanimously, as required by instructions given both orally and in a written verdict form:  (1) the existence of two statutory aggravating circumstances; (2) the existence of two of eight possible mitigating circumstances; (3) that the mitigating circumstances found were insufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found; and (4) that the aggravating circumstances found were sufficiently substantial to call for the imposition of the death penalty when considered with the mitigating circumstances found.  The State Supreme Court rejected petitioner's challenge to his sentence, distinguishing Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367.  In Mills, this Court reversed a death sentence imposed under Maryland's capital punishment scheme because that scheme precluded a jury from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular circumstance supported by that evidence.  In contrast to the Maryland procedure, which required the jury to impose a death penalty if it found at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or unanimously agreed that the mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravating ones, the court emphasized that Issue Four in North Carolina's scheme allowed the jury to recommend life imprisonment if it felt that the aggravating circumstances did not call for the death penalty even if it had found several aggravating circumstances and no mitigating ones.  The court also reasoned that, whereas in Maryland's scheme evidence remained ""legally relevant"" as long as one or more jurors found the presence of a mitigating circumstance supported by that evidence, in North Carolina's system, any evidence introduced to support a mitigating factor that the jury did not unanimously find is legally ""irrelevant"" and can be excluded from jurors' consideration.
Held:  North Carolina's unanimity requirement impermissibly limits jurors' consideration of mitigating evidence, and hence is contrary to this Court's decision in Mills, supra.  The State's Issue Four does not ameliorate the constitutional infirmity created by the requirement.  Although the jury can opt for life imprisonment without finding any mitigating circumstances, it is required to make its decision based only on the circumstances it unanimously finds in Issue Two.  Thus, one holdout 
Page 494 U. S. 434
 juror can prevent the others from giving effect to evidence they feel calls for a lesser sentence; moreover, even if all the jurors agree that there are some mitigating circumstances, they can not give effect to evidence supporting any of those circumstances unless they agree unanimously on the same circumstance.  In addition, the state court's holding distorts the concept of relevance.  The mitigating circumstances not unanimously found to be present by the jury did not become ""irrelevant"" to mitigation merely because one or more jurors either did not believe that the circumstance had been proved as a factual matter or did not think that the circumstance, though proved, mitigated the offense.  Furthermore, the mere declaration that evidence is ""legally irrelevant"" cannot bar the consideration of that evidence if the sentencer could reasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death.  Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1; Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104.  The State misplaces its reliance on Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, to support its view that the unanimity requirement is a standard of proof intended to ensure the reliability of mitigating evidence, as Patterson did not involve the validity of a capital sentencing procedure under the Eighth Amendment, which requires States to allow consideration of mitigating evidence.  It is no answer that the jury is permitted to ""consider"" mitigating evidence when it decides colt is primarily concerned with policy considerations. . . .  Conversely, adjudication is concerned with the determination of past and present rights and liabilities.
Id. at 13-14.
These statements cannot conceivably be reconciled with the Secretary's pion that may not be foreclosed by one or more jurors' failure to find a mitigating circumstance under Issue Two.  Moreover, requiring unanimity on mitigating factors is not constitutional merely because the State also requires unanimity on aggravating circumstances.  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Pp.  494 U.

|494 u.s. 472|"Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp.
No. 87-1955
Argued November 28, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 472

Syllabus 
Before 1987, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) allowed States to prohibit an out-of-state bank holding company from owning an in-state ""bank,"" which was defined to include an institution that both accepted demand deposits and engaged in the commercial lending business.  In 1981, appellee, an Illinois bank holding company, applied to Florida to establish and operate an ""industrial savings bank"" (ISB) in that State, averring that ""all deposit relationships"" would be insured ""to the maximum extent allowed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"" (FDIC).  Appellant Lewis, the State Comptroller, refused to process the application on the ground that two state statutes prohibited out-of-state holding companies from operating ISBs in Florida.  Appellee then filed a suit claiming that the state statutes violated the Commerce Clause, and the District Court granted summary judgment in its favor, ordering Lewis to process the application.  The court subsequently denied without explanation appellee's motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988.  In 1987, shortly before the Court of Appeals affirmed on the merits and remanded for an explanation of why the attorney's fees claim had been denied, amendments to the BHCA expanded the definition of ""bank"" to include all banks whose deposits are insured by the FDIC.  Lewis then filed a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the new legislation mooted the controversy because, since appellee's proposed ISB would have FDIC-insured deposits, the refusal to process the application was authorized by federal law, and hence immune from Commerce Clause challenge.  The court denied the petition, awarded appellee attorney's fees for the appeal, and remanded for the District Court to calculate the amount of that award and to determine whether an award was appropriate for work done in the District Court.
Held:
1. The case has been rendered moot by the 1987 BHCA amendments.  The only evidence in the record of appellee's stake in the case's outcome 
Page 494 U. S. 473
 is its application to establish and operate an FDIC-insured ISB, which stake was eliminated by the amendments.  The application constitutes no evidence that appellee intended to establish an uninsured bank, since ""insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent allowed"" envisions FDIC insurance.  There is no merit to appellee's argument that its suit nevertheless remains justiciable because its dispute with Florida is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Since Florida's allegedly unconstitutional action is no longer unconstitutional with respect to insured ISBs, there is no reasonable expectation that appellee will suffer the same wrong again.  Moreover, the State's refusal to issue a bank charter is not the sort of action which, by reason of the inherently short duration of the opportunity for remedy, is likely to evade review.  See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95,  461 U. S. 109.  Pp.  494 U. S. 477-482.
2. Appellee's postargument, ex parte affidavit averring its interest in opening, and explaining its failure to file an updated application for, an uninsured ISB will not be evaluated by this Court in the first instance.  Since, however, the case's mootness is attributable to a change in the governing legal framework, and since appellee may have a residual claim, which understandably was not asserted previously, that it intended to apply for an uninsured ISB not covered by the new framework, the case is remanded for consideration of such materials as the parties may submit to supplement the record.  See Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Inc., 404 U. S. 412,  404 U. S. 415.   494 U. S.  482-483.
3. Because the event that mooted the controversy occurred before the Court of Appeals' judgment, appellee was not, at the appeal stage, a ""prevailing party"" entitled to recover attorney's fees under  1988.  See Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1,  488 U. S. 3-4.  Whether appellee can be deemed a ""prevailing party"" in the District Court, and whether  1988 fees are available in a Commerce Clause challenge, must be resolved by the courts below in the first instance.  P.  494 U. S. 483.

			"|"Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp.
No. 87-1955
Argued November 28, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 472

Syllabus 
Before 1987, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) allowed States to prohibit an out-of-state bank holding company from owning an in-state ""bank,"" which was defined to include an institution that both accepted demand deposits and engaged in the commercial lending business.  In 1981, appellee, an Illinois bank holding company, applied to Florida to establish and operate an ""industrial savings bank"" (ISB) in that State, averring that ""all deposit relationships"" would be insured ""to the maximum extent allowed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"" (FDIC).  Appellant Lewis, the State Comptroller, refused to process the application on the ground that two state statutes prohibited out-of-state holding companies from operating ISBs in Florida.  Appellee then filed a suit claiming that the state statutes violated the Commerce Clause, and the District Court granted summary judgment in its favor, ordering Lewis to process the application.  The court subsequently denied without explanation appellee's motion for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988.  In 1987, shortly before the Court of Appeals affirmed on the merits and remanded for an explanation of why the attorney's fees claim had been denied, amendments to the BHCA expanded the definition of ""bank"" to include all banks whose deposits are insured by the FDIC.  Lewis then filed a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, arguing that the new legislation mooted the controversy because, since appellee's proposed ISB would have FDIC-insured deposits, the refusal to process the application was authorized by federal law, and hence immune from Commerce Clause challenge.  The court denied the petition, awarded appellee attorney's fees for the appeal, and remanded for the District Court to calculate the amount of that award and to determine whether an award was appropriate for work done in the District Court.
Held:
1. The case has been rendered moot by the 1987 BHCA amendments.  The only evidence in the record of appellee's stake in the case's outcome 
Page 494 U. S. 473
 is its application to establish and operate an FDIC-insured ISB, which stake was eliminated by the amendments.  The application constitutes no evidence that appellee intended to establish an uninsured bank, since ""insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent allowed"" envisions FDIC insurance.  There is no merit to appellee's argument that its suit nevertheless remains justiciable because its dispute with Florida is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review.""  Since Florida's allegedly unconstitutional action is no longer unconstitutional with respect to insured ISBs, there is no reasonable expectation that appellee will suffer the same wrong again.  Moreover, the State's refusal to issue a bank charter is not the sort of action which, by reason of the inherently short duration of the opportunity for remedy, is likely to evade review.  See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95,  461 U. S. 109.  Pp.  494 U. S. 477-482.
2. Appellee's postargument, ex parte affidavit averring its interest in opening, and explaining its failure to file an updated application for, an uninsured ISB will not be evaluated by this Court in the first instance.  Since, however, the case's mootness is attributable to a change in the governing legal framework, and since appellee may have a residual claim, which understandably was not asserted previously, that it intended to apply for an uninsured ISB not covered by the new framework, the case is remanded for consideration of such materials as the parties may submit to supplement the record.  See Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Inc., 404 U. S. 412,  404 U. S. 415.   494 U. S.  482-483.
3. Because the event that mooted the controversy occurred before the Court of Appeals' judgment, appellee was not, at the appeal stage, a ""prevailing party"" entitled to recover attorney's fees under  1988.  See Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1,  488 U. S. 3-4.  Whether appellee can be deemed a ""prevailing party"" in the District Court, and whether  1988 fees are available in a Commerce Clause challenge, must be resolved by the courts below in the first instance.  P.  494 U. S. 483.
827 F.2d 1517 and 838 F.2d 457, vacated and remanded.

|494 u.s. 484|"Saffle v. Parks
No. 88-1264
Argued November 1, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 484

Syllabus 
Respondent Parks' state court capital murder conviction and death sentence became final in 1983.  The Federal District Court denied his habeas corpus petition, which was based on the argument that, inter alia, an instruction delivered in the penalty phase of his trial, telling the jury to ""avoid any influence of sympathy,"" violated the Eighth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the instruction was unconstitutional because it in effect told the jury to disregard the mitigating evidence that Parks had presented.
Held:  Parks is not entitled to federal habeas relief.  The principle he urges is a ""new rule"" of federal constitutional law that can neither be announced nor applied in a case on collateral review unless it comes within one of two narrow -- and here inapplicable -- exceptions.  Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288; Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Pp.  492 U. S. 487-495.
(a) Parks' contention that the Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be allowed to base the sentencing decision upon the sympathy they feel for the defendant after hearing his mitigating evidence constitutes a ""new rule"" as defined in Teague and Penry, since a state court considering his claim at the time his conviction became final would not have concluded that it was compelled by existing precedent to adopt it.  Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, which were both decided before 1983, do not dictate the result urged by Parks, since those cases hold only that the State cannot bar relevant mitigating evidence from being presented and considered during a capital trial's penalty phase, and do not speak to how the State may guide the jury in considering and weighing that evidence.  The holding in Penry, supra, at  492 U. S. 315 -- that the relief sought there did not call for the creation of a new rule -- does not compel a similar result here.  Nor does the antisympathy instruction run afoul of Lockett and Eddings on the theory that jurors who react sympathetically to mitigating evidence may interpret the instruction as barring them from considering that evidence altogether.  At the very least, nothing in those cases prevents the State from attempting to ensure reliability and nonarbitrariness by requiring that the jury consider and give effect to the defendant's mitigating evidence in the form of a reasoned moral response, rather than an emotional one based on the whims or caprice of jurors.  Similarly, California v. 
Page 494 U. S. 485
 Brown, 479 U. S. 538,  479 U. S. 542 -- which approved an antisympathy instruction that prevented jurors from considering emotional responses not based on the evidence -- is of no assistance to Parks.  It is doubtful that a constitutional rule requiring that the jury be allowed to consider and give effect to emotions based on mitigating evidence may be inferred from Brown or is consistent with the Court's precedents.  Moreover, since Brown was decided after 1983, Parks can gain its benefit, if any, only by pursuing the untenable argument that Brown's reasoning, if not its result, was dictated by Lockett and Eddings.  Pp.  494 U. S. 487-494.
(b) The new rule sought by Parks does not come within either of the two exceptions set forth in Teague and Penry.  The first exception cannot be invoked, since Parks' proposed rule would neither decriminalize a class of private conduct nor prohibit the imposition of capital punishment on a particular class of persons.  The second exception is also inapplicable, since Parks' rule has none of the primacy and centrality of the type of ""watershed rule of criminal procedure"" that the exception contemplates.  The objectives of fairness and accuracy are more likely to be threatened than promoted by a rule allowing the sentence to turn not on whether the defendant, in the eyes of the community, is morally deserving of the death sentence, but on whether the defendant can strike an emotional chord in a juror.  Pp.  494 U. S. 494-495.

||"Ferens v. John Deere Co.
No. 88-1512
Argued November 6, 1989
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 516

Syllabus 
Petitioner husband lost a hand in Pennsylvania when it allegedly became caught in a harvester manufactured by respondent Deere, a Delaware corporation.  Petitioners, Pennsylvania residents, delayed taking legal action against Deere until after Pennsylvania's 2-year tort limitations period expired.  In the third year, they filed proper diversity suits (1) in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania, raising contract and warranty claims as to which the applicable Pennsylvania limitations period had not yet run, and (2) in a Federal District Court in Mississippi, where Deere did business, alleging tort causes of action.  As to the latter suit, petitioners knew that the federal court had to apply the Mississippi state courts' choice-of-law rules, Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487,  313 U. S. 496, under which Mississippi's 6-year tort statute of limitations would apply.  The Mississippi court then granted petitioners' motion to transfer the tort action to the Pennsylvania court under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a), which allows such transfers ""[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""  However, the Pennsylvania court declined to honor the Mississippi tort statute of limitations, ruling that, since petitioners had moved for transfer as plaintiffs, the rule in Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612 -- that, following a defendant-initiated  1404(a) transfer, the transferee court must follow the choice-of-law rules prevailing in the transferor court -- was inapplicable.  The court therefore dismissed the tort action under Pennsylvania's tort statute of limitations, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The policies underlying Van Dusen, as well as other considerations, require a transferee forum to apply the law of the transferor court, regardless of who initiated the transfer.  Pp.  494 U. S. 521-532.
(a) The Van Dusen policy that  1404(a) should not deprive parties of state law advantages that exist absent diversity jurisdiction is not violated by applying that case's rule to transfers initiated by plaintiffs.  Applying the transferor law will not deprive plaintiffs of any state law advantages.  Moreover, although a defendant may lose a nonlegal advantage if the transferor law controls -- e.g., Deere would lose whatever advantage inheres in forcing petitioners to litigate in Mississippi or not at all -- that loss is slight, since a plaintiff always can sue in the favorable state court or in diversity and not seek a transfer.  Section 1404(a) 
Page 494 U. S. 517
 exists to eliminate inconvenience without altering permissible choices under the federal venue statutes, and it is not its purpose to protect a party's ability to use inconvenience as a shield to discourage or hinder litigation otherwise proper.  Applying the transferor law in these circumstances is in full accord with the rule in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, whereas applying the transferee law would seriously undermine Erie, since it would mean that initiating a  1404(a) transfer changes the state law applicable in a diversity case, a result disapproved generally by this Court.  See Van Dusen, supra, at  376 U. S. 636-637.  Pp.  494 U. S. 524-527.
(b) Applying the transferor State's law with respect to plaintiff-initiated  1404(a) transfers does not contravene Van Dusen's policy against forum shopping, since, even without  1404(a), a plaintiff already has the option of shopping for a forum with the most favorable law.  Applying the transferee law, by contrast, might create opportunities for forum shopping in an indirect way, since such application, to the extent that it discourages plaintiff-initiated transfers, might give States incentives to enact laws similar to Mississippi's long tort statute of limitations in order to bring in out-of-state business that would not be moved at the instance of the plaintiff.  Pp.  494 U. S. 527-528.
(c) The Van Dusen policy mandating that the  1404(a) transfer decision turn upon considerations of convenience, rather than on the possibility of prejudice resulting from a change in the applicable law, requires application of the transferor law when a plaintiff initiates the transfer.  If a law change were to occur following such a transfer, a district court would be at least reluctant, despite convenience considerations, to grant a transfer that would prejudice the defendant.  Hardship might occur because plaintiffs may find as many opportunities to exploit application of the transferee law as they would the transferor law.  If the transferee law were to apply, moreover, the plaintiff simply would not move to transfer unless the benefits of convenience outweighed the loss of favorable law.  The desire to punish the plaintiff who has chosen an inconvenient forum overlooks the facts that  1404(a) exists for the benefit of witnesses and courts, as well as the moving party, and that litigation in an inconvenient forum harms the entire judicial system.  Pp.  494 U. S. 528-530.
(d) Foresight and judicial economy also favor the simple rule that the transferor law should apply regardless of who makes the  1404(a) motion.  While applying the transferee law to plaintiff-initiated transfers would eliminate cases such as this in the future, that rule would produce undesirable complications, and would result in litigation and uncertainty in cases presenting other situations -- e.g., a transfer at the request of both parties, or by the court on its own motion.  Pp.  494 U. S. 530-531. 
Page 494 U. S. 518

(e) Although requiring a district court in Pennsylvania to apply a Mississippi statute of limitations to a Pennsylvania cause of action might seem to be too generous to petitioners, and even to reward them for manipulative conduct, that does not affect the outcome of this case, since Congress gave them the power to seek a  1404(a) transfer, and Van Dusen already could require the same result.  Moreover, no alternative rule would be more acceptable.  Applying the transferee law would, in effect, tell petitioners that they should have continued litigating their separate actions in Pennsylvania and Mississippi, thereby causing the wastefulness of time, energy, and money that  1404(a) was designed to prevent.  Allowing them simply to file in the convenient forum, and then to request application of the law of the inconvenient forum, would ignore the fact that  1404(a) does not provide for an automatic transfer, but requires a showing of convenience, and that the transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""  And there is no need to develop more sophisticated federal choice-of-law rules to cover all diversity actions involving transfers, since state conflicts rules already ensure generally that appropriate laws will apply, and, even if more elaborate federal rules would not run afoul of Klaxon and Erie, applying the transferor law effects the appropriate balance between fairness and simplicity.

|494 u.s. 541|"Smith v. Ohio
No. 89-5999
Decided March 5, 1990
494 U.S. 541

Syllabus 
As petitioner Smith was approached by two police officers, he threw the bag he was carrying onto his car's hood and, when asked, refused to reveal its contents.  Although he attempted to protect the bag, one officer opened it and discovered drug paraphernalia that provided probable cause for Smith's arrest and evidence to support his conviction for drug abuse.  The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the bag's warrantless search under the exception for searches incident to arrest, finding that the search was constitutional because its fruits justified the arrest that followed.
Held:   A warrantless search providing probable cause for an arrest cannot be justified as an incident of that arrest.  While the incident to arrest exception permits the police to search a lawfully arrested individual and areas within his immediate control, it does not permit them to search any citizen without a warrant or probable cause so long as an arrest follows.  Contrary to the State's argument, a citizen who attempts to protect his private property from inspection, after throwing it on a car to respond to a police officer's inquiry, clearly has not abandoned his property.

Syllabus 
After the Government obtained an arrest warrant for respondent -- a Mexican citizen and resident believed to be a leader of an organization that smuggles narcotics into this country -- he was apprehended by Mexican police and transported here, where he was arrested.  Following his arrest, Drug Enforcement Administration agents, working with Mexican officials, searched his Mexican residences and seized certain documents.  The District Court granted his motion to suppress the evidence, concluding that the Fourth Amendment -- which protects ""the people"" against unreasonable searches and seizures -- applied to the searches, and that the DEA agents had failed to justify searching the premises without a warrant.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Citing Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1 -- which held that American citizens tried abroad by United States military officials were entitled to Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections -- the court concluded that the Constitution imposes substantive constraints on the Federal Government, even when it operates abroad.  Relying on INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U. S. 1032 -- where a majority assumed that illegal aliens in the United States have Fourth Amendment rights -- the court observed that it would be odd to acknowledge that respondent was entitled to trial-related rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, but not to Fourth Amendment protection.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment does not apply to the search and seizure by United States agents of property owned by a nonresident alien and located in a foreign country.  Pp.  494 U. S. 264-275.
(a) If there were a constitutional violation in this case, it occurred solely in Mexico, since a Fourth Amendment violation is fully accomplished at the time of an unreasonable governmental intrusion whether or not the evidence seized is sought for use in a criminal trial.  Thus, the Fourth Amendment functions differently from the Fifth Amendment, whose privilege against selfincrimination is a fundamental trial right of criminal defendants.  P.  494 U. S. 264.
(b) The Fourth Amendment phrase ""the people"" seems to be a term of art used in select parts of the Constitution, and contrasts with the words ""person"" and ""accused"" used in Articles of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments regulating criminal procedures.  This suggests that ""the people"" 
Page 494 U. S. 260
 refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.  Pp.  494 U. S. 264-266.
(c) The Fourth Amendment's drafting history shows that its purpose was to protect the people of the United States against arbitrary action by their own Government, and not to restrain the Federal Government's actions against aliens outside United States territory.  Nor is there any indication that the Amendment was understood by the Framers' contemporaries to apply to United States activities directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters.  Pp.  494 U. S. 266-268.
(d) The view that every constitutional provision applies wherever the Government exercises its power is contrary to this Court's decisions in the Insular Cases, which held that not all constitutional provisions apply to governmental activity even in territories where the United States has sovereign power.  See, e.g., Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298.  Indeed, the claim that extraterritorial aliens are entitled to rights under the Fifth Amendment -- which speaks in the relatively universal term of ""person"" -- has been emphatically rejected.  Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763,  339 U. S. 784.  Pp.  494 U. S. 268-269.
(e) Respondent's reliance on Reid, supra, is misplaced, since that case stands only for the proposition that United States citizens stationed abroad could invoke the protection of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Similarly, those cases in which aliens have been determined to enjoy certain constitutional rights establish only that aliens receive such protections when they have come within the territory of, and have developed substantial connections with, this country. See, e.g., Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202,  457 U. S. 212.  Respondent, however, is an alien with no previous significant voluntary connection with the United States, and his legal but involuntary presence here does not indicate any substantial connection with this country.  The Court of Appeals' reliance on INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, is also misplaced, since that case assumed that, but did not expressly address the question whether, the Fourth Amendment applies to illegal aliens in the United States.  Even assuming such aliens -- who are in this country voluntarily and presumably have accepted some societal obligations -- would be entitled to Fourth Amendment protections, their situation differs from that of respondent, who had no voluntary connection with this country that might place him among ""the people.""  This Court's decisions expressly according differing protection to aliens than to citizens also undermine respondent's claim that treating aliens differently under the Fourth Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  Pp.  494 U. S. 269-273.
(f) The Court of Appeals' rule would have significant and deleterious consequences for the United States in conducting activities beyond its 
Page 494 U. S. 261
 borders.  The rule would apply not only to law enforcement operations abroad, but also to other foreign operations -- such as armed forces actions -- which might result in ""searches and seizures.""  Under the rule, aliens with no attachment to this country might bring actions for damages to remedy claimed violations of the Fourth Amendment in foreign countries or in international waters, and Members of the Executive and Legislative Branches would be plunged into a sea of uncertainty as to what might be reasonable in the way of searches and seizures conducted abroad.  Any restrictions on searches and seizures incident to American action abroad must be imposed by the political branches through diplomatic understanding, treaty, or legislation.  Pp.  494 U.

494 U.S. 299

Syllabus 
After convicting petitioner of robbery, first-degree murder, and related crimes, a Pennsylvania jury -- having found as an aggravating circumstance that petitioner committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony and having found that no mitigating circumstances existed -- sentenced him to death.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner's argument that the State's death penalty statute -- which requires a sentence of death if a jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating circumstances that outweigh any mitigating ones -- is unconstitutional because it mandates a death sentence based on the outcome of the weighing process.
Held:  The Pennsylvania death penalty statute, and petitioner's sentence under it, comport with this Court's decisions interpreting the Eighth Amendment.  The statute satisfies the requirement that a capital-sentencing jury be allowed to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence since it does not unduly limit the types of mitigating evidence that may be considered.  Nor is the statute impermissibly mandatory.  Death is not automatically imposed upon conviction for certain types of murder, but is imposed only after a determination that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating ones present in the particular crime committed by the particular defendant, or that there are no such mitigating circumstances.  This is sufficient under Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, and Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, and Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325, distinguished.  Petitioner's argument that the mandatory feature of his jury instructions precluded the jury from considering whether the severity of his aggravating circumstance warranted the death sentence is rejected.  The presence of aggravating circumstances serves the purpose of limiting the class of death-eligible defendants, and the Eighth Amendment does not require that such circumstances be further refined or weighed by a jury.  Also rejected is petitioner's argument that the mandatory aspect of his jury instructions -- where the instructions additionally stated that the jury was allowed to consider, inter alia, whether petitioner was affected by ""extreme"" mental or emotional disturbance, whether he was ""substantially"" impaired from appreciating his conduct, or whether he acted under ""extreme"" duress -- foreclosed 
Page 494 U. S. 300
 the jury's consideration of lesser degrees of disturbance, impairment, or duress.  The judge clearly stated that these were merely items that the jury could consider, and that it was also entitled to consider ""any other mitigating matter concerning the character or record of the defendant, or the circumstances of his offense,"" an instruction that fully complies with the requirements of Lockett, supra, and Penry, supra.  That other States have enacted different forms of death penalty statutes which also satisfy constitutional requirements casts no doubt on Pennsylvania's choice, since within the constitutional limits defined by this Court's cases, the States enjoy their traditional latitude to prescribe the method of punishment for those who commit murder.

No. 88-1369
Argued Dec. 4, 1989
Decided Feb. 28, 1990
494 U.S. 325

Syllabus 
Following a Maryland armed robbery by two men, one of whom was wearing a red running suit, police obtained arrest warrants for respondent Buie and his suspected accomplice and executed the warrant for Buie at his house.  After Buie was arrested upon emerging from the basement, one of the officers entered the basement ""in case there was someone else"" there and seized a red running suit lying in plain view.  The trial court denied Buie's motion to suppress the running suit, the suit was introduced into evidence, and Buie was convicted of armed robbery and a weapons offense.  The intermediate appellate court affirmed the denial of the suppression motion, but the State Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the running suit was inadmissible because the officer who conducted the ""protective sweep"" of the basement did not have probable cause to believe that a serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger existed.
Held:  The Fourth Amendment permits a properly limited protective sweep in conjunction with an in-home arrest when the searching officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable 
Page 494 U. S. 326
 facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.  Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1049-1050; Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1,  392 U. S. 21.  Pp.  494 U. S. 330-337.
(a) In holding that, respectively, an on-the-street ""frisk"" and a roadside search of an automobile's passenger compartment were reasonable despite the absence of a warrant or probable cause, Terry and Long balanced the Fourth Amendment interests of the persons with whom they were dealing against the immediate interests of the police in protecting themselves from the danger posed by hidden weapons.  Here, the police had an analogous interest in taking steps to assure themselves that Buie's house was not harboring other person's who were dangerous and who could unexpectedly launch an attack, and the fact that Buie had an expectation of privacy in rooms that were not examined by the police prior to the arrest does not mean that such rooms were immune from entry.  No warrant was required, and as an incident to the arrest the officers could, as a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest from which an attack could be launched.  Beyond that, however, just as in Terry and Long, there must be articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger.  Such a protective sweep is not a full search of the premises, but may extend only to a cursory inspection of those spaces where a person may be found.  The sweep lasts no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.  Pp.  494 U. S. 331-336.
(b) Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 -- which held that, in the absence of a search warrant, the justifiable search incident to an in-home arrest could not extend beyond the arrestee's person and the area from within which he might have obtained a weapon -- is distinguished.  First, Chimel was concerned with a full-blown, top-to-bottom search of an entire house for evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made, not the more limited intrusion contemplated by a protective sweep.  Second, the justification for the search incident to arrest in Chimel was the threat posed by the arrestee, not the safety threat posed by the house, or more properly by unseen third parties in the house.  P.  494 U. S. 336.
(c) The Court of Appeals applied an unnecessarily strict Fourth Amendment standard in requiring a protective sweep to be justified by probable cause.  The case is remanded for application of the proper standard.  Pp.  494 U. S. 336-337.

When the individual petitioners terminated their employment with petitioner Boeing Company to accept important positions in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, Boeing made to each, before he became a Government employee, an unconditional lump sum payment to mitigate the substantial loss each expected to suffer by reason of his change in employment.  Subsequently, the United States filed a civil complaint in the District Court, seeking damages from Boeing and the imposition of a constructive trust on the monies received by the individual petitioners.
The complaint alleged that the payments had been made to supplement the individual petitioners' compensation as federal employees, and that they created a conflict of interest situation which induced the breach of the fiduciary duty of undivided loyalty owed by the individual petitioners to the Government, as measured by, inter alia, 18 U.S.C.  209(a), which makes it a crime for a private party to pay, and a Government employee to receive, supplemental compensation for the employee's Government service.  The court held, among other things, that  209(a) had not been violated because the payments were made before the recipients had become Government employees and were not intended to compensate them for Government service.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that employment status at the time of payment is not an element of a  209(a) violation, and that the finding that the payments were not intended to be supplemental compensation for Government service was clearly erroneous.
Held:  Section 209(a) does not apply to a severance payment that is made to encourage the payee to accept Government employment, but is made before the payee becomes a Government employee.  Pp.  494 U. S. 157-168.
(a) Section 209(a)'s text indicates that employment status is an element of the offense.  Neither of its two prohibitions -- the one directed to every person who ""receives"" any salary supplement ""as compensation for his services as an officer or employee"" -- and the other directed to every person who ""pays,"" or makes any contribution to the salary of, ""any officer or employee"" -- directly specifies when a payment must be made or

 received.  However, a literal reading of the second prohibition supports the conclusion that the payee must be a Government employee at the time the payment is made, and the prohibitions appear to be coextensive in their coverage of both sides of a single transaction.  Pp.  494 U. S. 158-160.
(b) The legislative history of  209(a), the language of  209(b) and (c) which obviously focus on certain other payments that are made while the recipient is a Government employee -- and the unambiguous language covering preemployment payments that Congress used in its contemporaneous revision of other bribery and conflicts provisions indicate that Congress did not intend to change the substance of  209(a)'s predecessor statute when it eliminated language that had unquestionably required a recipient of a payment to be a Government employee at the time the payment was made.  Pp.  494 U. S. 160-164.
(c) A literal reading of  209(a) serves one of the conflicting policies that motivated the enactment of the statute -- the public interest in recruiting personnel of the highest quality and capacity -- since it allows corporations to encourage qualified employees to make their special skills available to the Government.  While the other policy justifications for  209(a) concerns that the private paymaster will have an economic hold over the employee, that the payment will engender bitterness among fellow employees, and that the employee might tend to favor his former employer -- are not wholly inapplicable to unconditional preemployment severance payments, they by no means are as directly implicated as they are in the cases of ongoing salary supplements.  Pp.  494 U. S. 164-168.
(d) To the extent that any ambiguity over the temporal scope of  209(a) remains, the rule of lenity requires that it should be resolved in petitioners' favor unless and until Congress plainly states that its intent has been misconstrued.  P.  494 U. S. 168.

494 U.S. 185

Syllabus 
Respondent Arkoma Associates, a limited partnership organized under Arizona law, sued petitioners Carden and Limes on a contract dispute in the District Court relying on diversity of citizenship for federal jurisdiction.  Carden and Limes, Louisiana citizens, moved to dismiss on the ground that one of Arkoma's limited partners was also a Louisiana citizen.  The court denied the motion, finding the requisite ""complete diversity.""  After petitioner Magee Drilling Co. intervened and counterclaimed against Arkoma, the court awarded judgment to Arkoma.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding, with respect to the jurisdictional challenge, that complete diversity existed because Arkoma's citizenship should be determined by reference to the citizenship of its general, but not its limited, partners.
Held:
1. Complete diversity is lacking with respect to Carden and Limes.  Pp.  494 U. S. 187-197.
(a) A limited partnership is not in its own right a ""citizen"" of the State that created it within the meaning of the federal diversity statute.

(b) A federal court must look to the citizenship of a partnership's limited, as well as its general, partners to determine whether there is complete diversity.  That only the general partners have exclusive and complete control over the partnership's operations and the litigation is irrelevant.

No. 88-599
Argued Oct. 11, 1989
Decided Feb. 27, 1990
494 U.S. 210

Syllabus 
Respondent Harper has been a ward of the Washington state penal system since his 1976 robbery conviction.  Both as an inmate and while temporarily on parole, he received psychiatric treatment, including the consensual administration of antipsychotic drugs.  He has engaged in violent conduct, and his condition has deteriorated when he did not take the drugs.  On two occasions, he was transferred to the Special Offender Center (SOC or Center), a state institute for convicted felons with serious mental illness, where he was diagnosed as suffering from a manic-depressive disorder.  While at the Center, he was required to take antipsychotic drugs against his will pursuant to an SOC Policy.  The Policy provides, inter alia, that, if a psychiatrist orders such medication, an inmate may be involuntarily treated only if he (1) suffers from a ""mental disorder"" and (2) is ""gravely disabled"" or poses a ""likelihood of serious harm"" to himself or others; that, after a hearing and upon a finding that the above conditions are met, a special committee consisting of a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a Center official, none of whom may be currently involved in the inmate's diagnosis or treatment, may order involuntary medication if the psychiatrist is in the majority; and that the inmate has the right to notice of the hearing, the right to attend, present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses, the right to representation by a disinterested lay advisor versed in the psychological issues, the right to appeal to the Center's Superintendent, and the right to periodic review of any involuntary medication ordered.  In addition, state law gives him the right to state court review of the committee's decision.  Both of the involuntary treatment proceedings were conducted in accordance with the SOC policy.  During his second stay at the Center, but before his transfer to a state penitentiary, Harper filed suit in state court under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  The trial court rejected his claim that the failure to provide a judicial hearing before the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medication violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The State Supreme Court reversed and remanded, concluding that, under the Clause, the State could administer such medication to a competent, nonconsenting inmate only if, in a judicial hearing at which the inmate had the full panoply of adversarial procedural protections, the State proved by ""clear, cogent, and convincing"" evidence that 
Page 494 U. S. 211
 the medication was both necessary and effective for furthering a compelling state interest.
Held:
1. The case is not rendered moot by the fact that the State has ceased administering antipsychotic drugs to Harper against his will.  A live case or controversy remains, since there is no evidence that Harper has recovered from his mental illness; he continues to serve his sentence in the state prison system; and there is a strong likelihood that he may again be transferred to the Center, where officials would seek to administer antipsychotic medication pursuant to the Policy.  Thus, the alleged injury likely would recur but for the decision of the State Supreme Court.  Pp.  494 U. S. 218-219.
2. The Due Process Clause permits the State to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will, if he is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in his medical interest.  Although Harper has a liberty interest under the Clause in being free from the arbitrary administration of such medication, the Policy comports with substantive due process requirements, since it is reasonably related to the State's legitimate interest in combating the danger posed by a violent, mentally ill inmate.  The Policy is a rational means of furthering that interest, since it applies exclusively to mentally ill inmates who are gravely disabled or represent a significant danger to themselves or others; the drugs may be administered only for treatment and under the direction of a licensed psychiatrist; and there is little dispute in the psychiatric profession that the proper use of the drugs is an effective means of treating and controlling a mental illness likely to cause violent behavior.  Harper's contention that, as a precondition to antipsychotic drug treatment, the State must find him incompetent, and then obtain court approval of the treatment using a ""substituted judgment"" standard, is rejected, since it does not take account of the State's legitimate interest in treating him where medically appropriate for the purpose of reducing the danger he poses.  Similarly, it has not been shown the alternatives of physical restraints or seclusion would not accommodate his rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests.  Pp.  494 U. S. 219-227.
3. The Policy's administrative hearing procedures comport with procedural due process.  Pp.  494 U. S. 228-236.
(a) The Due Process Clause does not require a judicial hearing before the State may treat a mentally ill prisoner with antipsychotic drugs against his will.  Harper's not insubstantial liberty interest, when considered with the government interests involved and the efficacy of the particular procedural requirements, is adequately protected, and perhaps better served, by allowing the decision to medicate to be made by 
Page 494 U. S. 212
 medical professionals rather than a judge.  It cannot be assumed that a mentally disturbed patient's intentions, or a substituted judgment approximating those intentions, can be determined in a single judicial hearing apart from the realities of frequent and ongoing medical observation.  Nor can it be ignored that requiring judicial hearings will divert scarce prison resources from the care and treatment of mentally ill inmates.  Moreover, the risks associated with antipsychotic drugs are for the most part medical ones, best assessed by medical professionals.  The Policy contains adequate procedural safeguards to ensure that the prisoner's interests are taken into account.  In particular, the independence of the decisionmaker is adequately addressed, since none of the hearing committee members may be involved in the inmate's current treatment or diagnosis, and the record is devoid of evidence that staff members lack the necessary independence to provide a full and fair hearing.  Pp.  494 U. S. 228-235.
(b) The Policy's procedures satisfy due process requirements in all other respects.  The provisions mandating notice and the specified hearing rights satisfy the requirement of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and are not vitiated by prehearing meetings between the committee members and staff absent evidence of resulting bias or that the actual decision is made before the hearing. The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence, and the state court's ""clear, cogent, and convincing"" standard of proof is neither required nor helpful when medical personnel are making the judgment required by the Policy.  An inmate may obtain judicial review of the committee's decision, and the trial court found that the record complied under the Policy was adequate to allow such a review.  Nor is the Policy deficient in not allowing representation by counsel, since the provision of an independent lay advisor who understands the psychiatric issues is sufficient protection given the medical nature of the decision to be made.  Pp.  494 U. S. 235-236.

 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition to consider whether a trial court's decision to transfer a capital trial of an Afro-American defendant to a county with no residents of the defendant's race violates the Equal Protection Clause or the Sixth Amendment's fair cross section requirement, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Just as state prosecutors may not use peremptory challenges to exclude members of the defendant's race from the jury, Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), state trial courts may not transfer venue of the trial to accomplish the same result by another means. [ Mallett v. Missouri 494 U.S. 1009 (1990) ][1009-Continued.] 
 Jerome Mallett, an Afro-American, was arrested for the murder of a white police officer that occurred in Perry County, Missouri. In 1980, over 1,100 Afro-Americans lived in Perry County, out of a total population of 16,784. Mallett was originally brought to trial in that county, but he requested a change of venue because of prejudicial pretrial publicity. Both the defense and prosecution offered suggestions for an appropriate venue; defense counsel specifically expressed concern that some members of Mallett's race reside in whatever county the court chose. 
 The judge ordered the case transferred to Schuyler County, a location that neither attorney had suggested. According to the 1980 census figures, Schuyler County contained 4,964 whites and 3 Afro-Americans; at the time of the trial, however, there were no Afro-Americans in the county. Mallett was convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury in Schuyler County. His conviction was upheld on direct appeal. In his petition for state post-conviction relief, Mallett argued that the Perry County judge's decision to transfer venue to Schuyler County violated his rights 
Page 494 U.S. 1009 , 1010
 under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. After a hearing, a special judge ordered a new trial on both grounds; the State Supreme Court reversed his decision and affirmed the original sentence. 769 S.W. 2d 77 (1989) (en banc). 
 In Batson v. Kentucky, supra, 476 U.S., at 86, we held that ""[p]urposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire violates a defendant's right to equal protection because it denies him the protection that a trial by jury is intended to secure."" To make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination, a defendant must establish first that he is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the state has acted to remove members of that race from the venire; second, that the procedure used by the state permits those "" 'who are of a mind to discriminate' "" to do so; and third, that the facts and circumstances of the case raise the inference that the state acted in a discriminatory manner. 476 U.S., at 96. Once the defendant has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the state to present a neutral explanation to rebut the inference. Id., at 97. 
 Properly applying Batson to these facts, the special judge found purposeful discrimination in the court's transfer decision. Specifically, he found that 
 These facts give rise to a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination. The court's transfer decision reduced the number of Afro- Americans on Mallett's venire; the virtually unrestricted discretion of the trial judge to make the venue determination presented an opportunity to discriminate; and the judge transferred the case to a county with no members of Mallett's race. The trial judge failed to offer a ""specific or compelling"" neutral explanation for the transfer. Ibid. [494 U.S. 1009 , 1011]

No. 88-1434
Argued Nov. 6, 1989
Decided Feb. 21, 1990
494 U.S. 26

Syllabus 
Pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, petitioner Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated a Hazard Communications Standard, which imposed disclosure requirements on manufacturers aimed at ensuring that their employees were informed of the potential hazards posed by chemicals in the workplace.  Among other things, the Standard required the manufacturers to label hazardous chemical containers, conduct training on the chemicals' dangers, and make available to employees safety data sheets on the chemicals.  Respondents and others challenged the Standard in the Court of Appeals.  The court held that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) had not adequately explained why the Standard was limited to the manufacturing sector, and twice directed OSHA either to apply it to workplaces in other sectors of the economy or to state why such application would be infeasible.  Ultimately, DOL issued a revised Standard that applied to worksites in all sectors, and submitted it to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Act).  That Act sets forth a comprehensive scheme to reduce the federal paperwork burden on the public by requiring, inter alia, an agency to submit any instrument for the ""collection of information"" -- termed an ""information collection request"" -- to the OMB for approval before it may collect the information.  OMB disapproved three of the Standard's provisions on the ground that their requirements were not necessary to protect employees, and DOL published notice withdrawing the provisions.  Respondents sought further relief from the Court of Appeals, which ordered DOL to reinstate the disapproved provisions.  The court reasoned that the provisions represented good faith compliance by DOL with the court's prior orders, that OMB lacked the authority under the Act to disapprove the provisions, and that, therefore, DOL had no legitimate basis for withdrawing them.
Held:  The Act does not authorize OMB to review and countermand agency regulations mandating disclosure by regulated entities directly to third parties.  Pp.  494 U. S. 32-43.
(a) The Act's language indicates that the terms ""information collection request"" and ""collection of information"" -- which is defined as ""the obtaining 
Page 494 U. S. 27
 or soliciting of facts by an agency through . . . reporting or recordkeeping requirements"" -- refer solely to the collection of information by, or for the use of, a federal agency, rather than to disclosure rules, which do not result in information being made available for agency use.  Petitioners' interpretation of the above definition -- that an agency is ""soliciting facts"" when it requires someone to communicate specified data to a third party and that rules requiring labeling, employee training, and the keeping of accessible data sheets are ""reporting and recordkeeping requirements"" -- is precluded by the language, purpose, and structure of the Act as a whole.  Pp.  494 U. S. 34-35.
(b) Under the traditional canon of construction requiring that words grouped in a list be given a related meaning, the phrase ""reporting and recordkeeping requirements"" would comprise only rules requiring information to be sent or made available to a federal agency, not disclosure rules, since the other examples listed are forms for communicating information to a party requesting that information.  P.  494 U. S. 36.
(c) Moreover, disclosure rules present none of the problems Congress sought to solve, and none of the enumerated purposes would be served by subjecting such rules to the Act's provisions.  Pp.  494 U. S. 36-38.
(d) That Congress did not intend the Act to encompass disclosure rules is further revealed by the language and import of other provisions.  The internal preliminary steps that an agency must take before adopting an information collection request affect agencies only when they gather information for their own use, and do not relate to disclosure rules.  Likewise, the provisions governing OMB's review of proposed agency information collection requests focus on an agency's ability to use the information, particularly its ability to process it.  The Act does not authorize OMB to determine the usefulness of agency-adopted warning requirements to those being warned.  Furthermore, the Act's enforcement mechanism, by its terms, does not apply to disclosure rules, and its clear legislative history shows that Congress intended the provision to apply to all collections of information subject to the Act.  Pp.  494 U. S. 38-40.
(e) The Act's legislative history does not support petitioners' contention that Congress intended ""collection of information"" to include disclosure rules.  This Court need not defer to OMB's contrary interpretation where Congress' intent is clear.  Pp.  494 U. S. 40-41.
855 F.2d 108 (CA 3 1988), affirmed.

Syllabus 
In order to raise money to support its general business operations, the Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma sold uncollateralized and uninsured promissory notes payable on demand by the holder.  Offered to both Co-Op members and nonmembers and marketed as an ""Investment Program,"" the notes paid a variable interest rate higher than that of local financial institutions.  After the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy, petitioners, holders of the notes, filed suit in the District Court against the Co-Op's auditor, respondent's predecessor, alleging, inter alia, that it had violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- which regulates certain specified instruments, including ""any note[s]"" -- and Arkansas' securities laws by intentionally failing to follow generally accepted accounting principles that would have made the Co-Op's insolvency apparent to potential note purchasers.  Petitioners prevailed at trial, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Applying the test created in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293, to determine whether an instrument is an ""investment contract"" to the determination whether the Co-Op's instruments were ""notes,"" the court held that the notes were not securities under the 1934 Act or Arkansas law, and that the statutes' antifraud provisions therefore did not apply.
Held:  The demand notes issued by the Co-Op fall under the ""note"" category of instruments that are ""securities.""  Pp.  494 U. S. 60-76.
(a) Congress' purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.  However, notes are used in a variety of settings, not all of which involve investments.  Thus, they are not securities per se, but must be defined using the ""family resemblance"" test.  Under that test, a note is presumed to be a security unless it bears a strong resemblance, determined by examining four specified factors, to one of a judicially crafted list of categories of instrument that are not securities.  If the instrument is not sufficiently similar to a listed item, a court must decide whether another category should be added by examining the same factors.  The application of the Howey test to notes is rejected, since to hold that a ""note"" is not a ""security"" unless it meets a test designed for 
Page 494 U. S. 57
 an entirely different variety of instrument would make the 1933 and 1934 Acts' enumeration of many types of instruments superfluous and would be inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting the laws.  Pp.  494 U. S. 60-67.
(b) Applying the family resemblance approach, the notes at issue are ""securities.""  They do not resemble any of the enumerated categories of nonsecurities.  Nor does an examination of the four relevant factors suggest that they should be treated as nonsecurities:  (1) the Co-Op sold them to raise capital, and purchasers bought them to earn a profit in the form of interest, so that they are most naturally conceived as investments in a business enterprise; (2) there was ""common trading"" of the notes, which were offered and sold to a broad segment of the public; (3) the public reasonably perceived from advertisements for the notes that they were investments, and there were no countervailing factors that would have led a reasonable person to question this characterization; and (4) there was no risk-reducing factor that would make the application of the Securities Acts unnecessary, since the notes were uncollateralized and uninsured and would escape federal regulation entirely if the Acts were held not to apply.  The lower court's argument that the demand nature of the notes is very uncharacteristic of a security is unpersuasive, since an instrument's liquidity does not eliminate the risk associated with securities.  Pp.  494 U. S. 67-70.
(c) Respondent's contention that the notes fall within the statutory exception for ""any note . . . which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not less than nine months"" is rejected, since it rests entirely on the premise that Arkansas' statute of limitations for suits to collect demand notes -- which are due immediately -- is determinative of the notes' ""maturity,"" as that term is used in the federal Securities Acts.  The ""maturity"" of notes is a question of federal law, and Congress could not have intended that the Acts be applied differently to the same transactions depending on the accident of which State's law happens to apply.  Pp.  494 U. S. 70-72.
(d) Since, as a matter of federal law, the words of the statutory exception are far from plain with regard to demand notes, the exclusion must be interpreted in accordance with the exception's purpose.  Even assuming that Congress intended to create a bright-line rule exempting from coverage all notes of less than nine months' duration on the ground that short-term notes are sufficiently safe that the Securities Acts need not apply, that exemption would not cover the notes at issue here, which do not necessarily have short terms, since demand could just as easily be made years or decades into the future.

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when he ""finds that more or less than the correct amount"" of ""payment"" has been made under the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program, or of ""benefits"" has been paid under the Supplemental Security Income program, to make ""proper adjustment or recovery.""  If less than the correct amount has been paid, the Secretary shall pay the balance due; if more than the correct amount has been paid, the Secretary shall reduce future payment or obtain a refund from the beneficiary.

Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,  442 U. S. 697, interpreted that limitation as entitling the beneficiary to an oral hearing on waiver of recoupment.

If the beneficiary was overpaid in certain months and underpaid in others, the Secretary will net the errors (i.e., calculate the difference between the underpayments and the overpayments) and treat the netted amount as an overpayment or underpayment, as the case may be, for purposes of adjustment or recovery.  In this case, after the Secretary made both underpayments and overpayments to each respondent, he netted the errors, paid the net underpayments, and offered recoupment waiver hearings as to the net overpayments.

(a) The regulations are based on a permissible construction of the Act.  The Act authorizes the Secretary to determine whether ""more or less than the correct amount"" has been paid; and the ""correct amount"" can

 reasonably be construed to mean the net amount owing as of the date of the determination, rather than the amount owing each month.  The Act refers to the correct amount ""of payment,"" not of ""any payment"" (as it does elsewhere), which suggests computation on a multipayment basis.  Nor does the restriction on ""adjustment or recovery"" of overpayments foreclose the netting regulations.  These terms do not necessarily embrace all collection methods.  The Secretary has reasonably interpreted ""adjustment"" to mean a reduction in future payments, and ""recovery"" to mean refund.  Pp.  494 U. S. 89-93.
(b) The method of computing the netting period does not make the regulations arbitrary and capricious.  The inevitable delay between the discovery that something is amiss and the formal ""initial determination"" of error (which closes the netting period) is necessary to avoid spur-of-the-moment decisions.  The Secretary's regulations limit delay, and the hypothesis that the Secretary will deliberately delay to net-in additional underpayments is implausible.  The respondents' alternative regime of separate accounting would increase the administrative burden, and their alternative suggestion of delayed reimbursement of underpayments does not address the alleged delay problem.

494 U.S. 83

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, when he ""finds that more or less than the correct amount"" of ""payment"" has been made under the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program, or of ""benefits"" has been paid under the Supplemental Security Income program, to make ""proper adjustment or recovery.""  If less than the correct amount has been paid, the Secretary shall pay the balance due; if more than the correct amount has been paid, the Secretary shall reduce future payment or obtain a refund from the beneficiary.  The Act prohibits, however, ""adjustment of payments to, or recovery . . . from, any person who is without fault,"" if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the Act's purposes or be against equity and good conscience.  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682,  442 U. S. 697, interpreted that limitation as entitling the beneficiary to an oral hearing on waiver of recoupment.

Argued January 17, 1990
Decided Feb. 21, 1990
494 U.S. 108

Syllabus 
Petitioner Selvage filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a Court of Appeals' decision refusing to grant a stay of execution.  This Court stayed the execution and withheld disposition of the petition pending the decision in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302.  Following that decision, certiorari was granted to answer the question whether, at the time of trial, there was cause for not raising a claim based upon arguments later accepted in Penry v. Lynaugh, supra, and, if not, whether the application of a procedural bar to the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
Held:  The case is remanded for a determination whether Selvage's Penry claim is presently procedurally barred under Texas law.  The Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice disputes his argument that his Penry claim would no longer be deemed procedurally barred by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  However, since Penry was handed down after his petition for certiorari was filed, and may have affected the state court's view on whether the claim is presently barred, this issue should be decided by the Court of Appeals before the question on which certiorari was granted is addressed.
842 F.2d 89 vacated and remanded.

493 U.S. 521

Syllabus 
The Social Security Act authorizes the payment of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits to, inter alios, a child who suffers from an impairment of ""comparable severity"" 
Page 493 U. S. 522
 to one that would render an adult disabled.  An adult is disabled if he is prevented from engaging in any substantial gainful activity by reason of certain medically determinable physical or mental impairments.  Petitioner Secretary of Health and Human Services has created a 5-step test to determine adult disability.  At the test's third step, a claimant may be found to be disabled if medical evidence of his impairment matches or is equal to one of a listing of impairments presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful activity, thus making further inquiry unnecessary.  However, since the listings' medical criteria are more restrictive than the statutory disability standard, an adult claimant who does not qualify at the third step may do so after showing, at the fourth and fifth steps, that he cannot engage in his past work or other work in the economy, given his age, education, and work experience.  In contrast, the Secretary's test for determining whether a child claimant is disabled ends if the claimant cannot show that his impairment matches or is equal to a listed impairment, there being no further inquiry corresponding to the final, vocational steps of the adult test.  Respondent Zebley, a child who was denied SSI benefits, brought a class action in the District Court challenging the child-disability regulations.  The court granted summary judgment for the Secretary.  The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment in part, finding the regulatory scheme to be inconsistent with the Act, because the listings-only approach does not account for all impairments of ""comparable severity,"" and denies child claimants the individualized functional assessment that the statutory standard requires and that the Secretary provides to adults.
Held:  The child-disability regulations are inconsistent with the statutory standard of ""comparable severity.""   493 U. S.  528-541.
(a) While adults who do not qualify under the listings still have the opportunity to show that they are disabled at the last steps of the Secretary's test, no similar opportunity exists for children, who are denied benefits even if their impairments are of ""comparable severity"" to ones that would actually (though not presumptively) disable adults.  Pp.  493 U. S. 529-536.
(b) The Secretary's regulatory scheme -- which applies the same approach to child-disability claimants and to claimants for widows' and widowers' Social Security disability benefits, despite the fact that the Act uses a stricter standard for widows' benefits -- nullifies the congressional choice to link the child-disability standard to the more liberal test applied to adult disability claims.   493 U. S.  536-537.
(c) The Secretary's argument that the listings-only approach is the only practicable way to determine whether a child's impairment is comparable to one that would disable an adult is rejected.  Even if they were set at the statutory level of severity, no set of listings could ensure that child claimants would receive benefits whenever their impairments are of comparable severity to ones that would qualify an adult for benefits under the individualized functional analysis contemplated by the statute and provided to adults.  That a vocational analysis is inapplicable to children does not mean that a functional analysis cannot be applied to them, since an inquiry into an impairment's impact on a child's normal daily activities is no more amorphous or unmanageable than an inquiry into the impact of an adult's impairment on his ability to perform any kind of substantial gainful work that exists in the economy.  Moreover, the Secretary tacitly acknowledges that functional assessment of child claimants is possible in that some of his own listings are defined in terms of functional criteria, and the test for cessation of disability involves an examination of a child claimant's ability to perform age-appropriate activities.

Nos. 88-1182, 88-6651
Argued Nov. 7, 1989
Decided Feb. 20, 1990
493 U.S. 549

Syllabus 
Based on evidence that respondent Bouknight had abused petitioner Maurice M., her infant son, petitioner Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS) secured a Juvenile Court order removing Maurice from Bouknight's control.  That order was subsequently modified to return custody to Bouknight pursuant to extensive conditions and subject to further court order.  After Bouknight violated the order's conditions, the court granted BCDSS' petition to remove Maurice from her control and held her in civil contempt when she failed to produce the child as ordered.  Rejecting her subsequent claim that the contempt order violated the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination, the court stated that the contempt would be purged by the production of Maurice and was issued not because Bouknight refused to testify but because she failed to obey the production order.  In vacating the Juvenile Court's judgment upholding the contempt order, the State Court of Appeals found that that order unconstitutionally compelled Bouknight to admit through the act of production a measure of continuing control over Maurice in circumstances in which she had a reasonable apprehension that she would be prosecuted.
Held:  A mother who is the custodian of her child pursuant to a court order may not invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to resist a subsequent court order to produce the child.   493 U. S.  554-556.
(a) Although the privilege applies only when an accused is compelled to make an incriminating testimonial communication, the fact that Bouknight could comply with the order through the unadorned act of producing Maurice does not necessarily deprive her of the privilege, because the act of complying may testify to the existence, possession, or authenticity of the thing produced.  See, e.g., United States v. Doe, 465 U. S. 605.   493 U. S.  554-555.
(b) Even assuming that the act of production would amount to a communication regarding Bouknight's control over and possession of Maurice that is sufficiently incriminating and testimonial in character, she may not invoke the privilege to resist the production order in the present 
Page 493 U. S. 550
 circumstances.  The ability to invoke the privilege is greatly diminished when invocation would interfere with the effective operation of a generally applicable regulatory regime constructed to effect the State's public purposes unrelated to the enforcement of its criminal laws, see, e.g., California v. Byers, 402 U. S. 424,  402 U. S. 430, and when a person assumes control over items that are the legitimate object of the government's noncriminal regulatory powers, cf. Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1.  Here, Maurice's care and safety became the particular object of the State's regulatory interest once the Juvenile Court adjudicated him a child in need of assistance.  Moreover, by taking responsibility for such care subject to the custodial order's conditions, Bouknight submitted to the regulatory system's routine operation, agreed to hold Maurice in a manner consonant with the State's interests, and accepted the incident obligation to permit inspection.  Furthermore, the State imposes that obligation as part of a broadly directed, noncriminal regulatory regime governing children cared for pursuant to custodial orders.  Persons who care for such children are not a selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.  Similarly, the efforts of BCDSS and the judiciary to gain access to the children focus primarily on the children's wellbeing, rather than on criminal conduct, and are enforced through measures unrelated to criminal law enforcement.  Finally, production in the vast majority of cases will embody no incriminating testimony.   493 U. S.  555-561.
(c) The custodial role that limits Bouknight's ability to resist the production order may give rise to corresponding limitations upon the State's ability to use the testimonial aspects of her act of production directly or indirectly in any subsequent criminal proceedings.

Trial Lawyers Association
Nos. 88-1198, 88-1393
Argued Oct. 30, 1989
Decided Jan. 22, 1990
493 U.S. 411

Syllabus 
A group of lawyers in private practice who regularly acted as court-appointed counsel for indigent defendants in District of Columbia criminal cases agreed at a meeting of the Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association (SCTLA) to stop providing such representation until the District increased group members' compensation.  The boycott had a severe impact on the District's criminal justice system, and the District government capitulated to the lawyers' demands.  After the lawyers returned to work, petitioner Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against SCTLA and four of its officers (respondents), alleging that they had entered into a conspiracy to fix prices and to conduct a boycott that constituted unfair methods of competition in violation of  5 of the FTC Act.  Declining to accept the conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that the complaint should be dismissed, the FTC ruled that the boycott was illegal per se and entered an order prohibiting respondents from initiating future such boycotts.  The Court of Appeals, although acknowledging that the boycott was a ""classic restraint of trade"" in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, vacated the FTC order.  Noting that the boycott was meant to convey a political message to the public, the court concluded that it contained an element of expression warranting First Amendment protection and that, under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, an incidental restriction on such expression could not be justified unless it was no greater than was essential to an important governmental interest.  Reasoning that this test could not be satisfied by the application of an otherwise appropriate per se rule, but instead requires the enforcement agency to prove rather than presume that the evil against which the antitrust laws are directed looms in the conduct it condemns, the court remanded for a determination whether respondents possessed ""significant market power."" 
Page 493 U. S. 412

Held:
1. Respondents' boycott constituted a horizontal arrangement among competitors that was unquestionably a naked restraint of price and output in violation of the antitrust laws.  Respondents' proffered social justifications for the restraint of trade do not make the restraint any less unlawful.  Nor is respondents' agreement outside the coverage of the antitrust laws under Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.

2. Respondents' boycott is not immunized from antitrust regulation by NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.

3. The Court of Appeals erred in creating a new exception, based on O'Brien, supra, to the antitrust per se liability rules for boycotts having an expressive component.  The court's analysis is critically flawed in at least two respects.  First, it exaggerates the significance of the ""expressive component"" in respondents' boycott, since every concerted refusal to do business with a potential customer or supplier has such a component.  Thus, a rule requiring courts to apply the antitrust laws ""prudently and with sensitivity,"" in the Court of Appeals' words, whenever an economic boycott has an ""expressive component"" would create a gaping hole in the fabric of those laws.  Second, the Court of Appeals' analysis denigrates the importance of the rule of law that respondents violated.  The court's implicit assumption that the antitrust laws permit, but do not require, the condemnation of price fixing and boycotts without proof of market power is in error, since, although the per se rules are the product of judicial interpretation of the Sherman Act, they nevertheless have the same force and effect as any other statutory commands.  The court also erred in assuming that the categorical antitrust prohibitions are ""only"" rules of ""administrative convenience"" that do not serve any substantial governmental interest unless the price-fixing competitors actually possess market power.  The per se rules reflect a longstanding judgment that every horizontal price-fixing arrangement among competitors poses some threat to the free market, even if the participants

Trial Lawyers Association
Nos. 88-1198, 88-1393
Argued Oct. 30, 1989
Decided Jan. 22, 1990
493 U.S. 411

Syllabus 
A group of lawyers in private practice who regularly acted as court-appointed counsel for indigent defendants in District of Columbia criminal cases agreed at a meeting of the Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association (SCTLA) to stop providing such representation until the District increased group members' compensation.  The boycott had a severe impact on the District's criminal justice system, and the District government capitulated to the lawyers' demands.  After the lawyers returned to work, petitioner Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against SCTLA and four of its officers (respondents), alleging that they had entered into a conspiracy to fix prices and to conduct a boycott that constituted unfair methods of competition in violation of  5 of the FTC Act.  Declining to accept the conclusion of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that the complaint should be dismissed, the FTC ruled that the boycott was illegal per se and entered an order prohibiting respondents from initiating future such boycotts.  The Court of Appeals, although acknowledging that the boycott was a ""classic restraint of trade"" in violation of  1 of the Sherman Act, vacated the FTC order.  Noting that the boycott was meant to convey a political message to the public, the court concluded that it contained an element of expression warranting First Amendment protection and that, under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, an incidental restriction on such expression could not be justified unless it was no greater than was essential to an important governmental interest.  Reasoning that this test could not be satisfied by the application of an otherwise appropriate per se rule, but instead requires the enforcement agency to prove rather than presume that the evil against which the antitrust laws are directed looms in the conduct it condemns, the court remanded for a determination whether respondents possessed ""significant market power."" 
Page 493 U. S. 412

Held:
1. Respondents' boycott constituted a horizontal arrangement among competitors that was unquestionably a naked restraint of price and output in violation of the antitrust laws.  Respondents' proffered social justifications for the restraint of trade do not make the restraint any less unlawful.  Nor is respondents' agreement outside the coverage of the antitrust laws under Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, simply because its objective was the enactment of favorable legislation.  The Noerr doctrine does not extend to horizontal boycotts designed to exact higher prices from the government simply because they are genuinely intended to influence the government to agree to the conspirators' terms.  Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U. S. 492,  486 U. S. 503.   493 U. S.  421-425.
2. Respondents' boycott is not immunized from antitrust regulation by NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, which held that the First Amendment prevented a State from prohibiting a politically motivated civil rights boycott.  Unlike the boycott upheld in Claiborne Hardware, the undenied objective of this boycott was to gain an economic advantage for those who agreed to participate.  458 U.S. at  458 U.

Syllabus 
Petitioners, nonresidents of Maryland who,are holders of unpaid certificates of deposit issued by a failed Maryland savings and loan association, filed a civil action in the Federal District Court against respondents, former association officers and directors and others, alleging claims under inter alia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1961-1968.  The court dismissed the action, concluding, among other things, that federal abstention was appropriate as to the civil RICO claims, which had been raised in pending litigation in state court, since state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over such claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over civil RICO claims.  The presumption in favor of such jurisdiction 
Page 493 U. S. 456
 has not been rebutted by any of the factors identified in Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U. S. 473,  453 U. S. 478.  Pp.  493 U. S. 458-467.
(a) As petitioners concede, there is nothing in RICO's explicit language to suggest that Congress has, by affirmative enactment, divested state courts of civil RICO jurisdiction.  To the contrary,  1964(c)'s grant of federal jurisdiction over civil RICO claims is plainly permissive, and thus does not operate to oust state courts from concurrent jurisdiction.  P.  493 U. S. 460-461.
(b) RICO's legislative history reveals no evidence that Congress even considered the question of concurrent jurisdiction, much less any suggestion that Congress affirmatively intended to confer exclusive jurisdiction over civil RICO claims on the federal courts.  Petitioners' argument that, because Congress modeled  1964(c) after  4 of the Clayton Act -- which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the federal courts -- it intended, by implication, to grant exclusive federal jurisdiction over  1964(c) claims is rejected.  Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, and Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., 483 U. S. 143, are distinguished, since those cases looked to the Clayton Act in interpreting RICO without the benefit of a background juridical presumption of the type presented here.  Pp.  493 U. S. 461-462.
(c) No ""clear incompatibility"" exists between state court jurisdiction and federal interests.  The interest in uniform interpretation of federal criminal laws, see 18 U.S.C.  3231, is not inconsistent with such jurisdiction merely because state courts would be required to construe the federal crimes that constitute RICO predicate acts.  Section 1964(c) claims are not ""offenses against the laws of the United States,""  3231, and do not result in the imposition of criminal sanctions.  There is also no significant danger of inconsistent application of federal criminal law, since federal courts would not be bound by state court interpretations of predicate acts, since state courts would be guided by federal court interpretations of federal criminal law, and since any state court judgments misinterpreting federal criminal law would be subject to direct review by this Court.  Moreover, state courts have the ability to handle the complexities of civil RICO actions.  Many cases involve asserted violations of state law, over which state courts presumably have greater expertise, and it would seem anomalous to rule that they are incompetent to adjudicate civil RICO claims when such claims are subject to adjudication by arbitration, see Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220,  482 U. S. 239.  Further, although the fact that RICO's procedural mechanisms are applicable only in federal court may tend to suggest that Congress intended exclusive federal jurisdiction, it does not by itself suffice to create a ""clear incompatibility"" with federal interests.  And, to the extent that Congress intended RICO to serve broad remedial purposes, concurrent jurisdiction will advance, rather than jeopardize, federal policies underlying the statute.  Pp.  493 U. S. 464-467.

Syllabus 
During jury selection at his state court trial on various felony charges, petitioner, who is white, objected to the State's peremptory challenges that struck the two black venire members from the petit jury, on the ground that he had a Sixth Amendment right to ""be tried by a representative cross section of the community.""  The trial judge overruled the objection, and petitioner was convicted of all but one of the charges.  On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the convictions and rejected petitioner's Sixth Amendment challenge to the exclusion of black jurors.
Held:
1. Petitioner has standing to raise a Sixth Amendment challenge to the exclusion of blacks from his jury.  Although a defendant, in order to establish a prima facie Equal Protection Clause violation,
""must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group . . . and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant's race,""
Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79,  476 U. S. 96, this Court has never suggested that such correlation between the group identification of the defendant and the group identification of the excluded venire member is necessary for Sixth Amendment standing.  To the contrary, the Sixth Amendment entitles every defendant to object to a venire that is not designed to represent a fair cross section of the community.  That petitioner seeks an extension of the fair-cross-section requirement from the venire to the petit jury does not affect his standing to assert it.   493 U. S.  476-477.
2. Petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim is without merit because a prohibition upon the exclusion of cognizable groups through peremptory challenges has no basis in the Amendment's text, is without support in this Court's decisions, and would undermine rather than further the Amendment's guarantee of the right to trial by ""an impartial jury.""  The Amendment's requirement that the venire from which the jury is chosen represent a fair cross section of the community constitutes a means of assuring, not a representative jury (which the Constitution does not demand), but an impartial one (which it does).  Without such a requirement, the State would have, in effect, unlimited peremptory challenges to compose the pool from which the jury is drawn in its favor.
This Court's decisions make clear that in no way can the fair-cross-section requirement be interpreted to prohibit peremptory challenges.  See, e.g., 
Page 493 U. S. 475
 Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162,  476 U. S. 173.  Such challenges have been considered ""a necessary part of trial by jury,"" Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202,  380 U. S. 219, and serve the Sixth Amendment's goal of impartiality by permitting both the defendant and the State to eliminate prospective jurors belonging to groups they believe would unduly favor the other side, thereby removing extremes of partiality on both sides.  Thus, the constitutional goal of ""an impartial jury"" would positively be obstructed by a petit jury fair-cross-section requirement, which would cripple the peremptory challenge device.
The rule of Batson, supra, cannot be incorporated into the Sixth Amendment.  Although that case extended the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of race-based exclusion from the venire stage to the individual petit jury stage, it did so not because the two stages are inseparably linked, but because the Fourteenth Amendment's intransigent prohibition of racial discrimination applies to both.  This case does not present an equal protection issue, and race as such has nothing to do with the question before the Court.  Petitioner is not a black man, and his Sixth Amendment claim would be just as strong if the object of the state's exclusion of jurors had been, not blacks, but any other identifiable group.

|493 u.s. 365|"Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund
No. 88-1105
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided Jan. 17, 1990
493 U.S. 365

Syllabus 
Petitioner Guidry, a former official of respondent Union and trustee of one of respondent pension plans, pleaded guilty to embezzling funds from the Union in violation of  501(c) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA).  Since his union employment had made him eligible for benefits from respondent plans, he filed suit in the District Court against two of the plans when they determined that he had forfeited his right to benefits as a result of his criminal activity.  The Union intervened, joined the third p!an as a party, and stipulated with Guidry to the entry of a money judgment in its favor.  The court rejected the funds' contention that Guidry had forfeited his right to benefits.  It ruled, however, that a constructive trust in the Union's favor should be imposed on Guidry's pension benefits until the judgment was satisfied.  Reading the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in pari materia with, inter alia, the LMRDA --  which seeks to combat union officials' corruption and to protect membership interests -- the court concluded that a narrow exception to ERISA's prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits,  206(d)(1), is appropriate where ""the viability of a union and the members' pension plans was damaged by the knavery of a union official.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Relying on ERISA  409(a) -- which makes a faithless plan fiduciary personally liable for losses to the plan resulting from his breach and subjects him to other appropriate equitable or remedial relief -- the court concluded that  206(d)(1) did not preclude the imposition of the constructive trust, deeming it unlikely that Congress intended to ignore equitable principles by protecting individuals such as Guidry from the consequences of their misconduct.
Held:  The constructive trust violates ERISA's prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits.  Pp.  493 U. S. 371-377.
(a) The constructive trust remedy is prohibited by  206(d)(1) unless some exception to the general statutory ban is applicable.  Cf. Mackey v. Lanier Collections Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,  486 U. S. 836-837.   493 U. S.  371-372.
(b) It is unnecessary to decide whether  409(a)'s remedial provisions supersede  206(d)(1)'s bar, since Guidry has not been found to have 
Page 493 U. S. 366
 breached any fiduciary duty to the pension plans.  Although his actions may have harmed the Union's members who were fund beneficiaries, he was convicted of stealing money only from the Union, and the funds and the Union are distinct legal entities.   493 U. S.  372-374.
(c) Assuming that LMRDA  501 authorizes the imposition of a constructive trust when a union officer has breached his fiduciary duties, that authorization does not override ERISA's anti-alienation provision.  Contrary to respondents' argument, the LMRDA will not be modified, impaired, or superseded in violation of ERISA  514(d)'s saving clause if ERISA pension plans cannot be used to effectuate the LMRDA's remedial goals.  A broad reading of  514(d) would eviscerate  206(d)'s protections by rendering  206(d)(1) inapplicable whenever a judgment creditor relied on the remedial provisions of a federal statute.

			"|"Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund
No. 88-1105
Argued Nov. 29, 1989
Decided Jan. 17, 1990
493 U.S. 365

Syllabus 
Petitioner Guidry, a former official of respondent Union and trustee of one of respondent pension plans, pleaded guilty to embezzling funds from the Union in violation of  501(c) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA).  Since his union employment had made him eligible for benefits from respondent plans, he filed suit in the District Court against two of the plans when they determined that he had forfeited his right to benefits as a result of his criminal activity.  The Union intervened, joined the third p!an as a party, and stipulated with Guidry to the entry of a money judgment in its favor.  The court rejected the funds' contention that Guidry had forfeited his right to benefits.  It ruled, however, that a constructive trust in the Union's favor should be imposed on Guidry's pension benefits until the judgment was satisfied.  Reading the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in pari materia with, inter alia, the LMRDA --  which seeks to combat union officials' corruption and to protect membership interests -- the court concluded that a narrow exception to ERISA's prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits,  206(d)(1), is appropriate where ""the viability of a union and the members' pension plans was damaged by the knavery of a union official.""  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  Relying on ERISA  409(a) -- which makes a faithless plan fiduciary personally liable for losses to the plan resulting from his breach and subjects him to other appropriate equitable or remedial relief -- the court concluded that  206(d)(1) did not preclude the imposition of the constructive trust, deeming it unlikely that Congress intended to ignore equitable principles by protecting individuals such as Guidry from the consequences of their misconduct.
Held:  The constructive trust violates ERISA's prohibition on assignment or alienation of pension benefits.  Pp.  493 U. S. 371-377.
(a) The constructive trust remedy is prohibited by  206(d)(1) unless some exception to the general statutory ban is applicable.  Cf. Mackey v. Lanier Collections Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,  486 U. S. 836-837.   493 U. S.  371-372.
(b) It is unnecessary to decide whether  409(a)'s remedial provisions supersede  206(d)(1)'s bar, since Guidry has not been found to have 
Page 493 U. S. 366
 breached any fiduciary duty to the pension plans.  Although his actions may have harmed the Union's members who were fund beneficiaries, he was convicted of stealing money only from the Union, and the funds and the Union are distinct legal entities.   493 U. S.  372-374.
(c) Assuming that LMRDA  501 authorizes the imposition of a constructive trust when a union officer has breached his fiduciary duties, that authorization does not override ERISA's anti-alienation provision.  Contrary to respondents' argument, the LMRDA will not be modified, impaired, or superseded in violation of ERISA  514(d)'s saving clause if ERISA pension plans cannot be used to effectuate the LMRDA's remedial goals.  A broad reading of  514(d) would eviscerate  206(d)'s protections by rendering  206(d)(1) inapplicable whenever a judgment creditor relied on the remedial provisions of a federal statute.  The two statutes are more persuasively reconciled by holding that the LMRDA determines what sort of judgment the aggrieved party may obtain, while ERISA governs the narrow question whether that judgment may be collected through a particular means.  Pp.  493 U. S. 374-376.
(d) It is also inappropriate to approve any generalized equitable exception to ERISA's anti-alienation provision.

No. 88-1374
Argued Oct. 31, 1989
Decided Jan. 17, 1990
493 U.S. 378

Syllabus 
California law requires retailers to pay a 6% sales tax on in-state sales of tangible personal property and to collect from state residents a 6% use tax on such property purchased outside the State.  During the tax period in question, appellant religious organization, which is incorporated in Louisiana, sold a variety of religious materials at ""evangelistic crusades"" within California and made mail-order sales of other such materials to California residents.  Appellee State Board of Equalization (Board) audited appellant and advised it that it should register as a seller as required by state law and report and pay sales and use taxes on the aforementioned sales.  Appellant paid the taxes and the Board ruled against it on its petitions for redetermination and refund, rejecting its contention that the tax on religious materials violated the First Amendment.  The state trial court entered judgment for the Board in appellant's refund suit, the State Court of Appeal affirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied discretionary review.
Held:
1. California's imposition of sales and use tax liability on appellant's sales of religious materials does not contravene the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.  Pp.  493 U. S. 384-397.
(a) The collection and payment of the tax imposes no constitutionally significant burden on appellant's religious practices or beliefs under the Free Exercise Clause, which accordingly does not require the State to grant appellant a tax exemption.  Appellant misreads Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, and Follett v. McCormick, 321 U. S. 573, which, although holding flat license taxes on commercial sales unconstitutional with regard to the evangelical distribution of religious materials, nevertheless specifically stated that religious activity may constitutionally be subjected to a generally applicable income or property tax akin to the California tax at issue.  Those cases apply only where a flat license tax operates as a prior restraint on the free exercise of religious belief.  As such, they do not invalidate California's generally applicable sales and use tax, which is not a flat tax, represents only a small fraction of any sale, and applies neutrally to all relevant sales regardless of the nature of the seller or purchaser, so that there is no danger that appellant's 
Page 493 U. S. 379
 religious activity is being singled out for special and burdensome treatment.  Moreover, the concern in Murdock and Follett that flat license taxes operate as a precondition to the exercise of evangelistic activity is not present here, because the statutory registration requirement and the tax itself do not act as prior restraints -- no fee is charged for registering, the tax is due regardless of preregistration, and the tax is not imposed as a precondition of disseminating the message.  Furthermore, since appellant argues that the exercise of its beliefs is unconstitutionally burdened by the reduction in its income resulting from the presumably lower demand for its wares (caused by the marginally higher price generated by the tax) and from the costs associated with administering the tax, its free exercise claim is in significant tension with Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680,  490 U. S. 699, which made clear that, to the extent that imposition of a generally applicable tax merely decreases the amount of money appellant has to spend on its religious activities, any such burden is not constitutionally significant because it is no different from that imposed by other generally applicable laws and regulations to which religious organizations must adhere.  While a more onerous tax rate than California's, even if generally applicable, might effectively choke off an adherent's religious practices, that situation is not before, or considered by, this Court.  Pp.  493 U. S. 384-392.
(b) Application of the California tax to appellant's sale of religious materials does not violate the Establishment Clause by fostering an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.  The evidence of administrative entanglement is thin, since the Court of Appeal expressly found that, in light of appellant's sophisticated accounting staff and computerized accounting methods, the record did not support its assertion that the collection and payment of the tax impose severe accounting burdens on it.  Moreover, although collection and payment will require some contact between appellant and the State, generally applicable administrative and recordkeeping burdens may be imposed on religious organizations without running afoul of the Clause.  See e.g., Hernandez, supra, at  490 U. S. 696-697.  The fact that appellant must bear the cost of collecting and remitting the tax -- even if the financial burden may vary from religion to religion -- does not enmesh the government in religious affairs, since the statutory scheme requires neither the involvement of state employees in, nor on-site continuing inspection of, appellant's day-to-day operations.  Most significantly, the imposition of the tax without an exemption for appellant does not require the State to inquire into the religious content of the items sold or the religious motivation for selling or purchasing them, since they are subject to the tax regardless of content or motive.  Pp.  493 U. S. 392-397. 
Page 493 U. S. 380

2. The merits of appellant's Commerce and Due Process Clause claim are not properly before, and will not be reached by, this Court, since both the trial court and the Court of Appeal ruled that the claim was procedurally barred because it was not presented to the Board as required by state law.  See, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1041-1042.  Appellant has failed to substantiate any claim that the California courts in general apply the procedural bar rule and a pertinent exception in an irregular, arbitrary, or inconsistent manner.

Syllabus 
According to respondent's complaint, petitioners obtained a construction contract from the Nigerian Government by bribing Nigerian officials.  Nigerian law prohibits both the payment and the receipt of such bribes.  Respondent, an unsuccessful bidder for the contract, filed an action for damages against petitioners and others under various federal and state statutes.  The District Court ruled that the suit was barred by the act of state doctrine, which, in its view, precluded judicial inquiry into the motivation of a sovereign act that would result in embarrassment to the sovereign, or constitute interference with the conduct of United States foreign policy.  The court granted summary judgment for petitioners because resolution of the case in favor of respondent would require imputing to foreign officials an unlawful motivation (the obtaining of bribes), and accordingly might embarrass the Executive Branch in its conduct of foreign relations.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial, holding that on the facts of this case the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not apply because no embarrassment of the Executive in its conduct of foreign affairs was evident.
Held:  The act of state doctrine does not apply because nothing in the present suit requires a court to declare invalid the official act of a foreign sovereign.  See, e.g., Ricaud v. American Metal Co., 246 U. S. 304.  It does not suffice that the facts necessary to establish respondent's claim will also establish that the Nigerian contract was unlawful, since the contract's legality is simply not a question that the District Court must decide.  American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347,  213 U. S. 357-358 (Holmes, J.) distinguished.  Nor does it suffice that judgment in favor of respondents will require the court to impute to foreign officials improper motivation in the performance of official acts.  To say that international comity, respect for the sovereignty of foreign nations, and the avoidance of embarrassment to the Executive Branch in its conduct of foreign relations are the policies underlying the act of state doctrine is not to say that the doctrine is applicable whenever those policies are implicated.  The doctrine is not a rule of abstention which prohibits courts from deciding properly presented cases or controversies simply because the Executive's conduct of foreign relations may be adversely

In 1985, in a suit brought by the United States, the city of Yonkers and its community development agency were held liable for intentionally enhancing segregation in housing in violation of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In early 1986, the District Court entered its remedial order, which enjoined the two named defendants and their officers, agents, and others acting in concert with them from discriminating and required the city to take extensive affirmative steps to disperse public housing throughout Yonkers.  Pending appeal of the liability and remedial orders, the city failed and refused to take various of the required steps.  Shortly after the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment in all respects, the parties agreed to a consent decree setting forth certain actions which the city would take to implement the remedial order, including the adoption, within 90 days, of a legislative package known as the Affordable Housing Ordinance.  The decree was approved in a to-2 vote by the city council -- which is vested with all of the city's legislative powers -- and entered by the District Court as a consent judgment in January, 1988.  When the city again delayed action, the District Court entered an order on July 26, 1988, requiring the city to enact the ordinance and providing that failure to do so would result in contempt citations, escalating daily fines for the city, and daily fines and imprisonment for recalcitrant individual councilmembers.  After a resolution of intent to adopt the ordinance was defeated by a 4-to-3 council vote, petitioner individual councilmembers constituting the majority, the District Court held the city and petitioners in contempt and imposed the sanctions set forth in the July 26 order.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting, inter alia, petitioners' argument that the District Court had abused its discretion in sanctioning them.  After this Court stayed the imposition of sanctions against the individual petitioners, but denied the city's request for a stay, the city council enacted the ordinance on September 9, 1988, in the face of daily fines approaching $1 million. 
Page 493 U. S. 266

Held:  In the circumstances of this case, the portion of the District Court's July 26 order imposing contempt sanctions against petitioner individual councilmembers if they failed to vote in favor of the ordinance was an abuse of discretion under traditional equitable principles.  Petitioners were never parties to the action, nor were they found to be individually liable for any of the violations upon which the remedial order was based.  Although the injunctive portion of that order was directed not only to the city but also to its officers and others acting in concert to discriminate, the remaining parts of the order requiring affirmative steps were directed only to the city.  It was the city, in fact, which capitulated in the present phase of the case, and there was a reasonable probability that sanctions against the city alone would have achieved the desired result.  The city's arguments against imposing sanctions on it pointed out the sort of pressure such sanctions would place on the city, and only eight months earlier, the District Court had secured compliance with an important remedial order through the threat of bankrupting fines against the city alone.  While this Court's Speech and Debate Clause and federal common law of legislative immunity cases do not control the question whether local legislators such as petitioners should be immune from contempt sanctions, some of the considerations underlying the immunity doctrine must inform the District Court's exercise of discretion, particularly the theme that any restriction on a legislator's freedom undermines the ""public good"" by interfering with the rights of the people to representation in the democratic process.  There are significant differences between fining the city and imposing sanctions on individual legislators, since the latter course causes legislators to vote, not with a view to the wishes of their constituents or to the fiscal solvency of the city, but with a view solely to their own personal monetary interest, and thereby effects a much greater perversion of the normal legislative process.  Thus, in view of the fact that holding elected officials in contempt for the manner in which they vote is ""extraordinary,"" as the District Court recognized, that court should have proceeded with sanctions first against the city alone in order to secure compliance with the remedial order.  Only if that approach failed to produce compliance within a reasonable time should the question of imposing contempt sanctions against petitioners even have been considered.  This limitation accords with the doctrine that, in selecting contempt sanctions, a court must exercise the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.  Pp.  493 U. S. 273-280.

In early 1986, the District Court entered its remedial order, which enjoined the two named defendants and their officers, agents, and others acting in concert with them from discriminating and required the city to take extensive affirmative steps to disperse public housing throughout Yonkers.  Pending appeal of the liability and remedial orders, the city failed and refused to take various of the required steps.  Shortly after the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment in all respects, the parties agreed to a consent decree setting forth certain actions which the city would take to implement the remedial order, including the adoption, within 90 days, of a legislative package known as the Affordable Housing Ordinance.  The decree was approved in a to-2 vote by the city council -- which is vested with all of the city's legislative powers -- and entered by the District Court as a consent judgment in January, 1988.  When the city again delayed action, the District Court entered an order on July 26, 1988, requiring the city to enact the ordinance and providing that failure to do so would result in contempt citations, escalating daily fines for the city, and daily fines and imprisonment for recalcitrant individual councilmembers.  After a resolution of intent to adopt the ordinance was defeated by a 4-to-3 council vote, petitioner individual councilmembers constituting the majority, the District Court held the city and petitioners in contempt and imposed the sanctions set forth in the July 26 order.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting, inter alia, petitioners' argument that the District Court had abused its discretion in sanctioning them.  After this Court stayed the imposition of sanctions against the individual petitioners, but denied the city's request for a stay, the city council enacted the ordinance on September 9, 1988, in the face of daily fines approaching $1 million. 
Page 493 U. S. 266

Held:  In the circumstances of this case, the portion of the District Court's July 26 order imposing contempt sanctions against petitioner individual councilmembers if they failed to vote in favor of the ordinance was an abuse of discretion under traditional equitable principles.  Petitioners were never parties to the action, nor were they found to be individually liable for any of the violations upon which the remedial order was based.  Although the injunctive portion of that order was directed not only to the city but also to its officers and others acting in concert to discriminate, the remaining parts of the order requiring affirmative steps were directed only to the city.  It was the city, in fact, which capitulated in the present phase of the case, and there was a reasonable probability that sanctions against the city alone would have achieved the desired result.  The city's arguments against imposing sanctions on it pointed out the sort of pressure such sanctions would place on the city, and only eight months earlier, the District Court had secured compliance with an important remedial order through the threat of bankrupting fines against the city alone.  While this Court's Speech and Debate Clause and federal common law of legislative immunity cases do not control the question whether local legislators such as petitioners should be immune from contempt sanctions, some of the considerations underlying the immunity doctrine must inform the District Court's exercise of discretion, particularly the theme that any restriction on a legislator's freedom undermines the ""public good"" by interfering with the rights of the people to representation in the democratic process.  There are significant differences between fining the city and imposing sanctions on individual legislators, since the latter course causes legislators to vote, not with a view to the wishes of their constituents or to the fiscal solvency of the city, but with a view solely to their own personal monetary interest, and thereby effects a much greater perversion of the normal legislative process.  Thus, in view of the fact that holding elected officials in contempt for the manner in which they vote is ""extraordinary,"" as the District Court recognized, that court should have proceeded with sanctions first against the city alone in order to secure compliance with the remedial order.  Only if that approach failed to produce compliance within a reasonable time should the question of imposing contempt sanctions against petitioners even have been considered.  This limitation accords with the doctrine that, in selecting contempt sanctions, a court must exercise the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.  Pp.  493 U. S. 273-280.

493 U.S. 307

Syllabus 
The day after a shooting which left one of a group of eight boys dead and another seriously injured, police took petitioner James into custody as a suspect.  James, who then had black curly hair, admitted under police questioning that the previous day his hair had been reddish-brown, long, and combed straight back, and that he had just dyed and curled it in order to change his appearance.  After James was indicted for murder and attempted murder, the trial court sustained his motion to suppress the statements about his hair as fruit of an unlawful arrest.  At trial, five members of the group of boys testified that the shooter had slicked-back, shoulder-length, reddish hair, and that they had seen James several weeks earlier with hair that color and style.  Each boy identified James as the shooter even though at trial he had black hair worn in a ""natural"" style.  James did not testify in his defense, but called one Henderson, who testified that, on the day of the shooting James had had black hair.  The court permitted the State to introduce James' illegally obtained statements to impeach Henderson's testimony.  James was convicted on both counts.  The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the convictions on the ground that the exclusionary rule barred the admission of the illegally obtained statements for the purpose of impeaching a defense witness' testimony.  The State Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that the impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule -- which permits the prosecution to introduce illegally obtained evidence to impeach the defendant's own testimony --  should be expanded to include the testimony of other defense witnesses in order to deter the defendant from engaging in perjury ""by proxy.""
Held:  The State Supreme Court erred in expanding the impeachment exception to encompass the testimony of all defense witnesses.  Such expansion would frustrate, rather than further, the purposes underlying the exclusionary rule.  The truthseeking rationale supporting the impeachment of defendants does not apply with equal force to other witnesses.  The State Supreme Court's ""perjury by proxy"" premise is suspect, since the threat of a criminal prosecution for perjury is far more likely to deter a witness from intentionally lying than to deter a defendant, already facing conviction, from lying on his own behalf.  Moreover, some defendants likely would be chilled from calling witnesses who would otherwise offer probative evidence out of fear that those witnesses might make 
Page 493 U. S. 308
 some statement in sufficient tension with the tainted evidence to allow the prosecutor to introduce that evidence for impeachment.  Finally, expansion of the exception would significantly weaken the exclusionary rule's deterrent effect on police misconduct by enhancing the expected value to the prosecution of illegally obtained evidence, both by vastly increasing the number of occasions on which such evidence could be used and also, due to the chilling effect, by deterring defendants from calling witnesses in the first place, and thereby keeping exculpatory evidence from the jury.  The exclusion of illegal evidence from the prosecution's case in chief would not provide sufficient deterrence to protect the privacy interests underlying the rule.  When police officers confront opportunities to obtain illegal evidence after they have legally obtained sufficient evidence to sustain a prima facie case, excluding such evidence from only the case in chief would leave officers with little to lose and much to gain by overstepping the constitutional limits on evidence gathering.

Syllabus 
Respondents -- foreign corporations and sole shareholders of domestic corporations conducting business in California -- brought separate suits against petitioner California Franchise Tax Board (Board) and certain of its employees, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on Foreign Commerce Clause grounds from the Board's method of determining the taxable income of respondents' subsidiaries that is allocable to California.  The District Court dismissed the suits, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondents had alleged injuries sufficiently direct and independent of the injuries to their subsidiaries to confer both Article III and stockholder standing.  It also held that respondents' federal actions were not barred by the Tax Injunction Act, which prohibits district courts from enjoining, suspending, or restraining the assessment, levy, or collection of any state tax where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had in state court.
Held:
1. Respondents have Article III standing.  A judicial determination that the Board's accounting method is unconstitutional would prevent the actual financial injury to respondents that would be caused by a tax that illegally reduced the return on their investments in their subsidiaries and lowered the value of their stockholdings.  Pp.  493 U. S. 335-336.
2. Assuming that respondents have stockholder standing, their actions are nevertheless barred under the Tax Injunction Act.  As sole shareholders, respondents have under their direction and control entities that, as actual taxpayers, possess a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy for their claims.  Respondents' argument that, even if they are treated as effectively having all of their subsidiaries' remedies, they do not have a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy because their subsidiaries would not be permitted to raise a Foreign Commerce Clause challenge to the tax, or at least could not base such a challenge on the allegedly distinct foreign commerce injuries suffered by their parent corporations, is rejected.  Respondents have not demonstrated that their remedy is uncertain and thus inadequate to bar federal jurisdiction.  Petitioners have represented that in no case currently pending in the state courts is the State claiming that the subsidiaries cannot raise foreign commerce

No. 88-6025
Argued Oct. 4, 1989
Decided Jan. 10, 1990
493 U.S. 342

Syllabus 
Petitioner Dowling was convicted of robbing a Virgin Islands bank while wearing a ski mask and carrying a small pistol.  Relying on Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)  -- which provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible against a defendant for purposes other than character evidence -- the Government introduced at trial the testimony of one Henry, who stated that a similarly masked and armed Dowling had been one of two intruders who had entered her home two weeks after the bank robbery.  Although Dowling had been acquitted of charges in the Henry case, the Government believed that Henry's description of him strengthened its identification of him as the bank robber, and that her testimony linked him to another individual thought to be implicated in the bank robbery.  The District Court permitted the introduction of the testimony and twice instructed the jury about Dowling's acquittal and the limited purpose for which the testimony was being admitted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, ruling that, although the Government was collaterally estopped by the acquittal from offering Henry's testimony at trial and the testimony was inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, its admission was harmless because it was highly probable that the error did not prejudice Dowling.  The court declined to apply the more stringent standard of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,  386 U. S. 24, applicable to constitutional errors because the District Court's error was evidentiary, and not of constitutional dimension.
Held:
1. The admission of the testimony did not violate the collateral estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The collateral estoppel doctrine prohibits the Government from relitigating an issue of ultimate fact that has been determined by a valid and final judgment, Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, but does not bar in all circumstances the later use of evidence simply because it relates to alleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted.  Here, the prior acquittal did not determine the ultimate issue in the bank robbery case, because in the second trial the Government was not required to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Dowling was the man who entered Henry's house.  This decision is consistent with other cases where this Court has held that an 
Page 493 U. S. 343
 acquittal in a criminal case does not preclude the Government from relitigating an issue when it is presented in a subsequent action governed by a lower standard of proof, United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354,  465 U. S. 361-362; One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232,  409 U. S. 235.  Even if the lower burden of proof at the second trial did not serve to avoid the collateral estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause, Dowling failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the first jury determined that he was not one of the men who entered Henry's home.  Pp.  493 U. S. 347-352.
2. The introduction of the evidence did not violate the due process test of ""fundamental fairness.""  Especially in light of the trial judge's limiting instructions, the testimony was not fundamentally unfair, since the jury was free to assess the truthfulness and significance of the testimony, since the trial court's authority to exclude potentially prejudicial evidence adequately addresses the possibility that introduction of such evidence will create a risk that the jury will convict a defendant based on inferences drawn from the acquitted conduct, since inconsistent verdicts are constitutionally tolerable, and since the tradition that the Government may not force a person acquitted in one trial to defend against the same accusation in a subsequent proceeding is amply protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 88-493
Argued Nov. 7, 1989
Decided Jan. 9, 1990
493 U.S. 182

Syllabus 
After petitioner university denied tenure to associate professor Rosalie Tung, she filed a charge with respondent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In the course of its investigation, the EEOC issued a subpoena seeking, inter alia, Tung's tenure-review file and the tenure files of five male faculty members identified in the charge as having received more favorable treatment than Tung.  Petitioner refused to produce a number of the tenure file documents and applied to the EEOC for modification of the subpoena to exclude what it termed ""confidential peer review information.""  The EEOC denied the application and successfully sought enforcement of the subpoena by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that policy considerations and First Amendment principles of academic freedom required the recognition of a qualified privilege or the adoption of a balancing approach that would require the EEOC to demonstrate some particularized need, beyond a showing of relevance, to obtain peer review materials.
Held:  A university does not enjoy a special privilege requiring a judicial finding of particularized necessity of access, beyond a showing of mere relevance, before peer review materials pertinent to charges of discrimination in tenure decisions are disclosed to the EEOC.   493 U. S.  188-202.
(a) The claimed privilege cannot be grounded in the common law under Federal Rule of Evidence 501.  This Court is reluctant to recognize petitioner's asserted privilege where it appears that Congress, in expressly extending Title VII's coverage to educational institutions in 1972 and in thereafter continuing to afford the EEOC a broad right of access to any evidence ""relevant"" to a charge under investigation, balanced the substantial costs of invidious discrimination in institutions of higher learning against the importance of academic autonomy, but did not see fit to create a privilege for peer review documents.  In fact, Congress did provide a modicum of protection for an employer's interest in the confidentiality of its records by making it a crime for EEOC employees to publicize before the institution of court proceedings materials obtained during investigations.  Petitioner has not offered persuasive 
Page 493 U. S. 183
 justification for its claim that this Court should go further than Congress thought necessary to safeguard confidentiality.  Disclosure of peer review materials will often be necessary in order for the EEOC to determine whether illegal discrimination has taken place.  Moreover, the adoption of a requirement that the EEOC demonstrate a specific reason for disclosure, beyond a showing of relevance, would place a substantial litigation-producing obstacle in the EEOC's way and give universities a weapon to frustrate investigations.  It would also lead to a wave of similar privilege claims by other employers, such as writers, publishers, musicians, and lawyers, who play significant roles in furthering speech and learning in society.  Furthermore, petitioner's claim is not supported by this Court's precedents recognizing qualified privileges for Presidential and grand and petit jury communications and for deliberative intra-agency documents, since a privilege for peer review materials lacks a historical, constitutional, or statutory basis similar to that of those privileges.   493 U. S.  188-195.
(b) Nor can the claimed privilege be grounded in First Amendment ""academic freedom.""  Petitioner's reliance on this Court's so-called academic freedom cases is somewhat misplaced, since, in invalidating various governmental actions, those cases dealt with attempts to control university speech that were content-based and that constituted a direct infringement on the asserted right to determine on academic grounds who could teach.  In contrast, petitioner here does not allege any content-based regulation, but only that the ""quality of instruction and scholarship [will] decline"" as a result of the burden EEOC subpoenas place on the peer review process.  The subpoena at issue does not provide criteria that petitioner must use in selecting teachers, or prevent it from using any such criteria other than those prescribed by Title VII, and therefore respects legitimate academic decisionmaking.  In any event, the First Amendment does not embrace petitioner's claim to the effect that the right of academic freedom derived from the cases relied on should be expanded to protect confidential peer review materials from disclosure.  By comparison with cases in which the Court has recognized a First Amendment right, the complained-of infringement is extremely attenuated, in that the burden of such disclosure is far removed from the asserted right, and, if petitioner's claim were accepted, many other generally applicable laws, such as tax laws, might be said to infringe the First Amendment to the extent they affected university hiring.  In addition, the claimed injury to academic freedom is speculative, since confidentiality is not the norm in all peer review systems, and since some disclosure of peer evaluations would take place even if the ""special necessity"" test were adopted.  Moreover, this Court will not assume that most evaluators will become less candid if the possibility of disclosure increases.  
Page 493 U. S. 184
 This case is in many respects similar to Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, where, in rejecting the contention that the First Amendment prohibited requiring a reporter to testify as to information obtained in confidence without a special showing that such testimony was necessary, the Court declared that the Amendment does not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that may result from the enforcement of generally applicable laws, id. at 682, and indicated a reluctance to recognize a constitutional privilege of uncertain effect and scope, id. at 693, 703.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
No. 88-493
Argued Nov. 7, 1989
Decided Jan. 9, 1990
493 U.S. 182

Syllabus 
After petitioner university denied tenure to associate professor Rosalie Tung, she filed a charge with respondent Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In the course of its investigation, the EEOC issued a subpoena seeking, inter alia, Tung's tenure-review file and the tenure files of five male faculty members identified in the charge as having received more favorable treatment than Tung.  Petitioner refused to produce a number of the tenure file documents and applied to the EEOC for modification of the subpoena to exclude what it termed ""confidential peer review information.""  The EEOC denied the application and successfully sought enforcement of the subpoena by the District Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's claim that policy considerations and First Amendment principles of academic freedom required the recognition of a qualified privilege or the adoption of a balancing approach that would require the EEOC to demonstrate some particularized need, beyond a showing of relevance, to obtain peer review materials.
Held:  A university does not enjoy a special privilege requiring a judicial finding of particularized necessity of access, beyond a showing of mere relevance, before peer review materials pertinent to charges of discrimination in tenure decisions are disclosed to the EEOC.   493 U. S.  188-202.
(a) The claimed privilege cannot be grounded in the common law under Federal Rule of Evidence 501.  This Court is reluctant to recognize petitioner's asserted privilege where it appears that Congress, in expressly extending Title VII's coverage to educational institutions in 1972 and in thereafter continuing to afford the EEOC a broad right of access to any evidence ""relevant"" to a charge under investigation, balanced the substantial costs of invidious discrimination in institutions of higher learning against the importance of academic autonomy, but did not see fit to create a privilege for peer review documents.  In fact, Congress did provide a modicum of protection for an employer's interest in the confidentiality of its records by making it a crime for EEOC employees to publicize before the institution of court proceedings materials obtained during investigations.  Petitioner has not offered persuasive 
Page 493 U. S. 183
 justification for its claim that this Court should go further than Congress thought necessary to safeguard confidentiality.  Disclosure of peer review materials will often be necessary in order for the EEOC to determine whether illegal discrimination has taken place.  Moreover, the adoption of a requirement that the EEOC demonstrate a specific reason for disclosure, beyond a showing of relevance, would place a substantial litigation-producing obstacle in the EEOC's way and give universities a weapon to frustrate investigations.  It would also lead to a wave of similar privilege claims by other employers, such as writers, publishers, musicians, and lawyers, who play significant roles in furthering speech and learning in society.  Furthermore, petitioner's claim is not supported by this Court's precedents recognizing qualified privileges for Presidential and grand and petit jury communications and for deliberative intra-agency documents, since a privilege for peer review materials lacks a historical, constitutional, or statutory basis similar to that of those privileges.   493 U. S.  188-195.
(b) Nor can the claimed privilege be grounded in First Amendment ""academic freedom.""  Petitioner's reliance on this Court's so-called academic freedom cases is somewhat misplaced, since, in invalidating various governmental actions, those cases dealt with attempts to control university speech that were content-based and that constituted a direct infringement on the asserted right to determine on academic grounds who could teach.  In contrast, petitioner here does not allege any content-based regulation, but only that the ""quality of instruction and scholarship [will] decline"" as a result of the burden EEOC subpoenas place on the peer review process.  The subpoena at issue does not provide criteria that petitioner must use in selecting teachers, or prevent it from using any such criteria other than those prescribed by Title VII, and therefore respects legitimate academic decisionmaking.  In any event, the First Amendment does not embrace petitioner's claim to the effect that the right of academic freedom derived from the cases relied on should be expanded to protect confidential peer review materials from disclosure.  By comparison with cases in which the Court has recognized a First Amendment right, the complained-of infringement is extremely attenuated, in that the burden of such disclosure is far removed from the asserted right, and, if petitioner's claim were accepted, many other generally applicable laws, such as tax laws, might be said to infringe the First Amendment to the extent they affected university hiring.  In addition, the claimed injury to academic freedom is speculative, since confidentiality is not the norm in all peer review systems, and since some disclosure of peer evaluations would take place even if the ""special necessity"" test were adopted.  Moreover, this Court will not assume that most evaluators will become less candid if the possibility of disclosure increases.  
Page 493 U. S. 184
 This case is in many respects similar to Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, where, in rejecting the contention that the First Amendment prohibited requiring a reporter to testify as to information obtained in confidence without a special showing that such testimony was necessary, the Court declared that the Amendment does not invalidate every incidental burdening of the press that may result from the enforcement of generally applicable laws, id. at 682, and indicated a reluctance to recognize a constitutional privilege of uncertain effect and scope, id. at 693, 703.

Respondent Indianapolis Power and Light Co. (IPL), a regulated Indiana utility and an accrual-basis taxpayer, requires customers having suspect credit to make deposits with it to assure prompt payment of future electric bills.  Prior to termination of service, customers who satisfy a credit test can obtain a refund of their deposits or can choose to have the amount applied against future bills.  Although the deposits are at all times subject to the company's unfettered use and control, IPL does not treat them as income at the time of receipt, but carries them on its books as current liabilities.  Upon audit of IPL's returns for the tax years at issue, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted deficiencies, claiming that the deposits are advance payments for electricity and therefore are taxable to IPL in the year of receipt. The Tax Court ruled in favor of IPL on its petition for redetermination, holding that the deposits' principal purpose is to serve as security rather than as prepayment of income.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The customer deposits are not advance payments for electricity, and therefore do not constitute taxable income to IPL upon receipt.  Although IPL derives some economic benefit from the deposits, it does not have the requisite ""complete dominion"" over them at the time they are made, the crucial point for determining taxable income.  IPL has an obligation to repay the deposits upon termination of service or satisfaction of the credit test.  Moreover, a customer submitting a deposit makes no commitment to purchase any electricity at all.  Thus, while deposits eventually may be used to pay for electricity by virtue of customer default or choice, IPL's right to retain them at the time they are made is contingent upon events outside its control.  This construction is consistent with the Tax Court's longstanding treatment of sums deposited to secure a tenant's performance of a lease agreement, perhaps the closest analogy to the present situation.

Nos. 87-2012, 87-2051 and 88-49
Argued Oct. 4, 1989
Decided Jan. 8, 1990
493 U.S. 215

Syllabus 
Respondent City of Dallas adopted a comprehensive ordinance regulating ""sexually oriented businesses,"" which are defined to include ""adult"" arcades, bookstores, video stores, cabarets, motels, and theaters, as well as escort agencies, nude model studios, and sexual encounter centers.  Among other things, the ordinance requires that such businesses be licensed, and includes civil disability provisions prohibiting certain individuals from obtaining licenses.  Three groups of individuals and businesses involved in the adult entertainment industry filed separate suits challenging the ordinance on numerous grounds and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.  The District Court upheld the bulk of the ordinance, but struck down several subsections, and the city subsequently amended the ordinance in conformity with the court's judgment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, that the ordinance's licensing scheme did not violate the First Amendment despite its failure to provide the procedural safeguards set forth in Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51 (1965), and that its civil disability provisions and its provision requiring licensing for ""adult motel owners"" renting rooms for fewer than 10 hours were constitutional.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are remanded.
837 F.2d 1298, (CA 51988), affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III and IV, concluding that:
1. No petitioner has shown standing to challenge (1) the ordinance's provision which prohibits the licensing of an applicant who has resided with an individual whose license application has been denied or revoked, or (2) the civil disability provisions, which disable for specified periods those who have been convicted of certain enumerated crimes, as well as those whose spouses have been so convicted.  The record does not reveal 
Page 493 U. S. 216
 that any petitioner was living with an individual whose application was denied or whose license was revoked.  Moreover, although the record reveals one individual who potentially could be disabled under the spousal conviction provision, that person is not herself a license applicant or a party to this action.  Even if she did have standing, however, her claim would now be moot, since the city council deleted from the statutory list the crimes of which her husband was convicted after the District Court ruled that the inclusion of such convictions was unconstitutional.  Furthermore, although one party stated in an affidavit that he had been convicted of three enumerated misdemeanors, he lacked standing, since he failed to state when he had been convicted of the last misdemeanor or the date of his release from confinement and, therefore, has not shown that he is still within the statutory disability period.  This Court cannot rely on the city's representations at oral argument that one or two of the petitioners had been denied licenses based on convictions, since the necessary factual predicate must be gleaned from the record below.  Similarly, the city's affidavit indicating that two licenses were revoked for convictions is unavailing, since the affidavit was first introduced in this Court and is not part of the record, and, in any event, fails to identify the individuals whose licenses were revoked.  Because the courts below lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate petitioners' claims, the Court of Appeals' judgment with respect to the disability provisions is vacated, and the court is directed to dismiss that portion of the suit.   493 U. S.  230-236.
2. The ordinance's provision requiring licensing for motels that rent rooms for fewer than 10 hours is not unconstitutional.  The motel owner petitioners' contention that the city has violated the Due Process Clause by failing to produce adequate support for its supposition that renting rooms for fewer than 10 hours results in increased crime or other secondary effects is rejected.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, it was reasonable to believe that shorter rental time periods indicate that the motels foster prostitution, and that this type of criminal activity is what the ordinance seeks to suppress.  The reasonableness of the legislative judgment, along with the Los Angeles study of the effect of adult motels on surrounding neighborhoods that was before the city council when it passed the ordinance, provided sufficient support for the limitation.  Also rejected is the assertion that the 10-hour limitation places an unconstitutional burden on the right to freedom of association recognized in Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609,  468 U. S. 618.  Even assuming that the motel owners have standing to assert the associational rights of motel patrons, limiting rentals to 10 hours will not have any discernible effect on the sorts of traditional personal bonds considered in Roberts:  those that play a critical role in the Nation's culture and traditions by cultivating and transmitting shared ideals and beliefs.  This Court 
Page 493 U. S. 217
 will not consider the motel owners' privacy and commercial speech challenges, since those issues were not pressed or passed upon below.   493 U. S.  236-238.
Justice O'CONNOR, joined by Justice STEVENS and Justice KENNEDY, concluded in Part II that the ordinance's licensing scheme violates the First Amendment, since it constitutes a prior restraint upon protected expression that fails to provide adequate procedural safeguards as required by Freedman, supra.  Pp.  493 U. S. 223-230.
(a) Petitioners may raise a facial challenge to the licensing scheme.  Such challenges are permitted in the First Amendment context where the scheme vests unbridled discretion in the decisionmaker and where the regulation is challenged as overbroad.  Petitioners argue that the licensing scheme fails to set a time limit within which the licensing authority must act.  Since Freedman, supra, 380 U.S. at  380 U. S. 56-57 held that such a failure is a species of unbridled discretion, every application of the ordinance creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas.  Moreover, the businesses challenging the licensing scheme have a valid First Amendment interest.  Although the ordinance applies to some businesses that apparently are not protected by the First Amendment  -- e.g., escort agencies and sexual encounter centers -- it largely targets businesses purveying sexually explicit speech, which the city concedes for purposes of this litigation are protected by the First Amendment.  While the city has asserted that it requires every business -- regardless of whether it engages in First Amendment-protected speech -- to obtain a certificate of occupancy when it moves into a new location or the use of the structure changes, the challenged ordinance nevertheless is more onerous with respect to sexually oriented businesses, which are required to submit to inspections -- for example, when their ownership changes or when they apply for the annual renewal of their permits -- whether or not they have moved or the use of their structures has changed.  Pp.  493 U. S. 223-225.
(b) Freedman, supra, at 58-60 determined that the following procedural safeguards were necessary to ensure expeditious decisionmaking by a motion picture censorship board:  (1) any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period during which the status quo must be maintained; (2) expeditious judicial review of that decision must be available; and (8) the censor must bear the burden of going to court to suppress the speech and must bear the burden of proof once in court.  Like a censorship system, a licensing scheme creates the possibility that constitutionally protected speech will be suppressed where there are inadequate procedural safeguards to ensure prompt issuance of the license.  Thus, the license for a First Amendment-protected business must be issued in a reasonable period of time, and, accordingly, the first two Freedman safeguards are essential.  Here, although 
Page 493 U. S. 218
 the Dallas ordinance requires the chief of police to approve the issuance of a license within 30 days after receipt of an application, it also conditions such issuance upon approval by other municipal inspection agencies without setting forth time limits within which those inspections must occur.  Since the ordinance therefore fails to provide an effective time limitation on the licensing decision, and since it also fails to provide an avenue for prompt judicial review so as to minimize suppression of speech in the event of a license denial, its licensing requirement is unconstitutional insofar as it is enforced against those businesses engaged in First Amendment activity, as determined by the court on remand.  However, since the licensing scheme at issue is significantly different from the censorship system examined in Freedman, it does not present the grave dangers of such a system, and the First Amendment does not require that it contain the third Freedman safeguard.  Unlike the Freedman censor, Dallas does not engage in presumptively invalid direct censorship of particular expressive material, but simply performs the ministerial action of reviewing the general qualifications of each license applicant.  It therefore need not be required to carry the burden of going to court or of there justifying a decision to suppress speech.  Moreover, unlike the motion picture distributors considered in Freedman -- who were likely to be deterred from challenging the decision to suppress a particular movie if the burdens of going to court and of proof were not placed on the censor -- the license applicants under the Dallas scheme have every incentive to pursue a license denial through court, since the license is the key to their obtaining and maintaining a business.  Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988), is not dispositive of this litigation, since, although it struck down a licensing scheme for failing to provide adequate procedural safeguards, it did not address the proper scope of procedural safeguards with respect to such a scheme.  Since the Dallas ordinance summarily states that its terms and provisions are severable, the Court of Appeals must, on remand, determine to what extent the licensing requirement is severable.  Pp.  493 U. S. 225-230.
Justice BRENNAN, joined by Justice MARSHALL and Justice BLACKMUN, although agreeing that the ordinance's licensing scheme is invalid as to any First Amendment-protected business under the Freedman doctrine, concluded that Riley mandates application of all three of the Freedman procedural safeguards, not just two of them.  Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781,  487 U. S. 802, applied Freedman to invalidate a professional licensing scheme with respect to charity fundraisers who were engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, ruling that the scheme must require that the licensor -- i.e., the State, not the would-be fundraiser -- either issue a license within a specified brief period or go to court.  The principal opinion's grounds for declining 
Page 493 U. S. 219
 to require the third Freedman safeguard -- that the Dallas scheme does not require an administrator to engage in the presumptively invalid task of passing judgment on whether the content of particular speech is protected, and that it licenses entire businesses, not just individual films, so that applicants will not be inclined to abandon their interests -- do not distinguish the present litigation from Riley, where the licensor was not required to distinguish between protected and unprotected speech, and where the fundraisers had their entire livelihoods at stake.  Moreover, the danger posed by a license that prevents a speaker from speaking at all is not derived from the basis on which the license was purportedly denied, but is the unlawful stifling of speech that results.  Thus, there are no relevant differences between the fundraisers in Riley and the petitioners here, and, in the interest of protecting speech, the burdens of initiating judicial proceedings and of proof must be borne by the city.  Pp.  493 U. S. 239-242.

Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781,  487 U. S. 802, applied Freedman to invalidate a professional licensing scheme with respect to charity fundraisers who were engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, ruling that the scheme must require that the licensor -- i.e., the State, not the would-be fundraiser -- either issue a license within a specified brief period or go to court.  The principal opinion's grounds for declining 
Page 493 U. S. 219
 to require the third Freedman safeguard -- that the Dallas scheme does not require an administrator to engage in the presumptively invalid task of passing judgment on whether the content of particular speech is protected, and that it licenses entire businesses, not just individual films, so that applicants will not be inclined to abandon their interests -- do not distinguish the present litigation from Riley, where the licensor was not required to distinguish between protected and unprotected speech, and where the fundraisers had their entire livelihoods at stake.  Moreover, the danger posed by a license that prevents a speaker from speaking at all is not derived from the basis on which the license was purportedly denied, but is the unlawful stifling of speech that results.  Thus, there are no relevant differences between the fundraisers in Riley and the petitioners here, and, in the interest of protecting speech, the burdens of initiating judicial proceedings and of proof must be borne by the city.  Pp.  493 U. S. 239-242.

 October 16, 1989
 Petition for a writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2950, 2973 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.

 Richard Wilkerson, an Afro-American, was convicted of murder by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. During voir dire, the prosecution exercised 4 of its 12 peremptory challenges to remove all of the potential Afro-American jurors. After trial, while petitioner's case was pending on direct review, this Court held that the Equal Protection Clause ""forbids the States to strike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased in a particular case simply because the defendant is black."" Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 97, 1723 ( 1986). Petitioner subsequently raised a Batson claim in a petition for habeas corpus filed in state court. 
 The trial court concluded that Wilkerson had made a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination by the prosecution in the jury selection process. At the Batson hearing, one of the prosecutors who conducted voir dire conceded that race was a factor in his peremptory strike of an Afro-American juror: [ Wilkerson v. Texas 493 U.S. 924 (1990)

 Responding to questions concerning his peremptory strike of a different juror, the prosecutor indicated that he ""thought perhaps [the juror] might make some identification I guess, with the defendant to some extent."" Id., at 3-4. The questioning continued: 
 Finally, on redirect examination by the State, the same prosecutor stated that his perception that an Afro-American juror would extend sympathy to an Afro-American defendant was ""[o]ne of the many considerations [for striking a particular juror] but nothing major about that."" Id., at 76. 
 The trial court nonetheless concluded that the prosecutors ""did not exercise peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner to exclude venirepersons based upon racial considerations, nor did they, in any way, purposefully or deliberately deny jury participation to black persons because of race."" Id., at 10. The court based this legal conclusion on several pages of factual findings that relate in detail the prosecution's race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenges to the Afro- American venirepersons. Unaccountably, these findings do not mention, much less discuss, the prosecution's open admissions that race played a role in its decision to prevent the Afro-American members of the venire from serving on the petit jury. This omission in the state court's factual findings provides ample justification for this Court to dispense with the traditional deference, now codified by statute, that such findings are accorded on federal review.

No. 87-1965
Argued Oct. 11, 1989
Decided Feb. 27, 1990
494 U.S. 113

Syllabus 
Respondent Burch, while allegedly medicated and disoriented, signed forms requesting admission to, and treatment at, a Florida state mental hospital, in apparent compliance with state statutory requirements for ""voluntary"" admission to such facilities.  After his release, he brought suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 in the District Court against, inter alios, petitioners -- physicians, administrators, and staff members at the hospital -- on the ground that they had deprived him of his liberty without due process of law.  The complaint alleged that they violated state law by admitting him as a voluntary patient when they knew or should have known that he was incompetent to give informed consent to his admission, and that their failure to initiate Florida's involuntary placement procedure denied him constitutionally guaranteed procedural safeguards.  The court granted petitioners' motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), relying on Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, and Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, which held that a deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest caused by a state employee's random, unauthorized conduct does not give rise to a  1983 procedural due process claim unless the State fails to provide a postdeprivation remedy.  The court pointed out that Burch did not contend that the State's statutory procedure for placement was inadequate to ensure due process, but only that petitioners had failed to follow the procedure.  Since the State could not have anticipated or prevented the unauthorized deprivation of Burch's liberty, the court reasoned, there was no feasible predeprivation remedy, and the State's postdeprivation tort remedies provided Burch with all the process that was due him.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
Held:  Burch's complaint was sufficient to state a claim under  1983 for violation of his procedural due process rights.  While Parratt and Hudson apply to deprivations of liberty, they do not preclude Burch's claim, because predeprivation procedural safeguards might have been of value in preventing the alleged deprivation of Burch's liberty without either valid consent or an involuntary placement hearing.  Such a deprivation is not unpredictable.  It is foreseeable that persons requesting treatment might be incapable of informed consent, and that state officials with the power to admit patients might take their apparent willing 
Page 494 U. S. 114
 ness to be admitted at face value.  And the deprivation will occur, if at all, at a predictable point in the admissions process -- when a patient is given admission forms to sign.  Nor was predeprivation process impossible here.  Florida has a procedure for involuntary placement, but only the hospital staff is in a position to take notice of any misuse of the voluntary admission process and to ensure that the proper procedures are afforded both to those patients who are unwilling and to those who are unable to give consent.  In addition, petitioners' conduct was not ""unauthorized"" within the meaning of Parratt and Hudson, since the State had delegated to them the power and authority to deprive mental patients of their liberty and the concomitant duty to initiate the procedural safeguards set up by state law to guard against unlawful confinement.

 Case below, 292 Ark. 421, 731 S.W.2d 756; 300 Ark. 360, 779 S.W.2d 156. 
 Oct. 1, 1990. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 It is well established ""that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence legally insufficient"" to support conviction. Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 18, 2150, 2151 (1978). Nonetheless, the Arkansas Supreme Court concluded in this case that reversal for failure to prove an essential element of one statutory formulation of capital murder poses no bar to reprosecution under another statutory formulation of the same offense, because the State's decision to prosecute a defendant under the ""wrong"" murder statute is mere ""trial error."" Because I believe that this conclusion reflects a profound misreading of our double jeopardy precedents, I would grant the petition. 
 I Petitioner was twice tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for murdering James and Sandra Warren. He was initially convicted for felony murder on the theory that he had murdered the Warrens while burglarizing their home. The Arkansas Supreme Court reversed. [Footnote 1] See Parker v. State, 292 Ark. 421, 731 S.W.2d 756 (1987) (Parker I ). Reviewing the statutory elements of felony murder, the court concluded that the State's felony- murder statute ""cannot be read to encompass the facts of this case."" Id. at 425, 731 S.W.2d, at 758. The Arkansas capital felony-murder statute requires the State to prove that the defendant caused the death of another "" in the course of and in furtherance of the [underlying] felony."" Ark.Code Ann. 5-10-101(a)(1) (1987 and Supp.1989). ""The state's proof,"" the court explained, ""showed that [petitioner] followed Mr. Warren into the house for only one purpose-to commit the murders of the Warrens."" Parker I, 292 Ark., at 425, 731 S.W.2d, at 758. ""The killings were obviously a form of criminal homicide of some degree, but they were not 'in 
Page 498 U.S. 883 , 884
 the course of and in furtherance of' the [charged] burglary as required to be capital felony murder."" Ibid. The court noted that, under these facts, the State should have prosecuted Parker for ordinary capital murder rather than felony capital murder. Id., at 425-426, 731 S.W.2d, at 758. 
 Taking this last observation as an invitation to retry Parker, the State subsequently prosecuted Parker for ""caus[ing] the death of two . . . or more persons in the course of the same criminal episode."" Ark.Code Ann . 5-10-101(a)(3) (1987). On appeal, the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected petitioner's contention that his reprosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and affirmed petitioner's conviction. See Parker v. State, 300 Ark. 360, 779 S.W.2d 156 (1989) (Parker II ). Reviewing its disposition in Parker I, the court concluded that it had reversed petitioner's original conviction not because the evidence was insufficient, but because the State had committed the ""trial error"" of ""charging and trying [petitioner] under the wrong capital murder provision."" Parker II, supra, at 363-364, 779 S.W.2d, at 157. Consequently, the court held, its decision in Parker I posed no double jeopardy bar to reprosecuting petitioner under the applicable provision of the Arkansas capital murder statute. Parker II, supra, at 363-364, 779 S.W.2d, at 157-158.2 
 II 
 Our precedents recognize that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars reprosecution following reversal for insufficiency of the evidence but not following reversal for trial error. Burks, supra, 437 U.S., at 15-17-2150; accord, Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 39, 109 S. Ct. 285, 290 (1988).

 the course of and in furtherance of' the [charged] burglary as required to be capital felony murder."" Ibid. The court noted that, under these facts, the State should have prosecuted Parker for ordinary capital murder rather than felony capital murder. Id., at 425-426, 731 S.W.2d, at 758. 
 Taking this last observation as an invitation to retry Parker, the State subsequently prosecuted Parker for ""caus[ing] the death of two . . . or more persons in the course of the same criminal episode."" Ark.Code Ann . 5-10-101(a)(3) (1987). On appeal, the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected petitioner's contention that his reprosecution was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and affirmed petitioner's conviction. See Parker v. State, 300 Ark. 360, 779 S.W.2d 156 (1989) (Parker II ). Reviewing its disposition in Parker I, the court concluded that it had reversed petitioner's original conviction not because the evidence was insufficient, but because the State had committed the ""trial error"" of ""charging and trying [petitioner] under the wrong capital murder provision."" Parker II, supra, at 363-364, 779 S.W.2d, at 157. Consequently, the court held, its decision in Parker I posed no double jeopardy bar to reprosecuting petitioner under the applicable provision of the Arkansas capital murder statute. Parker II, supra, at 363-364, 779 S.W.2d, at 157-158.2

 Our precedents recognize that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars reprosecution following reversal for insufficiency of the evidence but not following reversal for trial error.

 John Edward SWINDLER, petitioner,v. A.L. LOCKHART, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction. No. 89-6679. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 April 23, 1990
 Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 A defendant's interest in a fundamentally fair trial outweighs the State's interest in trying the defendant in a particular venue. See, e.g., Lee v. Georgia, 488 U.S. 879 (1988) ( MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Accordingly, state laws that restrict a court's ability to protect a defendant from the possibility of juror exposure to prejudicial publicity unconstitutionally infringe on a defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury. Relying in part on its interpretation of Arkansas law, see Ark.Code Ann. 16-88-207 ( 1987) (""In no case shall a second removal of the same cause be allowed""), the trial court in this capital case refused to allow petitioner a second change of venue. I would grant the petition for certiorari to provide much needed guidance regarding the minimal due process requirements for state change of venue rules. When, as here, a State frames its venue rule in absolute terms and fails to permit the trial court to consider a particular defendant's right to a jury free from preconceptions regarding his guilt, such a rule violates due process. See Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 352, 1516 (1966) ("" 'It is true that in most cases involving claims of due process deprivations we require a showing of identifiable prejudice to the accused. Nevertheless, at times a 
Page 495 U.S. 911 , 912
 procedure employed by the State involves such a probability that prejudice will result that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process' "") ( quoting Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 542-543, 1632-1633 (1965)). Even if I did not believe that this case merited plenary review, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the death penalty, because I continue to believe that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231- 241, 2973-2977 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). 
 Petitioner was convicted of murdering a police officer and sentenced to death. His conviction was reversed by the Arkansas Supreme Court because of the trial court's failure to grant a change of venue from Sebastian County, where the killing occurred. Swindler v. State, 264 Ark. 107, 113, 569 S.W.2d 120, 123 (1978). Petitioner was thereafter retried in Scott County, a small rural county adjacent to Sebastian. Waldron, the seat of Scott County, is only 45 miles south of Fort Smith, the location of both the crime and the first trial. 
 During voir dire, a majority of the 120 venirepersons indicated that they were aware that petitioner had previously been found guilty of the crime and that he was wanted in another State for allegedly murdering two teenagers. More importantly, an overwhelming majority of the venire-98 out of 120-either tentatively or firmly believed that petitioner was guilty.

 Justice STEVENS, dissenting.

 Kenneth GRANVIEL, petitioner,v. TEXAS.No. 89-6484 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 29, 1990
 The petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
 Denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 This case raises the question whether an indigent criminal defendant's constitutional right to psychiatric assistance in preparing an insanity defense is satisfied by court appointment of a psychiatrist whose examination report is available to both the defense and prosecution. The Fifth Circuit, on habeas review, held that such an appointment is sufficient. Granviel v. Lynaugh, 881 F.2d 185 (1989). This ruling is squarely inconsistent with our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985), that a State must provide an indigent defendant a psychiatrist to assist in preparing and presenting his defense. Ake mandates the provision of a psychiatrist who will be part of the defense team and serve the defendant's interests in the context of our adversarial system. To allow the prosecution to enlist the psychiatrist's efforts to help secure the defendant's conviction would deprive an indigent defendant of the protections that our adversarial process affords all other defendants. 
 Kenneth Granviel was tried for capital murder in 1983. Prior to trial, Granviel requested that the court appoint a mental health expert to help him prepare an insanity defense. He specifically asked that the expert's report not be made available to the prosecution. The trial court denied petitioner's request for confidential expert assistance; it did, however, appoint a disinterested ex- 
Page 495 U.S. 963 , 964
 pert whose report would go to both the defense and prosecution, as authorized by Tex.Code Crim.Proc., Art. 46.03, 3 (Vernon 1979 and Supp. 1990). That statute provides: 
 ""(a) If notice of intention to raise the insanity defense is filed . . ., the court may, on its own motion or motion by the defendant, his counsel, or the prosecuting attorney, appoint disinterested experts experienced and qualified in mental health and mental retardation to examine the defendant with regard to the insanity defense and to testify thereto at any trial or hearing on this issue. 
 ""(b) The court may order any defendant to submit to examination for the purposes described in this article. . . . 
 ""(c) The court shall advise any expert appointed pursuant to this section of the facts and circumstances of the offense with which the defendant is charged and the elements of the insanity defense. 
 ""(d) A written report of the examination shall be submitted to the court within 30 days of the order of examination, and the court shall furnish copies of the report to the defense counsel and the prosecuting attorney."" 
 See also Art. 46.02 (providing for court appointment of expert to determine defendant's competency to stand trial). 
 Pursuant to this law, the court also allowed the prosecution, over Granviel's objection, to rebut Granviel's evidence of insanity with the report of a psychiatrist appointed at Granviel's request. 
 In Ake, we held that ""when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."" 470 U.S., at 83 (emphasis added). Ake was concerned not with establishing a procedure whereby an independent examiner could determine the validity of a defendant's insanity defense and present his findings to both parties and to the court. Rather, Ake was directed at providing a defendant with the tools necessary to present an effective defense within the context of our adversarial system, in which each party marshals evidence favorable to its side and aggressively challenges the evidence presented by the other side.

 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966), this Court held that ""the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpa- 
Page 497 U.S. 1011 , 1012
 tory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination."" Id., at 444. Consistent with the need for a bright-line rule, the Court adopted a straightforward definition of ""custodial interrogation "": ""questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."" Ibid. In this case, petitioner, a prison inmate, challenged the admission of statements he made in response to direct questioning by prison officials following the murder of a prison employee on the ground that they had not given him the Miranda warnings. Notwithstanding Miranda 's clear language, the State Court of Appeals held that petitioner was not in custody for purposes of Miranda, see No. 1583, 1987 WL 17303 (Sept. 22, 1987), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-129-A-130, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed this point without discussion, 42 Ohio St. 3d 136, 148, 538 N.E.2d 373, 385 (1989). Because the Courts of Appeals have approached the issue of what constitutes custody in the prison setting in differing ways,* this Court should grant the petition for certiorari to state clearly when Miranda applies in this context. 
 On February 2, 1984, the supervisor of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility's sheet metal shop was beaten to death. Immediately after the murder, prison officials closed off the shop area and began to conduct a strip search of the inmates there. During the search, the officials found blood on one inmate's clothing. When he was asked for an explanation, another inmate, petitioner William Bradley, told the officials that the first prisoner ""had nothing to do with this."" 42 Ohio St.3d, at 138, 538 N.E.2d, at 376.

 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 2950, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 ( 1966), this Court held that ""the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpa- 
Page 497 U.S. 1011 , 1012
 tory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination."" Id., at 444. Consistent with the need for a bright-line rule, the Court adopted a straightforward definition of ""custodial interrogation "": ""questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."" Ibid. In this case, petitioner, a prison inmate, challenged the admission of statements he made in response to direct questioning by prison officials following the murder of a prison employee on the ground that they had not given him the Miranda warnings. Notwithstanding Miranda 's clear language, the State Court of Appeals held that petitioner was not in custody for purposes of Miranda, see No. 1583, 1987 WL 17303 (Sept. 22, 1987), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-129-A-130, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed this point without discussion, 42 Ohio St. 3d 136, 148, 538 N.E.2d 373, 385 (1989). Because the Courts of Appeals have approached the issue of what constitutes custody in the prison setting in differing ways,* this Court should grant the petition for certiorari to state clearly when Miranda applies in this context. 
 On February 2, 1984, the supervisor of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility's sheet metal shop was beaten to death. Immediately after the murder, prison officials closed off the shop area and began to conduct a strip search of the inmates there. During the search, the officials found blood on one inmate's clothing. When he was asked for an explanation, another inmate, petitioner William Bradley, told the officials that the first prisoner ""had nothing to do with this."" 42 Ohio St.3d, at 138, 538 N.E.2d, at 376. The officials then searched petitioner and found blood on his clothing. The state court described the questioning that ensued: [497 U.S. 1011 , 1013]

 Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 
 Tonight, for the second time within a month, see Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U.S. 731 (1990), this Court permits a State to execute a prisoner who has waived further appeals on his behalf when serious doubts remain concerning his mental competence. I believe that we shirk our responsibility if we do not articulate standards by which the adequacy of procedures in state competency hearings may be judged. I would grant the petitions for certiorari and the corresponding applications for stay of execution. Indeed, four Members of this Court have voted to grant certiorari in this case, but because a stay cannot be entered without five votes, the- 
Page 497 U.S. 1016 , 1017
 execution cannot be halted. For the first time in recent memory, a man will be executed after the Court has decided to hear his claim. Cf. Watson v. Butler, 483 U.S. 1037, 1038, 7 ( 1987) (stay denied although four Justices voted to hold, rather than to grant, petition for certiorari).

 In Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149 (1990), this Court held that ""one necessary condition for 'next friend' standing in federal court is a showing by the proposed 'next friend' that the real party in interest is unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity."" Id. at 165. Although the Court noted that this prerequisite is not satisfied ""where an evidentiary hearing shows that the defendant has given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed,"" ibid., we did not have occasion in that case to decide the procedures that are required when a state court determines that a prisoner is competent to forgo further appeals in his case. We face that issue tonight. 
 Petitioner, the mother of condemned prisoner James Edward Smith, challenges the decision of the Texas courts, to which the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit have deferred, that Smith is competent to waive further appeal of his case. The state trial court held a hearing to determine Smith's competency, a hearing which seems to have been little more than a nonadversarial, ex parte chat among the trial judge, the prosecutor, and Smith. The hearing was scheduled without notice to Smith's mother and next friend, Ms. Alexzene Hamilton, despite the fact that Ms. Hamilton had appeared as petitioner on Smith's behalf as early as May 7, 1988. Indeed, it was upon her application that we granted a stay of execution in Hamilton v. Texas, 485 U.S. 1042 (1988). Smith was unrepresented by counsel; although the trial judge had arranged for an attorney to be present in the event that Smith wished to consult with him, the judge stated: ""I'm not going to force a lawyer to represent you."" After Smith indicated that he did not wish to speak with the attorney, that was the end of the matter. There was no cross-examination at the hearing.

 Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting. 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the death penalty in this case. Even if I did not hold this view, I would grant the petition to decide whether the Constitution requires a State to provide an indigent defendant access to diagnostic testing necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when the defendant demonstrates that his sanity at the time of the offense will be a significant issue at trial. I believe that our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985), compels us to answer that question in the affirmative. 
 Petitioner Robert Wayne Vickers was convicted of murdering a prison inmate and sentenced to death. His only defense at trial was insanity. Specifically, Vickers claimed that he suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, a brain disorder that can cause violent behavior and render a person unable to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his acts. Vickers' court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Bindelglas, determined, after a lengthy interview and an exhaustive review of Vickers' medical records, that Vickers suffered from ""definite dissociative reactions"" possibly due to temporal lobe epilepsy. App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7. Dr. Bindelglas based his opinion on Vickers' history of cerebral trauma and seizures, neurological deficits reported by a psychologist when Vickers was a child, improvement in Vickers' condition when he was placed on anti-convulsive and psychotropic medications and 
Page 497 U.S. 1033 , 1034
 reversion when he was taken off the medication, and an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) performed four years before the murder. Ibid. Dr. Bindelglas further opined that Vickers probably was in a dissociative state at the time of the offense, which made him ""incapable of rendering any judgement and . . . unable to know right from wrong."" Id., at B-9. Dr. Bindelglas stated that he could not make a definitive diagnosis, however, without certain neuropsychological testing. Ibid. 
 Based on Dr. Bindelglas' recommendation, petitioner requested that the trial court provide access to diagnostic testing. Petitioner included with his request an affidavit from a second psychiatrist, Dr. David Bear, who, after reviewing petitioner's records and examining him for five hours, agreed that there was a ""substantial possibility"" that Vickers suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy, which may have impaired his ability to "" appreciate the quality and nature of the act and its wrongfulness."" Id., at C-4, C-9. Dr. Bear also stated that diagnostic testing, including a careful neurological examination and multiple EEG's, was necessary ""before professional judgment can be rendered regarding Mr. Vickers' mental state at the time of the subject offense."" In addition, the state's own expert, Dr. Maier Tuchler, testified at petitioner's competency hearing that diagnostic testing was necessary to determine definitely whether Vickers suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy. Finally, petitioner supplied the court with the affidavits of two other psychiatrists who testified that strong evidence indicated that Vickers suffered from a mental disorder which impaired his capacity to make rational judgments, but that diagnostic testing was necessary before a firm conclusion could be reached . App. to Pet. for Cert. D and E. 
 Despite the consensus of these medical experts that diagnostic testing was necessary, the court denied petitioner's request. The court relied on a two-paragraph letter from a psychiatrist appointed at the State's request, Dr. William Masland. Dr. Masland concluded, on the basis of a quick review of petitioner's medical records, conversations with prisoners and prison staff, and a brief interview with Vickers, that "" there is absolutely nothing to suggest that this man is epileptic"" and that ""further diagnostic testing . . . would be totally superfluous."" Id., at F. The court refused to reconsider its order after receiving additional affidavits from Dr. Bindelglas and Dr. Bear and two neurologists [497 U.S. 1033 , 1035]
