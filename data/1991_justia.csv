UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE v.
RAY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-747. Argued October 9, 1991-Decided December 16, 1991
In 1981, the Secretary of State obtained an assurance from the Haitian Government that it would not subject to prosecution for illegal departure undocumented Haitians interdicted by the United States and returned to Haiti. Personnel of petitioner State Department monitored Haiti's compliance with the assurance by conducting interviews with a ""representative sample"" of unsuccessful emigrants, most of whom reported no harassment or prosecution after their return. During immigration proceedings, respondents, undocumented Haitian nationals and their attorney, sought to prove that the nationals were entitled to political asylum in the United States because Haitians who immigrate illegally face a well-founded fear of persecution upon returning home. To disprove the Government's assertion that returnees have not been persecuted, respondents made Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for copies of petitioner's interview reports and received, inter alia, 17 documents from which the names and other identifying information had been redacted. The District Court ordered petitioner to produce the redacted material, finding that the deletions were not authorized by FOIA Exemption 6, which exempts from disclosure ""personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."" The Court of Appeals affirmed. It found that the returnees' significant privacy interests-stemming from respondents' intent to use the redacted information to contact and question the returnees and from the Federal Government's promise to maintain their confidentiality-were outweighed by the public interest in learning whether the Government is adequately monitoring Haiti's compliance with its obligation and is honest when its officials opine that Haiti is adhering to its assurance. The court also concluded that the indirect benefit of giving respondents the means to locate and question returnees provided a public value requiring disclosure.
Held: Disclosure of the unredacted interview reports would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the returnees' privacy. Pp. 171-182.

165
(a) In order to determine whether petitioner has met its burden of justifying the redaction, the individual's right of privacy must be balanced against the ForA's basic policy of opening agency action to the light of public scrutiny. Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 372. Pp.173-175.
(b) The privacy interest at stake in this case is more substantial than the Court of Appeals recognized. The invasion of privacy from summaries containing personal details about particular returnees, while de minimis when the returnees' identities are unknown, is significant when the information is linked to particular individuals. In addition, disclosure would publicly identify the returnees, possibly subjecting them or their families to embarrassment in their social and community relationships or to retaliatory action that might result from a renewed interest in their aborted attempt to emigrate. The lower court also gave insufficient weight to the fact that the interviews were conducted pursuant to an assurance of confidentiality, since the returnees might otherwise have been unwilling to discuss private matters and since the risk of mistreatment gives this group an additional interest in assuring that their anonymity is maintained. Finally, respondents' intent to interview the returnees magnifies the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of their identities. pp. 175-177.
(c) The public interest in knowing whether petitioner has adequately monitored Haiti's compliance with the assurance has been adequately served by disclosure of the redacted interview summaries, which reveal how many returnees were interviewed, when the interviews took place, the interviews' contents, and details about the returnees' status. The addition of the redacted information would shed no further light on petitioner's conduct of its obligation. Pp. 177-178.
(d) The question whether the ""derivative use"" of requested documents-here, the hope that the information can be used to obtain additional information outside the Government files-would ever justify release of information about private individuals need not be addressed, since there is nothing in the record to suggest that a second set of interviews would produce any additional relevant information. Nor is there a scintilla of evidence that tends to impugn the integrity of the interview reports, and, therefore, they should be accorded a presumption of legitimacy. Pp.178-179.

IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE ET AL. v. NATIONAL CENTER FOR IMMIGRANTS' RIGHTS, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-1090. Argued November 13, 1991-Decided December 16,1991
Section 242(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes the Attorney General to arrest excludable aliens and, pending a determination of their deportability, either to hold them in custody or to release them on bond containing conditions prescribed by the Attorney General. Respondent individuals and organizations filed suit in the District Court against petitioners, alleging that 8 CFR  103.6(a) (2)(ii)-which is entitled ""Condition against unauthorized employment"" and generally requires that release bonds contain a ""condition barring employment"" pending a deportability determination-was invalid on its face and therefore could not be enforced even against aliens who may not lawfully accept employment in this country. Ultimately, the District Court held that the regulation was beyond the Attorney General's statutory authority. The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the regulation barred all employment, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that the Attorney General exceeded his authority in promulgating it because the no-employment condition was not related to the purposes of the INA and the regulation did not provide for ""individualized decisions"" on the imposition of bond conditions as required by the statute.
Held: The regulation on its face is consistent with the Attorney General's statutory authority. Pp. 188-196.
(a) No ""as-applied"" challenges to the regulation nor any constitutional claims raised by respondents' initial complaint are before this Court. P.188.
(b) The regulation does not contemplate the inclusion of no-work conditions in bonds issued to aliens who are authorized to work. Reading the text's generic reference to ""employment"" as a reference to the ""unauthorized employment"" identified in the paragraph's title helps to resolve any ambiguity in the text's language. See, e. g., Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U. S. 714, 723. Moreover, the agency's consistent interpretation of the regulation as applying only to unauthorized employment is due deference. This conclusion is further supported by the regulation's text, the agency's comments when the rule was promulgated, operating

184
instructions issued to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) personnel, and the absence of any evidence that INS has ever imposed the condition on any alien authorized to work. Pp. 189-191.
(c) The regulation is wholly consistent with the established concern of immigration law to preserve jobs for American workers and thus is squarely within the scope of the Attorney General's statutory authority. United States v. Witkovich, 353 U. S. 194; Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, distinguished. Pp. 191-194.
(d) The regulation, when properly construed, and when viewed in the context of INS' administrative procedures-an initial informal determination regarding an alien's status, the right to seek discretionary relief from the INS and secure temporary authorization, and the right to seek prompt administrative and judicial review of bond conditionsprovides the individualized determinations contemplated in the statute. Pp. 194-196.

HILTON v. SOUTH CAROLINA PUBLIC RAILWAYS COMMISSION
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA No. 90-848. Argued October 8, 1991-Decided December 16, 1991
Respondent South Carolina Public Railways Commission, a state agency that is a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad, was sued in state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FE LA) by its employee, petitioner Hilton, who alleged that he was injured in the course of his employment as a result of the commission's negligence. In dismissing the complaint on the ground that FELA does not authorize a damages action against a state agency, even if suit is maintained in a state forum, the trial court acknowledged that in Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, this Court interpreted FELA to permit such actions, but held that in effect Parden had been overruled by subsequent decisions of the Court. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed.
Held: FELA creates a cause of action against a state-owned railroad, enforceable in state court. Pp.201-207.
(a) Absent sufficient, countervailing justifications for departing from precedent, the strong considerations favoring adherence to stare decisis in this case compel the Court to reaffirm Parden insofar as it held, 377 U. S., at 187-188, that when Congress used the phrase ""[e]very common carrier by railroad"" to describe the class of employers subject to FELA's terms, it intended to include state-owned railroads. Weight must be accorded to the continued acceptance of the Parden holding by Congress, which has had almost 30 years in which to take corrective action if it disagreed with that holding, but has chosen not to do so. Moreover, overruling Parden would require an extensive legislative response by the many States, including South Carolina, that have specifically excluded railroad workers from workers' compensation coverage on the assumption that FELA adequately protects those workers in the event of injuries caused by an employer's negligence, and would dislodge the settled rights and expectations of employees and employers who have been acting on that assumption. Overruling Parden would also throw into doubt this Court's decisions holding that the entire federal scheme of railroad regulation applies to state-owned railroads. Pp.201-203.
(b) Decisions subsequent to Parden do not require the Court to depart from stare decisis in this case. Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation, 483 U. S. 468, 478-which held that the

198
Syllabus
Jones Act, which incorporates FELA's remedial scheme, does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, ibid., but which explicitly reserved the question whether in that Act (or in FELA) Congress intended to create a cause of action against the States, id., at 476, n. 6 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 495 (WHITE, J., concurring)-cannot be characterized as having considered and rejected the aforementioned arguments for following stare decisis, since Welch neither addressed nor discussed the most vital consideration of today's decision: that to confer immunity from state-court suit would strip all FELA and Jones Act protection from state-employed workers. Further, the Welch holding cannot be treated as determinative of the issue here presented, since Welch's statement that Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity ""only"" by making its intention unmistakably clear in the statutory language, id., at 471, was made in the context of establishing a rule of constitutional law based on the Eleventh Amendment, which does not apply in state courts. Nor was Parden effectively overruled by Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65, which, in holding that a State is not a ""person"" suable under 42 U. S. C.  1983, relied in part on the lack of any ""clear statement"" in the statute of a congressional intent to impose such liability. Will's ""clear statement"" rule is not a per se rule of constitutional law, but only an ""ordinary rule of statutory construction,"" ibid. The issue in this case, as in Will, is a pure question of statutory construction, where the stare decisis doctrine is most compelling. Thus the clear statement inquiry need not be made here and the Court need not decide whether FELA satisfies that standard, for the rule in any event does not prevail over the stare decisis doctrine as applied to a longstanding statutory construction implicating important reliance interests. And when the clear statement rule is either overcome or inapplicable so that a federal statute does impose liability upon the States, the Supremacy Clause makes that statute the law in every State, fully enforceable in state courts. Pp. 203-207.
Reversed and remanded.

WILLIAM ""SKY"" KING v. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-889. Argued October 16, 1991-Decided December 16,1991
Petitioner King, a National Guard member, advised his civilian employer, respondent St. Vincent's Hospital, that he had accepted a 3-year fulltime appointment with the Guard, and requested a leave of absence from his hospital job as ostensibly guaranteed by 38 U. S. C.  2024(d), which provides reemployment rights to service personnel in King's position. St. Vincent's denied King's request and brought suit in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act does not provide reemployment rights after tours of duty as long as King's. The court granted the requested relief, ruling that service of the type in question was protected by  2024(d), but holding, under Circuit precedent, that leave requests under that subsection must be reasonable, and that King's request for a 3-year leave was per se unreasonable. A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: Section 2024(d) does not limit the length of military service after which a member of the Armed Forces retains a right to civilian reemployment. Subsection (d)'s text-which specifies that any covered employee ""shall ... be granted a leave ... for the period required to perform active duty [and] [u]pon ... release from ... such duty ... shall be permitted to return to [his or her] position"" -is utterly silent about any durationallimit on the protection it provides. Reading the statute as a whole, it must be inferred that the unqualified nature of subsection (d)'s protection was deliberate, since other subsections of  2024, protecting other classes of full-time service personnel, expressly limit the periods of their protection. St. Vincent's argument that such limits reflect a hierarchy of reemployment rights-under which reservists subject to duty under subsection (d) are entitled to the least protection and are therefore subject to an imprecise durationallimit of reasonableness-is unconvincing because its conclusion rests on circular reasoning, requiring the assumption of the point at issue: that  2024(d) reservists really do get less protection than the inductees, enlistees, and other veterans covered by the other subsections. Pp. 218-223.
901 F.2d 1068, reversed and remanded.

SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except THOMAS, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.
Amy L. Wax argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Starr, Assistant Attorney General Gerson, Deputy Solicitor General Shapiro, and Michael Jay Singer.
Harry L. Hopkins argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.
JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether 38 U. S. C.  2024(d), a provision of what is popularly known as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, implicitly limits the length of military service after which a member of the Armed Forces retains a right to civilian reemployment. We hold that it does not.

I
In June 1987, petitioner William ""Sky"" King,l a member of the Alabama National Guard,2 applied to become command sergeant major in the Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) program, and thereby undertook to serve the 3-year tour of duty required by Army regulations 3 of the person holding that position.4 The next month King learned of his selection and advised his employer, respondent St. Vincent's Hospital, that he had accepted the Guard's 3-year full-time appointment.

WILLIAM ""SKY"" KING v. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-889. Argued October 16, 1991-Decided December 16,1991
Petitioner King, a National Guard member, advised his civilian employer, respondent St. Vincent's Hospital, that he had accepted a 3-year fulltime appointment with the Guard, and requested a leave of absence from his hospital job as ostensibly guaranteed by 38 U. S. C.  2024(d), which provides reemployment rights to service personnel in King's position. St. Vincent's denied King's request and brought suit in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act does not provide reemployment rights after tours of duty as long as King's. The court granted the requested relief, ruling that service of the type in question was protected by  2024(d), but holding, under Circuit precedent, that leave requests under that subsection must be reasonable, and that King's request for a 3-year leave was per se unreasonable. A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: Section 2024(d) does not limit the length of military service after which a member of the Armed Forces retains a right to civilian reemployment. Subsection (d)'s text-which specifies that any covered employee ""shall ... be granted a leave ... for the period required to perform active duty [and] [u]pon ... release from ... such duty ... shall be permitted to return to [his or her] position"" -is utterly silent about any durationallimit on the protection it provides. Reading the statute as a whole, it must be inferred that the unqualified nature of subsection (d)'s protection was deliberate, since other subsections of  2024, protecting other classes of full-time service personnel, expressly limit the periods of their protection. St. Vincent's argument that such limits reflect a hierarchy of reemployment rights-under which reservists subject to duty under subsection (d) are entitled to the least protection and are therefore subject to an imprecise durationallimit of reasonableness-is unconvincing because its conclusion rests on circular reasoning, requiring the assumption of the point at issue: that  2024(d) reservists really do get less protection than the inductees, enlistees, and other veterans covered by the other subsections. Pp. 218-223.
901 F.2d 1068, reversed and remanded.

Harry L. Hopkins argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.
JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether 38 U. S. C.  2024(d), a provision of what is popularly known as the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, implicitly limits the length of military service after which a member of the Armed Forces retains a right to civilian reemployment. We hold that it does not.

In June 1987, petitioner William ""Sky"" King,l a member of the Alabama National Guard,2 applied to become command sergeant major in the Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) program, and thereby undertook to serve the 3-year tour of duty required by Army regulations 3 of the person holding that position.4 The next month King learned of his selection and advised his employer, respondent St. Vincent's Hospital, that he had accepted the Guard's 3-year full-time appointment.

UNION BANK v. WaLAS, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE FOR THE ESTATE OF ZZZZ BEST CO., INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No.90-1491. Argued November 5, 1991-Decided December 11, 1991
During the 90-day period preceding its filing of a petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, ZZZZ Best Co., Inc. (Debtor) made two interest payments and paid a loan commitment fee on its long-term debt to petitioner, Union Bank (Bank). Mter he was appointed trustee of the Debtor's estate, respondent Wolas filed a complaint against the Bank to recover those payments as voidable preferences under 11 U. S. C.  547(b). The Bankruptcy Court held that the payments were transfers made in the ordinary course of business pursuant to  547(c)(2) and thus were excepted from  547(b). The District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ordinary course of business exception was not available to long-term creditors.
Held:
1. Payments on long-term debt, as well as those on short-term debt, may qualify for the ordinary course of business exception to the trustee's power to avoid preferential transfers. Section 547(c)(2) contains no language distinguishing between long- and short-term debt and, therefore, provides no support for Wolas' contention that its coverage extends only to short-term debt. Moreover,  547's relevant history in part supports, and is not otherwise inconsistent with, a literal reading of the statute. While  547(c)(2), as originally enacted, was limited to payments made within 45 days of the date a debt was incurred, Congress amended the provision in 1984 by deleting the time limitation entirely. That Congress may have intended only to address particular concerns of specific short-term creditors in the amendment or may not have foreseen all of the consequences of its statutory enactment is insufficient reason for refusing to give effect to  547(c)(2)'s plain meaning. Also unpersuasive is Wolas' argument that Congress originally enacted  547(c)(2) to codify a judicially crafted ""current expense"" rule covering contemporaneous exchanges for new value, since other  547(c) exceptions occupy some (if not all) of the territory previously covered by that rule, and since there is no extrinsic evidence that Congress intended to codify the rule in  547(c)(2). Nor does the fact that the exception's availability to long-term creditors may not directly further  547's underlying policy of equality of distribution among all creditors support

limiting  547(c)(2) to short-term debt, for it does further the provision's other policy of deterring creditors from racing to the courthouse to dismember a debtor and may indirectly further the equal distribution goal as well. Pp. 154-162.
2. The question whether the Bankruptcy Court correctly concluded that the Debtor's payments qualify for the ordinary course of business exception remains open for the Court of Appeals on remand. P. 162. 921 F.2d 968, reversed and remanded.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court. Section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S.

The Code makes an exception, however, for transfers made in the ordinary course of business,  547(c)(2). The question presented is whether payments on long-term debt may qualify for that exception.

SIMON & SCHUSTER, INC. v. MEMBERS OF THE NEW YORK STATE CRIME VICTIMS BOARD ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 90-1059. Argued October 15, 1991-Decided December 10,1991
Among other things, New York's ""Son of Sam"" law provides that an ""entity"" contracting with a person ""accused or convicted of a crime"" for the production of a book or other work describing the crime must pay to respondent Crime Victims Board any moneys owed to that person under the contract; requires the Board to deposit such funds in an escrow account for payment to any victim who, within five years, obtains a civil judgment against the accused or convicted person and to the criminal's other creditors; and defines ""person convicted of a crime"" to include ""any person who has voluntarily and intelligently admitted the commission of a crime for which such person is not prosecuted."" Mter it discovered that petitioner publisher had signed an agreement with an author who had contracted with admitted organized crime figure Henry Hill for the production of a book about Hill's life, the Board, inter alia, determined that petitioner had violated the Son of Sam law and ordered it to turn over all money payable to Hill. Petitioner then brought suit under 42 U. S. C.  1983, seeking a declaration that the law violates the First Amendment and an injunction barring the law's enforcement. The District Court found the law to be consistent with the Amendment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: The Son of Sam law is inconsistent with the First Amendment.
Pp. 115-123.
(a) Whether the First Amendment ""speaker"" is considered to be Hill, whose income the New York law places in escrow because of the story he has told, or petitioner, which can publish books about crime with the assistance of only those criminals willing to forgo remuneration for at least five years, the law singles out speech on a particular subject for a financial burden that it places on no other speech and no other income and, thus, is presumptively inconsistent with the Amendment. Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 447; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 230. The fact that the law escrows speechderived income, rather than taxing a percentage of it outright as did the law invalidated in Arkansas Writers' Project, cannot serve as the basis for disparate treatment under the Amendment, since both forms of financial burden operate as disincentives to speak. Moreover, the

106

Syllabus
Board's assertion that discriminatory financial treatment is suspect only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas is incorrect, since this Court has long recognized that even regulations aimed at proper governmental concerns can restrict unduly the exercise of rights under the Amendment. Furthermore, the Board's claim that the law is permissible under the Amendment because it focuses generally on an ""entity"" rather than specifically on the media falters, first, on semantic grounds, since any entity that enters into a contract with a convicted person to transmit that person's speech becomes by definition a medium of communication, and, second, on constitutional grounds, since the governmental power to impose content-based financial disincentives on speech does not vary with the identity of the speaker. Accordingly, in order to justify the differential treatment imposed by the law, the State must show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. Id., at 231. Pp. 115-118.
(b) The State has a compelling interest in compensating victims from the fruits of crime. Cf. Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 629. However, contrary to the Board's assertion, the State has little if any interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds of the wrongdoer's speech about the crime. The Board cannot explain why the State should have any greater interest in compensating victims from the proceeds of criminals' ""storytelling"" than from any of their other assets, nor offer any justification for a distinction between this expressive activity and any other activity in connection with its interest in transferring the fruits of crime from criminals to their victims. Cf., e. g., Arkansas Writers' Project, supra, at 231. Like the governmental entities in the latter and similar cases, the Board has taken the effect of the statute and posited that effect as the State's interest. Pp. 118-121.
(c) The New York law is not narrowly tailored to achieve the State's objective of compensating victims from the profits of crime. The law is significantly overinclusive, since it applies to works on any subject provided that they express the author's thoughts or recollections about his crime, however tangentially or incidentally, and since its broad definition of ""person convicted of a crime"" enables the Board to escrow the income of an author who admits in his work to having committed a crime, whether or not he was ever actually accused or convicted. These two provisions combine to encompass a wide range of existing and potential works that do not enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated. Pp. 121-123.

ARDESTANI v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No.90-1141. Argued October 8, 1991-Decided December 10, 1991
Mter petitioner Ardestani prevailed in an administrative deportation proceeding brought by respondent Immigration and Naturalization Service, an Immigration Judge awarded her attorney's fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which permits a prevailing party in an ""adversary adjudication"" before an administrative agency to recover fees from the Government, 5 U. S. C.  504(a)(1). The EAJA defines an ""adversary adjudication,"" in relevant part, as ""an adjudication under section 554 of [Title 5],"" which is part of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  504(b)(1)(C)(i). Section 554, in turn, applies, inter alia, to ""every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing."" The Board of Immigration Appeals vacated and denied Ardestani's award on the ground that deportation proceedings are not within the EAJA's scope, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: Administrative deportation proceedings are not adversary adjudications ""under section 554"" and thus do not fall within the category of proceedings for which the EAJA has waived sovereign immunity and authorized the award of attorney's fees and costs. Pp. 132-139.
(a) Although immigration proceedings are required by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to be determined on the record after a hearing, 8 U. S. C.  1252(b), they are not governed by the APA. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U. S. 302. It is immaterial that regulations have been promulgated conforming deportation hearings more closely to the procedures required for APA adjudications, for Marcello rests in large part on the INA's prescription that it ""shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining [an alien's] deportability,"" 8 U. S. C.  1252(b) (emphasis added), and leaves open no possibility that the INA should be displaced by the APA if the regulations governing immigration proceedings become functionally equivalent to  554's procedures. Pp. 133-134.
(b) The most natural reading of the EAJA's applicability to adjudications ""under section 554,"" and that adopted by seven Courts of Appeals, is that those proceedings must be ""subject to"" or ""governed by""  554.

130
Syllabus
The strong presumption that the statute's plain language expresses congressional intent, Rubin v. United States, 449 U. S. 424, 430, is not rebutted by any statements in the EAJA's legislative history. Thus, the meaning of ""under section 554"" is unambiguous in the context of the EAJA and does not permit Ardestani's reading that, since both deportation and  554 proceedings are required ""to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,"" the phrase ""under section 554"" encompasses all adjudications ""as defined in""  554(a), even if they are not otherwise governed by that section. This conclusion is reinforced by the limited nature of waivers of sovereign immunity. The EAJA renders the United States liable for attorney's fees and, thus, amounts to a partial waiver of sovereign immunity, which must be strictly construed in the United States' favor, see, e. g., Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 318. United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 118; Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95; Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892, distinguished. Also rejected is Ardestani's argument that a functional interpretation of the EAJA is needed to further the legislative goals underlying the statute. While making the EAJA applicable to deportation proceedings would serve its broad purposes of eliminating financial disincentives for those who would defend against unjustified governmental action and deterring the unreasonable exercise of Government authority, it is the province of Congress to decide whether to bring such proceedings within the statute's scope. Pp. 134-138.

Section 554, in turn, applies, inter alia, to ""every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing."" The Board of Immigration Appeals vacated and denied Ardestani's award on the ground that deportation proceedings are not within the EAJA's scope, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: Administrative deportation proceedings are not adversary adjudications ""under section 554"" and thus do not fall within the category of proceedings for which the EAJA has waived sovereign immunity and authorized the award of attorney's fees and costs. Pp. 132-139.
(a) Although immigration proceedings are required by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to be determined on the record after a hearing, 8 U. S. C.  1252(b), they are not governed by the APA. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U. S. 302. It is immaterial that regulations have been promulgated conforming deportation hearings more closely to the procedures required for APA adjudications, for Marcello rests in large part on the INA's prescription that it ""shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining [an alien's] deportability,"" 8 U. S. C.  1252(b) (emphasis added), and leaves open no possibility that the INA should be displaced by the APA if the regulations governing immigration proceedings become functionally equivalent to  554's procedures. Pp. 133-134.
(b) The most natural reading of the EAJA's applicability to adjudications ""under section 554,"" and that adopted by seven Courts of Appeals, is that those proceedings must be ""subject to"" or ""governed by""  554.

Syllabus
The strong presumption that the statute's plain language expresses congressional intent, Rubin v. United States, 449 U. S. 424, 430, is not rebutted by any statements in the EAJA's legislative history. Thus, the meaning of ""under section 554"" is unambiguous in the context of the EAJA and does not permit Ardestani's reading that, since both deportation and  554 proceedings are required ""to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,"" the phrase ""under section 554"" encompasses all adjudications ""as defined in""  554(a), even if they are not otherwise governed by that section. This conclusion is reinforced by the limited nature of waivers of sovereign immunity. The EAJA renders the United States liable for attorney's fees and, thus, amounts to a partial waiver of sovereign immunity, which must be strictly construed in the United States' favor, see, e. g., Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310, 318. United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 118; Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95; Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892, distinguished. Also rejected is Ardestani's argument that a functional interpretation of the EAJA is needed to further the legislative goals underlying the statute. While making the EAJA applicable to deportation proceedings would serve its broad purposes of eliminating financial disincentives for those who would defend against unjustified governmental action and deterring the unreasonable exercise of Government authority, it is the province of Congress to decide whether to bring such proceedings within the statute's scope. Pp. 134-138.

ESTELLE, WARDEN v. McGUIRE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-1074. Argued October 9, 1991-Decided December 4, 1991
Respondent McGuire was found guilty in a California state court of the second-degree murder of his infant daughter, Tori. Among the prosecution's witnesses were two physicians, who testified that Tori was a battered child who had suffered prior injuries. The battered child testimony revealed evidence of rectal tearing, which was at least six weeks old, and evidence of partially healed rib fractures, which were approximately seven weeks old. The trial court instructed the jury that the prior injury evidence could be considered for ""the limited purpose of determining if it tends to show ... a clear connection between the other two offense[s] and the one of which [McGuire] is accused, so that it may be logically concluded that if the Defendant committed other offenses, he also committed the crime charged in this case."" The State Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding that the introduction of prior injury evidence was proper under state law to prove ""battered child syndrome,"" which exists when a child has sustained repeated and/or serious injuries by nonaccidental means. Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied McGuire's petition for habeas corpus. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the trial was arbitrary and fundamentally unfair in violation of due process. It ruled that the prior injury evidence was erroneously admitted to establish battered child syndrome, because there was no evidence linking McGuire to the prior injuries and no claim made at trial that Tori died accidently, and that the jury instruction on the use of prior act evidence allowed a finding of guilt based simply on a judgment that he committed the prior acts.
Held: Neither the admission of the challenged evidence nor the jury instruction as to its use rises to the level of a due process violation. Pp.67-75.
(a) The prior injury evidence, although not linked to McGuire himself, was probative on the question of the intent with which the person who caused Tori's injuries acted, since it demonstrated that her death was the result of an intentional act by someone, and not an accident. The fact that no claim that Tori died accidentally was made at trial did not relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove all of the essential elements of second-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. By eliminating the possibility of accident, the evidence was clearly probative of

63
such an element: that the killing was intentional. It was also improper for the Court of Appeals to base its holding on its conclusion that the evidence was incorrectly admitted under state law, since it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 780. pp.67-70.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the instruction allowed the jury to consider the prior injury evidence for more than simply proof of battered child syndrome. The instruction's language forecloses McGuire's claim that the jury was directed to find that he had committed the prior acts. The trial court's inclusion of the words ""if the Defendant committed other offenses"" unquestionably left it to the jury to determine whether he committed the prior acts and to use the evidence in deciding his guilt only if it believed that he had committed those acts. To the extent that the jury may have believed that he inflicted the prior injuries, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support that conclusion. Also rejected is McGuire's argument that, even if the determination of the perpetrator was left to the jury, the instruction was a propensity instruction, allowing the jury to base its determination of guilt in part upon the conclusion that McGuire had committed the prior acts and therefore had a disposition to commit this type of crime. While the instruction was ambiguous, there is no ""reasonable likelihood"" that the jury would have concluded that it, read in the context of other instructions, authorized the use of propensity evidence. Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380. It seems far more likely that the jury understood the instruction to mean that if it found a ""clear connection"" between the prior and instant injuries, and if it found that McGuire had committed the prior injuries, then it could use that fact in determining that he committed the crime charged. This parallels the use of prior act evidence for the purpose of showing intent, identity, motive, or plan, see, e. g., Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b). More importantly, the court specifically guarded against possible misuse by advising the jury that the prior injury evidence, if believed, could not be considered to prove that McGuire was ""a person of bad character or that he ha[d] a disposition to commit crimes."" Neither the belief that the instruction violated state law nor a belief that the trial judge incorrectly interpreted the state evidence code is a ground for federal habeas relief. Pp. 70-75.

SOUTHWEST MARINE, INC. v. GIZONI
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-584. Argued October 15, 1991-Decided December 4,1991
Petitioner Southwest Marine, Inc., a ship repair facility operator, owns several floating platforms that, among other things, support ship repairmen engaged in their work. Respondent Gizoni, a rigging foreman, worked on the platforms and rode them as they were towed into place. Disabled when his foot broke through a wooden sheet covering a hole in a platform's deck, he applied for, and received, medical and compensation benefits from petitioner pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA). He later brought suit against petitioner under, inter alia, the Jones Act, alleging that he was a seaman injured as a result of his employer's negligence. The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment, concluding that, as a matter of law, Gizoni was not a Jones Act seaman, and that he was a harbor worker precluded from bringing his action by the LHWCA, which provides the exclusive remedy for a maritime employee, 33 U. S. C.  905(a). The term employee includes, inter alios, any harbor worker, including a ship repairman, but not ""a master or member of a crew of any vessel,""  902(3). The Court of Appeals reversed both determinations. It held that questions of fact existed as to Gizoni's seaman status; and it rejected the notion that any employee whose work involved ship repair was necessarily restricted to remedy under the LHWCA, reasoning that coverage under the Jones Act or the LHWCA depended not on the claimant's job title, but on the nature of the claimant's work and Congress' intent in enacting those statutes.
Held: A maritime worker whose occupation is one of those enumerated in the LHWCA may be a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act. Pp.86-92.
(a) It cannot be the case that, as a matter of law, the LHWCA provides the exclusive remedy for all harbor workers, since the LHWCA and its exclusionary provision do not apply to a harbor worker who is also a ""member of a crew of any vessel,"" a phrase that is a ""refinement"" of the term ""seaman"" in the Jones Act. McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, 355. Although better characterized as a mixed question of law and fact, the inquiry into seaman status is fact specific and depends on the vessel's nature and the employee's precise relation to it. A maritime worker need only be doing a ship's work, not aiding

82
Syllabus
in its navigation, in order to qualify as a ""seaman"" under the Jones Act. Id., at 349. Petitioner's argument that this fact-intensive inquiry may always be resolved as a matter of law if the claimant's job fits within one of the enumerated occupations defining the term ""employee"" covered by the LHWCA ignores the fact that some maritime workers may be Jones Act seamen performing a job specifically enumerated under the LHWCA. pp. 86-89.
(b) Petitioner's several arguments to foreclose Gizoni's Jones Act suit are rejected. Decisions holding that the LHWCA provides the exclusive remedy for certain injured railroad workers otherwise permitted by the Federal Employers' Liability Act to pursue a negligence cause of action provide no meaningful guidance here, for the LHWCA contains no exclusion for railroad workers comparable to that for Jones Act seamen. Petitioner errs in arguing that, where a maritime worker is arguably covered by the LHWCA, Congress intended to preclude or stay traditional Jones Act suits in the district courts pending a final LHWCA administrative agency determination of that issue. Indeed, the LHWCA anticipates that such suits could be brought. See 33 U. S. C.  913(d). And, unlike the Federal Employees Compensation Act, the LHWCA contains no ""unambiguous and comprehensive"" provisions barring any judicial review of administrative determinations of coverage. Moreover, its administrative proceedings do not require the same jurisdictional limitations that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) places on courts in favor of National Labor Relations Board hearings, since the LHWCA's proceedings in no way approach the NLRA's complex and interrelated federal scheme of law, remedy, and administration requiring pre-emption in those cases. Neither is it essential to the LHWCA's administration that resolution of the coverage issue be left in the first instance to agency proceedings. Petitioner's suggestion that an employee's receipt of benefits under the LHWCA precludes subsequent litigation under the Jones Act is also rejected, see Tipton v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 375 U. S. 34, 37, since the question of coverage has never been litigated in such cases, and since the LHWCA clearly does not comprehend such a preclusive effect, see  903(e). Pp. 89-92.

WOODDELL v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 71, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-967. Argued October 16, 1991-Decided December 4,1991
Petitioner Wooddell, a member of Local 71 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), sued respondents, the local and its officers, alleging, inter alia, that, because of his opposition to proposed union actions, they had violated his rights under Title I of the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) by discriminating against him in job referrals in the operation of a hiring hall provided for in the local's collective-bargaining contracts with electrical contractors. He also contended that such conduct constituted violations of the IBEW Constitution and the local's bylaws, which were allegedly breaches of contract redressable under  301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA). Among other things, Wooddell sought injunctive relief, lost wages and benefits, and damages. The District Court dismissed all claims against all defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the LMRDA claim but otherwise affirmed the District Court, including its holding that Wooddell had no right to have the LMRDA claim tried to a jury. The Court of Appeals further held that  30l-which provides that ""[sJuits for violation of contracts between ... labor organizations ... may be brought in ... district court"" -did not authorize a breach-of-contract action to be brought by an individual union member for an alleged violation of a union constitution.
Held:
1. Wooddell was entitled to a jury trial on the LMRDA cause of action. Although he seeks injunctive relief as well as damages, the injunctive relief is assertedly incidental to the damages. His claim for lost wages cannot be treated as restitutionary incident to an order reinstating him to a job from which he has been terminated, as the damages sought are for pay for jobs to which the union failed to refer him. Also, an LMRDA action is closely analogous to a personal injury action, a prototypical example of an action at law to which the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial applies. Thus, Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 565, 570, 571-in which the Court found a right to a jury trial on a claim for an employer's breach of a collective-bargaining agreement

94
Syllabus
under  301 and a union's breach of the duty of fair representation-controls this case. Pp. 97-98.
2. The subject-matter jurisdiction conferred on the district courts by  301(a) extends to suits on union constitutions brought by individual union members. Wooddell charged a violation of a contract between unions within the meaning of  301, since union constitutions are an important form of contract between labor organizations, Plumbers and Pipe fitters v. Plumbers and Pipe fitters, Local 334, 452 U. S. 615, 624, and since Wooddell alleged that the IBEW Constitution requires locals to live up to collective-bargaining agreements, that that constitution and the local's bylaws are contracts which are binding on the local, and that the defendants had breached such contracts by discriminating against him in referrals. Moreover,  301 is not limited to suits brought by a party to an interunion contract, but extends to individual union members when they are the beneficiaries of such contracts. Cf. Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S. 195, 200-201. If such members could not sue under  301, but were required to resort to state court and state law, the possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon the negotiation and administration of interunion contracts. Cf. ibid. There is no merit to respondents' contention that construing  301 in this fashion signals an unwarranted intrusion on state contract law, since there is no indication in the later enacted LMRDA that Congress meant to narrow  301's reach. Also unconvincing is respondents' submission that this construction of  301 will inundate the federal courts with trivial suits dealing with intraunion affairs, since there is no evidence of such a result in the various Federal Circuits that have adopted the interpretation. Pp. 98-103.
907 F.2d 151, reversed and remanded.

under  301 and a union's breach of the duty of fair representation-controls this case. Pp. 97-98.
2. The subject-matter jurisdiction conferred on the district courts by  301(a) extends to suits on union constitutions brought by individual union members. Wooddell charged a violation of a contract between unions within the meaning of  301, since union constitutions are an important form of contract between labor organizations, Plumbers and Pipe fitters v. Plumbers and Pipe fitters, Local 334, 452 U. S. 615, 624, and since Wooddell alleged that the IBEW Constitution requires locals to live up to collective-bargaining agreements, that that constitution and the local's bylaws are contracts which are binding on the local, and that the defendants had breached such contracts by discriminating against him in referrals. Moreover,  301 is not limited to suits brought by a party to an interunion contract, but extends to individual union members when they are the beneficiaries of such contracts. Cf. Smith v. Evening News Assn., 371 U. S. 195, 200-201. If such members could not sue under  301, but were required to resort to state court and state law, the possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon the negotiation and administration of interunion contracts. Cf. ibid. There is no merit to respondents' contention that construing  301 in this fashion signals an unwarranted intrusion on state contract law, since there is no indication in the later enacted LMRDA that Congress meant to narrow  301's reach. Also unconvincing is respondents' submission that this construction of  301 will inundate the federal courts with trivial suits dealing with intraunion affairs, since there is no evidence of such a result in the various Federal Circuits that have adopted the interpretation. Pp. 98-103.

BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM v. MCORP FINANCIAL, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-913. Argued October 7, 1991-Decided December 3,1991*
Mter MCorp, a bank holding company, filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions, it initiated an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) seeking to enjoin the prosecution of two pending administrative proceedings, one charging MCorp with a violation of the Board's ""source of strength"" regulation and the other alleging a violation of  23A of the Federal Reserve Act. The District Court transferred the adversary proceeding to its own docket, ruled that it had jurisdiction to enjoin the Board from prosecuting both administrative proceedings, and entered a preliminary injunction halting those proceedings. The Court of Appeals vacated the injunction barring the  23A proceeding, reasoning that the plain language of the judicial review provisions of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966 (FISA), particularly 12 U. S. C.  1818(i)(I), deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enjoin either administrative proceeding. However, the Court of Appeals also interpreted Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U. S. 184, to authorize an injunction against any administrative proceeding conducted without statutory authorization, ruled that the Board's promulgation and enforcement of its source of strength regulation exceeded its statutory authority, and remanded the case with instructions to the District Court to enjoin the Board from enforcing the regulation.
Held: The District Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin either regulatory proceeding. Pp. 37-45.
(a) This litigation is controlled by  1818(i)(I)'s plain, preclusive language: ""[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction ... the issuance or enforcement of any [Board] notice or order."" That language is not qualified or superseded by the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay

provision, 11 U. S. C.  362. The Board's planned actions against MCorp fall squarely within 362(b)(4), which expressly provides that the automatic stay will not reach proceedings to enforce a ""governmental unit's police or regulatory power."" MCorp is not protected by 362(a)(3) and 362(a)(6)-which stay ""any act"" to obtain possession of, or to exercise control over, property of the estate, or to recover claims against the debtor that arose prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition-because such provisions do not have any application to ongoing, nonfinal administrative proceedings such as those at issue here. Moreover, MCorp's reliance on 28 U. S. C.  1334(b)-which authorizes district courts to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over certain bankruptcy-related civil proceedings that would otherwise be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another ""court"" -is misplaced, since the Board is not another ""court,"" and since the prosecution of the Board's proceedings, prior to the entry of a final order and the commencement of any enforcement action, seems unlikely to impair the Bankruptcy Court's exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the estate protected by  1334(d). pp.37-42.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in interpreting Kyne to authorize judicial review of the source of strength regulation. In contrast to the situation in Kyne, FISA, in  1818(h)(2), expressly provides MCorp with a meaningful and adequate opportunity for review of the regulation's validity and application if and when the Board finds that MCorp has violated the regulation and, in  1818(i)(I), clearly and directly demonstrates a congressional intent to preclude review. In such circumstances, the District Court is without jurisdiction to review and enjoin the Board's ongoing administrative proceedings. Pp. 42-45.

GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-6352. Argued October 7, 1991-Decided December 3,1991
Petitioner Griffin and others were charged in a multiple-object conspiracy.
The evidence introduced at trial implicated Griffin in the first object of the conspiracy but not the second. The District Court nevertheless instructed the jury in a manner that would permit it to return a verdict against Griffin if it found her to have participated in either one of the two objects. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty. The Court of Appeals upheld Griffin's conviction, rejecting the argument that the verdict could not stand because it left in doubt whether the jury had convicted her as to the first or the second object.
Held: Neither the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment nor this Court's precedents require, in a federal prosecution, that a general guilty verdict on a multiple-object conspiracy be set aside if the evidence is inadequate to support conviction as to one of the objects. Pp. 49-60.
(a) The historical practice fails to support Griffin's due process claim, since the rule of criminal procedure applied by the Court of Appeals was a settled feature of the common law. Pp. 49-51.
(b) The precedent governing this case is not Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, which invalidated a general verdict when one of the possible bases of conviction was legally inadequate, but Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398, 420, which upheld a general verdict when one of the possible bases of conviction was supported by inadequate evidence. The line between Yates and Turner makes good sense: Jurors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction is contrary to law, but are well equipped to determine whether the theory is supported by the facts. Although it would generally be preferable to give an instruction removing from the jury's consideration an alternative basis of liability that does not have adequate evidentiary support, the refusal to do so does not provide an independent basis for reversing an otherwise valid conviction. pp. 51-60.
913 F.2d 337, affirmed.

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether, in a federal prosecution, a general guilty verdict on a multiple-object conspiracy charge must be set aside if the evidence is inadequate to support conviction as to one of the objects.

I
A federal grand jury returned a 23-count indictment against petitioner Diane Griffin and others. Count 20, the only count in which Griffin was named, charged her, Alex Beverly, and Betty McNulty with conspiring to defraud an agency of the Federal Government in violation of 18 U. S. C.  371, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:

""If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be [guilty of a crime].""
The unlawful conspiracy was alleged to have had two objects: (1) impairing the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ascertain income taxes; and (2) impairing the efforts of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to ascertain forfeitable assets.
The evidence introduced at trial implicated Beverly and McNulty in both conspiratorial objects, and petitioner in the

HAFER v. MELO ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No.90-681. Argued October 15, 1991-Decided November 5,1991
Mter petitioner Hafer, the newly elected auditor general of Pennsylvania, discharged respondents from their jobs in her office, they sued her for, inter alia, monetary damages under 42 U. S. C.  1983. The District Court dismissed the latter claims under Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71, in which the Court held that state officials ""acting in their official capacities"" are outside the class of ""persons"" subject to liability under  1983. In reversing this ruling, the Court of Appeals found that respondents sought damages from Hafer in her personal capacity and held that, because she acted under color of state law, respondents could maintain a  1983 individual-capacity suit against her.
Held: State officers may be held personally liable for damages under  1983 based upon actions taken in their official capacities. pp. 25-31.
(a) The above-quoted language from Will does not establish that Hafer may not be held personally liable under  1983 because she ""act[ed]"" in her official capacity. The claims considered in Will were official-capacity claims, and the phrase ""acting in their official capacities"" is best understood as a reference to the capacity in which the state officer is sued, not the capacity in which the officer inflicts the alleged injury. Pp. 25-27.
(b) State officials, sued in their individual capacities, are ""persons"" within the meaning of  1983. Unlike official-capacity defendants-who are not ""persons"" because they assume the identity of the government that employs them, Will, supra, at 71-officers sued in their personal capacity come to the court as individuals and thus fit comfortably within the statutory term ""person,"" cf. 491 U. S., at 71, n. 10. Moreover,  1983's authorization of suits to redress deprivations of civil rights by persons acting ""under color of"" state law means that Hafer may be liable for discharging respondents precisely because of her authority as auditor general. Her assertion that acts that are both within the official's authority and necessary to the performance of governmental functions (including the employment decisions at issue) should be considered acts of the State that cannot give rise to a personal-capacity action is unpersuasive. That contention ignores this Court's holding that  1983 was enacted to enforce provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge of a State and represent it in some capacity,

22
whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 243. Furthermore, Hafer's theory would absolutely immunize state officials from personal liability under  1983 solely by virtue of the ""official"" nature of their acts, in contravention of this Court's immunity decisions. See, e. g., Scheuer, supra. pp.27-29.
(c) The Eleventh Amendment does not bar  1983 personal-capacity suits against state officials in federal court. Id., at 237, 238. Will's language concerning suits against state officials cannot be read as establishing the limits of liability under the Amendment, since Will arose from a suit in state court and considered the Amendment only because the fact that Congress did not intend to override state immunity when it enacted  1983 was relevant to statutory construction. 491 U. S., at 66. Although imposing personal liability on state officers may hamper their performance of public duties, such concerns are properly addressed within the framework of this Court's personal immunity jurisprudence. pp.29-31.

CAMPOS ET AL. v. CITY OF HOUSTON ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION AND STAY No. A-30l. Decided October 29, 1991
The application seeking an injunction and stay stopping imminent elections for the Houston City Council is denied because there is no legal basis for such an original order. Assuming that the applicants would desire the lesser relief of a mere stay of the District Court's order implementing a redistricting plan for the elections, that too must be denied. There is no evidence that the city was acting in bad faith in seeking that order, and both the applicants and the United States share some responsibility for this matter's having been presented and decided in inordinate haste. Relying on the judgment of those federal judges on the scene, who have declined the stay, it also cannot be said with certainty that more good than harm to the public interest will be achieved by staying the District Court's order.
JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.
The application before me seeks ""an injunction and stay from the Court stopping the entire City election process"" with respect to elections for the Houston City Council scheduled for November 5. Application 11. As the amicus United States points out, there is no basis in law for such an original order, and the application must be denied.
Assuming that the applicants would desire the lesser relief of a mere stay of the District Court's order, I would nonetheless deny it. The issuance by a circuit justice of a stay pending appeal calls for consideration of not only the probability that the district court was wrong, but also the nature of (including responsibility for) the alleged injury that will occur absent a stay, and the effect that a stay would have upon the public interest. See Republican State Central Comm. of

Opinion in Chambers
Arizona v. Ripon Society Inc., 409 U. S. 1222, 1224 (1972) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). Like the Court of Appeals, I am doubtful of the District Court's authority to issue the present order. However, while the city may have been guilty of overimaginative lawyering in obtaining it, I have no reason to believe the city was acting in bad faith in the sense of seeking to frustrate the purposes of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Moreover, in my view both the applicants and the United States share some responsibility, by their delay, for this matter's having been presented and decided in inordinate haste. Finally, and most important, I am not certain that more good than harm to the public interest will be achieved by staying the District Court's order, making the imminent elections (in which some people have already cast absentee ballots) impossible. On this last point, which seems to me in the present case the determinative one, I am inclined to rely upon the judgment of those federal judges on the scene, who have declined the stay.
For the foregoing reasons, the application is denied.

No. 90-1713
Decided October 16, 1991
502 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
While stopped for a vehicle operating violation, respondent gave police permission to search his car, but they found nothing.  However, they impounded the car because respondent had no operator's license, and they found cocaine during a subsequent search.  Respondent filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence from the second search, which the Government contested on the ground that the search was conducted pursuant to his continuing consent.  However, the Government abandoned this argument, and the District Court granted respondent's motion.  The Government subsequently moved for reconsideration of the suppression order, again raising the consent issue, but the court denied the motion.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the Government's appeal as untimely, holding that the Government's motion to reconsider did not ""toll"" the 30-day period to appeal, which began to run on the date of the initial order.  The court also held that this Court's decisions in United States v. Healy, 376 U. S. 76 -- that a motion for rehearing renders an otherwise final decision of a district court not final until it decides the motion -- and United States v. Dieter, 429 U. S. 6 (per curiam) -- that there is no exception to Healy's rule for petitions for rehearing which do not assert an alleged error of law -- did not control in a case where the Government's motion is based on a previously disavowed theory.
Held:  The Government's appeal was timely.  All motions for reconsideration are subsumed under one general rule -- the rule laid down in Healy.  If a merits inquiry were grafted onto the general rule, litigants would 
Page 502 U. S. 2
 be required to guess at their peril the date on which the time to appeal commences to run.  An alternative method of analysis -- that the Government's motion was not a ""true"" motion for reconsideration, because the Government did not initially urge the argument on which it based the motion -- would also break down into subcategories the more general category of ""motions for reconsideration"" described in this Court's previous decisions.
Certiorari granted; 920 F. 2d 702, vacated and remanded.

No. A-94
Decided Aug. 2, 1991
501 U.S. 1301

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
JUSTICE SCALIA, Circuit Justice.
Texas state officials responsible for the collection of taxes and the regulation of insurance seek a stay of the judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in these two sets of consolidated cases pending action by this Court on their intended petition for certiorari.   The judgments at issue upheld decisions by the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas which declared the Texas Administrative Services Tax Act, Tex.Ins.Code Ann. art. 4.11A 
Page 501 U. S. 1302
 (Supp.1991), to be preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U.S.C.  1001 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. I), enjoined its enforcement, and directed the State to issue refunds to the challenging taxpayers.  E-Systems, Inc. v. Pogue, 929 F.2d 1100 (CA5 1991).
The authority for a single Justice to issue a stay of the sort requested here is conferred by 28 U.S.C.  2101(f).  Before the predecessor to that provision was enacted in 1925, see Act of Feb. 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 940, similar action could be taken by the Court by issuing a supersedeas under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651.  See Magnum Import Co. v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159 (1923);  Ex parte The Milwaukee Railroad Co., 5 Wall. 188,  72 U. S. 190 (1867);  Hardeman v. Anderson, 4 How. 640,  45 U. S. 642-643 (1846).  Under  2101(f), as under the All Writs Act and the prior common law, a stay issues not of right, but pursuant to sound equitable discretion; ""it requires,"" as Chief Justice Taft said, ""a clear case and a decided balance of convenience.""  Magnum Import Co., supra, at  262 U. S. 164.
The practice of the Justices has settled upon three conditions that must be met before issuance of a  2101(f) stay is appropriate.   There must be a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted (or probable jurisdiction noted), a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed, and a likelihood of irreparable harm (assuming the correctness of the applicant's position) if the judgment is not stayed.  Times-Picayune Publishing Corp. v. Schulingkamp, 419 U. S. 1301,  419 U. S. 1305 (Powell, J., in chambers).   In my view, all three of these conditions are met here.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 June 28, 1991 
 On petition for writ of 
certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 In Clemons v. Mississippi, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990), this Court held that, once a defendant is sentenced to death by an erroneously instructed jury, a reviewing court can resentence the defendant to death only if it clearly and expressly engages in either harmless-error analysis or reweighing of permissible aggravating and mitigating circumstances. See id., at ___, ___, 110 S.Ct., at 1444, 1451. It is conceded that the petitioner in this case was sentenced to death by an erroneously instructed jury. Nonetheless, the Missouri Supreme Court concluded that the trial court's summary denial of petitioner's motion to set aside the jury sentence constituted a constitutionally adequate resentencing. Because Clemons does not permit us to infer from the trial court's silence that it engaged in the requisite reweighing or harmless-error analysis, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 I  
 Petitioner was convicted of capital murder. At the conclusion of the penalty phase of his trial, the jury determined that the murder "" 'involved depravity of mind and that as a result thereof it was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.' "" 803 S.W.2d 1, 14 ( Mo. en banc 1991). On the basis of this single aggravating factor, the jury sentenced petitioner to death. Id., at 6. Petitioner thereafter filed a motion to reduce his sentence, arguing, inter alia, that the "" depravity of mind"" aggravating factor was unconstitutionally vague under this Court's precedents. The trial court denied the motion, stating from the bench that it "" 'has listened attentively to [petitioner's argument] and has recalled the testimony and the evidence in this cause, and the Court will overrule the Motion for Reduction of Sentence.' "" Id., at 16. 
 The Missouri Supreme court affirmed. The court acknowledged that the ""depravity of mind"" aggravating factor was uncon- 
Page 501 U.S. 1262, 1263
 stitutionally vague under this Court's decision in godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980). See 803 S.W.2d, at 14. See generally Shell v. Mississippis, ___ U.S. ___, 11 S.Ct. 313d 1 (1990), (per curiam ); clemons v. Mississippi, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S. Ct. at 1441, 108 L.Ed.2d 725 (1990); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 108 S.Ct. 1853, 100 L.Ed.2d 372 (1988). It also acknowledged that the trial court had erred in not instructing the jury to apply the limiting construction fashioned by the the Missouri supreme Court in order to save the ""depravity of mind"" factor from unconstitutionality. See 803 S.W.2d, at 14, citing State v. Preston, 673 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Mo. en banc), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 893, 105 s.Ct. 269, 83 L.Ed.2d 205 (1984).* Nonetheless, relying on Walton v. Arizona, ___ U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 3047, 111 L.Ed.2d 511 (1990), the Missouri Supreme Court concluded that the trial court's summary denial of petitioner's postsentence motin sufficed to cure any error in the jury's sentencing verdict. In Walton, this Court hled that, where the death sentence is imposed by a trial judge, the trial judge need not expressly state that he has relied upon a constitutionally necessary limiting construciton, because ""[t]rial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in making their deicison.""Id., at ___, 110 S.Ct. at 3057. The Missouri Supreme Court in this case reasoned that it could likewise ""presum[e] that the trial judge knew and applied the relevant factors ennunciated in State v. Preston when he evaluated and rules on [ petitioner's] motion for reduction of sentence."" 803 S.W.2d, at 16. 
 In my view, the Missouri Supreme Court's reliance on Walton was clearly misplaced. As used in Walton, the ""presumption"" that a trial court has followed the law stands only for the proposition that error cannot be inferred where a trial court, acting as the initial sentencer, fails expressly to articulate its reliance on a limiting construction of what would otherwise be an unconstitutional aggravating factor. However, this presumption is clearly rebutted when, as here, the trial court erroneously instructs a sentencing jury by omitting any reference to the necessary limiting construction. Under such circumstances, the question is no longer [501 U.S. 1262, 1264]

The Missouri Supreme Court in this case reasoned that it could likewise ""presum[e] that the trial judge knew and applied the relevant factors ennunciated in State v. Preston when he evaluated and rules on [ petitioner's] motion for reduction of sentence."" 803 S.W.2d, at 16. 
 In my view, the Missouri Supreme Court's reliance on Walton was clearly misplaced. As used in Walton, the ""presumption"" that a trial court has followed the law stands only for the proposition that error cannot be inferred where a trial court, acting as the initial sentencer, fails expressly to articulate its reliance on a limiting construction of what would otherwise be an unconstitutional aggravating factor. However, this presumption is clearly rebutted when, as here, the trial court erroneously instructs a sentencing jury by omitting any reference to the necessary limiting construction. Under such circumstances, the question is no longer [501 U.S. 1262, 1264]

No. 90-5721
Argued April 24, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 808

Syllabus 
Petitioner Payne was convicted by a Tennessee jury of the first-degree murders of Charisse Christopher and her 2-year-old daughter, and of first-degree assault upon, with intent to murder, Charisse's 3-year-old son Nicholas.  The brutal crimes were committed in the victims' apartment after Charisse resisted Payne's sexual advances.  During the sentencing phase of the trial, Payne called his parents, his girlfriend, and a clinical psychologist, each of whom testified as to various mitigating aspects of his background and character.  The State called Nicholas' grandmother, who testified that the child missed his mother and baby sister.  In arguing for the death penalty, the prosecutor commented on the continuing effects on Nicholas of his experience and on the effects of the crimes upon the victims' family.  The jury sentenced Payne to death on each of the murder counts.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting his contention that the admission of the grandmother's testimony and the State's closing argument violated his Eighth Amendment rights under Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496, and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805, which held that evidence and argument relating to the victim and the impact of the victim's death on the victim's family are per se inadmissible at a capital sentencing hearing.
Held:  The Eighth Amendment erects no per se bar prohibiting a capital sentencing jury from considering ""victim impact"" evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the murder on the victim's family, or precluding a prosecutor from arguing such evidence at a capital sentencing hearing.  To the extent that this Court held to the contrary in Booth and Gathers, those.cases are overruled.  Pp.  501 U. S. 817-830.
(a) There are numerous infirmities in the rule created by Booth and Gathers.  Those cases were based on two premises:  that evidence relating to a particular victim or to the harm caused a victim's family does not, in general, reflect on the defendant's ""blameworthiness,"" and that only evidence of ""blameworthiness"" is relevant to the capital sentencing decision.  See Booth, supra at  482 U. S. 504-505.  However, assessment of the harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate punishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing authority about such harm.  In excluding such evidence, the Court in Booth, supra at  482 U. S. 504, misread 
Page 501 U. S. 809
 the statement in Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280,  428 U. S. 304, that the capital defendant must be treated as a ""uniquely individual human bein[g].""  As Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,  428 U. S. 203-204, demonstrates, the Woodson language was not intended to describe a class of evidence that could not be received, but a class of evidence that must be received, i.e., any relevant, nonprejudicial material, see Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880,  463 U. S. 898.  The Booth Court's misreading of precedent has unfairly weighted the scales in a capital trial.  Virtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances. See, e.g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,  455 U. S. 114.  The State has a legitimate interest in counteracting such evidence, but the Booth rule prevents it from doing so.  Similarly, fairness to the prosecution requires rejection of Gathers' extension of the Booth rule to the prosecutor's argument, since, under the Eighth Amendment, this Court has given the capital defendant's attorney broad latitude to argue relevant mitigating evidence reflecting on his client's individual personality.  The Court in Booth, supra at  482 U. S. 506-507, also erred in reasoning that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a capital defendant to rebut victim impact evidence without shifting the focus of the sentencing hearing away from the defendant to the victim.  The mere fact that, for tactical reasons, it might not be prudent for the defense to rebut such evidence makes the case no different from others in which a party is faced with this sort of dilemma.  Nor is there merit to the concern voiced in Booth, supra at  482 U. S. 506, that admission of such evidence permits a jury to find that defendants whose victims were assets to their communities are more deserving of punishment than those whose victims are perceived to be less worthy. Such evidence is not generally offered to encourage comparative judgments of this kind, but is designed to show instead each victim's uniqueness as an individual human being.  In the event that victim impact evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides a mechanism for relief.  See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168,  477 U. S. 179-183.  Thus, a State may properly conclude that, for the jury to assess meaningfully the defendant's moral culpability and blameworthiness, it should have before it at the sentencing phase victim impact evidence.  Pp.  501 U. S. 817-827.
(b) Although adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis is usually the best policy, the doctrine is not an inexorable command.  This Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent when governing decisions are unworkable or badly reasoned, Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649,  321 U. S. 655, particularly in constitutional cases, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,  285 U.

Syllabus 
The Chief Judge of the United States Tax Court, an Article I court composed of 19 judges appointed by the President, is authorized to appoint special trial judges, 26 U.S.C.  7443A(a), and to assign to them certain specified proceedings,  7443A(b)(1), (2), and (3), and ""any other proceeding which the chief judge may designate,""  7443A(b)(4).  As to subsection (b)(4) proceedings, the special trial judge may hear the case and prepare proposed findings and an opinion, but the actual decision is rendered by a Tax Court judge,  7443A(c).  When petitioners sought review in the Tax Court of determinations of approximately $1.5 billion in federal income tax deficiencies, their cases were assigned to a Tax Court judge, but were later reassigned, with petitioners' consent, to a Special Trial Judge.  His unfavorable opinion was adopted by the Chief Judge as the opinion of the Tax Court.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' arguments that the assignment of complex cases to a special trial judge was not authorized by  7443A and that such assignment violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, which, inter alia, limits congressional discretion to vest the appointment of ""inferior Officers"" to the President, the heads of departments, and the courts of law.
Held:
1. Subsection (b)(4) authorizes the Chief Judge to assign any Tax Court proceeding, regardless of complexity or amount in controversy, to a special trial judge for hearing and preparation of proposed findings and a written opinion.  Its plain language contains no limiting term restricting its reach to cases that are minor, simple, or narrow; and neither the statute's structure nor legislative history contradicts the broad sweep of this language.  Pp.  501 U. S. 873-877.
2. Section 7443A does not transgress the structure of separation of powers embodied in the Appointments Clause.  Pp.  501 U. S. 877-892.
(a) This is one of those rare cases in which the Court should exercise its discretion to hear petitioners' challenge.  That challenge goes to the validity of the Tax Court proceeding that is the basis for this litigation and, thus, is a nonjurisdictional structural constitutional objection that 
Page 501 U. S. 869
 may be considered, even though petitioners consented to the assignment.  See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530,  370 U. S. 535-536.  Pp.  501 U. S. 878-880.
(b) A special trial judge is an ""inferior Office[r]"" whose appointment must conform to the Appointments Clause.  Such a judge acts as an inferior officer who exercises independent authority in cases governed by subsections (b)(1), (2), and (3).  The fact that in subsection (b)(4) cases he performs duties that may be performed by an employee not subject to the Appointments Clause does not transform his status.  Pp.  501 U. S. 880-882.
(c) The Clause reflects the Framers' conclusion that widely distributed appointment power subverts democratic government.  Thus, such power can be vested in the Tax Court's Chief Judge only if that court falls within one of the three repositories the Clause specifies.  Clearly Congress did not intend to grant the President the power to appoint special trial judges.  And the term ""Departmen[t]"" refers only to executive divisions like Cabinet-level departments.  United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508,  99 U. S. 510-511.  Treating the Tax Court as a ""Department"" would defy the purpose of the Clause, the meaning of the Constitution's text, and the clear intent of Congress to transform that court from an executive agency into an Article I court.  Pp.  501 U. S. 882-888.
(d) An Article I court, which exercises judicial power, can be a ""Cour[t] of Law"" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause.  The reference to ""Courts of Law"" cannot be limited to Article III courts merely because they are the only courts the Constitution mentions.  Congress has wide discretion to assign the task of adjudication to legislative tribunals, see, e.g.,  26 U. S.  v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511,  26 U. S. 546; and an Article I court cannot exercise judicial power and not be one of the ""Courts of Law.""  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, distinguished.  To hold otherwise would also undermine Congress' understanding that Article I courts can be given the power to appoint.  See, e.g.,  38 U. S.  13 Pet. 230.  Pp.  501 U. S. 888-890.
(e) The Tax Court is a ""Cour[t] of Law"" within the Clause's meaning.  It exercises judicial power to the exclusion of any other function; its function and role closely resemble those of the federal district courts; and it is independent of the Executive and Legislative Branches, in that its decisions are appealable in the same manner as those of the district courts.

No. 90-615
Argued April 23, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 923

Syllabus 
In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, this Court held that the selection of a jury in a felony trial without a defendant's consent is not one of the ""additional duties"" that magistrates may be assigned under the Federal Magistrates Act.  That decision rested on the lack of both an express statutory provision for de novo review and an explicit congressional intent to permit magistrates to conduct voir dire absent the parties' consent.  And it was compelled by concerns that a defendant might have a constitutional right to demand that an Article III judge preside at every critical stage of a felony trial and that the procedure deprived an individual of an important privilege, if not a right.  In this case, petitioner Peretz consented to the assignment of a Magistrate to conduct the voir dire and supervise the jury selection for his felony trial, never asked the District Court to review the Magistrate's rulings, and raised no objection regarding jury selection at trial.  However, on appeal from his conviction, he contended that it was error to assign the jury selection to the Magistrate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction on the ground that Gomez requires reversal only in cases in which the magistrate has acted without the defendant's consent.
Held:
1. The Act's ""additional duties"" clause permits a magistrate to supervise jury selection in a felony trial provided that the parties consent.  The fact that there is only ambiguous evidence of Congress' intent to include jury selection among magistrates' additional duties is far less important here than it was in Gomez, for Peretz' consent eliminates the concerns about a constitutional issue and the deprivation of an important right.  Absent these concerns, the Act's structure and purpose evince a congressional belief that magistrates are well qualified to handle matters of similar importance to jury selection.

			"|"Peretz v. United States
No. 90-615
Argued April 23, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 923

Syllabus 
In Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, this Court held that the selection of a jury in a felony trial without a defendant's consent is not one of the ""additional duties"" that magistrates may be assigned under the Federal Magistrates Act.  That decision rested on the lack of both an express statutory provision for de novo review and an explicit congressional intent to permit magistrates to conduct voir dire absent the parties' consent.  And it was compelled by concerns that a defendant might have a constitutional right to demand that an Article III judge preside at every critical stage of a felony trial and that the procedure deprived an individual of an important privilege, if not a right.  In this case, petitioner Peretz consented to the assignment of a Magistrate to conduct the voir dire and supervise the jury selection for his felony trial, never asked the District Court to review the Magistrate's rulings, and raised no objection regarding jury selection at trial.  However, on appeal from his conviction, he contended that it was error to assign the jury selection to the Magistrate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction on the ground that Gomez requires reversal only in cases in which the magistrate has acted without the defendant's consent.
Held:
1. The Act's ""additional duties"" clause permits a magistrate to supervise jury selection in a felony trial provided that the parties consent.  The fact that there is only ambiguous evidence of Congress' intent to include jury selection among magistrates' additional duties is far less important here than it was in Gomez, for Peretz' consent eliminates the concerns about a constitutional issue and the deprivation of an important right.  Absent these concerns, the Act's structure and purpose evince a congressional belief that magistrates are well qualified to handle matters of similar importance to jury selection.  This reading of the additional duties clause strikes the balance Congress intended between a criminal defendant's interests and the policies undergirding the Act.  It allows courts, with the litigants' consent, to continue innovative experiments in the use of magistrates to improve the efficient administration of the courts' dockets, thus relieving the courts of certain subordinate duties that often distract them from more important matters.  At the same time, the consent requirement protects a criminal defendant's interest in

|501 u.s. 957|"Harmelin v. Michigan
No. 89-7272
Argued November 5, 1990
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 957

Syllabus 
Petitioner Harmelin was convicted under Michigan law of possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine and sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without possibility of parole.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting his argument that the sentence was ""cruel and unusual"" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.  He claims here that the sentence is cruel and unusual because it is ""significantly disproportionate"" to the crime he committed, and because the sentencing judge was statutorily required to impose it, without taking into account the particularized circumstances of the crime and of the criminal.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
176 Mich.  App. 524, 440 N.W.2d 75, affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part IV, concluding that Harmelin's claim that his sentence is unconstitutional because it is mandatory in nature, allowing the sentencer no opportunity to consider ""mitigating factors,"" has no support in the Eighth Amendment's text and history.  Severe, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout the Nation's history.  Although Harmelin's claim finds some support in the so-called ""individualized capital sentencing doctrine"" of this Court's death penalty jurisprudence, see, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, that doctrine may not be extended outside the capital context, because of the qualitative differences between death and all other penalties, see, e.g., id. at  428 U. S. 303-305.  Pp.  501 U. S. 994-996.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concluded in Parts I, II, and III that, because the Eighth Amendment contains no proportionality guarantee, Harmelin's sentence cannot be considered unconstitutionally disproportional.  Pp.  501 U. S. 962-994.
(a) For crimes concededly classified and classifiable as felonies -- i.e., as punishable by significant terms of imprisonment in a state penitentiary -- the length of the sentence actually imposed is purely a matter of legislative prerogative.  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263,  445 U. S. 274.  Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, which decreed a ""general principle of proportionality,"" id. at  463 U. S. 288, and used as the criterion for its application a three-factor test that had been explicitly rejected in Rummel, supra, at 
Page 501 U. S. 958
 445 U. S. 281-282, and n. 27, and Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370,  454 U. S. 373-374, was wrong, and should be overruled.  Pp.  501 U. S. 962-965.
(b) Although Solem, supra at  463 U. S. 285, correctly discerned that the Eighth Amendment prohibition was derived from the ""cruell and unusuall Punishments"" provision of the English Declaration of Rights of 1689, Solem's conclusion that the latter provision embodied a right to be free from disproportionate punishments is refuted by the circumstances of the declaration's enactment and the contemporaneous understanding of the English guarantee.  The guarantee was directed at the arbitrary use of the sentencing power by the King's Bench in particular cases, and at the illegality, rather than the disproportionality, of punishments thereby imposed.  Pp.  501 U. S. 966-975.
(c) That the Americans who adopted the Eighth Amendment intended its Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause as a check on the ability of the Legislature to authorize particular modes of punishment -- i.e., cruel methods of punishment that are not regularly or customarily employed -- rather than as a guarantee against disproportionate sentences is demonstrated by the available evidence of contemporary understanding, including the context of adoption, the debates of the state ratifying conventions and the First Congress, and early commentary and judicial decisions.  It is particularly telling that those who framed and approved the Federal Constitution chose not to include within it the explicit guarantee against disproportionate sentences that some State Constitutions contained.  Pp.  501 U. S. 975-985.
(d) There are no adequate textual or historical standards to enable judges to determine whether a particular penalty is disproportional.  The first two of the factors that Solem found relevant -- the inherent gravity of the defendant's offense and the sentences imposed for similarly grave offenses in some jurisdictions -- fail for lack of an objective standard of gravity.  Since, as the statutes Americans have enacted in different times and places demonstrate, there is enormous variation of opinion as to what offenses are serious, the proportionality principle is an invitation for judges to impose their own subjective values.  Moreover, although the third Solem factor -- the character of the sentences imposed by other States for the same crime -- can be applied with clarity and ease, it is irrelevant to the Eighth Amendment.  Traditional notions of federalism entitle States to treat like situations differently in light of local needs, concerns, and social conditions.  Pp.  501 U. S. 985-990.
(e) Although this Court's 20th-century jurisprudence has not remained entirely in accord with the proposition that there is no Eighth Amendment proportionality requirement, it has not departed to the extent that Solem suggests.  While Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349 -- which was cited by Solem, supra at  463 U. S. 287, as the ""leading case"" -- did contain language suggesting that mere disproportionality might make a 
Page 501 U. S. 959
 punishment cruel and unusual, 217 U.S. at  217 U. S. 366-367, it also contained statements indicating that the unique punishment there at issue was unconstitutional because it was unknown to Anglo-American tradition, id. at  217 U. S. 377.  It is hard to view Weems as announcing a constitutional proportionality requirement, given that it did not produce a decision implementing such a requirement, either in this Court or the lower federal courts, for six decades.  This Court's first such opinion, Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,  433 U. S. 592, was a death penalty case.  The Coker line of authority should not be treated as a generalized aspect of Eighth Amendment law, since proportionality review is one of several respects in which ""death is different,"" requiring protections that the Constitution nowhere else provides.  Pp.  501 U. S. 990-994.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE SOUTER, concluded:
1. This Court's decisions recognize that the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause encompasses a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences.  See, e.g., Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349,  217 U. S. 371; Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263,  445 U. S. 271-274, and n. 11; Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370,  454 U. S. 374, and n. 3; Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277.  Although these decisions have not been totally clear or consistent, close analysis yields some common principles that give content to the uses and limits of proportionality review.  First, the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves a substantial penological judgment that, as a general matter, is properly within the province of the legislature, and reviewing courts should grant substantial deference to legislative determinations.  Second, there are a variety of legitimate penological schemes based on theories of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, and the Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one such scheme.  Third, marked divergences both in sentencing theories and the length of prescribed prison terms are the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal structure, and differing attitudes and perceptions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational, conclusions regarding the appropriate length of terms for particular crimes.  Fourth, proportionality review by federal courts should be informed by objective factors to the maximum extent possible, and the relative lack of objective standards concerning length, as opposed to type, of sentence has resulted in few successful proportionality challenges outside the capital punishment context.  Finally, the Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence, but rather forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime.  Pp.  501 U. S. 996-1001.
2. Tn light of the foregoing principles, Harmelin's sentence does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Although a sentence 
Page 501 U. S. 960
 of life imprisonment without parole is the second most severe penalty permitted by law, it is not grossly disproportionate to Harmelin's crime of possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine.  His suggestion that the crime was nonviolent and victimless is false to the point of absurdity.  Studies demonstrate the grave threat that illegal drugs, and particularly cocaine, pose to society in terms of violence, crime, and social displacement.  The amount of cocaine Harmelin possessed has a potential yield of between 32,500 and 65,000 doses, and the Michigan Legislature could with reason conclude that possession of this large an amount is momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and retribution of a life sentence without parole.  Given the severity of Harmelin's crime, there is no need to conduct a comparative analysis between his sentence and sentences imposed for other crimes in Michigan and for the same crime in other jurisdictions.  This Court's decisions indicate that such an analysis is appropriate in the rare case in which a threshold comparison of the crime committed and the sentence imposed leads to an inference of gross disproportionality, see Solem, supra at  463 U. S. 293-300; Weems, supra at  217 U. S. 377-381, but not in the usual case where no such inference arises, see, e.g., Rummel, supra at  445 U. S. 281.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1001-1005.

|501 u.s. 1030|"Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada
No. 89-1836
Argued April 15, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 1030

Syllabus 
Petitioner Gentile, an attorney, held a press conference the day after his client, Sanders, was indicted on criminal charges under Nevada law.  Six months later, a jury acquitted Sanders.  Subsequently, respondent State Bar of Nevada filed a complaint against Gentile, alleging that statements he made during the press conference violated Nevada Supreme Court Rule 177, which prohibits a lawyer from making extrajudicial statements to the press that he knows or reasonably should know will have a ""substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing"" an adjudicative proceeding, 177(1), which lists a number of statements that are ""ordinarily . . . likely"" to result in material prejudice, 177(2), and which provides that a lawyer ""may state without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense"" ""[n]otwithstanding subsection 1 and 2 (a-f),"" 177(3).  The Disciplinary Board found that Gentile violated the Rule and recommended that he be privately reprimanded.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting his contention that the Rule violated his right to free speech.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
106 Nev. 60, 787 P.2d 386, reversed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III and VI, concluding that, as interpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court, Rule 177 is void for vagueness.  Its safe harbor provision, Rule 177(3), misled Gentile into thinking that he could give his press conference without fear of discipline.  Given the Rule's grammatical structure and the absence of a clarifying interpretation by the state court, the Rule fails to provide fair notice to those to whom it is directed, and is so imprecise that discriminatory enforcement is a real possibility.

Moreover, this Court's decisions dealing with a lawyer's First Amendment right to solicit business and advertise have not suggested that lawyers are protected to the same extent as those engaged in other businesses, but have balanced the State's interest in regulating a specialized profession against a lawyer's First Amendment interest in the kind of speech at issue.

(b) The ""substantial likelihood of material prejudice"" standard is a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases and the State's interest in fair trials.  Lawyers in such cases are key participants in the criminal justice system, and the State may demand some adherence to that system's precepts in regulating their speech and conduct.  Their extrajudicial statements pose a threat to a pending proceeding's fairness, since they have special access to information through discovery and client communication, and since their statements are likely to be received as especially authoritative.  The standard is designed to protect the integrity and fairness of a State's judicial system and imposes only narrow and necessary limitations on lawyers' speech.  Those limitations are aimed at comments that are likely to influence a trial's outcome or prejudice the jury venire, even if an untainted panel is ultimately found.  Few interests under the Constitution are more fundamental than the right to a fair trial by impartial jurors, and the State has a substantial interest in preventing officers of the court from imposing costs on the judicial system and litigants arising from measures, such as a change of venue, to ensure 
Page 501 U. S. 1032
 a fair trial.  The restraint on speech is narrowly tailored to achieve these objectives, since it applies only to speech that is substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect, is neutral to points of view, and merely postpones the lawyer's comments until after the trial.

			"|"Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada
No. 89-1836
Argued April 15, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 1030

Syllabus 
Petitioner Gentile, an attorney, held a press conference the day after his client, Sanders, was indicted on criminal charges under Nevada law.  Six months later, a jury acquitted Sanders.  Subsequently, respondent State Bar of Nevada filed a complaint against Gentile, alleging that statements he made during the press conference violated Nevada Supreme Court Rule 177, which prohibits a lawyer from making extrajudicial statements to the press that he knows or reasonably should know will have a ""substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing"" an adjudicative proceeding, 177(1), which lists a number of statements that are ""ordinarily . . . likely"" to result in material prejudice, 177(2), and which provides that a lawyer ""may state without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense"" ""[n]otwithstanding subsection 1 and 2 (a-f),"" 177(3).  The Disciplinary Board found that Gentile violated the Rule and recommended that he be privately reprimanded.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting his contention that the Rule violated his right to free speech.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
106 Nev. 60, 787 P.2d 386, reversed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III and VI, concluding that, as interpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court, Rule 177 is void for vagueness.  Its safe harbor provision, Rule 177(3), misled Gentile into thinking that he could give his press conference without fear of discipline.  Given the Rule's grammatical structure and the absence of a clarifying interpretation by the state court, the Rule fails to provide fair notice to those to whom it is directed, and is so imprecise that discriminatory enforcement is a real possibility.  By necessary operation of the word ""notwithstanding,"" the Rule contemplates that a lawyer describing the ""general"" nature of the defense without ""elaboration"" need fear no discipline even if he knows or reasonably should know that his statement will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.  Both ""general"" and ""elaboration"" are classic terms of degree which, in this context, have no settled usage or tradition of interpretation in law, and thus a lawyer has no principle for determining when his remarks pass from the permissible to the forbidden.  A review of the press conference -- where Gentile made only a brief opening statement and declined to answer reporters'

|501 u.s. 1083|"Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg
No. 90-615
Argued April 23, 1991
Decided June 27, 1991
501 U.S. 1083

Syllabus 
As part of a proposed ""freeze-out"" merger, in which First American Bank of Virginia (Bank) would be merged into petitioner Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (VBI), a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner First American Bankshares, Inc. (FABI), the Bank's executive committee and board approved a price of $42 a share for the minority stockholders, who would lose their interests in the Bank after the merger.  Although Virginia law required only that the merger proposal be submitted to a vote at a shareholders' meeting, preceded by a circulation of an informational statement to the shareholders, petitioner Bank directors nevertheless solicited proxies for voting on the proposal.  Their solicitation urged the proposal's adoption and stated that the plan had been approved because of its opportunity for the minority shareholders to receive a ""high"" value for their stock.  Respondent Sandberg did not give her proxy and filed suit in District Court after the merger was approved, seeking damages from petitioners for, inter alia, soliciting proxies by means of materially false or misleading statements in violation of  14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Security and Exchange Commission's Rule 14(a)-9.  Among other things, she alleged that the directors believed they had no alternative but to recommend the merger if they wished to remain on the board.  At trial, she obtained a jury instruction, based on language in Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U. S. 375,  396 U. S. 385, that she could prevail without showing her own reliance on the alleged misstatements, so long as they were material and the proxy solicitation was an ""essential link"" in the merger process.  She was awarded an amount equal to the difference between the offered price and her stock's true value.  The remaining respondents prevailed in a separate action raising similar claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that certain statements in the proxy solicitation, including the one regarding the stock's value, were materially misleading, and that respondents could maintain the action even though their votes had not been needed to effectuate the merger.
Held:
1. Knowingly false statements of reasons, opinion, or belief, even though conclusory in form, may be actionable under  14(a) as misstatements of material fact within the meaning of Rule 14(a)-9.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1090-1098. 
Page 501 U. S. 1084

(a) Such statements are not per se inactionable under  14(a).  A statement of belief by corporate directors about a recommended course of action, or an explanation of their reasons for recommending it, may be materially significant, since there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.  See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438,  426 U. S. 449.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1090-1091.
(b) Statements of reasons, opinions, or beliefs are statements ""with respect to . . . material fact[s]"" within the meaning of the Rule.  Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, does not support petitioners' position that such statements should be placed outside the Rule's scope on policy grounds.  There, the right to bring suit under  10(b) of the Act was limited to actual stock buyers and sellers because of the risk of nuisance litigation, in which would-be sellers and buyers would manufacture claims of hypothetical action, unconstrained by independent evidence.  In contrast, reasons for directors' recommendations or statements of belief are factual as statements that the directors do act for the reasons given or hold the belief stated and as statements about the subject matter of the reason or belief expressed.  Thus, they are matters of corporate record subject to documentation, which can be supported or attacked by objective evidence outside a plaintiff's control.  Conclusory terms in a commercial context are also reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis.  Provable facts either furnish good reasons to make the conclusory judgment or count against it.  And expressions of such judgments can be stated with knowledge of truth or falsity just like more definite statements and defended or attacked through the orthodox evidentiary process.  Here, respondents presented facts about the Bank's assets and its actual and potential level of operation to prove that the directors' statement was misleading about the stock's value and a false explanation of the directors' beliefs.  However, a director's disbelief or undisclosed motivation, standing alone, is an insufficient basis to sustain a  14(a) action.  Pp. 1091-1096.
(c) The fact that proxy material discloses an offending statement's factual basis limits liability for misstatements only if the inconsistency is so obvious that it neutralizes the misleading conclusion's capacity to influence the reasonable shareholder.  The evidence here fell short of compelling the jury to find the misleading statement's facial materiality neutralized.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1096-1098.
2. Respondents cannot show causation of damages compensable under  14(a).  Pp.  501 U. S. 1099-1108.
(a) Allowing shareholders whose votes are not required by law or corporate bylaw to authorize a corporate action subject to a proxy solicitation to bring an implied private action pursuant to J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426, would extend the scope of Borak actions beyond 
Page 501 U. S. 1085
 the ambit of Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., supra, which held that a proxy solicitation is an ""essential link"" to a transaction when it links a directors' proposal with the votes legally required to authorize the action proposed.  And it is a serious obstacle to the expansion of the Borak right that there is no manifestation, in either the Act or its legislative history, of congressional intent to recognize a cause of action as broad as that proposed by respondents.  Any private right of action for violating a federal statute must ultimately rest on congressional intent to provide a private remedy, Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560,  442 U. S. 575, and the breadth of the right once recognized should not, as a general matter, grow beyond the scope congressionally intended.  Nonetheless, when faced with a claim for equality in rounding out the scope of an implied private action, this Court should look to policy reasons for deciding where the outer limits of the right should lie.  See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, supra.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1099-1105.
(b) Respondents' theory is rejected that a link existed and was essential because VBI and FABI, in order to avoid the minority stockholders' ill will, would have been unwilling to proceed with the merger without the approval manifested by the proxies.  As was the case in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, supra, threats of speculative claims and procedural intractability are inherent in a theory linked through the directors' desire for a cosmetic vote.  Causation would turn on inferences about what the directors would have thought and done without the minority shareholder approval.  The issues would be hazy, their litigation protracted, and their resolution unreliable.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1105-1106.
(c) Respondents cannot rely on the theory that the proxy statement was an essential link in this case because it was part of a means to avoid suit under a Virginia state law that bars a shareholder from seeking to avoid a transaction tainted by a director's conflict of interest, if, inter alia, the minority shareholders ratified the transaction after disclosure of the material facts of the transaction and the conflict.  Because there is no indication in the law or facts of this case that the proxy solicitation resulted in any such loss, this Court need not resolve the question whether  14(a) provides a federal remedy when a false or misleading proxy statement results in a shareholder's loss of a state remedy.  Pp.  501 U. S. 1106-1108.
891 F.2d 1112, reversed.

||"Cohen v. Cowles Media Company
No. 90-634
Argued March 27, 1991
Decided June 24, 1991
501 U.S. 663

Syllabus 
During the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race, petitioner Cohen, who was associated with one party's campaign, gave court records concerning another party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor to respondent publishers' newspapers after receiving a promise of confidentiality from their reporters.  Nonetheless, the papers identified him in their stories, and he was fired from his job.  He filed suit against respondents in state court, alleging, among other things, a breach of contract.  The court rejected respondents' argument that the First Amendment barred the suit, and a jury awarded him, inter alia, compensatory damages.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed, holding that a contract cause of action was inappropriate.  It then went on to address the question whether Cohen could recover under state law on a promissory estoppel theory, even though that issue was never tried to a jury, nor briefed nor argued by the parties, concluding that enforcement under such a theory would violate respondents' First Amendment rights.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction.  Respondents' contention that the case should be dismissed because the promissory estoppel theory was not argued or presented in the courts below and because the State Supreme Court's decision rests entirely on a state law interpretation is rejected.  It is irrelevant to this Court's jurisdiction whether a party raised below and argued a federal law issue that the state supreme court actually considered and decided.  Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268,  440 U. S. 274-275.  Moreover, the Minnesota Supreme Court made clear that its holding rested on federal law, and respondents have defended against this suit all along by arguing that the First Amendment barred the enforcement of the reporters' promises.  Pp.  501 U. S. 667-668.
2. The First Amendment does not bar a promissory estoppel cause of action against respondents.  Such a cause of action, although private, involves state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore triggers the First Amendment's protections, since promissory estoppel is a state law doctrine creating legal obligations never explicitly assumed by the parties that are enforceable through the Minnesota courts' official power.  Cf., e.g.,  376 U. S.  v. Sullivan,

However, the doctrine is a law of general applicability that does not target or single out the press, but rather is applicable to all Minnesota citizens' daily transactions.  Thus, the First Amendment does not require that its enforcement against the press be subject to stricter scrutiny than would be applied to enforcement against others, cf. Associated Press v. NLRB, 301 U. S. 103,  301 U. S. 132-133, even if the payment is characterized as compensatory damages.  Nor does that Amendment grant the press protection from any law which in any fashion or to any degree limits or restricts its right to report truthful information.  The Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.

Moreover, Cohen sought damages for a breach of promise that caused him to lose his job and lowered his earning capacity, and did not attempt to use a promissory estoppel cause of action to avoid the strict requirements for establishing a libel or defamation claim.

No. 90-634

501 U.S. 663

Syllabus 
During the 1982 Minnesota gubernatorial race, petitioner Cohen, who was associated with one party's campaign, gave court records concerning another party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor to respondent publishers' newspapers after receiving a promise of confidentiality from their reporters.  Nonetheless, the papers identified him in their stories, and he was fired from his job.  He filed suit against respondents in state court, alleging, among other things, a breach of contract.  The court rejected respondents' argument that the First Amendment barred the suit, and a jury awarded him, inter alia, compensatory damages.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed, holding that a contract cause of action was inappropriate.  It then went on to address the question whether Cohen could recover under state law on a promissory estoppel theory, even though that issue was never tried to a jury, nor briefed nor argued by the parties, concluding that enforcement under such a theory would violate respondents' First Amendment rights.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction.  Respondents' contention that the case should be dismissed because the promissory estoppel theory was not argued or presented in the courts below and because the State Supreme Court's decision rests entirely on a state law interpretation is rejected.  It is irrelevant to this Court's jurisdiction whether a party raised below and argued a federal law issue that the state supreme court actually considered and decided.  Orr v. Orr, 440 U. S. 268,  440 U. S. 274-275.  Moreover, the Minnesota Supreme Court made clear that its holding rested on federal law, and respondents have defended against this suit all along by arguing that the First Amendment barred the enforcement of the reporters' promises.  Pp.  501 U. S. 667-668.
2. The First Amendment does not bar a promissory estoppel cause of action against respondents.  Such a cause of action, although private, involves state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore triggers the First Amendment's protections, since promissory estoppel is a state law doctrine creating legal obligations never explicitly assumed by the parties that are enforceable through the Minnesota courts' official power.  Cf., e.g.,  376 U. S.  v. Sullivan,

Syllabus 
Congress created the black lung benefits program to provide compensation for disability to miners due, at least in part, to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.  The program was first administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) under the auspices of the then-existent Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), and later by the Department of Labor (DOL).  Congress authorized these Departments, during their respective tenures, to adopt interim regulations governing claims adjudications, but constrained the Secretary of Labor by providing that the DOL regulations ""shall not be more restrictive than"" HEW's.  As here relevant, the HEW interim regulations permit the invocation of a rebuttable statutory presumption of eligibility for benefits upon introduction by the claimant of specified medical evidence, 20 CFR  410.490(b)(1), and a demonstration that the ""impairment [thus] established . . . arose out of coal mine employment (see  410.416 and 410.456),""  410.490(b)(2).  The referred-to sections presume, ""in the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary,"" that pneumoconiosis arose out of such employment.  Once a claimant invokes the eligibility presumption,  410.490(c) permits the SSA to rebut the presumption by two methods.  In contrast, the comparable DOL interim regulations set forth four rebuttal provisions.  The first two provisions mimic those in the HEW regulations.  The third provision permits rebuttal upon a showing that the miner's disability did not arise in whole or in part out of coal mine employment, and the fourth authorizes rebuttal with evidence demonstrating that the miner does not have pneumoconiosis.  In No. 89-1714, the Court of Appeals concluded that the DOL regulations were not ""more restrictive than"" the HEW regulations by virtue of the DOL's third rebuttal provision, and therefore reversed an administrative award of benefits to a claimant found to qualify under the HEW 
Page 501 U. S. 681
 regulations, but not under the DOL provisions.  In Nos. 90-113 and 90-114, the Court of Appeals struck down the DOL regulations as being ""more restrictive than"" HEW's, reversing DOL's denial of benefits to two claimants whose eligibility was deemed rebutted under the fourth rebuttal provision.
Held:  The third and fourth rebuttal provisions in the DOL regulations do not render those regulations ""more restrictive than"" the HEW regulations.  Pp.  501 U. S. 695-706.
(a) The Secretary of Labor's determination that her interim regulations are not more restrictive than HEW's warrants deference from this Court.  Deference to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous provisions in the statutes it is authorized to implement is appropriate when Congress has delegated policymaking authority to the agency.  See, e.g.,  467 U. S. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,  467 U. S. 866.  Here, since the relevant legislation has produced a complex and highly technical regulatory program, requiring significant expertise in the identification and classification of medical eligibility criteria, and entailing the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns, Congress must have intended, with respect to the ""not . . . more restrictive than"" phrase, a delegation of broad policymaking discretion to the Secretary of Labor.  This is evident from the statutory text, in that Congress declined to require that the DOL adopt the HEW interim regulations verbatim, and from the statute's legislative history, which demonstrates that the delegation was made with the intention that the black lung program evolve as technological expertise matured.  Thus, the Secretary's authority necessarily entails the authority to interpret HEW's regulations and the discretion to promulgate interim regulations based on a reasonable interpretation thereof.  Pp.  501 U. S. 696-699.
(b) The Secretary of Labor's position satisfies Chevron's reasonableness requirement.  See 467 U.S. at  467 U. S. 845.  Based on the premise that the HEW regulations were adopted to ensure that only miners who were disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment would receive benefits, the Secretary interprets HEW's  410.490(b)(2) requirement that the claimant demonstrate that the impairment ""arose out of coal mine employment"" as comparable to DOL's third rebuttal provision, and views subsection (b)(2)'s incorporation by reference of  410.416 and 410.456 as doing the work of DOL's fourth rebuttal method, in light of the statutory definition of pneumoconiosis as ""a . . . disease . . . arising out of coal mine employment.""  This interpretation harmonizes the two interim regulations with the statute.  Moreover, the Secretary's interpretation is more reasoned than that of the claimants, who assert that the HEW regulations contain no provision, either in the invocation subsection or in the rebuttal subsection, that directs factual 
Page 501 U. S. 682
 inquiry into the issue of disability causation or the existence of pneumoconiosis.  The claimants' contention that  410.490(b)(1) creates a ""conclusive"" presumption of entitlement without regard to the existence of competent evidence on these questions is deficient in two respects.  First, the claimants' premise is inconsistent with the statutory text, which expressly provides that the presumptions in question will be rebuttable, and requires the Secretary of HEW to consider all relevant evidence.  Second, although subsection (c)'s delineation of two rebuttal methods may support an inference that the drafter intended to exclude other methods, such an inference provides no guidance where its application would render a regulation inconsistent with the statute's purpose and language.  The fact that the SSA, under the HEW regulations, appeared to award benefits to miners whose administrative files contained scant evidence of eligibility does not require the Secretary to forgo inquiries into disability causation and disease existence.  The claimants' argument that HEW omitted such inquiries from its criteria based on a ""cost/benefit"" conclusion that the inquiries would engender inordinate delays, yet generate little probative evidence, finds scant support in contemporaneous analyses of the SSA awards; disregards entirely subsequent advances in medical technology that Congress could not have intended the HEW or the DOL to ignore; and is based on the unacceptable premise that the Secretary must demonstrate that her reasonable interpretation of HEW's regulations is consistent with HEW's contemporaneous interpretation of those regulations.  Pp.  501 U. S. 699-706.
No. 89-1714, 890 F.2d 1295 (CA3 1989), affirmed; No. 90-113, 895 F.2d 178 (CA4 1990), and No. 90-114, 895 F.2d 173 (CA4 1990), reversed and remanded.

No. 89-7662

Decided June 24, 1991
501 U.S. 722

Syllabus 
After a Buchanan County jury convicted petitioner Coleman of capital murder, he was sentenced to death, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.  He then filed a habeas corpus action in the County Circuit Court, which, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing, ruled against him on numerous federal constitutional claims that he had not raised on direct appeal.  He filed a notice of appeal with that court 33 days after it entered its final judgment, and subsequently filed a petition for appeal in the Virginia Supreme Court.  The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the appeal on the sole ground that the notice of appeal was untimely under the Supreme Court's Rule 5:9(a), which requires that such a notice be filed within 30 days of final judgment.  After both parties filed several briefs on the subject of the dismissal motion and on the merits of Coleman's claims, the Supreme Court granted the motion ""upon consideration [o]f"" the filed papers.  Coleman next filed a habeas petition in the Federal District Court, presenting, inter alia, seven federal constitutional claims he had first raised in state habeas.  Among other things, the court concluded that, by virtue of the dismissal of his state habeas appeal, Coleman had procedurally defaulted the seven claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Coleman's argument that the Virginia Supreme Court had not ""clearly and expressly"" stated that its decision in state habeas was based on a procedural default, such that the federal courts could not treat it as such under Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255.  The court concluded that federal review of the claims was barred, since the Virginia Supreme Court had met Harris' ""plain statement"" requirement by granting a motion to dismiss that was based solely on procedural grounds, since that decision rested on independent and adequate state grounds, and since Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default.
Held:  Coleman's claims presented for the first time in the state habeas proceeding are not subject to review in federal habeas.  Pp.  501 U. S. 729-757.
(a) Because of comity and federalism concerns and the requirement that States have the first opportunity to correct their own mistakes, federal habeas courts generally may not review a state court's denial of a state prisoner's federal constitutional claim if the state court's decision rests on a state procedural default that is independent of the federal 
Page 501 U. S. 723
 question and adequate to support the prisoner's continued custody.  See, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72,  433 U. S. 81,  433 U. S. 87.  Pp.  501 U. S. 729-732.
(b) Since ambiguous state court decisions can make it difficult for a federal habeas court to apply the independent and adequate state ground doctrine, this Court has created a conclusive presumption that there is no such ground if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those claims, or to be interwoven with those claims, and did not ""clearly and expressly"" rely on an independent and adequate state ground.  See Harris, supra, 489 U.S. at  489 U. S. 261,  489 U. S. 266; Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1040-1041.  Pp.  501 U. S. 732-735.
(c) There is no merit to Coleman's contention that the Harris presumption applies in all cases in which the state habeas court's decision does not ""clearly and expressly"" state that it was based on an independent and adequate state ground.  The holding of Harris, supra, is not changed by the fact that, in one particular exposition of its rule, id. at  489 U. S. 263, the Court announced the ""plain statement"" requirement without mentioning the predicate requirement that the state court's decision must fairly appear to rest primarily on, or to be interwoven with, federal law.  The Harris presumption, like all conclusive presumptions, is designed to avoid the costs of excessive inquiry where a per se rule will achieve the correct result in almost all cases.  Coleman's proposed rule would greatly and unacceptably expand the risk of improper federal review in those cases in which it does not fairly appear that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds.  Applying Coleman's rule would have very little benefit to the federal courts in such cases, since their task of determining the scope of the state court judgment would not be difficult.  On the other hand, that rule would place great burdens on the States, which, if their courts neglected to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default, would have to respond to federal habeas review of the federal claims of prisoners in state custody for independent and adequate state law reasons, would have to pay the price in terms of the uncertainty and delay added to the enforcement of their criminal laws, and would have to retry the petitioner if the federal courts reversed his conviction.  Coleman's rule would also burden the state courts, which would have to incorporate ""plain statement"" language in every state appeal and every denial of state collateral review that was potentially subject to federal review.  Pp.  501 U. S. 735-740.
(d) The Harris presumption does not apply in this case.  The Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order ""fairly appears"" to rest primarily on state law, since it does not mention federal law and granted the Commonwealth's dismissal motion, which was based solely on Coleman's failure to meet Rule 5:9(a)'s time requirements.  There is no merit to Coleman's 
Page 501 U. S. 724
 argument that the dismissal was not independent of federal law, because the Virginia court applied its procedural bar only after determining that doing so would not abridge one of his federal constitutional rights, such that federal review is permissible under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68,  470 U. S. 75.  Even if Ake, a direct review case, applies here, it does Coleman no good, because the Virginia court relied on an independent state procedural ground.  Moreover, it is clear that the rule of Tharp v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 1, 3, 175 S.E.2d 277, 278 -- in which the Virginia court announced that it would no longer allow extensions of time for filing petitions for writs of error with the Supreme Court unless denial of an extension would abridge a constitutional right -- was not applied here, where it was Coleman's notice of appeal in the trial court that was late.  And, although in O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 207 Va. 707, 709, 152 S.E.2d 278, 280, the Virginia court reviewed the merits of a constitutional claim before dismissing the case on the basis of an untimely civil notice of appeal, it also expressly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the notice of appeal time requirement.  While some ambiguity is added to this case by the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order was issued ""[u]pon consideration"" of all the filed papers, including those discussing the merits of Coleman's federal claims, this Court cannot read that ambiguity as overriding the Virginia court's explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on state procedural grounds independent of federal law.  This Court also accepts the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the procedural bar was adequate to support the judgment, since Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question.  Pp.  501 U. S. 740-744.
(e) In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Cf., e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,  477 U. S. 485,  477 U. S. 495; Harris, supra, 489 U.S. at  489 U. S. 265.  Although Coleman would be entitled to relief if the ""deliberate bypass"" standard set forth in Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391,  372 U. S. 438-439, still applied, that standard has been superseded by the Court's subsequent decisions applying the cause and prejudice standard.  The Fay standard was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,  499 U. S. 491.  Pp.  501 U. S. 744-751. 
Page 501 U. S. 725

(f) Coleman's contention that it was his attorney's error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal cannot demonstrate ""cause"" under the foregoing standard.  Carrier, supra, 477 U.S. at  477 U. S. 488, establishes that attorney error can be ""cause"" only if it constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel violative of the Sixth Amendment.  Because there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state postconviction proceedings, see, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings, see Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586.  Although Coleman argues that attorney error may be of sufficient magnitude to excuse a procedural default in federal habeas even though no Sixth Amendment claim is possible, this argument is inconsistent with the language and logic of Carrier, supra, 477 U.S. at  477 U. S. 488, which explicitly says that, in the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation.  Pp.  501 U. S. 752-754.
(g) Nor is there merit to Coleman's contention that, at least as to the federal ineffective assistance claims that he first presented to the state habeas trial court, attorney error in his state habeas appeal must constitute ""cause"" because, under Virginia law at the time of his trial and direct appeal, claims of that type could be brought only in state habeas.  Although an indigent criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to an effective attorney in his ""one and only appeal . . . as of right,"" Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353,  372 U. S. 357,  372 U. S. 358; Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387.  Coleman has had his ""one and only appeal"" as to the claims in question, since the County Circuit Court fully addressed and denied those claims.  He does not have a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from that determination.  Cf., e.g., Finley, supra, 481 U.S. at  481 U. S. 556.  Thus, since any attorney error that lead to the default of those claims cannot constitute ""cause,"" and since Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of the claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing the claims in federal habeas.  Pp.  501 U. S. 755-757.

			"|"Coleman v. Thompson
No. 89-7662
Argued Feb. 25, 1991
Decided June 24, 1991
501 U.S. 722

Syllabus 
After a Buchanan County jury convicted petitioner Coleman of capital murder, he was sentenced to death, and the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed.  He then filed a habeas corpus action in the County Circuit Court, which, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing, ruled against him on numerous federal constitutional claims that he had not raised on direct appeal.  He filed a notice of appeal with that court 33 days after it entered its final judgment, and subsequently filed a petition for appeal in the Virginia Supreme Court.  The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the appeal on the sole ground that the notice of appeal was untimely under the Supreme Court's Rule 5:9(a), which requires that such a notice be filed within 30 days of final judgment.  After both parties filed several briefs on the subject of the dismissal motion and on the merits of Coleman's claims, the Supreme Court granted the motion ""upon consideration [o]f"" the filed papers.  Coleman next filed a habeas petition in the Federal District Court, presenting, inter alia, seven federal constitutional claims he had first raised in state habeas.  Among other things, the court concluded that, by virtue of the dismissal of his state habeas appeal, Coleman had procedurally defaulted the seven claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Coleman's argument that the Virginia Supreme Court had not ""clearly and expressly"" stated that its decision in state habeas was based on a procedural default, such that the federal courts could not treat it as such under Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255.  The court concluded that federal review of the claims was barred, since the Virginia Supreme Court had met Harris' ""plain statement"" requirement by granting a motion to dismiss that was based solely on procedural grounds, since that decision rested on independent and adequate state grounds, and since Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default.
Held:  Coleman's claims presented for the first time in the state habeas proceeding are not subject to review in federal habeas.  Pp.  501 U. S. 729-757.
(a) Because of comity and federalism concerns and the requirement that States have the first opportunity to correct their own mistakes, federal habeas courts generally may not review a state court's denial of a state prisoner's federal constitutional claim if the state court's decision rests on a state procedural default that is independent of the federal 
Page 501 U. S. 723
 question and adequate to support the prisoner's continued custody.  See, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72,  433 U. S. 81,  433 U. S. 87.  Pp.  501 U. S. 729-732.
(b) Since ambiguous state court decisions can make it difficult for a federal habeas court to apply the independent and adequate state ground doctrine, this Court has created a conclusive presumption that there is no such ground if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those claims, or to be interwoven with those claims, and did not ""clearly and expressly"" rely on an independent and adequate state ground.  See Harris, supra, 489 U.S. at  489 U. S. 261,  489 U. S. 266; Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,  463 U. S. 1040-1041.  Pp.  501 U. S. 732-735.
(c) There is no merit to Coleman's contention that the Harris presumption applies in all cases in which the state habeas court's decision does not ""clearly and expressly"" state that it was based on an independent and adequate state ground.  The holding of Harris, supra, is not changed by the fact that, in one particular exposition of its rule, id. at  489 U. S. 263, the Court announced the ""plain statement"" requirement without mentioning the predicate requirement that the state court's decision must fairly appear to rest primarily on, or to be interwoven with, federal law.  The Harris presumption, like all conclusive presumptions, is designed to avoid the costs of excessive inquiry where a per se rule will achieve the correct result in almost all cases.  Coleman's proposed rule would greatly and unacceptably expand the risk of improper federal review in those cases in which it does not fairly appear that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds.  Applying Coleman's rule would have very little benefit to the federal courts in such cases, since their task of determining the scope of the state court judgment would not be difficult.  On the other hand, that rule would place great burdens on the States, which, if their courts neglected to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default, would have to respond to federal habeas review of the federal claims of prisoners in state custody for independent and adequate state law reasons, would have to pay the price in terms of the uncertainty and delay added to the enforcement of their criminal laws, and would have to retry the petitioner if the federal courts reversed his conviction.  Coleman's rule would also burden the state courts, which would have to incorporate ""plain statement"" language in every state appeal and every denial of state collateral review that was potentially subject to federal review.  Pp.  501 U. S. 735-740.
(d) The Harris presumption does not apply in this case.  The Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order ""fairly appears"" to rest primarily on state law, since it does not mention federal law and granted the Commonwealth's dismissal motion, which was based solely on Coleman's failure to meet Rule 5:9(a)'s time requirements.  There is no merit to Coleman's 
Page 501 U. S. 724
 argument that the dismissal was not independent of federal law, because the Virginia court applied its procedural bar only after determining that doing so would not abridge one of his federal constitutional rights, such that federal review is permissible under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68,  470 U. S. 75.  Even if Ake, a direct review case, applies here, it does Coleman no good, because the Virginia court relied on an independent state procedural ground.  Moreover, it is clear that the rule of Tharp v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 1, 3, 175 S.E.2d 277, 278 -- in which the Virginia court announced that it would no longer allow extensions of time for filing petitions for writs of error with the Supreme Court unless denial of an extension would abridge a constitutional right -- was not applied here, where it was Coleman's notice of appeal in the trial court that was late.  And, although in O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 207 Va. 707, 709, 152 S.E.2d 278, 280, the Virginia court reviewed the merits of a constitutional claim before dismissing the case on the basis of an untimely civil notice of appeal, it also expressly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the notice of appeal time requirement.  While some ambiguity is added to this case by the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order was issued ""[u]pon consideration"" of all the filed papers, including those discussing the merits of Coleman's federal claims, this Court cannot read that ambiguity as overriding the Virginia court's explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on state procedural grounds independent of federal law.  This Court also accepts the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the procedural bar was adequate to support the judgment, since Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question.  Pp.  501 U. S. 740-744.
(e) In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Cf., e.g., Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,  477 U. S. 485,  477 U. S. 495; Harris, supra, 489 U.S. at  489 U. S. 265.  Although Coleman would be entitled to relief if the ""deliberate bypass"" standard set forth in Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391,  372 U. S. 438-439, still applied, that standard has been superseded by the Court's subsequent decisions applying the cause and prejudice standard.  The Fay standard was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467,  499 U. S. 491.  Pp.  501 U. S. 744-751. 
Page 501 U. S. 725

(f) Coleman's contention that it was his attorney's error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal cannot demonstrate ""cause"" under the foregoing standard.  Carrier, supra, 477 U.S. at  477 U. S. 488, establishes that attorney error can be ""cause"" only if it constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel violative of the Sixth Amendment.  Because there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state postconviction proceedings, see, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings, see Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586.  Although Coleman argues that attorney error may be of sufficient magnitude to excuse a procedural default in federal habeas even though no Sixth Amendment claim is possible, this argument is inconsistent with the language and logic of Carrier, supra, 477 U.S. at  477 U. S. 488, which explicitly says that, in the absence of a constitutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the representation.  Pp.  501 U. S. 752-754.
(g) Nor is there merit to Coleman's contention that, at least as to the federal ineffective assistance claims that he first presented to the state habeas trial court, attorney error in his state habeas appeal must constitute ""cause"" because, under Virginia law at the time of his trial and direct appeal, claims of that type could be brought only in state habeas.  Although an indigent criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to an effective attorney in his ""one and only appeal . . . as of right,"" Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353,  372 U. S. 357,  372 U. S. 358; Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U. S. 387.  Coleman has had his ""one and only appeal"" as to the claims in question, since the County Circuit Court fully addressed and denied those claims.  He does not have a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from that determination.  Cf., e.g., Finley, supra, 481 U.S. at  481 U. S. 556.  Thus, since any attorney error that lead to the default of those claims cannot constitute ""cause,"" and since Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of the claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing the claims in federal habeas.

Syllabus 
Respondents, Alaska Native villages, brought suit against petitioner, a state official, seeking an order requiring payment to them of money allegedly owed under a state revenue-sharing statute.  The District Court dismissed the suit as violating the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court of Appeals reversed, first on the ground that 28 U.S.C.  1362 constituted a congressional abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and then, upon reconsideration, on the ground that Alaska had no immunity against suits by Indian tribes.
Held:
1. The Eleventh Amendment bars suits by Indian tribes against States without their consent.  Respondents' argument that traditional principles of sovereign immunity restrict suits only by individuals, and not by other sovereigns, was rejected in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313,  292 U. S. 322-323.  Nor is there merit to respondents' contention that the States consented to suits by tribes in the ""plan of the convention.""  See ibid.  Just as in Monaco with regard to foreign sovereigns, see id. at  292 U. S. 330, there is no compelling evidence that the Founders thought that the States waived their immunity with regard to tribes when they adopted the Constitution.  Although tribes are in some respects more like States -- which may sue each other, South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286,  192 U. S. 318 -- than like foreign sovereigns, it is the mutuality of concession that makes the States' surrender of immunity from suits by sister States plausible.  There is no such mutuality with tribes, which have been held repeatedly to enjoy immunity against suits by States.  Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505,  498 U. S. 509.  Pp.  501 U. S. 779-782.
2. Section 1362 -- which grants district courts original jurisdiction to hear ""all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe . . . wherein the matter in controversy arises under"" federal law -- does not operate to void the Eleventh Amendment's bar of tribes' suits against States.  Pp.  501 U. S. 782-788. 
Page 501 U. S. 776

(a) Assuming the doubtful proposition that the Federal Government's exemption from state sovereign immunity can be delegated,  1362 does not embody a general delegation to tribes of the Federal Government's authority, under United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181,  270 U. S. 195, to sue States on the tribes' behalf.  Although Moe v. Confederated Salish an Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463 -- which held that  1362 revoked as to tribes the Tax Injunction Act's denial of federal court access to persons other than the United States seeking injunctive relief from state taxation -- equated tribal access to federal court with the United States' access, it did not purport to do so generally, nor on the basis of a ""delegation"" theory, nor with respect to constitutional (as opposed to merely statutory) constraints.  Pp.  501 U. S. 783-786.
(b) Nor does  1362 abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity.  It does not satisfy the standard for congressional abrogation set forth in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223,  491 U. S. 227-228, since it does not reflect an ""unmistakably clear"" intent to abrogate immunity, made plain ""in the language of the statute.""  Nor was it a sufficiently clear statement under the less stringent standard of Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184, which case (unlike Dellmuth) had already been decided at the time of  1362's enactment in 1966.  That case neither mentioned nor was premised on abrogation (as opposed to consensual waiver) -- and indeed the Court did not even acknowledge the possibility of congressional abrogation until 1976, Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445.  Pp.  501 U. S. 786-788.
3. Respondents' argument that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar their claim for injunctive relief must be considered initially by the Court of Appeals on remand.  P.  501 U. S. 788.
896 F.2d 1157, reversed and remanded.

501 U.S. 797

Syllabus 
Following his California murder conviction, respondent raised a Miranda claim for the first time on direct appeal, in violation of a state procedural rule.  In affirming the conviction, the State Court of Appeal rejected the claim on the sole basis of the procedural bar.  After successive petitions for collateral relief were denied without opinion by the State Superior Court and Court of Appeal, respondent filed a habeas petition in the State Supreme Court, which denied relief without opinion or explanation, citing its decisions in In re Swain and In re Waltreus.  When the State Supreme Court denied, without opinion or citation, a second habeas petition to it, respondent filed a habeas petition raising the Miranda claim in Federal District Court.  That court found that the state procedural default barred federal review, but the Court of Appeals reversed this determination.  Relying on this Court's statement in Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255,  489 U. S. 263, that state procedural default bars federal review only when the state court clearly and expressly states its reliance on that ground, the court held that the State Supreme Court's ""silent denial"" of respondent's second state habeas petition lifted the procedural bar imposed on direct review.
Held:  A state court's unexplained denial of a habeas petition raising federal claims is not sufficient, for purposes of federal review, to lift a procedural bar imposed on direct appeal.  Pp.  501 U. S. 801-806.
(a) The Court of Appeals erred in applying a presumption that, when a state court denies a federal claim without explicit reliance on state grounds, the merits of the federal claim are the basis for the judgment.  The Harris presumption in favor of federal review is to be applied only after it has been determined that ""the relevant state court decision . . . fairly appear[s] to rest primarily on federal law or [is] interwoven with [federal] law.""  Coleman v. Thompon, ante at  501 U. S. 740.  P.  501 U. S. 802.
(b) With respect to unexplained state court judgments, federal habeas courts should apply the following presumption:  where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.  If an earlier opinion ""fairly appear[s] to rest primarily upon federal law,"" it should be presumed that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment 
Page 501 U. S. 798
 or its consequences in place.  Similarly, where the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, it should be presumed that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard the bar and consider the merits.  This ""look-through"" presumption may be rebutted by strong evidence to the contrary.  Pp.  501 U. S. 803-804.
(c) The last explained state court judgment on respondent's Miranda claim was that of the Court of Appeal on direct review, which unequivocally rested upon a state procedural default.  None of the later judgments or orders was informative on the reason for denying the Miranda claim, nor has respondent adduced strong evidence that one of them reached the merits of that claim.  Thus, federal court review is barred unless respondent can establish ""cause and prejudice"" for his default, see Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,  477 U. S. 493,  477 U. S. 495-496.  On remand, the Court of Appeals must determine whether he has done so.  Pp.  501 U. S. 805-806.

Coleman v. Thompon, ante at  501 U. S. 740.  P.  501 U. S. 802.
(b) With respect to unexplained state court judgments, federal habeas courts should apply the following presumption:  where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim, later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.  If an earlier opinion ""fairly appear[s] to rest primarily upon federal law,"" it should be presumed that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment 
Page 501 U. S. 798
 or its consequences in place.  Similarly, where the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, it should be presumed that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard the bar and consider the merits.  This ""look-through"" presumption may be rebutted by strong evidence to the contrary.  Pp.  501 U. S. 803-804.
(c) The last explained state court judgment on respondent's Miranda claim was that of the Court of Appeal on direct review, which unequivocally rested upon a state procedural default.  None of the later judgments or orders was informative on the reason for denying the Miranda claim, nor has respondent adduced strong evidence that one of them reached the merits of that claim.  Thus, federal court review is barred unless respondent can establish ""cause and prejudice"" for his default, see Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,  477 U. S. 493,  477 U. S. 495-496.  On remand, the Court of Appeals must determine whether he has done so.  Pp.  501 U. S. 805-806.

 In Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 ( 1986), this Court recognized that ""the Eighth Amendment prohibits a State from carrying out a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane."" Id., at 409-410, 106 S.Ct., at 2601-2602. The full Court, however, did not attempt a comprehensive definition of insanity or incompetence in this setting. See id., at 407-408, 409-410, 106 S.Ct., at 2600-2601, 2601-2602 ; id., at 418, 106 S.Ct., at 2606 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). This petition presents the question whether a prisoner whose mental incapacity renders him unable to recognize or communicate facts that would make his sentence unlawful or unjust is nonetheless competent to be executed. Because Ford leaves this question unanswered, and because this is an important and recurring issue in the administration of the death penalty, I would grant the petition.

 Petitioner thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, arguing that his deteriorated mental condition rendered him incompetent to be executed. The District Court ordered a mental evaluation of petitioner to be conducted by the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners. The examiners reached two conclusions.

Syllabus 
Respondents, two Indiana establishments wishing to provide totally nude dancing as entertainment and individual dancers employed at those establishments, brought suit in the District Court to enjoin enforcement of the state public indecency law -- which requires respondent dancers to wear pasties and a G-string -- asserting that the law's prohibition against total nudity in public places violates the First Amendment.  The court held that the nude dancing involved here was not expressive conduct. The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that nonobscene nude dancing performed for entertainment is protected expression, and that the statute was an improper infringement of that activity because its purpose was to prevent the message of eroticism and sexuality conveyed by the dancers.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
904 F.2d 1081 (CA9 1990), reversed.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that the enforcement of Indiana's public indecency law to prevent totally nude dancing does not violate the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression.  Pp.  501 U. S. 565-572.
(a) Nude dancing of the kind sought to be performed here is expressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment, although only marginally so.  See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U. S. 922,  422 U. S. 932.  Pp.  501 U. S. 565-566.
(b) Applying the four-part test of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367,  391 U. S. 376-377 -- which rejected the contention that symbolic speech is entitled to full First Amendment protection -- the statute is justified despite its incidental limitations on some expressive activity.  The law is clearly within the State's constitutional power.  And it furthers a substantial governmental interest in protecting societal order and morality.  Public indecency statutes reflect moral disapproval of people appearing in the nude among strangers in public places, and this particular law follows a line of state laws, dating back to 1831, banning public nudity.  The States' traditional police power is defined as the authority to provide for the public health, safety, and morals, and such a basis for legislation 
Page 501 U. S. 561
 has been upheld.  See, e.g., Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49,  413 U. S. 61.  This governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, since public nudity is the evil the State seeks to prevent, whether or not it is combined with expressive activity.  The law does not proscribe nudity in these establishments because the dancers are conveying an erotic message.  To the contrary, an erotic performance may be presented without any state interference, so long as the performers wear a scant amount of clothing.  Finally, the incidental restriction on First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the governmental interest.  Since the statutory prohibition is not a means to some greater end, but an end itself, it is without cavil that the statute is narrowly tailored.  Pp.  501 U. S. 566-572.
JUSTICE SCALIA concluded that the statute -- as a general law regulating conduct and not specifically directed at expression, either in practice or on its face -- is not subject to normal First Amendment scrutiny, and should be upheld on the ground that moral opposition to nudity supplies a rational basis for its prohibition.  Cf. Employment Division, Oregon Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872.  There is no intermediate level of scrutiny requiring that an incidental restriction on expression, such as that involved here, be justified by an important or substantial governmental interest.  Pp.  501 U. S. 572-580.
JUSTICE SOUTER, agreeing that the nude dancing at issue here is subject to a degree of First Amendment protection, and that the test of United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, is the appropriate analysis to determine the actual protection required, concluded that the State's interest in preventing the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments -- prostitution, sexual assaults, and other criminal activity -- is sufficient under O'Brien to justify the law's enforcement against nude dancing.  The prevention of such effects clearly falls within the State's constitutional power.  In addition, the asserted interest is plainly substantial, and the State could have concluded that it is furthered by a prohibition on nude dancing, even without localized proof of the harmful effects.  See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41,  475 U. S. 50.  Moreover, the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, since the pernicious effects are merely associated with nude dancing establishments and are not the result of the expression inherent in nude dancing.  Id. at  475 U. S. 48.  Finally, the restriction is no greater than is essential to further the governmental interest, since pasties and a G-string moderate expression to a minor degree when measured against the dancer's remaining capacity and opportunity to express an erotic message.  Pp.  501 U. S. 581-587.

No. 89-1905
Argued April 24, 1991
Decided June 21, 1991
501 U.S. 597

Syllabus 
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA or Act), 7 U.S.C.  136 et seq., was primarily a pesticide licensing and labeling law until 1972, when it was transformed by Congress into a comprehensive regulatory statute.  Among other things, the 1972 amendments significantly strengthened the preexisting registration and labeling standards, specified that FIFRA regulates pesticide use, as well as sales and labeling, and granted increased enforcement authority to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Regarding state and local authorities, FIFRA, as amended, includes provisions requiring pesticide manufacturers to produce records for inspection ""upon request of any officer or employee . . . of any State or political subdivision,""  136f(b); directing the EPA to cooperate with ""any appropriate agency of any state or any political subdivision thereof . . . in securing uniformity of regulations,""  136t(b); and specifying that ""[a] State"" may regulate pesticide sale or use so long as such regulation does not permit a sale or use prohibited by the Act,  136v(a).  Pursuant to its statutory police power, petitioner town adopted an ordinance that, inter alia, requires a permit for certain applications of pesticides to private lands.  After the town issued a decision unfavorable to respondent Mortier on his application for a permit to spray a portion of his land, he brought a declaratory judgment action in county court, claiming, among other things, that the ordinance was preempted by FIFRA.  The court granted summary judgment for Mortier, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, finding preemption on the ground that the Act's text and legislative history demonstrate a clearly manifest congressional intent to prohibit any regulation of pesticides by local governmental units.
Held:  FIFRA does not preempt local governmental regulation of pesticide use.  Pp.  501 U. S. 604-616.
(a) When considering preemption, this Court starts with the assumption that the States' historic powers are not superseded by federal law unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.  That purpose may be expressed in the terms of the statute itself.  Absent explicit preemptive language, congressional intent to supersede state law may nonetheless be implicit if, for example, the federal Act touches a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be 
Page 501 U. S. 598
 assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.  Even where Congress has not chosen to occupy a particular field, preemption may occur to the extent that state and federal law actually conflict, as when compliance with both is a physical impossibility, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' purposes and objectives.  Pp.  501 U. S. 604-605.
(b) FIFRA nowhere expressly supersedes local regulation.  Neither the Act's language nor the legislative history relied on by the court below, whether read together or separately, suffices to establish preemption.  The fact that  136v(a) expressly refers only to ""[a] State"" as having the authority to regulate pesticide use, and the Act's failure to include political subdivisions in its  136(aa) definition of ""State,"" are wholly inadequate to demonstrate the requisite clear and manifest congressional intent.  Mere silence is insufficient in this context.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,  331 U. S. 230.  And the exclusion of local governments cannot be inferred from the express authorization to ""State[s],"" because that term is not self-limiting; political subdivisions are merely subordinate components of the very entity the statute empowers.  Cf., e.g., Sailors v. Board of Education of Kent County, 387 U. S. 105,  387 U. S. 108.  Indeed, the more plausible reading of the express authorization leaves the allocation of regulatory authority to the absolute discretion of the States themselves, including the options of specific redelegation or leaving local regulation of pesticides in the hands of local authorities under existing state laws.  Nor is there any merit to Mortier's contention that the express references in  136t(b) and 136f(b) to ""political subdivision[s]"" show that Congress made a clear distinction between nonregulatory authority, which may be exercised by such subdivisions, and the regulatory authority reserved to the ""State[s]"" in  136v(a).  Furthermore, the legislative history is, at best, ambiguous, reflecting a disagreement between the responsible congressional committees as to whether the provision that would become  136v preempted local regulation.  Pp.  501 U. S. 606-610.
(c) FIFRA also fails to provide any clear and manifest indication that Congress sought to supplant local authority over pesticide regulation impliedly.  The argument that the 1972 amendments transformed the Act into a 
Page 501 U. S. 599
 comprehensive statute that occupied the entire pesticide regulation field, and that certain provisions, including  136v(a), reopened certain portions of the field to the States, but not to political subdivisions, is unpersuasive.  Section 136v itself undercuts any inference of field preemption, since  136v(b) prohibits States from enacting or imposing labeling or packaging requirements that conflict with those required under FIFRA.  This language would be pure surplusage if Congress had already occupied the entire field.  Nor does FIFRA otherwise imply preemption.  While the 1972 amendments turned the Act into a comprehensive regulatory statute, substantial portions of the field are still left vacant, including the area at issue in this case.  FIFRA nowhere seeks to establish an affirmative permit scheme for the actual use of pesticides or to occupy the field of local use permitting.  Thus, the specific grant of authority in  136v(a) must be read not as an exclusion of municipalities, but as an act ensuring that the States could continue to regulate use and sales even where, such as with regard to the banning of mislabeled products, a narrow preemptive overlap might occur.  Pp.  501 U. S. 611-614.
(d) There is no actual conflict either between FIFRA or the ordinance at issue or between the Act and local regulation generally.  Compliance with both the ordinance and FIFRA is not a physical impossibility.  Moreover, Mortier's assertions that the ordinance stands as an obstacle to the Act's goals of promoting pesticide regulation that is coordinated solely at the federal and state levels, that rests upon some degree of technical expertise, and that does not unduly burden interstate commerce are based on little more than snippets of legislative history and policy speculations, and are unpersuasive.  As is evidenced by  136t(b), FIFRA implies a regulatory partnership between federal, state, and local governments.  There is no indication that any coordination which the statute seeks to promote extends beyond the matters with which it expressly deals, or does so strongly enough to compel the conclusion that an independently enacted ordinance that falls outside the statute's reach frustrates its purpose.  Nor is there any indication in FIFRA that Congress felt that local ordinances necessarily rest on insufficient expertise and burden commerce.  Pp.  501 U. S. 614-616.

The court granted summary judgment for Mortier, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, finding preemption on the ground that the Act's text and legislative history demonstrate a clearly manifest congressional intent to prohibit any regulation of pesticides by local governmental units.
Held:  FIFRA does not preempt local governmental regulation of pesticide use.  Pp.  501 U. S. 604-616.
(a) When considering preemption, this Court starts with the assumption that the States' historic powers are not superseded by federal law unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.  That purpose may be expressed in the terms of the statute itself.  Absent explicit preemptive language, congressional intent to supersede state law may nonetheless be implicit if, for example, the federal Act touches a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be 
Page 501 U. S. 598
 assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.  Even where Congress has not chosen to occupy a particular field, preemption may occur to the extent that state and federal law actually conflict, as when compliance with both is a physical impossibility, or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' purposes and objectives.  Pp.  501 U. S. 604-605.
(b) FIFRA nowhere expressly supersedes local regulation.  Neither the Act's language nor the legislative history relied on by the court below, whether read together or separately, suffices to establish preemption.  The fact that  136v(a) expressly refers only to ""[a] State"" as having the authority to regulate pesticide use, and the Act's failure to include political subdivisions in its  136(aa) definition of ""State,"" are wholly inadequate to demonstrate the requisite clear and manifest congressional intent.  Mere silence is insufficient in this context.  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,  331 U. S. 230.  And the exclusion of local governments cannot be inferred from the express authorization to ""State[s],"" because that term is not self-limiting; political subdivisions are merely subordinate components of the very entity the statute empowers.  Cf., e.g., Sailors v. Board of Education of Kent County, 387 U. S. 105,  387 U. S. 108.  Indeed, the more plausible reading of the express authorization leaves the allocation of regulatory authority to the absolute discretion of the States themselves, including the options of specific redelegation or leaving local regulation of pesticides in the hands of local authorities under existing state laws.  Nor is there any merit to Mortier's contention that the express references in  136t(b) and 136f(b) to ""political subdivision[s]"" show that Congress made a clear distinction between nonregulatory authority, which may be exercised by such subdivisions, and the regulatory authority reserved to the ""State[s]"" in  136v(a).  Furthermore, the legislative history is, at best, ambiguous, reflecting a disagreement between the responsible congressional committees as to whether the provision that would become  136v preempted local regulation.  Pp.  501 U. S. 606-610.
(c) FIFRA also fails to provide any clear and manifest indication that Congress sought to supplant local authority over pesticide regulation impliedly.  The argument that the 1972 amendments transformed the Act into a 
Page 501 U. S. 599
 comprehensive statute that occupied the entire pesticide regulation field, and that certain provisions, including  136v(a), reopened certain portions of the field to the States, but not to political subdivisions, is unpersuasive.  Section 136v itself undercuts any inference of field preemption, since  136v(b) prohibits States from enacting or imposing labeling or packaging requirements that conflict with those required under FIFRA.  This language would be pure surplusage if Congress had already occupied the entire field.  Nor does FIFRA otherwise imply preemption.  While the 1972 amendments turned the Act into a comprehensive regulatory statute, substantial portions of the field are still left vacant, including the area at issue in this case.  FIFRA nowhere seeks to establish an affirmative permit scheme for the actual use of pesticides or to occupy the field of local use permitting.  Thus, the specific grant of authority in  136v(a) must be read not as an exclusion of municipalities, but as an act ensuring that the States could continue to regulate use and sales even where, such as with regard to the banning of mislabeled products, a narrow preemptive overlap might occur.  Pp.  501 U. S. 611-614.
(d) There is no actual conflict either between FIFRA or the ordinance at issue or between the Act and local regulation generally.  Compliance with both the ordinance and FIFRA is not a physical impossibility.  Moreover, Mortier's assertions that the ordinance stands as an obstacle to the Act's goals of promoting pesticide regulation that is coordinated solely at the federal and state levels, that rests upon some degree of technical expertise, and that does not unduly burden interstate commerce are based on little more than snippets of legislative history and policy speculations, and are unpersuasive.  As is evidenced by  136t(b), FIFRA implies a regulatory partnership between federal, state, and local governments.  There is no indication that any coordination which the statute seeks to promote extends beyond the matters with which it expressly deals, or does so strongly enough to compel the conclusion that an independently enacted ordinance that falls outside the statute's reach frustrates its purpose.  Nor is there any indication in FIFRA that Congress felt that local ordinances necessarily rest on insufficient expertise and burden commerce.  Pp.  501 U. S. 614-616.

No. 90-5551
Argued Feb. 27, 1991
Decided June 21, 1991
501 U.S. 624

Syllabus 
After he was found with a murder victim's vehicle and other belongings, petitioner Schad was indicted for first-degree murder.  At trial, the prosecutor advanced both premeditated and felony murder theories, against which Schad claimed that the circumstantial evidence proved, at most, that he was a thief, not a murderer.  The court refused Schad's request for an instruction on theft as a lesser included offense, but charged the jury on second-degree murder.  The jury convicted him of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting Schad's contention that the trial court erred in not requiring the jury to agree on a single theory of first-degree murder.  The court also rejected Schad's argument that Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, required an instruction on the lesser included offense of robbery.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
163 Ariz. 411, 788 P.2d 1162, (1989) affirmed.
JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part III, concluding that Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 -- which held unconstitutional a state statute prohibiting lesser included offense instructions in capital cases -- did not entitle Schad to a jury instruction on robbery.  Beck was based on the concern that a jury convinced that the defendant had committed some violent crime, but not convinced that he was guilty of a capital offense, might nonetheless vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set him free with no punishment at all.  See id. at  447 U. S. 629,  447 U. S. 630,  447 U. S. 632,  447 U. S. 634,  447 U. S. 637,  447 U. S. 642-643, and n.19.  This concern simply is not implicated here, since the jury was given the ""third option"" of finding Schad guilty of a lesser included noncapital offense, second-degree murder.  It would be irrational to assume that the jury chose capital murder, rather than second-degree murder, as its means of keeping a robber off the streets, and, thus, the trial court's choice of instructions sufficed to ensure the verdict's reliability.  Pp.  501 U. S. 645-648.
JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded in Part II that Arizona's characterization of first-degree murder as a single crime as to which a jury need not agree on one of the alternative statutory theories of premeditated or felony murder is not unconstitutional.  Pp.  501 U. S. 630-645. 
Page 501 U. S. 625

(a) The relevant enquiry is not, as Schad argues, whether the Constitution requires a unanimous jury in state capital cases.  Rather, the real question here is whether it was constitutionally acceptable to permit the jury to reach one verdict based on any combination of the alternative findings.  Pp.  501 U. S. 630-631.
(b) The long-established rule that a jury need not agree on which overt act, among several, was the means by which a crime was committed provides a useful analogy.  Nevertheless, the Due Process Clause does place limits on a State's capacity to define different states of mind as merely alternative means of committing a single offense; there is a point at which differences between those means become so important that they may not reasonably be viewed as alternatives to a common end, but must be treated as differentiating between what the Constitution requires to be treated as separate offenses subject to separate jury findings.  Pp.  501 U. S. 631-637.
(c) It is impossible to lay down any single test for determining when two means are so disparate as to exemplify two inherently separate offenses.  Instead, the concept of due process, with its demands for fundamental fairness and for the rationality that is an essential component of that fairness, must serve as the measurement of the level of definitional and verdict specificity permitted by the Constitution.  Pp.  501 U. S. 637-638.
(d) The relevant enquiry must be undertaken with a threshold presumption of legislative competence.  Decisions about what facts are material and what are immaterial, or, in terms of In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,  397 U. S. 364, what ""fact[s] [are] necessary to constitute the crime,"" and therefore must be proved individually, and what facts are mere means, represent value choices more appropriately made in the first instance by a legislature than by a court.  There is support for such restraint in this Court's ""burden-shifting"" cases, which have made clear, in a slightly different context, that the States must be permitted a degree of flexibility in determining what facts are necessary to constitute a particular offense within the meaning of Winship. See, e.g., Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197,  432 U. S. 201-202,  432 U. S. 210.  Pp.  501 U. S. 638-639.
(e) In translating the due process demands for fairness and rationality into concrete judgments about the adequacy of legislative determinations, courts should look both to history and widely shared state practice as guides to fundamental values.  See, e.g., id. at  432 U. S. 202.  Thus it is significant here that Arizona's equation of the mental states of premeditated and felony murder as a species of the blameworthy state of mind required to prove a single offense of first-degree murder finds substantial historical and contemporary echoes.  See, e.g., People v. Sullivan, 173 N.Y. 122, 127, 65 N.E. 989, 989-990; State v. Buckman, 237 Neb. 936, 468 N.W.2d 589.  Pp.  501 U. S. 640-643. 
Page 501 U. S. 626

(f) Whether or not everyone would agree that the mental state that precipitates death in the course of robbery is the moral equivalent of premeditation, it is clear that such equivalence could reasonably be found.  See Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137,  481 U. S. 157-158.  This is enough to rule out the argument that a moral disparity bars treating the two mental states as alternative means to satisfy the mental element of a single offense.  Pp.  501 U. S. 643-644.
(g) Although the foregoing considerations may not exhaust the universe of those potentially relevant, they are sufficiently persuasive that the jury's options in this case did not fall beyond the constitutional bounds of fundamental fairness and rationality.  P.  501 U. S. 645.
JUSTICE SCALIA would reach the same result as the plurality with respect to Schad's verdict-specificity claim, but for a different reason.  It has long been the general rule that, when a single crime can be committed in various ways, jurors need not agree upon the mode of commission.  As the plurality observes, one can conceive of novel ""umbrella"" crimes that could not, consistent with due process, be submitted to a jury on disparate theories.  But first-degree murder, which has in its basic form existed in our legal system for centuries, does not fall into that category.  Such a traditional crime, and a traditional mode of submitting it to the jury, do not need to pass this Court's ""fundamental fairness"" analysis; and the plurality provides no persuasive justification other than history, in any event.  Pp.  501 U. S. 648-652.

Syllabus 
During 1979 through 1981, plaintiff-respondents purchased units in seven Connecticut limited partnerships, with the expectation of realizing federal income tax benefits.  Among other things, petitioner, a New Jersey law firm, aided in organizing the partnerships and prepared opinion letters addressing the tax consequences of investing.  The partnerships failed, and, subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the claimed tax benefits.  In 1986 and 1987, plaintiff-respondents filed complaints in the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon, alleging that they were induced to invest in the partnerships by misrepresentations in offering memoranda prepared by petitioner and others, in violation of, inter alia,  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5, and asserting that they became aware of the alleged misrepresentations only in 1985.  The court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the complaints were not timely filed, ruling that the claims were governed by Oregon's 2-year limitations period for fraud claims, the most analogous forum state statute; that plaintiff-respondents had been on notice of the possibility of fraud as early as 1982; and that there were no grounds sufficient to toll the statute of limitations.  The Court of Appeals also selected Oregon's limitations period, but reversed, finding that there were unresolved factual issues as to when plaintiff-respondents should have discovered the alleged fraud.
Held:  The judgment is reversed.
895 F.2d 1416, 1417, and 1418, reversed.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-B, II-C, III, and IV, concluding that:
1. Litigation instituted pursuant to  10(b) and Rule 10b-5 must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation, as provided in the 1934 Act and the Securities Act of 1933.  State borrowing principles should not be applied where, as here, the claim asserted is one implied under a statute also containing an express cause of action with its own time limitation.  The 1934 Act contemporaneously enacted a number of express remedial provisions actually designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake in this litigation.  And the limitations periods in all but one of its causes of action include some variation 
Page 501 U. S. 351
 of a 1-year period after discovery combined with a 3-year period of repose.  Moreover, in adopting the 1934 Act, Congress also amended the 1933 Act, adopting the same structure for each of its causes of action.  Neither the 5-year period contained in the 1934 Act's insider trading provision, which was added in 1988, nor state law fraud provides a closer analogy to  10(b).  Pp.  501 U. S. 358-362.
2. The limitations period is not subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.  The 1-year period begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation, making tolling unnecessary, and the 3-year limit is a period of repose inconsistent with tolling.  P.  501 U. S. 363.
3. As there is no dispute that the earliest of plaintiff-respondents complaints was filed more than three years after petitioner's alleged misrepresentations, plaintiff-respondents' claims were untimely.  P.  501 U. S. 364.

2. The limitations period is not subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.  The 1-year period begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation, making tolling unnecessary, and the 3-year limit is a period of repose inconsistent with tolling.  P.  501 U. S. 363.
3. As there is no dispute that the earliest of plaintiff-respondents complaints was filed more than three years after petitioner's alleged misrepresentations, plaintiff-respondents' claims were untimely.  P.  501 U. S. 364.

501 U.S. 380

Syllabus 
The Louisiana Supreme Court consists of seven members, two of whom are elected at-large from one multi-member district, with the remainder elected from single-member districts.  Petitioners in No. 90-757 represent a class of black registered voters in Orleans Parish, which is the largest of the four parishes in the multi-member district and contains about half of the district's registered voters.  Although more than one-half of Orleans Parish's registered voters are black, over three-fourths of the voters in the other three parishes are white.  Petitioners filed an action in the District Court against respondents, the Governor and state officials, alleging that the method of electing justices from their district impermissibly dilutes minority voting strength in violation of, inter alia,  2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  As amended in 1982,  2(a) prohibits the imposition of a voting qualification or prerequisite or standard, practice, or procedure that ""results in a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote on account of race or color,"" and  2(b) states that the test for determining the legality of such a practice is whether, ""based on the totality of circumstances,"" minority voters
""have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.""
(Emphasis added.)  The United States, petitioner in No. 90-1032, subsequently intervened to support petitioners' claims, and the District Court ultimately ruled against petitioners on the merits.  However, the Court of Appeals finally remanded the case with directions to dismiss the complaint in light of its earlier en banc decision in League of United Latin American Citizens Council No. 444 v. Clements, 914 F.2d 620 (LULAC), that judicial elections are not covered under  2 of the Act as amended.  There, the court distinguished between claims involving the opportunity to participate in the political process and claims involving the opportunity to elect representatives of minority voters' choice, holding that  2 applied to judicial elections with respect to claims in the first category, but that, 
Page 501 U. S. 381
 because judges are not ""representatives,"" the use of that term excludes judicial elections from claims in the second category.
Held:  Judicial elections are covered by  2 as amended.  Pp.  501 U. S. 391-404.
(a) As originally enacted,  2 was coextensive with the Fifteenth Amendment, and it is undisputed that it applied to judicial elections.  The 1982 amendment expanded  2's protection by adopting a results test, thus eliminating the requirement that proof of discriminatory intent is necessary to prove a  2 violation, and by adding  2(b), which provides guidance about how to apply that test.  Had Congress also intended to exclude judicial elections, it would have made its intent explicit in the statute or identified or mentioned it in the amendment's unusually extensive legislative history.  Pp.  501 U. S. 391-396.
(b) The results test is applicable to all  2 claims.  The statutory text and this Court's cases foreclose LULAC's reading of  2.  If the word ""representatives"" placed a limit on  2's coverage for judicial elections, it would exclude all claims involving such elections, for the statute requires that all claims must allege an abridgement of the opportunity both to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of one's choice.  Thus, rather than creating two separate and distinct rights, the statute identifies two inextricably linked elements of a plaintiff's burden of proof.  See, e.g., White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755.  Pp.  501 U. S. 396-398.
(c) The word ""representatives"" describes the winners of representative, popular elections, including elected judges.  Although LULAC correctly noted that judges need not be elected, when they are, it seems both reasonable and realistic to characterize the winners as representatives of the districts in which they reside and run.  The legislative history provides no support for the arguments that the term ""representatives"" includes only legislative and executive officials, or that Congress would have chosen the word ""candidates"" had it intended to apply the vote dilution prohibition to judicial elections.  Pp.  501 U. S. 398-401.
(d) Adopting respondents' view of coverage would lead to the anomalous result that a State covered by  5 of the Act would be precluded from implementing a new voting procedure having discriminatory effects with respect to judicial elections, Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, but a similarly discriminatory system already in place could not be challenged under  2.  P.  501 U. S. 401-402.
(e) That the one-person, one-vote rule is inapplicable to judicial elections, Wells v. Edwards, 409 U. S. 1095, does not mean that judicial elections are entirely immune from vote dilution claims.  Wells rejected a constitutional claim and, thus, has no relevance to a correct interpretation of this statute, which was enacted to provide additional protection

 for voting rights not adequately protected by the Constitution itself.  Cf. City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156,  446 U. S. 172-183.  Pp.  501 U. S. 402-403.

Syllabus 
Texas district courts are the State's trial courts of general jurisdiction.  Their judges are elected from electoral districts consisting of one or more entire counties.  The number of judges in each district varies, but each is elected by voters in the district in which he or she sits, pursuant to an at-large, district-wide scheme, and must be a resident of that district.  Although several judicial candidates in the same district may be running in the same election, each runs for a separately numbered position.  In the primary, the winner must receive a majority of votes, but in the general election, the candidate with the highest number of votes for a particular numbered position is elected.  Petitioners in No. 90974, local chapters of the League of United Latin American Citizens -- an organization composed of Mexican-American and African-American Texas residents and others -- filed suit in the District Court against respondents, the State Attorney General and other officials, alleging that the electoral scheme in 10 counties diluted the voting strength of African-American and Hispanic voters in violation of, inter alia,  2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Petitioners in No. 90-81 -- the Houston Lawyers' Association, an organization of African-American attorneys registered to vote in one of the 10 counties, and others -- intervened in support of the original plaintiffs.  The District Court ruled in petitioners' favor and granted interim relief for the 1990 election.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that judicial elections are not covered by  2.  A separate opinion concurring in the judgment agreed that elections for single-member offices, such as the district judgeships, are exempt from  2.  According to that opinion, a district court judge, unlike an appellate judge who acts as a member of a collegial body, is a single-office holder who has jurisdiction that is coextensive with the geographic area from which he or she is elected, and has authority to render final decisions independently of other judges serving in the same area or on the same court.  The concurrence concluded that exemption from  2 of elections for district judges is justified, 
Page 501 U. S. 420
 given the State's compelling interest in linking jurisdiction and elective base for judges acting alone, and given the risk that attempting to break that linkage might lessen minority influence by making only a few judges principally accountable to the minority electorate, rather than making all of them partly accountable to minority voters.
Held:  The Act's coverage encompasses the election of executive officers and trial judges whose responsibilities are exercised independently in an area coextensive with the districts from which they are elected.  Once a State decides to elect its trial judges, those elections must be conducted in compliance with the Act, since judicial elections are not categorically excluded from coverage.  Chisom v. Roemer, ante, p.  501 U. S. 380.  The state interest expressed in the concurring opinion below does not justify excluding single-member offices from  2's coverage.  Rather, it is a legitimate factor to be considered by courts in determining whether, based on the ""totality of circumstances,"" a vote dilution violation has occurred or may be remedied.

No. 89-1717
Argued Feb. 26, 1991
Decided June 20, 1991
501 U.S. 419

Syllabus 
As part of a drug interdiction effort, Broward County Sheriff's Department officers routinely board buses at scheduled stops and ask passengers for permission to search their luggage.  Two officers boarded respondent Bostick's bus and, without articulable suspicion, questioned him and requested his consent to search his luggage for drugs, advising him of his right to refuse.  He gave his permission, and the officers, after finding cocaine, arrested Bostick on drug trafficking charges.  His motion to suppress the cocaine on the ground that it had been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was denied by the trial court.  The Florida Court of Appeal affirmed, but certified a question to the State Supreme Court.  That court, reasoning that a reasonable passenger would not have felt free to leave the bus to avoid questioning by the police, adopted a per se rule that the sheriff's practice of ""working the buses"" is unconstitutional.
Held:
1. The Florida Supreme Court erred in adopting a per se rule that every encounter on a bus is a seizure.  The appropriate test is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, a reasonable passenger would feel free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.  Pp.  501 U. S. 433-437.
(a) A consensual encounter does not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny.  See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1,  392 U. S. 19, n. 16.  Even when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may generally ask the individual questions, Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U. S. 1,  469 U. S. 5-6, ask to examine identification, INS v. Delgdo, 466 U. S. 210,  466 U. S. 216, and request consent to search luggage, Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491,  460 U. S. 501, provided they do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required.  Thus, there is no doubt that, if this same encounter had taken place before Bostick boarded the bus or in the bus terminal, it would not be a seizure.  Pp.  501 U. S. 434-435.
(b) That this encounter took place on a bus is but one relevant factor in determining whether or not it was of a coercive nature.  The state court erred in focusing on the ""free to leave"" language of Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U. S. 567,  486 U. S. 573, rather than on the principle that those words were intended to capture.  This inquiry is not an accurate measure of an encounter's coercive effect when a person is seated on a bus about to depart, has no desire to leave, and would not feel free to leave 
Page 501 U. S. 430
 even if there were no police present.  The more appropriate inquiry is whether a reasonable passenger would feel free to decline the officers' request or otherwise terminate the encounter.  Thus, this case is analytically indistinguishable from INS v. Delgado, supra.  There, no seizure occurred when INS agents visited factories at random, stationing some agents at exits while others questioned workers, because, even though workers were not free to leave without being questioned, the agents' conduct gave them no reason to believe that they would be detained if they answered truthfully or refused to answer.  Such a refusal, alone, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for detention or seizure.  Id. at  466 U. S. 216-217.  Pp.  501 U. S. 435-437.
2. This case is remanded for the Florida courts to evaluate the seizure question under the correct legal standard.  The trial court made no express findings of fact, and the State Supreme Court rested its decision on a single fact -- that the encounter took place on a bus -- rather than on the totality of the circumstances.  Rejected, however, is Bostick's argument that he must have been seized because no reasonable person would freely consent to a search of luggage containing drugs, since the ""reasonable person"" test presumes an innocent person.  Pp.  501 U. S. 437-440.

Syllabus 
Article V,  26 of the Missouri Constitution provides a mandatory retirement age of 70 for most state judges.  Petitioners, judges subject to  26, were appointed by the Governor and subsequently were retained in office by means of retention elections in which they ran unopposed, subject only to a ""yes or no"" vote.  Along with other state judges, they filed suit against respondent Governor, alleging that  26 violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court granted the Governor's motion to dismiss, ruling that there was no ADEA violation because Missouri's appointed judges are not covered ""employees"" within the Act's terms, and that there was no equal protection violation because there is a rational basis for the distinction between judges and other state officials, to whom no mandatory retirement age applies.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Missouri's mandatory retirement requirement for judges does not violate the ADEA.  Pp.  501 U. S. 456-470.
(a) The authority of a State's people to determine the qualifications of their most important government officials lies ""at the heart of representative government,"" and is reserved under the Tenth Amendment and guaranteed by the Guarantee Clause of Article IV,  4.  See, e.g., Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634,  413 U. S. 648.  Because congressional interference with the Missouri people's decision to establish a qualification for their judges would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers, Congress must make its intention to do so ""unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.""  See, e.g., Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58,  491 U. S. 65.  Moreover, where Congress acts pursuant to its Commerce Clause power -- as it did in extending the ADEA to the States, see EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 -- the authority of a State's people to determine their government officials' qualifications may be inviolate.  Application of the Will plain statement rule to determine whether Congress intended the ADEA to apply to state judges may help the Court to avoid a potential constitutional problem.  Pp.  501 U. S. 457-464. 
Page 501 U. S. 453

(b) Appointed state judges are not covered by the ADEA.  When it extended the Act's substantive provisions to include the States as employers, Congress redefined ""employee"" to exclude all elected and most high-ranking state officials, including ""appointee[s] on the policymaking level.""  It is at least ambiguous whether a state judge is such an appointee.  Regardless of whether the judge might be considered to make policy in the same sense as executive officials and legislators, the judge certainly is in a position requiring the exercise of discretion concerning issues of public importance, and therefore might be said to be ""on the policymaking level.""  Thus, it cannot be concluded that the ADEA ""makes unmistakably clear,"" Will, supra, 491 U.S. at  491 U. S. 65, that appointed state judges are covered.  Pp.  501 U. S. 464-467.
(c) Even if Congress acted pursuant to its enforcement powers under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, in addition to its Commerce Clause powers, when it extended the ADEA to state employment, the ambiguity in the Act's ""employee"" definition precludes this Court from attributing to Congress an intent to cover appointed state judges.  Although, in EEOC v. Wyoming, supra, 460 U.S. at  460 U. S. 243, and n. 18, the Court noted that the federalism principles constraining Congress' exercise of its Commerce Clause powers are attenuated when it acts pursuant to its  5 powers, the Court's political function cases demonstrate that the Fourteenth Amendment does not override all such principles, see, e.g., Sugarman, supra, 413 U.S. at  413 U. S. 648.  Of particular relevance here is Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,  451 U. S. 16, in which the Court established that it will not attribute to Congress an unstated intent to intrude on traditional state authority in the exercise of its  5 powers.  That rule looks much like the plain statement rule applied supra, and pertains here in the face of the statutory ambiguity.  Pp.  501 U. S. 467-470.
2. Missouri's mandatory retirement provision does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Pp.  501 U. S. 470-473.
(a) Petitioners correctly assert their challenge at the rational basis level, since age is not a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause, and since they do not claim that they have a fundamental interest in serving as judges.  See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley, 440 U. S. 93,  440 U. S. 97.  In such circumstances, this Court will not overturn a state constitutional provision unless varying treatment of different groups is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that it can only be concluded that the people's actions in approving it were irrational.  Ibid.  P.  501 U. S. 470-471.
(b) The Missouri people rationally could conclude that the threat of deterioration at age 70 is sufficiently great, and the alternatives for removal from office sufficiently inadequate, that they will require all judges to step aside at that age.  Because it is an unfortunate fact of life 
Page 501 U. S. 454
 that physical and mental capacity sometimes diminish with age, the people may wish to replace some older judges in order to satisfy the legitimate, indeed compelling, public interest in maintaining a judiciary fully capable of performing judges' demanding tasks.  Although most judges probably do not suffer significant deterioration at age 70, the people could reasonably conceive the basis for the classification to be true.  See Bradley, supra, 440 U.S. at  440 U. S. 111.  Voluntary retirement will not always be sufficient to serve acceptably the goal of a fully functioning judiciary, nor may impeachment, with its public humiliation and elaborate procedural machinery.  The election process may also be inadequate, since most voters never observe judges in action nor read their opinions; since state judges serve longer terms than other officials, making them -- deliberately -- less dependent on the people's will; and since infrequent retention elections may not serve as an adequate check on judges whose performance is deficient.  That other state officials are not subject to mandatory retirement is rationally explained by the facts that their performance is subject to greater public scrutiny, that they are subject to more standard elections, that deterioration in their performance is more readily discernible, and that they are more easily removed than judges.  Pp.  501 U. S. 471-473.

No. 89-1799
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided June 20, 1991
501 U.S. 496

Syllabus 
Petitioner Masson, a psychoanalyst, became disillusioned with Freudian psychology while serving as Projects Director of the Sigmund Freud Archives, and was fired after advancing his own theories.  Thereafter, respondent Malcolm, an author and contributor to respondent The New Yorker, a magazine, taped several interviews with Masson and wrote a lengthy article on his relationship with the Archives.  One of Malcolm's narrative devices consists of enclosing lengthy passages attributed to Masson in quotation marks.  Masson allegedly expressed alarm about several errors in those passages before the article was published.  After its publication, and with knowledge of Masson's allegations that it contained defamatory material, respondent Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., published the work as a book, which portrayed Masson in a most unflattering light.  He brought an action for libel under California law in the Federal District Court, concentrating on passages alleged to be defamatory, six of which are before this Court.  In each instance, the quoted statement does not appear in the taped interviews.  The parties dispute whether there were additional untaped interviews, the notes from which Malcolm allegedly transcribed.  The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.  It concluded that the alleged inaccuracies were substantially true or were rational interpretations of ambiguous conversations, and therefore did not raise a jury question of actual malice, which is required when libel is alleged by a public figure.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.   The court found, among other things, that one passage -- in which Masson was quoted as saying that Archive officials had considered him an ""intellectual gigolo"" while the tape showed that he said he ""was much too junior within the hierarchy of analysis for these important . . . analysts to be caught dead with [him]"" -- was not defamatory, and would not be actionable under the ""incremental harm"" doctrine.
Held:
1. The evidence presents a jury question whether Malcolm acted with requisite knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of five of the passages.  Pp.  501 U. S. 509-525.
(a) As relevant here, the First Amendment limits California's libel law by requiring that a public figure prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant published the defamatory statement with 
Page 501 U. S. 497
 actual malice.  However, in place of the term actual malice, it is better practice that jury instructions refer to publication of a statement with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth or falsity.  Pp.  501 U. S. 509-511.
(b) A trier of fact in this case could find that the reasonable reader would understand the quotations attributed to Masson to be nearly verbatim reports of his statements.  In general, quotation marks indicate a verbatim reproduction, and quotations add authority to a statement and credibility to an author's work.  A fabricated quotation may injure reputation by attributing an untrue factual assertion to the speaker, or by indicating a negative personal trait or an attitude the speaker does not hold.  While some quotations do not convey that the speaker actually said or wrote the quoted material, such is not the case here.  Malcolm's work gives the reader no clue that the quotations are anything but the reproductions of actual conversations, and the work was published in a magazine that enjoyed a reputation for scrupulous factual inquiry.  These factors could lead a reader to take the quotations at face value.  Pp.  501 U. S. 511-513.
(c) The common law of libel overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth.  Thus, a deliberate alteration of a plaintiff's words does not equate with knowledge of falsity for purposes of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254,  376 U. S. 279-280, and Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323,  418 U. S. 342, unless it results in a material change in the statement's meaning.  While the use of quotations to attribute words not in fact spoken is important to that inquiry, the idea that any alteration beyond correction of grammar or syntax by itself proves falsity is rejected.  Even if a statement has been recorded, the existence of both a speaker and a reporter, the translation between two media, the addition of punctuation, and the practical necessity to edit and make intelligible a speakers' perhaps rambling comments, make it misleading to suggest that a quotation will be reconstructed with complete accuracy.  However, if alterations give a different meaning to a speaker's statements, bearing upon their defamatory character, then the device of quotations might well be critical in finding the words actionable.  Pp.  501 U. S. 513-518.
(d) Although the Court of Appeals applied a test of substantial truth, it erred in going one step further and concluding that an altered quotation is protected so long as it is a ""rational interpretation"" of the actual statement.  The protection for rational interpretation serves First Amendment principle by allowing an author the interpretive license that is necessary when relying upon ambiguous sources; but where a writer uses a quotation that a reasonable reader would conclude purports to be a verbatim repetition of the speaker's statement, the quotation 
Page 501 U. S. 498
 marks indicate that the author is not interpreting the speaker's ambiguous statement, but is attempting to convey what the speaker said.  Time, Inc. v. Pape, 401 U. S. 279; Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, distinguished.  Pp.  501 U. S. 518-520.
(e) In determining whether Masson has shown sufficient falsification to survive summary judgment, it must be assumed, except where otherwise evidenced by the tape recordings' transcripts, that he is correct in denying that he made the statements Malcolm attributed to him, and that Malcolm reported with knowledge or reckless disregard of the differences between what he said and what was quoted.  Malcolm's typewritten notes should not be considered, since Masson denied making the statements, and since the record contains substantial additional evidence to support a jury determination under a clear and convincing evidence standard that Malcolm deliberately or recklessly altered the quotations.  While she contests Masson's allegations, only a trial on the merits will resolve the factual dispute.  Pp.  501 U. S. 520-521.
(f) Five of the six published passages differ materially in meaning from the tape recorded statements so as to create an issue of fact for a jury as to falsity.  Whether the ""intellectual gigolo"" passage is defamatory is a question of California law, and to the extent that the Court of Appeals based its conclusion on the First Amendment, it was mistaken.  Moreover, an ""incremental harm"" doctrine -- which measures the incremental reputational harm inflicted by the challenged statements beyond the harm imposed by the nonactionable remainder of the publication -- is not compelled as a matter of First Amendment protection for speech, since it does not bear on whether a defendant has published a statement with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.  Pp.  501 U. S. 521-525.
2. On remand, the Court of Appeals should consider Masson's argument that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the New Yorker Magazine, Inc., and Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., on the basis of their respective relations with Malcolm or the lack of any independent actual malice, since the court failed to reach his argument because of its disposition with respect to Malcolm.

Syllabus 
Before 1985, Georgia law imposed an excise tax on imported liquor at a rate double that imposed on liquor manufactured from Georgia-grown products.  In 1984, this Court, in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, held that a similar Hawaii law violated the Commerce Clause.  Petitioner, a manufacturer of Kentucky Bourbon, thereafter filed an action in Georgia state court, seeking a refund of taxes it paid under Georgia's law for 1982, 1983, and 1984.  The court declared the statute unconstitutional, but refused to apply its ruling retroactively, relying on Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97, which held that a decision will be applied prospectively where it displaces a principle of law on which reliance may reasonably have been placed, and where prospectivity is, on balance, warranted by its effect on the operation of the new rule and by the inequities that might otherwise result from retroactive application.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
259 Ga. 363, 382 S.E.2d 95 (Ga.1989), reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that, once this Court has applied a rule of law to the litigants in one case, it must do so with respect to all others not barred by procedural requirements or res judicata.  Pp.  501 U. S. 534-544.
(a) Whether a new rule should apply retroactively is in the first instance a matter of choice of law, to which question there are three possible answers.  The first and normal practice is to make a decision fully retroactive.  Second, there is the purely prospective method of overruling, where the particular case is decided under the old law but announces the new, effective with respect to all conduct occurring after the date of that decision.  Finally, the new rule could be applied in the case in which it is pronounced, but then return to the old one with respect to all others arising on facts predating the pronouncement.  The possibility of such modified, or selective, prospectivity was abandoned in the criminal context in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314.  Pp.  501 U. S. 534-538.
(b) Because Bacchus did not reserve the question, and remanded the case for consideration of remedial issues, it is properly understood to have followed the normal practice of applying its rule retroactively to the litigants there before the Court.  Pp.  501 U. S. 540. 
Page 501 U. S. 530

(c) Because Bacchus thus applied its own rule, principles of equality and stare decisis require that it be applied to the litigants in this case.  Griffith's equality principle, that similarly situated litigants should be treated the same, applies equally well in the civil context as in the criminal.  Of course, retroactivity is limited by the need for finality, since equality for those whose claims have been adjudicated could only be purchased at the expense of the principle that there be an end of litigation. I n contrast, parties, such as petitioner, who wait to litigate until after others have labored to create a new rule, are merely asserting a right that is theirs in law, is not being applied on a prospective basis only, and is not otherwise barred by state procedural requirements.  Modified prospectivity rejected, a new rule may not be retroactively applied to some litigants when it is not applied to others.  This necessarily limits the application of the Chevron Oil test, to the effect that it may not distinguish between litigants for choice-of-law purposes on the particular equities of their claims to prospectivity.  It is the nature of precedent that the substantive law will not shift and spring on such a basis.  Pp.  501 U. S. 540-544.
(d) This opinion does not speculate as to the bounds or propriety of pure prospectivity.  Nor does it determine the appropriate remedy in this case, since remedial issues were neither considered below nor argued to this Court.  P.  501 U. S. 544.
JUSTICE WHITE concluded that, under any one of several suppositions, the opinion in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, may reasonably read to extend the benefits of the judgment in that case to Bacchus Imports, and that petitioner here should also have the benefit of Bacchus.  If the Court in Bacchus thought that its decision was not a new rule, there would be no doubt that it would be retroactive to all similarly situated litigants.  The Court in that case may also have thought that retroactivity was proper under the factors set forth in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S. 97.  And even if the Court was wrong in applying Bacchus retroactively, there is no precedent in civil cases for applying a new rule to the parties of the case, but not to others.  Moreover, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314,  479 U. S. 328, has overruled such a practice in criminal cases, and should be followed on the basis of stare decisis.  However, the propriety of pure prospectivity is settled in this Court's prior cases, see, e.g., Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S. 701,  395 U. S. 706, which recognize that, in proper cases, a new rule announced by the Court will not be applied retroactively, even to the parties before the Court.  To allow for the possibility of speculation as to the propriety of such prospectivity is to suggest that there may come a time when this Court's precedents on the issue will be overturned.  Pp.  501 U. S. 544-547. 
Page 501 U. S. 531

JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that prospectivity, whether ""selective"" or ""pure,"" breaches the Court's obligation to discharge its constitutional function in articulating new rules for decision, which must comport with its duty to decide only cases and controversies.  Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314.  The nature of judicial review constrains the Court to require retroactive application of each new rule announced.  Pp.  501 U. S. 547-548.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN, while agreeing with JUSTICE SOUTER's conclusion, disagreed that the issue is one of choice of law, and concluded that both selective and pure prospectivity are impermissible, not for reasons of equity, but because they are not permitted by the Constitution.  To allow the Judiciary powers greater than those conferred by the Constitution, as the fundamental nature of those powers was understood when the Constitution was enacted, would upset the division of federal powers central to the constitutional scheme.

No. 109, Orig.
Argued April 16, 1991
Decided June 17, 1991
501 U.S. 221

Syllabus 
The Canadian River flows through New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle before entering Oklahoma.  Its waters are apportioned among these States by the Canadian River Compact.  Article IV(a) of the Compact gives New Mexico free and unrestricted use of all waters ""originating"" in the river's drainage basin above Conchas Dam -- a structure that predates the Compact and provides water to the Tucumcari Project, a federal reclamation project -- and IV(b) gives it free and unrestricted use of waters ""originating"" in the river's drainage basin below that dam, limiting the ""conservation storage"" for impounding those waters to 200,000 acre-feet.  In 1963, New Mexico constructed Ute Dam and Reservoir downstream from Conchas Dam.  In 1984, Ute Reservoir was enlarged, giving it a storage capacity of 272,800 acre-feet, which has been reduced to about 237,900 feet because of silting.  Oklahoma and Texas filed this litigation, contending that Article IV(b)'s limitation is imposed on reservoir capacity available for conservation, and that capacity for the so-called ""desilting pool"" portion of Ute Reservoir was not exempt from that limitation because it was not allocated solely to ""sediment control.""  In 1987, while the case was pending, the river above Conchas Dam flooded, spilling over that dam, and Ute Reservoir caught a sufficient amount of spill waters to exceed 200,000 acre-feet.  When New Mexico refused to count the spill waters for purposes of the limitation, Texas and Oklahoma filed a supplemental complaint, claiming that, if the limitation applies to actual stored water, then water spilling over Conchas Dam or seeping back from Tucumcari Project constitutes waters originating below Conchas Dam under Article IV(b).  As relevant here, the Special Master's Report recommended that (1) Article IV(b) imposes a limitation on stored water, not physical reservoir capacity (Part VI of the Report); (2) water originating in the river basin above Conchas Dam but reaching the river's mainstream below that dam as a result of spills or releases from the dam or seepage and return flow from Tucumcari Project are subject to the Article IV(b) limitation (Part VII); (3) the issue whether and to what extent the water in Ute Reservoir's ""desilting pool"" should be exempt from the Article IV(b) limitation should be referred to the Canadian River Compact Commission for negotiations and possible resolution (Part VIII); and (4) if the recommendations are approved, New Mexico will have been in violation of Article IV(b) since 1987, and the 
Page 501 U. S. 222
 case should be returned to the Special Master for determination of any injury to Oklahoma and Texas and recommendations for appropriate relief.  The States have filed exceptions.
Held:
1. Oklahoma's exception to the recommendation in Part VI of the Master's Report is overruled.  Nothing on the Compact's face indicates a clear intention to base New Mexico's limitation on available reservoir capacity when Texas' limitation is based on stored water.  Early drafts uniformly referred to stored water, and the contemporaneous memoranda and statements of compact commissioners and their staffs do not explain why a change to ""storage capacity"" was made in the final draft, although it is most probable the terms were being used loosely and interchangeably.  Pp.  501 U. S. 229-231.
2. Also overruled are New Mexico's exceptions to the recommendation in Part VII of the Report.  New Mexico errs in arguing that the term ""originating"" is unambiguous, and that there are no restrictions on the impoundment of the spill waters, since they are waters originating above Conchas Dam, to which the State has free and unrestricted use under Article IV(a).  Rather, the Special Master correctly concluded that the Compact's drafters intended in Article IV(a) to give New Mexico free and unrestricted use of waters ""originating"" in the river's drainage basin above Conchas Dam only if the waters were stored, used, or diverted for use at or above Conchas Dam.  There is substantial evidence that, in drafting the Compact, Texas and Oklahoma agreed that storage limits were not necessary for waters above Conchas Dam because the waters in that basin had been fully developed, that any future water development would necessarily occur below that dam, and that 200,000 acre-feet of storage rights would satisfy all of New Mexico's future needs below the dam.  The Compact's ambiguous use of the term ""originating"" can be harmonized with the drafters' apparent intent only if it is interpreted so that waters spilling over or released from Conchas Dam, or returned from Tucumcari Project, are considered waters originating below Conchas Dam.  Thus, any water stored in excess of the 200,000 acre-feet limit should have been allowed to flow through Ute Dam for use by the downstream States, rather than being impounded by New Mexico.  Pp.  501 U. S. 231-240.
3. Texas' and Oklahoma's exception to the recommendation in Part VIII of the Report is sustained insofar as those States argue that the ""desilting pool"" issue should not be referred to the Commission.  There was no legal basis for the Master's refusing to decide whether the water in the desilting pool should be counted towards the Article IV(b) limitation, since a dispute clearly exists in this case, and since there is no claim that the issue has not been properly presented.  Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546.  Thus, the matter must be remanded to the Master for such further proceedings as may be necessary and a recommendation on the merits.  Pp.  501 U. S. 240-241.

No. 90-906
Argued April 19, 1991
Decided June 17, 1991
501 U.S. 252

Syllabus 
An Act of Congress (hereinafter the Transfer Act) authorized the transfer of operating control of Washington National Airport (National) and Dulles International Airport (Dulles) from the federal Department of Transportation to petitioner Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which was created by a compact between Virginia and the District of Columbia.  Both airports are located in the Virginia suburbs of the District.  Dulles is larger than National, and lies in a rural area miles from the Capitol.  National is a much busier airport, due to the convenience of its location at the center of the metropolitan area, but its flight paths over densely populated areas have generated concern among residents about safety, noise, and pollution.  Because of congressional concern that surrender of federal control of the airports might result in the transfer of a significant amount of traffic from National to Dulles, the Transfer Act authorizes the MWAA's Board of Directors to create a Board of Review (Board).  The Board is to be composed of nine congressmen who serve on committees having jurisdiction over transportation issues, and who are to act ""in their individual capacities.""  The Board is vested with a variety of powers, including the authority to veto decisions made by MWAA's directors.  After the directors adopted bylaws providing for the Board, and Virginia and the District amended their legislation to give MWAA powers to establish the Board, the directors appointed the Board's nine members from lists submitted by Congress.  The directors then adopted a Master Plan providing for extensive new facilities at National, and the Board voted not to disapprove that Plan.  Subsequently, respondents -- individuals living along National flight paths and Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc. (CAAN), whose members include persons living along such paths, and whose purposes include the reduction of National operations and associated noise, safety, and air pollution problems -- brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the Board's veto power is unconstitutional.  Although ruling that respondents had standing to maintain the action, the District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that Congress' delegation of the 
Page 501 U. S. 253
 veto power to the Board violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.
Held:
1. Respondents have standing.  Accepting as true their claims that the Master Plan will result in increased noise, pollution, and accidents, they have alleged ""personal injury"" to themselves that is ""fairly traceable"" to the Board's veto power.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,  468 U. S. 751.  This is because knowledge that the Plan was subject to that power undoubtedly influenced MWAA's directors when they drew up the Plan.  Moreover, because invalidation of the veto power will prevent enactment of the Plan, the relief respondents have requested is ""likely to . . . redres[s]"" their alleged injury.  Ibid.

2. Congress' conditioning of the airports' transfer upon the creation of a Board of Review composed of congressmen and having veto power over the MWAA directors' decisions violates the separation of powers.  Pp.  501 U. S. 265-277.
(a) Petitioners argue incorrectly that this case does not raise any separation-of-powers issue because the Board is a state creation that neither exercises federal power nor acts as an agent of Congress.  An examination of the Board's origin and structure reveals an entity created at the initiative of Congress, the powers of which Congress has mandated in detail, the purpose of which is to protect an acknowledged federal interest in the efficient operation of airports vital to the smooth conduct of Government and congressional business, and membership in which is controlled by Congress and restricted to Members charged with authority over air transportation.  Such an entity necessarily exercises sufficient federal powers as an agent of Congress to mandate separation of powers scrutiny.  Any other conclusion would permit Congress to evade the Constitution's ""carefully crafted"" constraints, INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,  462 U. S. 959, simply by delegating primary responsibility for execution of national policy to the States, subject to the veto power of Members of Congress acting ""in their individual capacities.""  Cf. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714,  478 U. S. 755 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).  Nor is there merit to petitioners' contention that the Board should nevertheless be immune from scrutiny for constitutional defects because it was created in the course of Congress' exercise of its power to dispose of federal property under Article IV,  3, cl. 2.

(b) Congress has not followed a constitutionally acceptable procedure in delegating decisionmaking authority to the Board.  To forestall the danger of encroachment into the executive sphere, the Constitution imposes two basic and related constraints on Congress.  It may not invest itself, its Members, or its agents with executive power.  See, e.g., J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394,  276 U. S. 406; Bowsher, supra, 478 U.S. at  478 U. S. 726.  And when it exercises its legislative power, it must follow the ""single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedures"" specified in Article I.  Chadha, supra, 462 U.S. at  462 U. S. 951.  If the Board's power is considered to be executive, the Constitution does not permit an agent of Congress to exercise it.  However, if the power is considered to be legislative, Congress must, but has not, exercised it in conformity with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of Article I,  7.  Although Congress imposed its will on the MWAA by means that are unique and that might prove to be innocuous, the statutory scheme by which it did so provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power beyond its constitutionally defined role.

			"|"Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v.
Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc.
No. 90-906
Argued April 19, 1991
Decided June 17, 1991
501 U.S. 252

Syllabus 
An Act of Congress (hereinafter the Transfer Act) authorized the transfer of operating control of Washington National Airport (National) and Dulles International Airport (Dulles) from the federal Department of Transportation to petitioner Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which was created by a compact between Virginia and the District of Columbia.  Both airports are located in the Virginia suburbs of the District.  Dulles is larger than National, and lies in a rural area miles from the Capitol.  National is a much busier airport, due to the convenience of its location at the center of the metropolitan area, but its flight paths over densely populated areas have generated concern among residents about safety, noise, and pollution.  Because of congressional concern that surrender of federal control of the airports might result in the transfer of a significant amount of traffic from National to Dulles, the Transfer Act authorizes the MWAA's Board of Directors to create a Board of Review (Board).  The Board is to be composed of nine congressmen who serve on committees having jurisdiction over transportation issues, and who are to act ""in their individual capacities.""  The Board is vested with a variety of powers, including the authority to veto decisions made by MWAA's directors.  After the directors adopted bylaws providing for the Board, and Virginia and the District amended their legislation to give MWAA powers to establish the Board, the directors appointed the Board's nine members from lists submitted by Congress.  The directors then adopted a Master Plan providing for extensive new facilities at National, and the Board voted not to disapprove that Plan.  Subsequently, respondents -- individuals living along National flight paths and Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc. (CAAN), whose members include persons living along such paths, and whose purposes include the reduction of National operations and associated noise, safety, and air pollution problems -- brought this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the Board's veto power is unconstitutional.  Although ruling that respondents had standing to maintain the action, the District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that Congress' delegation of the 
Page 501 U. S. 253
 veto power to the Board violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.
Held:
1. Respondents have standing.  Accepting as true their claims that the Master Plan will result in increased noise, pollution, and accidents, they have alleged ""personal injury"" to themselves that is ""fairly traceable"" to the Board's veto power.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,  468 U. S. 751.  This is because knowledge that the Plan was subject to that power undoubtedly influenced MWAA's directors when they drew up the Plan.  Moreover, because invalidation of the veto power will prevent enactment of the Plan, the relief respondents have requested is ""likely to . . . redres[s]"" their alleged injury.  Ibid.  Furthermore, the harm they allege is not confined to the consequences of a possible increase in National activity, since the Board and the Master Plan injure CAAN by making it more difficult for it to fulfill its goal of reducing that activity.  Pp.  501 U. S. 264-265.
2. Congress' conditioning of the airports' transfer upon the creation of a Board of Review composed of congressmen and having veto power over the MWAA directors' decisions violates the separation of powers.  Pp.  501 U. S. 265-277.

No. 89-7376
Argued Jan. 7, 1991
Decided June 17, 1991
501 U.S. 294

Syllabus 
Petitioner Wilson, an Ohio prison inmate, filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against respondents, state prison officials, alleging that certain conditions of his confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  His affidavits described the challenged conditions and charged that the authorities, after notification, had failed to take remedial action.  The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents, and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground, inter alia, that the affidavits failed to establish the requisite culpable state of mind on the part of respondents.
Held:
1. A prisoner claiming that the conditions of his confinement violate the Eighth Amendment must show a culpable state of mind on the part of prison officials.  See, e.g., Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312,  475 U. S. 319.  Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, distinguished.  An intent requirement is implicit in that Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.  Wilson's suggested distinction between ""short-term"" or ""one-time"" prison conditions (in which a state of mind requirement would apply) and ""continuing"" or ""systemic"" conditions (where official state of mind would be irrelevant) is rejected.  Pp.  501 U. S. 296-302.
2. The ""deliberate indifference"" standard applied in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97,  429 U. S. 106, to claims involving medical care applies generally to prisoner challenges to conditions of confinement.  There is no merit to respondents' contention that that standard should be applied only in cases involving personal, physical injury, and that a malice standard is appropriate in cases challenging conditions.  As Whitley teaches, the ""wantonness"" of conduct depends not on its effect on the prisoner, but on the constraints facing the official.  Pp.  501 U. S. 302-304.
3. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to consider Wilson's claims under the ""deliberate indifference"" standard and applying instead a standard of ""behavior marked by persistent malicious cruelty.""  It is possible that the error was harmless, since the court said that Wilson's affidavits established ""[a]t best . . . negligence.""  Conceivably, however, the court would have reached a different disposition under the correct

501 U.S. 312

Syllabus 
Article II,  6(b) of the California Constitution prohibits political parties and party central committees from endorsing, supporting, or opposing candidates for nonpartisan offices such as county and city offices.  Based on  6(b), it is the policy of petitioners -- the City and County of San Francisco, its Board of Supervisors, and certain local officials -- to delete any reference to party endorsements from candidates' statements included in the voter pamphlets that petitioners print and distribute.  Respondents -- among whom are 10 registered voters in the city and county, including members of the local Republican and Democratic Central Committees -- filed suit seeking, inter alia, a declaration that  6(b) violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction preventing petitioners from editing candidate statements to delete references to party endorsements.  The District Court entered summary judgment for respondents, declaring  6(b) unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The question whether  6(b) violates the First Amendment is not justiciable in this case, since respondents have not demonstrated a live controversy ripe for resolution by the federal courts.  Pp.  501 U. S. 316-324.
(a) Although respondents have standing to claim that  6(b) has been applied in an unconstitutional manner to bar their own speech, the allegations in their complaint and affidavits raise serious questions about their standing to assert other claims.  In their capacity as voters, they only allege injury flowing from  6(b)'s application to prevent speech by candidates in the voter pamphlets.  There is reason to doubt that that injury can be redressed by a declaration of  6(b)'s invalidity or an injunction against its enforcement, since a separate California statute, the constitutionality of which was not litigated in this case, might well be construed to prevent candidates from mentioning party endorsements in voter pamphlets, even in the absence of  6(b).  Moreover, apart from the possibility of an overbreadth claim, discussed infra, the standing of respondent committee members to litigate based on injuries to their respective committees' rights is unsettled.  See Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534,  475 U. S. 543-545.  Nor is it clear, putting aside redressability concerns, that the committee 
Page 501 U. S. 313
 members have third-party standing to assert the rights of candidates, since no obvious barrier exists preventing candidates from asserting their own rights.  See Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400.  Pp.  501 U. S. 318-320.
(b) Respondents' allegations fail to demonstrate a live dispute involving the actual or threatened application of  6(b) to bar particular speech.  Their generalized claim that petitioners deleted party endorsements from candidate statements in past elections does not do so, since, so far as can be discerned from the record, those disputes had become moot by the time respondents filed suit.  Similarly, an allegation that the Democratic Committee has not endorsed candidates ""[i]n elections since 1986"" for fear of the consequences of violating  6(b) will not support a federal court action absent a contention that  6(b) prevented a particular endorsement, and that the controversy had not become moot prior to the litigation.  Nor can a ripe controversy be found in the fact that the Republican Committee endorsed candidates for nonpartisan elections in 1987, the year this suit was filed, since nothing in the record suggests that petitioners took any action to enforce  6(b) as a result of those endorsements, or that there was any desire or attempt to include the endorsements in the candidates' statements.  Allegations that respondents desire to endorse candidates in future elections also present no ripe controversy, absent a factual record of an actual or imminent application of  6(b) sufficient to present the constitutional issues in clean-cut and concrete form.  Indeed, the record contains no evidence of a credible threat that  6(b) will be enforced other than against candidates in the context of voter pamphlets.  In these circumstances, postponing adjudication until a more concrete controversy arises will not impose a substantial hardship on respondents, and will permit the state courts further opportunity to construe  6(b), perhaps, in the process, materially altering the questions to be decided.  Pp.  501 U. S. 320-323.
(c) Even if respondents' complaint may be read to assert a facial overbreadth challenge, the better course might have been to address in the first instance the constitutionality of  6(b) as applied in the context of voter pamphlets.  See, e.g., Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469,  492 U. S. 484-485.  If the as-applied challenge had been resolved first, the justiciability problems determining the disposition of this case might well have concluded the litigation at an earlier stage.  Pp.  501 U.

No. 89-7260
Argued Dec. 3, 1990
Decided June 13, 1991
501 U.S. 129

Syllabus 
A plea agreement with the Government recited that petitioner Burns would plead guilty to three counts and stated the parties' expectation that his sentence would fall within a particular offense-level/criminal-history range under the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines.  The probation officer, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, filed a presentence report in which he confirmed the parties' expectation that the sentencing range would be 30 to 37 months and concluded that there were no factors that would warrant departure from the Guidelines sentence.  Although neither party filed any objections to the report, the District Court announced, at the end of the sentencing hearing, that it was departing upward from the Guidelines range and, based upon three grounds, sentenced Burns to 60 months' imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence, concluding that, although subdivision (a)(1) of Rule 32 requires a district court to afford the parties ""an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer's determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence"" at the sentencing hearing, it would be inappropriate to impose on a district court a requirement that it notify the parties of its intent to make a sua sponte departure from the Guidelines in the absence of express language to that effect.
Held:  Before a district court can depart upward from the applicable Guidelines range on a ground not identified as a ground for such departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, Rule 32 requires that the court give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling, specifically identifying the ground for the departure.  Pp.  501 U. S. 132-139.
(a) In order to eliminate the unwarranted disparities and uncertainty associated with indeterminate sentencing under the preexisting system, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 requires district courts to determine sentences based on the various offense- and offender-related factors identified by the Guidelines.  Under the Act, a district court may disregard the Guidelines' mechanical dictates only upon finding an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately considered by the Commission.  The Act amended Rule 32 to assure focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues relevant to determining the

(b) The textual and contextual evidence of legislative intent indicates that Congress did not intend a district court to depart from the Guidelines sua sponte without first affording notice to the parties.  The Government's contrary reading renders meaningless the parties' express right under Rule 32(a)(1) to ""comment upon [relevant] matters,"" since the right to comment upon a departure has little reality or worth unless one is informed that a decision is contemplated.  The Government's reading is also inconsistent with Rule 32's purpose.  Under the Government's interpretation of Rule 32, a critical sentencing determination would go untested by the adversarial process in every case in which the parties, lacking notice, failed to anticipate an unannounced and uninvited departure by the district court from the Guidelines.  Furthermore, the meaning that the Government attaches to Congress' silence is contrary to decisions in which, despite the absence of express statutory language, this Court has construed statutes authorizing analogous deprivations of liberty or property to require that the Government give affected individuals both notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  See, e.g., American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90,  329 U. S. 107-108.  Since the Government's interpretation would require this Court to confront the serious question whether notice is mandated by the Due Process Clause, the Court will not construe Rule 32 to dispense with notice in this setting absent a clear statement of congressional intent to that effect.  See, e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building and Construction Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568,  485 U. S. 575.  Pp.  501 U. S. 135-138.

			"|"Burns v. United States
No. 89-7260
Argued Dec. 3, 1990
Decided June 13, 1991
501 U.S. 129

Syllabus 
A plea agreement with the Government recited that petitioner Burns would plead guilty to three counts and stated the parties' expectation that his sentence would fall within a particular offense-level/criminal-history range under the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines.  The probation officer, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, filed a presentence report in which he confirmed the parties' expectation that the sentencing range would be 30 to 37 months and concluded that there were no factors that would warrant departure from the Guidelines sentence.  Although neither party filed any objections to the report, the District Court announced, at the end of the sentencing hearing, that it was departing upward from the Guidelines range and, based upon three grounds, sentenced Burns to 60 months' imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence, concluding that, although subdivision (a)(1) of Rule 32 requires a district court to afford the parties ""an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer's determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence"" at the sentencing hearing, it would be inappropriate to impose on a district court a requirement that it notify the parties of its intent to make a sua sponte departure from the Guidelines in the absence of express language to that effect.
Held:  Before a district court can depart upward from the applicable Guidelines range on a ground not identified as a ground for such departure either in the presentence report or in a prehearing submission by the Government, Rule 32 requires that the court give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a ruling, specifically identifying the ground for the departure.  Pp.  501 U. S. 132-139.
(a) In order to eliminate the unwarranted disparities and uncertainty associated with indeterminate sentencing under the preexisting system, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 requires district courts to determine sentences based on the various offense- and offender-related factors identified by the Guidelines.  Under the Act, a district court may disregard the Guidelines' mechanical dictates only upon finding an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately considered by the Commission.  The Act amended Rule 32 to assure focused, adversarial development of the factual and legal issues relevant to determining the 
Page 501 U. S. 130
 appropriate Guidelines sentence.  Although, ordinarily, the presentence report or the Government's recommendation will notify the defendant that an upward departure will be at issue and of the facts that allegedly support it, that will not be the case where, as here, the district court departs sua sponte from the Guidelines sentencing range.  Pp.  501 U. S. 132-135.

No. 90-368
Argued April 22, 1991
Decided June 13, 1991
501 U.S. 157

Syllabus 
Petitioner Toibb filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, disclosing, inter alia, assets that included stock in an electric power company.  When he discovered that the stock had substantial value, he decided to avoid its liquidation by moving to convert his Chapter 7 case to one under Chapter 11's reorganization provisions.  After the Bankruptcy Court granted his motion, and he filed his reorganization plan, that court dismissed his petition, finding that he did not qualify for relief under Chapter 11 because he was not engaged in an ongoing business.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The Bankruptcy Code's plain language permits individual debtors not engaged in business to file for relief under Chapter 11.  Toibb is a debtor within the meaning of  109(d), which provides that ""a person who may be a debtor under chapter 7 . . . except a stockbroker or a commodity broker, and a railroad may be a debtor under chapter 11.""  He is a person who may be a Chapter 7 debtor, since only railroads and various financial and insurance institutions are excluded from Chapter 7's coverage, and  109(d) makes Chapter 11 available to all entities eligible for Chapter 7 protection, other than stockbrokers and commodities brokers.  Although Chapter 11's structure and legislative history indicate that it was intended primarily for the use of business debtors, the Code contains no ongoing business requirement for Chapter 11 reorganization; and there is no basis, including underlying policy considerations, for imposing one.

No. 90-5319
Argued Feb. 25, 1991
Decided June 13, 1991
501 U.S. 171

Syllabus 
Charged with an armed robbery in West Allis, Wisconsin, petitioner McNeil was represented by a public defender at a bail hearing.  While in jail on that charge, he was questioned by police about a murder and related crimes in Caledonia, Wisconsin.  He was advised of his Miranda rights, signed forms waiving them, and made statements incriminating himself in the Caledonia offenses.  He was then formally charged with the latter crimes, his pretrial motion to suppress his statements was denied, and he was convicted.  His conviction was affirmed on appeal, the State Supreme Court holding that an accused's request for counsel at an initial appearance on a charged offense does not constitute an invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel that precludes police interrogation on unrelated, uncharged offenses.
Held:  An accused's invocation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel during a judicial proceeding does not constitute an invocation of the right to counsel derived by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, from the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against compelled self-incrimination.  Pp.  501 U. S. 175-182.
(a) The identity between the two rights that McNeil asserts is false as a matter of fact.  The Sixth Amendment right, which does not attach until the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings, is offense-specific, Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159,  474 U. S. 179-180 and n. 16, as is its effect, under Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, of invalidating subsequent waivers during police-initiated questioning.  Thus, McNeil's invocation of that right with respect to the West Allis robbery poses no bar to the admission of his statements regarding the Caledonia crimes, with which he had not been charged at the time he made the statements.  Moreover, although the Miranda right to counsel is non-offense-specific, Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, and, once asserted, prevents any further police-initiated interrogation outside the presence of counsel, Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477,  451 U. S. 484-485, its assertion cannot be inferred from the invocation of the Sixth Amendment right in light of the differing purposes and effects of the two rights.  The Sixth Amendment right is intended to protect the unaided layman at critical confrontations with the government after the initiation of the adversary process with respect to a particular crime, United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180,  467 U. S. 189.  The Miranda-Edwards guarantee is intended to protect the suspect's

Pp.  501 U. S. 175-1780.
(b) Nor will this Court declare as a matter of sound policy (assuming the existence of such expansive power) that assertion of the Sixth Amendment right implies invocation of the Miranda right.

No. 90-285
Argued March 20, 1991
Decided June 13, 1991
501 U.S. 190

Syllabus 
Among other things, the collective bargaining agreement (Agreement) between petitioner Litton and the Union representing the production employees at Litton's printing plant broadly required that all differences as to contract construction or violations be determined by arbitration, specified that grievances that could not be resolved under a two-step grievance procedure should be submitted for binding arbitration, and provided that, in case of layoffs, length of continuous service would be the determining factor ""if other things such as aptitude and ability [were] equal.""  The Agreement expired in October, 1979.  A new agreement had not been negotiated when, in August and September, 1980, and without any notice to the Union, Litton laid off 10 of the workers at its plant, including 6 of the most senior employees, pursuant to its decision to close down its cold-type printing operation.  The Union filed grievances on behalf of the laid-off employees, claiming a violation of the Agreement, but Litton refused to submit to the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure, to negotiate over its layoff decision, or to arbitrate under any circumstances.  Based on its precedents dealing with unilateral post-expiration abandonment of contractual grievance procedures and post-expiration arbitrability, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) held that Litton's actions violated  8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  However, although it ordered Litton, inter alia, to process the grievances through the two-step grievance procedure and to bargain with the Union over the layoffs, the Board refused to order arbitration of the particular layoff disputes, ruling that they did not ""arise under"" the expired contract as required by its decision in Indiana & Michigan Electric Co., 284 N.L.R.B. 53, and its interpretation of this Court's decision in Nolde Bros., Inc. v. Bakery Workers, 430 U. S. 243.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order, with the exception of that portion holding the layoff grievance not arbitrable, ruling that the right to lay off in seniority order, if other things such as aptitude and ability were equal, did arise under the Agreement. 
Page 501 U. S. 191

Held:  The layoff dispute was not arbitrable.  Pp.  501 U. S. 198-219.
(a) The unilateral change doctrine of NLRB v. Katz, 369 U. S. 736, whereby an employer violates the NLRA if, without bargaining to impasse, it effects a unilateral change of an existing term or condition of employment -- extends to cases in which an existing agreement has expired and negotiations on a new one have yet to be completed.  See, e.g., Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund v. Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co., 484 U. S. 539,  484 U. S. 544, n. 6.  However, since Hilton-Davis Chemical Co., 185 N.L.R.B. 241, the Board has held that an arbitration clause does not, by operation of the NLRA as interpreted in Katz, continue in effect after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  501 U. S. 198-200.
(b) This Court will not extend the unilateral change doctrine to impose a statutory duty to arbitrate post-expiration disputes.  The Board's Hilton-Davis Chemical Co. rule is both rational and consistent with the NLRA, under which arbitration is a matter of consent, and will not be imposed beyond the scope of the parties' agreement.  See, e.g., Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368,  414 U. S. 374.  The Board's rule is therefore entitled to deference.  If parties who favor labor arbitration during a contract's term also desire it to resolve post-expiration disputes, they can draft their agreement to so indicate, to eliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and execution of the new agreement, or to remain in effect until they bargain to impasse.  Pp.  501 U. S. 200-201.
(c) The Board's decision not to order arbitration of the layoff grievances in this case is not entitled to substantial deference.  Although the Board has considerable authority to structure its remedial orders to effectuate the NLRA's purposes and to order the relief it deems appropriate, its decision here is not based on statutory considerations, but rests upon its interpretation of the Agreement, applying Nolde Bros. and the federal common law of collective bargaining.  Arbitrators and courts, rather than the Board, are the principal sources of contract interpretation under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.  Deferring to the Board in its interpretation of contracts would risk the development of conflicting principles.  Pp.  501 U. S. 201-203.
(d) Nevertheless, as Nolde Bros. recognized, a post-expiration duty to arbitrate a dispute may arise from the express or implied terms of the expired agreement itself.  Holding that the extensive obligation to arbitrate under the contract there at issue was not consistent with an interpretation that would eliminate all duty to arbitrate upon expiration, Nolde Bros., supra, 430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 255, found a presumption in favor of post-expiration arbitration of disputes unless negated expressly or by clear implication, so long as such disputes arose out of the relation governed by contract.  Pp.  501 U. S. 203-204. 
Page 501 U. S. 192

(e) The Agreement's unlimited arbitration clause places it within the precise rational of Nolde Bros., such that other Agreement provisions cannot rebut the Nolde Bros. presumption.  P.  501 U. S. 205.
(f) However, Nolde Bros. does not announce a broad rule that post-expiration grievances concerning terms and conditions of employment remain arbitrable, but applies only where a dispute has its real source in the contract.  Absent an explicit agreement that certain benefits continue past expiration, a post-expiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arise before expiration, where a post-expiration action infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or where, under the normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.  And, as Nolde Bros. found, structural provisions relating to remedies and dispute resolution -- e.g., an arbitration provision -- may in some cases survive in order to enforce duties under the contract.  It is presumed as a matter of contract interpretation that the parties did not intend a pivotal dispute resolution provision to terminate for all purposes upon the Agreement's expiration.  Pp.  501 U. S. 205-208.
(g) Application of the foregoing principles reveals that the layoff dispute at issue does not arise under the Agreement.  Since the layoffs took place almost one year after the Agreement expired, the grievances are arbitrable only if they involve rights which accrued or vested under the Agreement or carried over after its expiration.  The layoff provision here does not satisfy these requirements and, unlike the severance pay provision at issue in Nolde Bros., cannot be construed as a grant of deferred compensation for time already worked.  The order of layoffs under the Agreement was to be determined primarily with reference to ""other [factors] such as aptitude and ability,"" which do not remain constant, but either improve or atrophy over time, and which vary in importance with the requirements of the employer's business at any given moment.  Thus, any arbitration proceeding would, of necessity, focus upon whether such factors were equal as of the date of the layoff decision and the decision to close down the cold-type operation, and an intent to freeze any particular order of layoff or vest any contractual right as of the Agreement's expiration cannot be inferred.  Pp.  501 U. S. 208-210.

The Court of Appeals enforced the Board's order, with the exception of that portion holding the layoff grievance not arbitrable, ruling that the right to lay off in seniority order, if other things such as aptitude and ability were equal, did arise under the Agreement. 
Page 501 U. S. 191

Held:  The layoff dispute was not arbitrable.  Pp.  501 U. S. 198-219.
(a) The unilateral change doctrine of NLRB v. Katz, 369 U. S. 736, whereby an employer violates the NLRA if, without bargaining to impasse, it effects a unilateral change of an existing term or condition of employment -- extends to cases in which an existing agreement has expired and negotiations on a new one have yet to be completed.  See, e.g., Laborers Health and Welfare Trust Fund v. Advanced Lightweight Concrete Co., 484 U. S. 539,  484 U. S. 544, n. 6.  However, since Hilton-Davis Chemical Co., 185 N.L.R.B. 241, the Board has held that an arbitration clause does not, by operation of the NLRA as interpreted in Katz, continue in effect after expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.  Pp.  501 U. S. 198-200.
(b) This Court will not extend the unilateral change doctrine to impose a statutory duty to arbitrate post-expiration disputes.  The Board's Hilton-Davis Chemical Co. rule is both rational and consistent with the NLRA, under which arbitration is a matter of consent, and will not be imposed beyond the scope of the parties' agreement.  See, e.g., Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368,  414 U. S. 374.  The Board's rule is therefore entitled to deference.  If parties who favor labor arbitration during a contract's term also desire it to resolve post-expiration disputes, they can draft their agreement to so indicate, to eliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and execution of the new agreement, or to remain in effect until they bargain to impasse.  Pp.  501 U. S. 200-201.
(c) The Board's decision not to order arbitration of the layoff grievances in this case is not entitled to substantial deference.  Although the Board has considerable authority to structure its remedial orders to effectuate the NLRA's purposes and to order the relief it deems appropriate, its decision here is not based on statutory considerations, but rests upon its interpretation of the Agreement, applying Nolde Bros. and the federal common law of collective bargaining.  Arbitrators and courts, rather than the Board, are the principal sources of contract interpretation under  301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.  Deferring to the Board in its interpretation of contracts would risk the development of conflicting principles.  Pp.  501 U. S. 201-203.
(d) Nevertheless, as Nolde Bros. recognized, a post-expiration duty to arbitrate a dispute may arise from the express or implied terms of the expired agreement itself.  Holding that the extensive obligation to arbitrate under the contract there at issue was not consistent with an interpretation that would eliminate all duty to arbitrate upon expiration, Nolde Bros., supra, 430 U.S. at  430 U. S. 255, found a presumption in favor of post-expiration arbitration of disputes unless negated expressly or by clear implication, so long as such disputes arose out of the relation governed by contract.  Pp.  501 U. S. 203-204. 
Page 501 U. S. 192

(e) The Agreement's unlimited arbitration clause places it within the precise rational of Nolde Bros., such that other Agreement provisions cannot rebut the Nolde Bros. presumption.  P.  501 U. S. 205.
(f) However, Nolde Bros. does not announce a broad rule that post-expiration grievances concerning terms and conditions of employment remain arbitrable, but applies only where a dispute has its real source in the contract.  Absent an explicit agreement that certain benefits continue past expiration, a post-expiration grievance can be said to arise under the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences that arise before expiration, where a post-expiration action infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or where, under the normal principles of contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.  And, as Nolde Bros. found, structural provisions relating to remedies and dispute resolution -- e.g., an arbitration provision -- may in some cases survive in order to enforce duties under the contract.  It is presumed as a matter of contract interpretation that the parties did not intend a pivotal dispute resolution provision to terminate for all purposes upon the Agreement's expiration.  Pp.  501 U. S. 205-208.
(g) Application of the foregoing principles reveals that the layoff dispute at issue does not arise under the Agreement.  Since the layoffs took place almost one year after the Agreement expired, the grievances are arbitrable only if they involve rights which accrued or vested under the Agreement or carried over after its expiration.  The layoff provision here does not satisfy these requirements and, unlike the severance pay provision at issue in Nolde Bros., cannot be construed as a grant of deferred compensation for time already worked.  The order of layoffs under the Agreement was to be determined primarily with reference to ""other [factors] such as aptitude and ability,"" which do not remain constant, but either improve or atrophy over time, and which vary in importance with the requirements of the employer's business at any given moment.  Thus, any arbitration proceeding would, of necessity, focus upon whether such factors were equal as of the date of the layoff decision and the decision to close down the cold-type operation, and an intent to freeze any particular order of layoff or vest any contractual right as of the Agreement's expiration cannot be inferred.  Pp.  501 U. S. 208-210.

|501 u.s. 78|"Johnson v. Home State Bank
No. 90-693
Argued April 16, 1991
Decided June 10, 1991
501 U.S. 78

Syllabus 
After petitioner Johnson defaulted on promissory notes secured with a mortgage on his farm, respondent Home State Bank (Bank) began foreclosure proceedings in state court.  While foreclosure proceedings were pending, Johnson filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the Bankruptcy Court discharged him from personal liability on the notes.  However, because the Bank's right to proceed against him in rem survived the bankruptcy, see 11 U.S.C.  522(c)(2); Long v. Bullard, 117 U. S. 617, the Bank reinitiated the foreclosure proceedings once the automatic stay protecting his estate was lifted.  The state court entered judgment for the Bank, but before the foreclosure sale, Johnson filed for reorganization under Chapter 13, listing the mortgage as a claim against his estate.  The Bankruptcy Court confirmed his plan to pay the Bank's judgment in installments, but the District Court reversed, ruling that the Code does not allow a debtor to include in a Chapter 13 plan a mortgage used to secure an obligation for which personal liability has been discharged in Chapter 7 proceedings.  The court did not reach the Bank's alternative argument that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that Johnson had proposed his plan in good faith and that the plan was feasible.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that, since Johnson's personal liability had been discharged, the Bank no longer had a ""claim"" against Johnson subject to rescheduling under Chapter 13.
Held:
1. A mortgage lien securing an obligation for which a debtor's personal liability has been discharged in a Chapter 7 liquidation is a ""claim"" within the meaning of  101(5), and is subject to inclusion in an approved Chapter 13 reorganization plan.  Congress intended in  101(5) to incorporate the broadest available definition of ""claim,"" see Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552.  As used in  101(5), ""right to payment"" and ""right to an equitable remedy"" mean ""nothing more nor less than an enforceable obligation.""  Id. at  501 U. S. 559.  A surviving mortgage interest corresponds to an ""enforceable obligation"" of the debtor.  Even after the debtor's personal obligations have been extinguished, the creditor still retains a ""right to payment"" in the form of its right to the proceeds from the sale of the debtor's property.   Alternatively, the creditor's surviving right to foreclose on the mortgage can 
Page 501 U. S. 79
 be viewed as a ""right to an equitable remedy"" for the debtor's default on the underlying obligation.  Thus, a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim -- an in personam action -- while leaving intact another -- an in rem action.  Indeed, the need to codify Long v. Bullard, supra, presupposes that a mortgage interest is a ""claim,"" because only ""claims"" are discharged.  This conclusion is consistent with other parts of the Code -- which contemplate circumstances in which a claim may consist of nothing more than a claim against the debtor's property,  502(b)(1), and establish that the phrase ""claim against the debtor' includes claim against"" the debtor's property,  102(2) -- and with the Code's legislative background and history.  The Bank's contention that serial filings under Chapters 7 and 13 evade the limits that Congress intended to place on the Chapters' remedies is unpersuasive, since Congress has expressly prohibited various forms of serial filings, see, e.g.,  727(a)(8), yet fashioned no similar prohibition with regard to Chapters 7 and 13 filings.  In addition, the full range of Code provisions designed to protect Chapter 13 creditors, see, e.g.,  1325(a), combined with Congress' intent that ""claim"" be construed broadly, makes it unlikely that Congress intended to use the Code's definition of ""claim"" to police the Chapter 13 process for abuse. Pp.  501 U. S. 82-88.
2. Because the lower courts never addressed the issues of Johnson's good faith or the plan's feasibility, this Court declines to address those issues and leaves them for consideration on remand.  P.  501 U. S. 88.

No. 90-5538
Argued April 15, 1991
Decided June 10, 1991
501 U.S. 89

Syllabus 
Petitioner filed suit in the District Court under 42 U.S.C.  1383(c)(3), which incorporates 42 U.S.C.  405(g)'s review provisions, seeking review of a final decision of respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services denying his application for disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program.  While his case was pending, he filed a new application, accompanied by additional evidence of disability, and was awarded benefits.  Subsequently, the Secretary requested that the court remand the first claim for reconsideration.  Responding to petitioner's motion that it either issue a decision on his motion for summary judgment or remand the case, the court granted the Secretary's remand motion, ""concurred in by plaintiff,"" and remanded the case ""to the Secretary for all further proceedings.""  On remand, the first decision was vacated and petitioner was found disabled as of his original application date.  Over a year later, he applied to the District Court for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which, inter alia, permits an award of fees and expenses to a party prevailing against the United States ""in any civil action . . . in any court,"" 28 U.S.C.  2412(d)(1)(A), upon an application made within 30 days of ""final judgment in the action,""  2412(d)(1)(B).  The court denied the request on the ground that the Secretary's position in the litigation had been substantially justified.  However, the Court of Appeals vacated, concluding that petitioner's application was untimely because the administrative determination on remand was a ""final judgment,"" which triggered the 30-day period.
Held:
1. The EAJA's plain language makes clear that a ""final judgment"" for purposes of  2412(d)(1)(B) is a judgment rendered by a court that terminates the civil action for which EAJA fees may be received.  Subsections (d)(1)(A) and (d)(1)(B) work in tandem, and subsection (d)(1)(B)'s requirement that the fee application be filed within 30 days of ""final judgment in the action"" (emphasis added) plainly refers back to the ""civil action . . . in any court"" in subsection (d)(1)(A).  This reading is reinforced by the contrast between  2412 and 5 U.S.C.  504(a), the only EAJA provision allowing awards for administrative proceedings conducted 
Page 501 U. S. 90
 prior to the filing of a civil action.  While  504(a)(2)'s pertinent language largely mirrors that of  2412(d)(1)(B), it requires that a fee application be filed within 30 days ""of a final disposition in the adversary adjudication,"" which includes an administrative agency's adjudication, rather than ""final judgment in the action,"" which a court renders.  The Secretary errs in arguing that the EAJA's definition of ""final judgment"" -- ""final and not appealable"" -- differs so significantly from the traditional definition -- final and appealable -- that it must include administrative agencies' decisions, since this suggestion does not alter  2412(d)(1)(B)'s unambiguous requirement of judgment by a court, and since Congress adopted this unusual definition to clarify that a judgment was final only after the time for taking an appeal from a district court's judgment had expired.  Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, is not to the contrary, for it stands only for the proposition that a claimant may collect EAJA fees for work done in post-remand administrative proceedings where a civil action has been filed, the district court retains jurisdiction over the action, and contemplates entering a judgment at the proceedings' completion.  Pp.  501 U. S. 93-97.
2. A district court may remand a final decision of the Secretary only as provided in sentences four and six of 42 U.S.C.  405(g):  in conjunction with a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the Secretary's decision (sentence four), or in light of additional evidence without any substantive ruling as to the correctness of the Secretary's decision, but only if the claimant shows good cause for failing to present the evidence earlier (sentence six).  The conclusion that Congress intended to so limit courts' authority to enter remand orders is dictated by  405(g)'s language, which explicitly delineates only two circumstances under which such remands are authorized, cf. 2United States v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160, and is supported by  405(g)'s legislative history.  This view also harmonizes with the EAJA's final judgment requirement, with the 30-day period beginning in sentence four cases after the court enters its judgment and the appeal period runs, and beginning in sentence six cases after the Secretary returns to court following a post-remand proceeding's completion, the court enters a judgment, and the appeal period runs.  Pp.  501 U. S. 97-102.
3. This matter must be remanded for the District Court to clarify its order because the record does not clearly indicate what it intended by its disposition.  It is not certain that this was a sentence six remand.  The court did not make a ""good cause"" finding or seem to anticipate that the parties would return to court, and it may be that the court treated the joint remand request as a voluntary dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a).  If it was a sentence six remand, once the Secretary returns to the District Court and the court enters a final judgment, petitioner will be entitled to EAJA fees unless the Secretary's position was substantially justified, an issue the Court of Appeals never addressed.  
Page 501 U. S. 91
 And if it was not such a remand, petitioner may be entitled to no fees at all.  Pp.  501 U. S. 102-103.
4. This case is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving the issue whether petitioner's application is timely.  In a sentence six remand, he will not be prejudiced if the District Court determines that an application filed before final judgment is sufficient or if he reapplies after the judgment's entry.  And timeliness may not be at issue if this was not a sentence six remand.  P.  501 U. S. 103.

|501 u.s. 104|"Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Solimino
No. 89-1895
Argued April 17, 1991
Decided June 10, 1991
501 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Respondent Solimino filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that petitioner Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association had dismissed him because of his age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (Age Act).  Under a worksharing agreement, the EEOC referred his claim to the state agency responsible for claims under New York's Human Rights Law.  That agency found no probable cause under state law to believe that he was terminated on account of age, and its decision was upheld on administrative review.  Rather than appealing that decision to state court, Solimino filed in the Federal District Court an Age Act suit grounded on the same factual allegations considered in the state proceedings.  The court granted Astoria's motion for summary judgment, holding that the State's age discrimination findings precluded federal litigation of the claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed, inferring from the Age Act's structure a legislative intent to deny preclusive effect to such state administrative proceedings.
Held:  Judicially unreviewed state administrative findings have no preclusive effect on age discrimination proceedings in federal court.  While well-established common law principles, such as preclusion rules, are presumed to apply in the absence of a legislative intent to the contrary, Congress need not state expressly its intention to overcome a presumption of administrative estoppel.  Clear statement requirements are appropriate only where weighty and constant values are at stake, or where an implied legislative repeal is implicated.  Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234,  473 U. S. 243; EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244,  499 U. S. 248; Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 551.  Such values are not represented by the lenient presumption in favor of administrative estoppel, the suitability of which varies according to context; nor does a finding against estoppel in this case give rise to an implied legislative repeal.  Thus, the test for the presumption's application is whether administrative preclusion would be inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting the particular statute.  University of Tennessee v. Elliott, 478 U. S. 788,  478 U. S. 796.  The Age Act implies, in its filing requirements, that federal courts should recognize no preclusion by state administrative findings.

			"|"Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Solimino
No. 89-1895
Argued April 17, 1991
Decided June 10, 1991
501 U.S. 104

Syllabus 
Respondent Solimino filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that petitioner Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association had dismissed him because of his age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (Age Act).  Under a worksharing agreement, the EEOC referred his claim to the state agency responsible for claims under New York's Human Rights Law.  That agency found no probable cause under state law to believe that he was terminated on account of age, and its decision was upheld on administrative review.  Rather than appealing that decision to state court, Solimino filed in the Federal District Court an Age Act suit grounded on the same factual allegations considered in the state proceedings.  The court granted Astoria's motion for summary judgment, holding that the State's age discrimination findings precluded federal litigation of the claim.  The Court of Appeals reversed, inferring from the Age Act's structure a legislative intent to deny preclusive effect to such state administrative proceedings.
Held:  Judicially unreviewed state administrative findings have no preclusive effect on age discrimination proceedings in federal court.  While well-established common law principles, such as preclusion rules, are presumed to apply in the absence of a legislative intent to the contrary, Congress need not state expressly its intention to overcome a presumption of administrative estoppel.  Clear statement requirements are appropriate only where weighty and constant values are at stake, or where an implied legislative repeal is implicated.  Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234,  473 U. S. 243; EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244,  499 U. S. 248; Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535,  417 U. S. 551.  Such values are not represented by the lenient presumption in favor of administrative estoppel, the suitability of which varies according to context; nor does a finding against estoppel in this case give rise to an implied legislative repeal.  Thus, the test for the presumption's application is whether administrative preclusion would be inconsistent with Congress' intent in enacting the particular statute.  University of Tennessee v. Elliott, 478 U. S. 788,  478 U. S. 796.  The Age Act implies, in its filing requirements, that federal courts should recognize no preclusion by state administrative findings.  Both  14(b) and  7(d)(2) assume the possibility of federal consideration after state review.  However, such proceedings would be strictly pro forma, with the employer likely enjoying an airtight defense, if state administrative findings were given preclusive effect.  The provision, in  14(b), for a claim's consideration in federal court after state proceedings are concluded would, as a result, be left essentially without effect, notwithstanding the rule that statutes should be read to avoid rendering superfluous any parts thereof.  Administrative preclusion was likewise found not to apply with respect to claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Elliott, supra, which held that Title VII's provision directing the EEOC to accord substantial weight to state administrative findings allowed for something less than preclusion.  Id. at  478 U. S. 795.  It is immaterial that the Age Act lacks a similar delimitation, since the Title VII provision was only the most obvious piece of evidence that administrative estoppel does not operate in a Title VII suit.

No. 90-659
Argued April 15, 1991
Decided June 10, 1991
501 U.S. 115

Syllabus 
Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 imposes strict liability on ""beneficial owner[s]"" of more than 10% of a corporation's listed stock, and on the corporation's officers and directors, for any profits realized from any purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of such stock occurring within a 6-month period.  Such ""insiders"" are subject to suit ""instituted . . . by the issuer, or by the owner of any security of the issuer"" in the issuer's name and behalf.  After respondent Mendell, an owner of common stock in Viacom International, Inc. (International), instituted a  16(b) suit against petitioners, allegedly ""beneficial owners"" of International stock, International was acquired by a shell subsidiary of what is now called Viacom, Inc. (Viacom).  International merged with the subsidiary, and became Viacom's wholly owned subsidiary and sole asset.  Mendell received cash and stock in Viacom in exchange for his International stock.  The District Court granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Mendell had lost standing to maintain the action because he no longer owned any International stock.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Mendell's continued prosecution of the action was not barred by the statute's language or existing case law, and was fully consistent with the statutory objectives.
Held:  Mendell has satisfied the statute's standing requirements.  Pp.  501 U. S. 121-128.
(a) Section 16(b) provides standing of signal breadth, expressly limited only by the conditions that the plaintiff be the ""owner of [a] security"" of the ""issuer"" at the time the suit is ""instituted.""  Any ""security"" -- including stock, notes, warrants, bonds, debentures, puts, and calls, 15 U.S.C.  78c(a)(10) -- will suffice to confer standing.  There is no restriction in terms of the number or percentage of shares, or the value of any other security, that must be held.  Nor is the security owner required to have had an interest in the issuer at the time of the short-swing trading.  Although the security's ""issuer"" does not include parent or subsidiary corporations, 15 U.S.C.  78c(a)(8), this requirement is determined at the time the  16(b) action is ""instituted.""  Congress intended to adopt the common understanding of the word ""institute"" -- ""inaugurate or commence; as to institute an action,"" Black's Law Dictionary 985-986 (3d ed.1933) -- which is confirmed by its use of the 
Page 501 U. S. 116
 same word elsewhere to mean the commencement of an action, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  1503(a).  Pp.  501 U. S. 121-124.
(b) A  16(b) plaintiff must, however, throughout the period of his participation in the litigation, maintain some financial interest in the litigation's outcome, both for the sake of furthering the statute's remedial purposes by ensuring that enforcing parties maintain the incentive to litigate vigorously, and to avoid the serious constitutional question that would arise under Article III from a plaintiff's loss of all financial interest in the outcome of the litigation he had begun.  But neither the statute nor its legislative history supports petitioners' argument that a plaintiff must continuously own a security of the issuer.  Pp.  501 U. S. 124-126.
(c) An adequate financial stake can be maintained when the plaintiff's interest in the issuer has been replaced by one in the issuer's new parent corporation.  This is no less an interest than a bondholder's financial stake, which, although more attenuated, satisfies the initial standing requirement under the statute.  P. 126126-127.
(d) Here, Mendell owned a security of the issuer at the time he instituted this  16(b) action, and he continues to maintain a financial interest in the litigation's outcome by virtue of his Viacom stock.  P.  501 U. S. 127-128.

||"Connecticut v. Doehr
No. 90-143
Argued Jan. 7, 1991
Decided June 6, 1991
501 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
A Connecticut statute authorizes a judge to allow the prejudgment attachment of real estate without prior notice or hearing upon the plaintiff's verification that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of his or her claim.  Petitioner DiGiovanni applied to the State Superior Court for such an attachment on respondent Doehr's home in conjunction with a civil action for assault and battery that he was seeking to institute against Doehr in the same court.  The application was supported by an affidavit in which DiGiovanni, in five one-sentence paragraphs, stated that the facts set forth in his previously submitted complaint were true; declared that the assault by Doehr resulted in particular injuries requiring expenditures for medical care; and stated his ""opinion"" that the foregoing facts were sufficient to establish probable cause.  On the strength of these submissions, the judge found probable cause and ordered the attachment.  Only after the sheriff attached the property did Doehr receive notice of the attachment, which informed him of his right to a post-attachment hearing.  Rather than pursue this option, he filed a suit in the Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  That court upheld the statute, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statute violated due process because, inter alia, it permitted ex parte attachment absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances, see, e.g., Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., 416 U. S. 600, and the nature of the issues at stake in this case increased the risk that attachment was wrongfully 
Page 501 U. S. 2
 granted, since the fact-specific event of a fistfight and the question of assault are complicated matters that do not easily lend themselves to documentary proof, see id. at  416 U. S. 609-610.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
898 F.2d 852 (CA 2 1990), affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that:
1. Determining what process must be afforded by a state statute enabling an individual to enlist the State's aid to deprive another of his or her property by means of prejudgment attachment or similar procedure requires (1) consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the prejudgment measure; (2) an examination of the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures under attack and the probable value of additional or alternative safeguards; and (3) principal attention to the interest of the party seeking the prejudgment remedy, with due regard for any ancillary interest the government may have in providing the procedure or forgoing the added burden of providing greater protections.  Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319,  424 U. S. 335.  Pp.  501 U. S. 9-11.
2. Application of the Mathews factors demonstrates that the Connecticut statute, as applied to this case, violates due process by authorizing prejudgment attachment without prior notice and a hearing.  Pp.  501 U. S. 11-18.
(a) The interests affected are significant for a property owner like Doehr, since attachment ordinarily clouds title; impairs the ability to sell or otherwise alienate the property; taints any credit rating; reduces the chance of obtaining a home equity loan or additional mortgage; and can even place an existing mortgage in technical default where there is an insecurity clause.  That these effects do not amount to a complete, physical, or permanent deprivation of real property is irrelevant, since even the temporary or partial impairments to property rights that such encumbrances entail are sufficient to merit due process protection.  See, e.g., Peralta v. Heights Medical Center, Inc., 485 U. S. 80,  485 U. S. 85.  P.  501 U. S. 11-12.
(b) Without pre-attachment notice and a hearing, the risk of erroneous deprivation that the State permits here is too great to satisfy due process under any of the interpretations of the statutory ""probable cause"" requirement offered by the parties.  If the statute merely demands inquiry into the sufficiency of the complaint, or, still less, the plaintiff's good faith belief that the complaint is sufficient, the judge could authorize deprivation of the defendant's property when the claim would fail to convince a jury, when it rested on factual allegations that were sufficient to state a cause of action but which the defendant would dispute, or in the case of a good faith standard, even when the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Even if the 
Page 501 U. S. 3
 provision requires a finding of probable cause to believe that judgment will be rendered in the plaintiff's favor, the reviewing judge in a case like this could make no realistic assessment based on the plaintiff's one-sided, self-serving, and conclusory affidavit and complaint, particularly since the issue does not concern ordinarily uncomplicated matters like the existence of a debt or delinquent payments that lend themselves to documentary proof.  See Mitchell, supra, 416 U.S. at  416 U. S. 609.  Moreover, the safeguards that the State does afford -- an ""expeditious"" post-attachment notice and an adversary hearing, judicial review of an adverse decision, and a double damages action if the original suit is commenced without probable cause -- do not adequately reduce the risk of erroneous deprivation under Mitchell, since none of the additional factors that diminished the need for a predeprivation hearing in that case -- that the plaintiff had a vendor's lien to protect, that the likelihood of recovery involved uncomplicated, documentable matters, and that the plaintiff was required to post a bond -- is present here.  Although a later hearing might negate the presence of probable cause, this would not cure the temporary deprivation that an earlier hearing might have prevented.  Pp.  501 U. S. 12-15.
(c) The interests in favor of an ex parte attachment, particularly DiGiovanni's interests, are too minimal to justify the burdening of Doehr's ownership rights without a hearing to determine the likelihood of recovery.  Although DiGiovanni had no existing interest in Doehr's real estate when he sought the attachment, and his only interest was to ensure the availability of assets to satisfy his judgment if he prevailed on the merits of his action, there were no allegations that Doehr was about to transfer or encumber his real estate or take any other action during the pendency of the suit that would render his property unavailable to satisfy a judgment.  Absent such allegations, there was no exigent circumstance permitting the postponement of notice or hearing until after the attachment was effected.  Moreover, the State's substantive interest in protecting DiGiovanni's de minimis rights cannot be any more weighty than those rights themselves, and the State cannot seriously plead additional financial or administrative burdens involving predeprivation hearings when it already claims to provide an immediate post-deprivation hearing.  P.  501 U. S. 16.
3. Historical and contemporary practice support the foregoing analysis.  Attachment measures in both England and this country have traditionally had several limitations that reduced the risk of erroneous deprivation, including requirements that the defendant had taken or threatened some action that would place satisfaction of the plaintiff's potential award in jeopardy, that the plaintiff be a creditor, as opposed to the victim of a tort, and that the plaintiff post a bond.  Moreover, a survey of current state attachment provisions reveals that nearly every 
Page 501 U. S. 4
 State requires either a pre-attachment hearing, a showing of some exigent circumstance, or both, before permitting an attachment to take place.  Although the States, for the most part, no longer confine attachments to creditor claims, this development only increases the importance of the other limitations.  Pp.  501 U. S. 16-18.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court with respect to Parts I and III, the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, in which REHNQUIST, C.J., and MARSHALL, BLACKMUN, STEVENS, O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts IV and V, in which MARSHALL, STEVENS, and O'CONNOR, JJ., joined.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Chambers, the sole shareholder and director of a company that operated a television station in Louisiana, agreed to sell the station's facilities and broadcast license to respondent NASCO, Inc.  Chambers soon changed his mind and, both before and after NASCO filed this diversity action for specific performance in the District Court, engaged in a series of actions within and without that court and in proceedings before the Federal Communications Commission, the Court of Appeals, and this Court, which were designed to frustrate the sale's consummation.  On remand following the Court of Appeals' affirmance of judgment on the merits for NASCO, the District Court, on NASCO's motion and following full briefing and a hearing, imposed sanctions against Chambers in the form of attorney's fees and expenses totaling almost $1 million, representing the entire amount of NASCO's litigation costs paid to its attorneys.  The court noted that the alleged sanctionable conduct was that Chambers had (1) attempted to deprive the court of jurisdiction by acts of fraud, nearly all of which were performed outside the confines of the court, (2) filed false and frivolous pleadings, and (3) ""attempted, by other tactics of delay, oppression, harassment and massive expense to reduce [NASCO] to exhausted compliance.""  The court deemed Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 -- which provides for the imposition of attorney's fees as a sanction for the improper filing of papers with a court -- insufficient to support the sanction against Chambers, since the Rule does not reach conduct in the foregoing first and third categories, and since it would have been impossible to assess sanctions at the time the papers in the second category were filed, because their falsity did not become apparent until after the trial on the merits.  The court likewise declined to impose sanctions under 28 U.S.C.  1927, both because the statute's authorization of an attorney's fees sanction applies only to attorneys who unreasonably and vexatiously multiply proceedings, and therefore would not reach Chambers, and because the statute was not broad enough to reach ""acts which degrade the judicial system.""  The court therefore relied on its inherent power in imposing sanctions.  In affirming, the Court of Appeals, inter alia, rejected Chambers' argument that a federal court sitting in diversity must look to state law, not the court's inherent power, to assess attorney's fees as a sanction for bad-faith conduct in litigation.
Held:  The District Court properly invoked its inherent power in assessing as a sanction for Chambers' bad-faith conduct the attorney's fees and related expenses paid by NASCO.  Pp.  501 U. S. 42-58.
(a) Federal courts have the inherent power to manage their own proceedings and to control the conduct of those who appear before them.  In invoking the inherent power to punish conduct which abuses the judicial process, a court must exercise discretion in fashioning an appropriate sanction, which may range from dismissal of a lawsuit to an assessment of attorney's fees.  Although the ""American Rule"" prohibits the shifting of attorney's fees in most cases, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240,  421 U. S. 259, an exception allows federal courts to exercise their inherent power to assess such fees as a sanction when a party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons, id. at  421 U. S. 258-259,  421 U. S. 260, as when the party practices a fraud upon the court, Universal Oil Products Co. v. Root Refining Co., 328 U. S. 575,  328 U. S. 580, or delays or disrupts the litigation or hampers a court order's enforcement, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,  437 U. S. 689, n. 14.  Pp.  501 U. S. 43-46.
(b) There is nothing in  1927, Rule 11, or other Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizing attorney's fees as a sanction, or in this Court's decisions interpreting those other sanctioning mechanisms, that warrants a conclusion that, taken alone or together, the other mechanisms displace courts' inherent power to impose attorney's fees as a sanction for bad-faith conduct.  Although a court ordinarily should rely on such rules when there is bad-faith conduct in the course of litigation that could be adequately sanctioned under the rules, the court may safely rely on its inherent power if, in its informed discretion, neither the statutes nor the rules are up to the task.  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in resorting to the inherent power in the circumstances of this case.  Although some of Chambers' conduct might have been reached through the other sanctioning mechanisms, all of that conduct was sanctionable.  Requiring the court to apply the other mechanisms to discrete occurrences before invoking the inherent power to address remaining instances of sanctionable conduct would serve only to foster extensive and needless satellite litigation, which is contrary to the aim of the rules themselves.  Nor did the court's reliance on the inherent power thwart the mandatory terms of Rules 11 and 26(g).  Those Rules merely require that ""an appropriate sanction"" be imposed, without specifying which sanction is required.  Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, distinguished. Pp.  501 U. S. 46-51.
(c) There is no merit to Chambers' assertion that a federal court sitting in diversity cannot use its inherent power to assess attorney's fees as a sanction unless the applicable state law recognizes the ""bad-faith"" exception to the general American Rule against fee-shifting.  Although footnote 31 in Alyeska tied a diversity court's inherent power to award fees to the existence of a state law giving a right thereto, that limitation applies only to fee-shifting rules that embody a substantive policy, such as a statute which permits a prevailing party in certain classes of litigation to recover fees.  Here the District Court did not attempt to sanction Chambers for breach of contract, but rather imposed sanctions for the fraud he perpetrated on the court and the bad faith he displayed toward both NASCO and the court throughout the litigation.  The inherent power to tax fees for such conduct cannot be made subservient to any state policy without transgressing the boundaries set out in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, and Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, for fee-shifting here is not a matter of substantive remedy, but is a matter of vindicating judicial authority.  Thus, although Louisiana law prohibits punitive damages for a bad-faith breach of contract, this substantive state policy is not implicated.  Pp.  501 U. S. 51-55.
(d) Based on the circumstances of this case, the District Court acted within its discretion in assessing as a sanction for Chambers' bad-faith conduct the entire amount of NASCO's attorney's fees.  Chambers' arguments to the contrary are without merit.  First, although the sanction was not assessed until the conclusion of the litigation, the court's reliance on its inherent power did not represent an end run around Rule 11's notice requirements, since Chambers received repeated timely warnings both from NASCO and the court that his conduct was sanctionable.  Second, the fact that the entire amount of fees was awarded does not mean that the court failed to tailor the sanction to the particular wrong, in light of the frequency and severity of Chambers' abuses of the judicial system and the resulting need to ensure that such abuses were not repeated.  Third, the court did not abuse its discretion by failing to require NASCO to mitigate its expenses, since Chambers himself made a swift conclusion to the litigation by means of summary judgment impossible by continuing to assert that material factual disputes existed.  Fourth, the court did not err in imposing sanctions for conduct before other tribunals, since, as long as Chambers received an appropriate hearing, he may be sanctioned for abuses of process beyond the courtroom.  Finally, the claim that the award is not ""personalized"" as to Chambers' responsibility for the challenged conduct is flatly contradicted by the court's detailed factual findings concerning Chambers' involvement in the sequence of events at issue.  Pp.  501 U. S. 55-58.

|500 u.s. 603|"Exxon Corporation v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc.
No. 90-34
Argued April 15, 1991
Decided June 3, 1991
500 U.S. 603

Syllabus 
Petitioner Exxon Corporation and Waterman Steamship Corporation negotiated a marine fuel requirements contract, in which Exxon agreed to supply Waterman's vessels with fuel when the vessels called at ports where Exxon could supply fuel directly and, when the vessels were in ports where Exxon had to rely on local suppliers, to arrange for, and pay, those suppliers to deliver the fuel and then invoice Waterman.  In the transaction at issue, Exxon acted as Waterman's agent, procuring fuel from a local supplier in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for a ship owned by respondent Central Gulf Lines, Inc., but chartered by Waterman.  Exxon paid for the fuel and invoiced Waterman, but Waterman filed for bankruptcy and never paid the bill's full amount.  When Central Gulf agreed to assume personal liability for the bill if a court were to hold the ship liable in rem, Exxon commenced litigation in the District Court against Central Gulf in personam and the ship in rem, claiming to have a maritime lien on the ship under the Federal Maritime Lien Act.  The court concluded that it did not have admiralty jurisdiction.  Noting that a prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the contract's subject matter must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction, it followed Second Circuit precedent, which holds that Minturn v. Maynard, 17 How. 477 -- in which an agent who had advanced funds for repairs and supplies necessary for a vessel was barred from bringing a claim in admiralty against the vessel's owners -- established a per se rule excluding agency contracts from admiralty.  However, the court ruled in Exxon's favor on a separate unpaid bill for fuel that Exxon supplied directly to the ship in New York.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Because there is no per se exception of agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction, Minturn is overruled.  Minturn is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts.  The rationales on which it apparently rested -- that an action cognizable as assumpsit was excluded from admiralty, and that a claimant had to have some form of a lien interest in a vessel to sue in admiralty on a contract -- have been discredited, and are no longer the law of this Court.  See Archawski v. Hanioti, 350 U. S. 532,  350 U. S. 536; see also, e.g.,  249 U. S. S. 604 S.S. Co. v. Hall Bros. Marine Railway & Shipbuilding Co., 249 U. S. 119,  249 U. S. 126.  Minturn's approach is also inconsistent with the principle that the ""nature and subject matter"" of the contract at issue should be the crucial consideration in assessing admiralty jurisdiction.  Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1,  78 U. S. 26.  And a per se bar of agency contracts from admiralty ill serves the purpose of the grant of admiralty jurisdiction, which is the protection of maritime commerce, Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson,@ 457 U. S. 668,  457 U. S. 674.  There is nothing in the agency relationship that necessarily excludes such relationships from the realm of maritime commerce, and rubrics such as ""general agent"" reveal nothing about whether the services actually performed are maritime in nature.  Pp.  500 U. S. 608-612.
2. Admiralty jurisdiction extends to Exxon's claim regarding the delivery of fuel in Jeddah.  The lower court correctly held that the New York transaction is maritime in nature.  Since the subject matter of both claims -- the value of the fuel received by the ship -- is the same as it relates to maritime commerce, admiralty jurisdiction must extend to one if it extends to the other.  P.  500 U. S. 612-613.
3. This Court expresses no view on whether Exxon is entitled to a maritime lien under the Federal Maritime Lien Act, and leaves that issue to be decided on remand.  P.  500 U. S. 613.

||"Syllabus 
Petitioner Edmonson sued respondent Leesville Concrete Co. in the District Court, alleging that Leesville's negligence had caused him personal injury.  During voir dire, Leesville used two of its three peremptory challenges authorized by statute to remove black persons from the prospective jury.  Citing Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, Edmonson, who is black, requested that the court require Leesville to articulate a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory strikes.  The court refused on the ground that Batson does not apply in civil proceedings, and the impaneled jury, which consisted of 11 white persons and 1 black, rendered a verdict unfavorable to Edmonson.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a private litigant in a civil case can exercise peremptory challenges without accountability for alleged racial classifications.
Held:  A private litigant in a civil case may not use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors on account of race.  Pp.  500 U. S. 618-631.
(a) Race-based exclusion of potential jurors in a civil case violates the excluded persons' equal protection rights.  Cf., e.g., Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,  499 U. S. 402.  Although the conduct of private parties lies beyond the Constitution's scope in most instances, Leesville's exercise of peremptory challenges was pursuant to a course of state action, and is therefore subject to constitutional requirements under the analytical framework set forth in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922,  457 U. S. 939-942.  First, the claimed constitutional deprivation results from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority, since Leesville would not have been able to engage in the alleged discriminatory acts without 28 U.S.C.  1870, which authorizes the use of peremptory challenges in civil cases.  Second, Leesville must in all fairness be deemed a government actor in its use of peremptory challenges.  Leesville has made extensive use of government procedures with the overt, significant assistance of the government, see, e.g., Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478,  485 U. S. 486, in that peremptory challenges have no utility outside the jury trial system, which is created and governed by an elaborate set of statutory provisions and administered solely by government officials, including the trial judge, himself a state actor, who exercises substantial control over voir dire and effects 
Page 500 U. S. 615
 the final and practical denial of the excluded individual's opportunity to serve on the petit jury by discharging him or her.  Moreover, the action in question involves the performance of a traditional governmental function, see, e.g., Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461, since the peremptory challenge is used in selecting the jury, an entity that is a quintessential governmental body having no attributes of a private actor.  Furthermore, the injury allegedly caused by Leesville's use of peremptory challenges is aggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority, see Shelley v. Kramer, 334 U. S. 1, since the courtroom is a real expression of the government's constitutional authority, and racial exclusion within its confines compounds the racial insult inherent in judging a citizen by the color of his or her skin.  Pp.  500 U. S. 618-628.
(b) A private civil litigant may raise the equal protection claim of a person whom the opposing party has excluded from jury service on account of race.  Just as in the criminal context, see Powers, supra, all three of the requirements for third-party standing are satisfied in the civil context.  First, there is no reason to believe that the daunting barriers to suit by an excluded criminal juror, see id. at  499 U. S. 414, would be any less imposing simply because the person was excluded from civil jury service.  Second, the relation between the excluded venireperson and the litigant challenging the exclusion is just as close in the civil as it is in the criminal context.  See id. at  499 U. S. 413.  Third, a civil litigant can demonstrate that he or she has suffered a concrete, redressable injury from the exclusion of jurors on account of race, in that racial discrimination in jury selection casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process and places the fairness of the proceeding in doubt.  See id. at  499 U. S. 411.  Pp.  500 U. S. 628-631.
(c) The case is remanded for a determination whether Edmonson has established a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the approach set forth in Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 96-97, such that Leesville would be required to offer race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenges.  P.  500 U. S. 631.

(a) Race-based exclusion of potential jurors in a civil case violates the excluded persons' equal protection rights.  Cf., e.g., Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,  499 U. S. 402.  Although the conduct of private parties lies beyond the Constitution's scope in most instances, Leesville's exercise of peremptory challenges was pursuant to a course of state action, and is therefore subject to constitutional requirements under the analytical framework set forth in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922,  457 U. S. 939-942.  First, the claimed constitutional deprivation results from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority, since Leesville would not have been able to engage in the alleged discriminatory acts without 28 U.S.C.  1870, which authorizes the use of peremptory challenges in civil cases.  Second, Leesville must in all fairness be deemed a government actor in its use of peremptory challenges.  Leesville has made extensive use of government procedures with the overt, significant assistance of the government, see, e.g., Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478,  485 U. S. 486, in that peremptory challenges have no utility outside the jury trial system, which is created and governed by an elaborate set of statutory provisions and administered solely by government officials, including the trial judge, himself a state actor, who exercises substantial control over voir dire and effects 
Page 500 U. S. 615
 the final and practical denial of the excluded individual's opportunity to serve on the petit jury by discharging him or her.  Moreover, the action in question involves the performance of a traditional governmental function, see, e.g., Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461, since the peremptory challenge is used in selecting the jury, an entity that is a quintessential governmental body having no attributes of a private actor.  Furthermore, the injury allegedly caused by Leesville's use of peremptory challenges is aggravated in a unique way by the incidents of governmental authority, see Shelley v. Kramer, 334 U. S. 1, since the courtroom is a real expression of the government's constitutional authority, and racial exclusion within its confines compounds the racial insult inherent in judging a citizen by the color of his or her skin.  Pp.  500 U. S. 618-628.
(b) A private civil litigant may raise the equal protection claim of a person whom the opposing party has excluded from jury service on account of race.  Just as in the criminal context, see Powers, supra, all three of the requirements for third-party standing are satisfied in the civil context.  First, there is no reason to believe that the daunting barriers to suit by an excluded criminal juror, see id. at  499 U. S. 414, would be any less imposing simply because the person was excluded from civil jury service.  Second, the relation between the excluded venireperson and the litigant challenging the exclusion is just as close in the civil as it is in the criminal context.  See id. at  499 U. S. 413.  Third, a civil litigant can demonstrate that he or she has suffered a concrete, redressable injury from the exclusion of jurors on account of race, in that racial discrimination in jury selection casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process and places the fairness of the proceeding in doubt.  See id. at  499 U. S. 411.  Pp.  500 U. S. 628-631.
(c) The case is remanded for a determination whether Edmonson has established a prima facie case of racial discrimination under the approach set forth in Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 96-97, such that Leesville would be required to offer race-neutral explanations for its peremptory challenges.  P.  500 U. S. 631.

500 U.S. 646

Syllabus 
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires covered jurisdictions to obtain either judicial preclearance from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or administrative preclearance from the United States Attorney General before implementing new voting practices, in order to prevent changes that have a discriminatory purpose or effect.  Appellants, black registered voters and a voting rights organization in Louisiana, filed suit in the District Court, challenging the validity of Louisiana's electoral scheme for certain judges under, inter alia,  5.  In response to their 1987 amended complaint alleging that a number of statutory and constitutional changes, many of which were adopted in the late 1960's and 1970's, had not been precleared under  5, Louisiana submitted all of the unprecleared voting changes for administrative preclearance.  In June, 1990, after the Attorney General had objected to preclearance for some changes, including the creation of several judgeships, Louisiana asked him to reconsider and proceeded with plans to hold fall elections for all of the seats.  The District Court denied appellants' motion to enjoin the elections for the unprecleared seats, but enjoined the winners from taking office pending its further orders.  In October, the court, noting that some of the judgeships to which the Attorney General now objected were in districts where the State had obtained administrative preclearance for later-created judgeships, ruled that the Attorney General had precleared the earlier judgeships when he precleared the later, or related, voting changes.  The court also refused to enjoin elections for those judgeships that it found were subject to valid objections by the Attorney General and violated  5, holding that the winners could take office, pending judicial preclearance.
Held:
1. The District Court erred by not enjoining elections for judgeships to which the Attorney General interposed valid objections.  Section 5 requires preclearance.  Without it, a voting change will not be effective as law, Connor v. Waller, 421 U. S. 656, and is unenforceable, Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U. S. 255,  457 U. S. 269.  Moreover,  5 plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction prohibiting a State from implementing changes that have not been precleared, Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,  393 U. S. 572.  The court's reasons for refusing to enjoin the elections lack merit.  Appellants displayed no lack of diligence in challenging the elections, and every participant in the process knew for over three years that the challenged seats were unprecleared.  Nor was  5's applicability to judges uncertain until 1990, since this Court issued a summary affirmance of a decision holding that  5 applied to judges in 1986, Haith v. Martin, 618 F.Supp. 410, aff'd mem., 477 U.S. 901.  The court's concern about the potential for voter confusion and low voter turnout in a special election for the unprecleared seats did not justify its position, since voters may be more confused and inclined to avoid the polls when an election is held in conceded violation of federal law.  Moreover, the court's stated purpose to avoid possible challenges to civil and criminal judgments counsels in favor of enjoining the illegal elections, thus averting a federal challenge to state judgments.  This Court's decisions dealing with the ex post question whether to set aside illegal elections, see, e.g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, are inapposite to the instant case, which addresses the ex ante question whether to allow illegal elections to be held at all.  And it is not necessary to decide here whether there are instances in which a court may deny a motion for an injunction and allow an election to go forward.  Pp.  500 U. S. 652-655.
2. The State's failure to preclear certain earlier voting changes under  5 was not cured by the Attorney General's preclearance of later, or related, voting changes.  McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, made clear that the submission of legislation for administrative preclearance under  5 defines the preclearance request's scope.  Normally, a submission pertains only to identified changes in that legislation, and any ambiguity in the request's scope must be resolved against the submitting authority.  A submission's description of the change from one number of judges to another in a particular judicial district does not, by itself, constitute a submission to the Attorney General of the prior voting changes incorporated in the newly amended statute.  The requirement that a State identify each change is necessary for the Attorney General to perform his preclearance duties, since otherwise he would have to add to his redoubtable obligations the additional duty to research each submission to ensure that all earlier unsubmitted changes had been brought.  Here, Louisiana's submissions of contemporary legislation to the Attorney General failed as a matter of law to put him on notice that the prior unsubmitted changes were included.  Pp.  500 U. S. 655-659.
3. Appellants' request that the elections held for the seats in question be set aside and the judges be removed is not a proper matter for this Court to consider in the first instance.  Pp.  500 U. S. 659-660.

 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Opinion of Justice STEVENS, respecting the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari. 
 One of the questions presented in the certiorari petition is whether our per curiam decision in Cage v. Louisiana, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990), announced a new rule. This question, however, would only be presented by the record if the instructions in this case contained the same flaw as the instructions in Cage. In Cage, the jury was instructed that a reasonable doubt ""must be a doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty. . . ."" Id., at ___, 111 S.Ct., at 329. Because the instructions to the jury in this case did not contain this improper language, the question whether Cage announced a new rule is not actually presented here. For this reason, I think the Court has correctly decided not to grant certiorari to review that question. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting: 
 Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2973, 49 L. Ed.2d 859 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.

No. 90-5193
Argued Feb. 20, 1991
Decided May 30, 1991
500 U.S. 415

Syllabus 
Petitioner Mu'Min, a Virginia inmate serving time for first-degree murder, committed another murder while out of prison on work detail.  The case engendered substantial publicity in the local news media.  The trial judge denied his motion for individual voir dire and refused to ask any of his proposed questions relating to the content of news items that potential jurors might have seen or read.  Initially, the judge questioned the prospective jurors as a group, asking four separate questions about the effect on them of pretrial publicity or information about the case obtained by other means.  One juror who admitted to having formed a belief as to Mu'Min's guilt was excused for cause.  The judge then conducted further voir dire in panels of four, and each time a juror indicated that he had acquired knowledge about the case from outside sources, he was asked whether he had formed an opinion.  One juror who equivocated as to her impartiality was excused by the judge sua sponte, and several others were excused for various reasons.  Although 8 of the 12 eventually sworn admitted that they had read or heard something about the case, none indicated that they had formed an opinion based on the outside information, or would be biased in any way.  The jury found Mu'Min guilty of capital murder, and the judge sentenced him to death.  The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed, finding that, while a criminal defendant may properly ask on voir dire whether a juror has previously acquired any information about the case, the defendant does not have a constitutional right to explore the content of the acquired information, but is only entitled to know whether the juror can remain impartial in light of the previously obtained information.
Held:  The trial judge's refusal to question prospective jurors about the specific contents of the news reports to which they had been exposed did not violate Mu'Min's Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury or his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  500 U. S. 422-432.
(a) This Court's cases have stressed the wide discretion granted to trial courts in conducting voir dire in the area of pretrial publicity and in other areas that might tend to show juror bias.  For example, in holding that a trial court's voir dire questioning must ""cover the subject"" of possible juror racial bias, Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S. 308,  283 U. S. 311, the Court was careful not to specify the particulars by which this could be done.  Pp.  500 U. S. 422-424. 
Page 500 U. S. 416

(b) Mu'Min's assertion that voir dire must do more than merely ""cover the subject"" of pretrial publicity is not persuasive.  Although precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that a potential juror has read might reveal a sense of the juror's general outlook on life that would be of some use in exercising peremptory challenges, this benefit cannot be a basis for making ""content"" questions about pretrial publicity a constitutional requirement, since peremptory challenges are not required by the Constitution.  Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81,  487 U. S. 88.  Moreover, although content questions might be helpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial, such questions are constitutionally compelled only if the trial court's failure to ask them renders the defendant's trial fundamentally unfair.  See Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,  421 U. S. 799.  Furthermore, contrary to the situation in Aldridge, supra, 283 U.S. at  283 U. S. 311-313, there is no judicial consensus, or even weight of authority, favoring Mu'Min's position.  Even the Federal Courts of Appeals that have required content inquiries have not expressly done so on constitutional grounds.  Pp.  500 U. S. 424-427.
(c) Mu'Min misplaces his reliance on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, in which the Court held that pretrial publicity in connection with a capital trial had so tainted the particular jury pool that the defendant was entitled as a matter of federal constitutional law to a change of venue.  That case did not deal with any constitutional requirement of voir dire inquiry, and it is not clear from the Court's opinion how extensive an inquiry the trial court made.  Moreover, the pretrial publicity here, although substantial, was not nearly as damaging or extensive as that found to exist in Irvin.  While adverse pretrial publicity can create such a presumption of prejudice that the jurors' claims that they can be impartial should not be believed, Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025,  467 U. S. 1031, this is not such a case.  Pp.  500 U. S. 427-430.
(d) Mu'Min also misplaces his reliance on the American Bar Association's Standards For Criminal Justice, which require interrogation of each juror individually with respect to ""what [he] has read and heard about the case,"" ""[i]f there is a substantial possibility that [he] will be ineligible to serve because of exposure to potentially prejudicial material.""  These standards leave to the trial court the initial determination of whether there is such a substantial possibility; are based on a substantive for-cause eligibility standard that is stricter than the impartiality standard required by the Constitution, see Patton, supra, 467 U.S. at  467 U. S. 1035; and have not commended themselves to a majority of the courts that have considered the question.  Pp.  500 U. S. 430-431.
(e) The two-part voir dire examination conducted by the trial court in this case was by no means perfunctory, and adequately covered the subject of possible bias by pretrial publicity.  P.  500 U. S. 431-432.
239 Va. 433, 389 S.E.2d 886, affirmed.

Although precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that a potential juror has read might reveal a sense of the juror's general outlook on life that would be of some use in exercising peremptory challenges, this benefit cannot be a basis for making ""content"" questions about pretrial publicity a constitutional requirement, since peremptory challenges are not required by the Constitution.  Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81,  487 U. S. 88.  Moreover, although content questions might be helpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial, such questions are constitutionally compelled only if the trial court's failure to ask them renders the defendant's trial fundamentally unfair.  See Murphy v. Florida, 421 U. S. 794,  421 U. S. 799.  Furthermore, contrary to the situation in Aldridge, supra, 283 U.S. at  283 U. S. 311-313, there is no judicial consensus, or even weight of authority, favoring Mu'Min's position.  Even the Federal Courts of Appeals that have required content inquiries have not expressly done so on constitutional grounds.  Pp.  500 U. S. 424-427.
(c) Mu'Min misplaces his reliance on Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, in which the Court held that pretrial publicity in connection with a capital trial had so tainted the particular jury pool that the defendant was entitled as a matter of federal constitutional law to a change of venue.  That case did not deal with any constitutional requirement of voir dire inquiry, and it is not clear from the Court's opinion how extensive an inquiry the trial court made.  Moreover, the pretrial publicity here, although substantial, was not nearly as damaging or extensive as that found to exist in Irvin.  While adverse pretrial publicity can create such a presumption of prejudice that the jurors' claims that they can be impartial should not be believed, Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025,  467 U. S. 1031, this is not such a case.  Pp.  500 U. S. 427-430.
(d) Mu'Min also misplaces his reliance on the American Bar Association's Standards For Criminal Justice, which require interrogation of each juror individually with respect to ""what [he] has read and heard about the case,"" ""[i]f there is a substantial possibility that [he] will be ineligible to serve because of exposure to potentially prejudicial material.""  These standards leave to the trial court the initial determination of whether there is such a substantial possibility; are based on a substantive for-cause eligibility standard that is stricter than the impartiality standard required by the Constitution, see Patton, supra, 467 U.S. at  467 U. S. 1035; and have not commended themselves to a majority of the courts that have considered the question.  Pp.  500 U. S. 430-431.
(e) The two-part voir dire examination conducted by the trial court in this case was by no means perfunctory, and adequately covered the subject of possible bias by pretrial publicity.  P.  500 U. S. 431-432.

Syllabus 
A pure dose of the hallucinogenic drug LSD is so small that it must be sold to retail customers in a ""carrier"" created by dissolving pure LSD and, inter alia, spraying the resulting solution on paper.  That paper is then cut into ""one-dose"" squares, which users swallow, lick, or drop into a beverage to release the drug.  Petitioners were convicted in the District Court of selling 10 sheets (1,000 doses) of blotter paper containing LSD, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a).  Section 841(b)(1)(B) calls for a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offense of distributing more than one gram of ""a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount"" of LSD.  Although petitioners' pure LSD weighed only 50 milligrams, the court included the total weight of the paper and LSD, 5.7 grams, in calculating their sentences, thus requiring the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence.  The 5.7 grams was also used to determine the base offense level under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (Sentencing Guidelines).  The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners' arguments that the carrier medium's weight should not be included for sentencing purposes, and, alternatively, that construing the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines to require the carrier medium's inclusion would violate the right to equal protection incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Held:
1. The statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentencing for trafficking in LSD.  Pp.  500 U. S. 456-464.
(a) Since the statute refers to a ""mixture or substance containing a detectable amount,"" the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.  This reading is supported by the history of Congress' attempts to control illegal drug distribution, and by the statute's structure.  Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of a pure drug was to be used to determine a sentence, having done so with respect to PCP and methamphetamine by providing for a mandatory minimum sentence based either on the weight of the mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drugs, or on lower weights of the pure drugs.  And Congress clearly intended the dilutant, 
Page 500 U. S. 454
 cutting agent, or carrier medium of heroin and cocaine to be included in those drugs' weight for sentencing purposes.  Pp.  500 U. S. 456-461.
(b) The blotter paper used here, and blotter paper customarily used to distribute LSD, is a ""mixture or substance containing a detectable amount"" of LSD.  Since neither the statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines define ""mixture,"" and it has no established common law meaning, it must be given its ordinary meaning, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,  498 U. S. 108, which is ""a portion of matter consisting of two or more components . . . that however thoroughly commingled are regarded as retaining a separate existence,"" Webster's Third New International Dictionary.  The LSD crystals left behind when the solvent evaporates are inside of the paper, so they are commingled with it, but the LSD does not chemically combine with the paper and, thus, retains a separate existence.  Using the dictionary definition would not allow the clause to be interpreted to include LSD in a bottle or in a car, since, unlike blotter paper, those containers are easily distinguished and separated from LSD.  Nor is there a reason to resort to the rule of lenity to construe the statute in petitioners' favor, since a straightforward reading of  841(b) does not produce a result so absurd or glaringly unjust as to raise a reasonable doubt about Congress' intent.  Pp.  500 U. S. 461-464.
2. This statutory construction is not unconstitutional.  Determining the lengths of sentences in accordance with the LSD carrier's weight is not arbitrary and, thus, does not violate due process.  The penalty scheme is intended to punish severely large-volume drug traffickers at any level, and it increases the penalty for such persons by measuring the quantity of the drugs according to their street weight in the diluted form in which they are sold, not their active component's net weight.  Thus, it was rational for Congress to set penalties based on the weight of blotter paper, the chosen tool of the trade for those trafficking in LSD.  Congress was also justified in seeking to avoid arguments about the accurate weight of pure drugs which might have been extracted from the paper if it had chosen to calibrate sentences according to that weight.  And, since the paper seems to be the carrier of choice, the vast majority of cases will do exactly what the sentencing scheme was designed to do -- punish more heavily those who deal in larger amounts of drugs.  That distributors with varying degrees of culpability might be subject to the same sentence does not mean that the penalty system for LSD distribution violates due process.  Moreover, the fact that there may be plausible arguments against describing blotter paper impregnated with LSD as a ""mixture or substance"" containing LSD does not mean that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, especially since any debate would center around the appropriate sentence, not the conduct's criminality, and since all but one of the courts that have decided the issue have held that the

 carrier medium's weight must be included in determining the appropriate sentence.  Pp.  500 U. S. 464-468.

Syllabus 
Suspecting that petitioner Burns had multiple personalities, one of which shot her sons while they slept, Indiana police sought the advice of respondent Reed, a state prosecutor, who told them they could question Burns under hypnosis.  While hypnotized, Burns referred to both herself and the assailant as ""Katie.""  Interpreting this as support for their multiple-personality theory, the officers detained Burns and again sought the advice of Reed, who told them that they ""probably had probable cause"" to arrest her.  During a subsequent county court probable cause hearing on a search warrant, one of the officers testified, in response to Reed's questioning, that Burns had confessed to the shootings, but neither the officer nor Reed informed the judge that the ""confession"" was obtained under hypnosis or that Burns had otherwise consistently denied guilt.  The warrant was issued on the basis of this misleading presentation, and Burns was charged with attempted murder, but her motion to suppress the statements given under hypnosis was granted before trial, and the charges were dropped.  She then filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against Reed, inter alios, alleging violations of various rights under the Federal Constitution and seeking compensatory and punitive damages.  The District Court granted Reed a directed verdict, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that he was absolutely immune from liability for giving legal advice to the officers and for his conduct at the probable cause hearing.
Held:  A state prosecuting attorney is absolutely immune from liability for damages under  1983 for participating in a probable cause hearing, but not for giving legal advice to the police.  Pp.  500 U. S. 484-496.
(a) Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, held that, in light of the immunity historically accorded prosecutors at common law and the interests supporting that immunity, state prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability under  1983 for their conduct in ""initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case,"" id. at  424 U. S. 431, insofar as that conduct is ""intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,"" id. at  424 U. S. 430.  Subsequent decisions are consistent with this functional approach, and have emphasized that the official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question.  See, e.g., Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219,  484 U. S. 224.  Pp.  500 U. S. 484-487. 
Page 500 U. S. 479

(b) The absolute immunity recognized in Imbler is applicable to Reed's appearance in court to support the search warrant application and his presentation of evidence at that hearing.  Burns claims only that Reed presented false evidence to the county court, and thereby facilitated the issuance of the warrant.  Such conduct was clearly addressed by the common law, which immunized a prosecutor, like other lawyers, from civil liability for making, or for eliciting from witnesses, false or defamatory statements in judicial proceedings, at least so long as the statements were related to the proceedings.  See, e.g., Yaselli v. Goff, 12 F.2d 396, 401-402, summarily aff'd, 275 U.S. 503.  Moreover, this immunity extended to any hearing before a tribunal which performed a judicial function.  See, e.g., ibid.  In addition to such common law support, absolute immunity in these circumstances is justified by the policy concerns articulated in Imbler.  Reed's actions clearly involve his ""role as advocate for the State,"" see 424 U.S. at  424 U. S. 431, n. 33, rather than his role as ""administrator or investigative officer,"" the protection for which the Court reserved judgment in Imbler, see id. at  424 U. S. 430-431, and n. 33.  Moreover, since the issuance of a warrant is unquestionably a judicial act, appearing at a probable cause hearing is ""intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.""  It is also connected with the initiation and conduct of a prosecution, particularly where, as here, the hearing occurs after the arrest.  Furthermore, since pretrial court appearances by the prosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect present a substantial likelihood of vexatious litigation that might have an untoward effect on the prosecutor's independence, absolute immunity serves the policy of protecting the judicial process, see id. at  424 U. S. 422-423, which, in any event, serves as a check on prosecutorial actions, see id. at  424 U. S. 429.  Pp.  500 U. S. 487-492.
(c) However, Reed has not met his burden of showing that the relevant factors justify an extension of absolute immunity to the prosecutorial function of giving legal advice to the police.  Neither he nor the court below has identified any historical or common law support for such an extension.  American common law was aware of the office of public prosecutor, and must guide this Court, which does not have a license to establish immunities from  1983 actions in the interests of what it judges to be sound public policy.  Nor do other factors authorize absolute immunity in these circumstances.  The risk of vexatious litigation is unavailing, since a suspect or defendant is not likely to be as aware of a prosecutor's role in giving advice as his role in initiating and conducting a prosecution, and since absolute immunity is designed to free the judicial process, rather than every litigation-inducing conduct, from harassment and intimidation.  The qualified immunity standard, which is today more protective of officials than it was at the time Imbler was decided, 
Page 500 U. S. 480
 provides ample support to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.  The argument that giving legal advice is related to a prosecutor's role in screening cases for prosecution and in safeguarding the fairness of the criminal judicial process proves too much, since almost any action by a prosecutor could be said to be in some way related to the ultimate decision whether to prosecute.  Moreover, that argument was implicitly rejected in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511.  Furthermore, although there are several checks other than civil litigation to prevent abuses of authority by prosecutors, one of the most important of those checks, the judicial process, will not necessarily restrain a prosecutor's out-of-court activities that occur prior to the initiation of a prosecution, particularly if the suspect is not eventually prosecuted.  Advising the police in the investigative phase of a criminal case is not so ""intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process"" that it qualifies for absolute prosecutorial immunity.

Syllabus 
Subsequent to Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U. S. 209, in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Michigan Public Employment Relations Act's agency shop provision and outlined permissible union uses of the ""service fee"" authorized by the provision, respondent Ferris Faculty Association (FFA), which is an affiliate of the Michigan Education Association (MEA) and the National Education Association (NEA), and which serves as the exclusive bargaining representative of the faculty of Michigan's Ferris State College, a public institution, entered into an agency shop arrangement with the college, whereby bargaining unit employees who do not belong to the FFA are required to pay it, the MEA, and the NEA a service fee equivalent to a union member's dues.  Petitioners, members of the Ferris faculty who objected to particular uses by the unions of their service fees, filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, 1985, and 1986, claiming, inter alia, that such uses for purposes other than negotiating and administering the collective bargaining agreement violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  As here relevant, the District Court held that certain of the union expenditures were constitutionally chargeable to petitioners.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-B, III-C, IV-B (except for the final paragraph), IV-D, IV-E, and IV-F, concluding that:
1. Abood and other of the Court's decisions in this area set forth guidelines for determining which activities a union constitutionally may charge to dissenting employees.  Specifically, chargeable activities must (1) be ""germane"" to collective bargaining activity; (2) be justified by the government's vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding ""free riders"" 
Page 500 U. S. 508
 who benefit from union efforts without paying for union services; and (3) not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.  Pp.  500 U. S. 514-519.
2. A local bargaining representative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct benefit of the objecting employees' bargaining unit.  Because the essence of the affiliation relationship is the notion that the parent union will bring to bear its often considerable economic, political, and informational resources when the local is in need of them, that part of a local's affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of resources potentially available to it is assessed for the bargaining unit's protection, even if it is not actually expended on that unit in any particular membership year.  Cf. Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435,  466 U. S. 448.  This does not give the local union carte blanche, since there must be some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately enure to the benefit of the local's members by virtue of their membership in the parent organization, and since the union bears the burden of proving the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.  Pp.  500 U. S. 522-524.
3. JUSTICE SCALIA's ""statutory duties"" test is not supported by this Court's cases, and must be rejected, since state labor laws are rarely precise in defining public sector unions' duties to their members, and therefore afford courts and litigants little guidance for determining which charges violate dissenting employees' First Amendment rights; since the test fails to acknowledge that effective representation often encompasses responsibilities extending beyond those specifically delineated by statute; and since the test turns constitutional doctrine on its head, making violations of freedom of speech dependent upon the terms of state statutes.  Pp.  500 U. S. 524-527.
4. In light of the foregoing general principles, certain of the union activities at issue may constitutionally be supported through objecting employees' funds.  Pp.  500 U. S. 527,  500 U. S. 529-532.
(a) NEA ""program expenditures"" destined for States other than Michigan and the expenses of an MEA publication, the Teacher's Voice, listed as ""Collective Bargaining"" are germane to collective bargaining and similar support services even though the activities in question do not directly benefit persons in petitioners' bargaining unit.  Pp.  500 U. S. 527.
(b) Information services such as portions of the Teacher's Voice that concern teaching and education generally, professional development, unemployment, job opportunities, MEA award programs, and other miscellaneous matters are neither political nor public in nature, are for the benefit of all, even though they do not directly concern the members of 
Page 500 U. S. 509
 petitioners' bargaining unit, and entail no additional infringement of First Amendment rights.  Cf. Ellis, 466 U.S. at  466 U. S. 456.  P.  500 U. S. 529.
(c) Participation by FFA delegates in the MEA and NEA conventions and in the 13E Coordinating Council meeting, an event at which bargaining strategies and representational policies are developed for bargaining units including petitioners', are likely to engender important affiliation benefits, since such conventions are essential to the union's discharge of its bargaining agent duties even though they are not solely devoted to FFA activities.  Cf. Ellis, 466 U.S. at  466 U. S. 448-449.  P.  500 U. S. 529-530.
(d) Expenses incident to preparation for a strike all concede would have been illegal under Michigan law are substantively indistinguishable from those appurtenant to collective bargaining negotiations, aid in those negotiations and enure to the direct benefit of members of the dissenters' unit, and impose no additional burden upon First Amendment rights.  Pp.  500 U. S. 530-532.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded in Parts III-A and IV-A, in the final paragraph of Part IV-B, and in Part IV-C, that certain other of the union activities at issue may not constitutionally be supported through objecting employees' funds.  Pp.  500 U. S. 519-522,  500 U. S. 527,  500 U. S. 528-529.
(a) Charging dissenters for lobbying, electoral, or other union political activities outside the limited context of contract ratification or implementation is not justified by the government's interest in promoting labor peace and avoiding ""free riders,"" and, most important, would compel dissenters to engage in core political speech with which they disagree, thus placing a burden upon their First Amendment rights that extends far beyond acceptance of the agency shop.  Pp.  500 U. S. 519-522.
(b) A union program designed to secure funds for public education in Michigan and that portion of the Teacher's Voice which reported those efforts were not shown to be oriented toward the ratification or implementation of petitioners' collective bargaining agreement.  P.  500 U. S. 527.
(c) Litigation that does not concern petitioners' bargaining unit and, by extension, union literature reporting on such litigation are not germane to the union's duties as exclusive bargaining representative.  Cf. Ellis, 466 U.S. at  466 U. S. 453.  Extra-unit litigation is akin to lobbying in its political and expressive nature, and may cover a diverse range of activities, from bankruptcy proceedings to employment discrimination.  P.  500 U. S. 528.
(d) Public relations efforts designed to enhance the reputation of the teaching profession and covering information picketing, media exposure, signs, posters, and buttons entail speech of a political nature in a public forum, are not sufficiently related to the union's collective bargaining functions, and extend beyond the negotiation and grievance-resolution

 contexts to impose a substantially greater burden upon First Amendment rights.  Ellis, 466 U.S. at  466 U. S. 456, distinguished.  Pp.  500 U. S. 528-529.
JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE SOUTER, although agreeing with JUSTICE BLACKMUN's disposition of many of the challenged expenditures, concluded that the Court's three-part test is neither required nor suggested by its earlier cases, and provides little, if any, guidance to parties or lower courts, and that a much more administrable test is implicit in the earlier decisions:  a union may constitutionally compel contributions from dissenting nonmembers in an agency shop only for the costs of performing the union's statutory duties as exclusive bargaining agent.  See, e.g., Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740,  367 U. S. 749,  367 U. S. 760-764,  367 U. S. 768; id. at  367 U. S. 787 (Black, J., dissenting).  Applying the latter test, JUSTICE SCALIA also concluded, inter alia, that a number of the challenged expenses, including those for public relations activities and lobbying, cannot be charged to nonmembers.

No. 89-1217
Argued Nov. 5, 1990
Decided May 30, 1991
500 U.S. 507

Syllabus 
Subsequent to Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U. S. 209, in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Michigan Public Employment Relations Act's agency shop provision and outlined permissible union uses of the ""service fee"" authorized by the provision, respondent Ferris Faculty Association (FFA), which is an affiliate of the Michigan Education Association (MEA) and the National Education Association (NEA), and which serves as the exclusive bargaining representative of the faculty of Michigan's Ferris State College, a public institution, entered into an agency shop arrangement with the college, whereby bargaining unit employees who do not belong to the FFA are required to pay it, the MEA, and the NEA a service fee equivalent to a union member's dues.  Petitioners, members of the Ferris faculty who objected to particular uses by the unions of their service fees, filed suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983, 1985, and 1986, claiming, inter alia, that such uses for purposes other than negotiating and administering the collective bargaining agreement violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  As here relevant, the District Court held that certain of the union expenditures were constitutionally chargeable to petitioners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that each of the activities in question was sufficiently related to the unions' duties as petitioners' exclusive collective bargaining representative to justify compelling petitioners to assist in subsidizing it.

No. 89-1690
Argued Jan . 8, 1991
Decided May 30, 1991
500 U.S. 565

Syllabus 
Police observed respondent Acevedo leave an apartment, known to contain marijuana, with a brown paper bag the size of marijuana packages they had seen earlier.  He placed the bag in his car's trunk, and, as he drove away, they stopped the car, opened the trunk and the bag, and found marijuana.  Acevedo's motion to suppress the marijuana was denied, and he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana for sale.  The California Court of Appeal held that the marijuana should have been suppressed.  Finding that the officers had probable cause to believe that the bag contained drugs but lacked probable cause to suspect that the car, itself, otherwise contained contraband, the court concluded that the case was controlled by United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, which held that police could seize movable luggage or other closed containers, but could not open them without a warrant, since, inter alia, a person has a heightened privacy expectation in such containers.
Held:  Police, in a search extending only to a container within an automobile, may search the container without a warrant where they have probable cause to believe that it holds contraband or evidence.  Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 -- which held that a warrantless search of an automobile based upon probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of crime in the light of an exigency arising out of the vehicle's likely disappearance did not contravene the Fourth Amendment's Warrant Clause -- provides one rule to govern all automobile searches.  Pp.  500 U. S. 569-581.
(a) Separate doctrines have permitted the warrantless search of an automobile to include a search of closed containers found inside the car when there is probable cause to search the vehicle, United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, but prohibited the warrantless search of a closed container located in a moving vehicle when there is probable cause to search only the container, Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753.  Pp.  500 U. S. 569-572.
(b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this Court from eliminating the warrant requirement of Sanders, which was specifically undermined in Ross.  The Chadwick-Sanders rule affords minimal protection to privacy interests.  Police, knowing that they may open a bag only if they are searching the entire car, may search more extensively 
Page 500 U. S. 566
 than they otherwise would in order to establish the probable cause Ross requires.  Cf. United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478.  And they may seize a container and hold it until they obtain a search warrant or search it without a warrant as a search incident to a lawful arrest.  Moreover, the search of a paper bag intrudes far less on individual privacy than does the incursion sanctioned in Carroll, where prohibition agents slashed a car's upholstery.  The Chadwick-Sanders rule also is the antithesis of a clear and unequivocal guideline and, thus, has confused courts and police officers and impeded effective law enforcement.  United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696; Oklahoma v. Castleberry, 471 U. S. 146, distinguished.  Pp.  500 U. S. 572-579.
(c) This holding neither extends the Carroll doctrine nor broadens the scope of permissible automobile searches.  In the instant case, the probable cause the police had to believe that the bag in the car's trunk contained marijuana now allows a warrantless search of the bag, but the record reveals no probable cause to search the entire vehicle.

|500 u.s. 322|"Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas
No. 89-1679
Argued Nov. 26, 1990
Decided May 28, 1991
500 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
Respondent Pinhas, an ophthalmologist on the staff of petitioner Midway Hospital Medical Center, filed a suit in the District Court, asserting a violation, inter alia, of  1 of the Sherman Act by Midway and other petitioners, including several doctors.  The amended complaint alleged, among other things, that petitioners conspired to exclude Pinhas from the Los Angeles ophthalmological services market when he refused to follow an unnecessarily costly surgical procedure used at Midway; that petitioners initiated peer review proceedings against him which did not conform to congressional requirements and which resulted in the termination of his Midway staff privileges; that, at the time he filed suit, petitioners were preparing to distribute an adverse report about him based on the peer review proceedings; that the provision of ophthalmological services affects interstate commerce because both physicians and hospitals serve nonresident patients and receive reimbursement from Medicare; and that reports from peer review proceedings are routinely distributed across state lines, and affect doctors' employment opportunities throughout the Nation.  The District Court dismissed the amended complaint, but the Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting petitioners' argument that the Act's jurisdictional requirements were not met because there was no allegation that interstate commerce would be affected by Pinhas' removal from Midway's staff.  Rather, the court found that Midway's peer review proceedings obviously affected the hospital's interstate commerce because they affected its entire staff, and that Pinhas need not make a particularized showing of the effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy.
Held:  Pinhas' allegations satisfy the Act's jurisdictional requirements.  To be successful, Pinhas need not allege an actual effect on interstate commerce.  Because the essence of any  1 violation is the illegal agreement itself, the proper analysis focuses upon the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were successful, not upon actual consequences.  And if the conspiracy alleged in the complaint is successful, as a matter of practical economics, there will be a reduction in the provision of ophthalmological services in the Los Angeles market.  Thus, petitioners erroneously contend that a boycott of a single surgeon, unlike a conspiracy to destroy a hospital department or a hospital, has no effect on 
Page 500 U. S. 323

			"|"Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas
No. 89-1679
Argued Nov. 26, 1990
Decided May 28, 1991
500 U.S. 322

Syllabus 
Respondent Pinhas, an ophthalmologist on the staff of petitioner Midway Hospital Medical Center, filed a suit in the District Court, asserting a violation, inter alia, of  1 of the Sherman Act by Midway and other petitioners, including several doctors.  The amended complaint alleged, among other things, that petitioners conspired to exclude Pinhas from the Los Angeles ophthalmological services market when he refused to follow an unnecessarily costly surgical procedure used at Midway; that petitioners initiated peer review proceedings against him which did not conform to congressional requirements and which resulted in the termination of his Midway staff privileges; that, at the time he filed suit, petitioners were preparing to distribute an adverse report about him based on the peer review proceedings; that the provision of ophthalmological services affects interstate commerce because both physicians and hospitals serve nonresident patients and receive reimbursement from Medicare; and that reports from peer review proceedings are routinely distributed across state lines, and affect doctors' employment opportunities throughout the Nation.  The District Court dismissed the amended complaint, but the Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting petitioners' argument that the Act's jurisdictional requirements were not met because there was no allegation that interstate commerce would be affected by Pinhas' removal from Midway's staff.  Rather, the court found that Midway's peer review proceedings obviously affected the hospital's interstate commerce because they affected its entire staff, and that Pinhas need not make a particularized showing of the effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy.
Held:  Pinhas' allegations satisfy the Act's jurisdictional requirements.  To be successful, Pinhas need not allege an actual effect on interstate commerce.  Because the essence of any  1 violation is the illegal agreement itself, the proper analysis focuses upon the potential harm that would ensue if the conspiracy were successful, not upon actual consequences.  And if the conspiracy alleged in the complaint is successful, as a matter of practical economics, there will be a reduction in the provision of ophthalmological services in the Los Angeles market.  Thus, petitioners erroneously contend that a boycott of a single surgeon, unlike a conspiracy to destroy a hospital department or a hospital, has no effect on

Syllabus 
At a hearing at which petitioner Braxton pleaded guilty to assault and firearm counts, but not guilty to the more serious charge of attempting to kill a United States marshal, the Government presented facts -- to which Braxton agreed -- showing, inter alia, that, after each of two instances in which marshals kicked open his door, Braxton fired a gunshot ""through the door opening,"" and the shots lodged in the door's front.  Over Braxton's objections, the District Court later sentenced him as though he had been convicted of the attempt to kill count, relying on a proviso in  1B1.2(a) of the U.S. Sentencing Comm'n Guidelines Manual.  Although  1B1.2(a) ordinarily requires a court to apply the Sentencing Guideline most applicable to the offense of conviction, the proviso allows the court, in the case of conviction by a guilty plea ""containing a stipulation"" that ""specifically establishes"" a more serious offense, to apply the Guideline most applicable to the stipulated offense.  The Court of Appeals upheld Braxton's sentence.
Held:  The court below misapplied the  1B1.2(a) proviso.  Pp.  500 U. S. 346-351.
(a) This Court will not resolve the question whether Braxton's guilty plea ""contain[ed] a stipulation"" within the proviso's meaning.  The Commission -- which was specifically charged by Congress with the duty to review and revise the Guidelines and given the unusual explicit power to decide whether and to what extent its amendments reducing sentences would be given retroactive effect -- has already undertaken a proceeding that will eliminate a conflict among the Federal Circuits over the precise question at issue here.

(b) Assuming that Braxton's agreement to the Government's facts constituted a ""stipulation,"" that stipulation does not ""specifically establis[h]"" an attempt to kill, as is required by the proviso. At best, the stipulation supports two reasonable readings -- one that Braxton shot across the room at the marshals when they entered, and one that he shot before they entered to frighten them off.  There is nothing in the latter reading from which an intent to kill -- a necessary element of the attempt to kill count -- could even be inferred.  Pp.  500 U. S. 349-351.

|500 u.s. 352|"Hernandez v. New York
No. 89-7645
Argued Feb. 25, 1991
Decided May 28, 1991
500 U.S. 352

Syllabus 
Counsel for petitioner Hernandez at his New York trial objected that the prosecutor had used four peremptory challenges to exclude Latino potential jurors.  Two of the jurors had brothers who had been convicted of crimes, and petitioner no longer presses his objection to exclusion of those individuals.  The ethnicity of one of the other two jurors was uncertain.  Without waiting for a ruling on whether Hernandez had established a prima facie case of discrimination under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, the prosecutor volunteered that he had struck these two jurors, who were both bilingual, because he was uncertain that they would be able to listen and follow the interpreter.  He explained that they had looked away from him and hesitated before responding to his inquiry whether they would accept the translator as the final arbiter of the witnesses' responses; that he did not know which jurors were Latinos; and that he had no motive to exclude Latinos from the jury, since the complainants and all of his civilian witnesses were Latinos.  The court rejected Hernandez's claim, and its decision was affirmed by the state appellate courts.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
75 N.Y.2d 350, 553 N.Y.S.2d 85, 552 N.E.2d 621, affirmed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SOUTER, announced the judgment of the Court, concluding that the prosecutor did not use peremptory challenges in a manner violating the Equal Protection Clause.  Under Batson's three-step process for evaluating an objection to peremptory challenges, (1) a defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race, (2) the burden then shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question, and (3) the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.  Pp.  500 U. S. 358-372.
(a) Since the prosecutor offered an explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue whether Hernandez made a prima facie showing of discrimination is moot.  Cf. United States Postal Service Bd. of Govs. v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711,  460 U. S. 715.  P.  500 U. S. 359. 
Page 500 U. S. 353

(b) The prosecutor offered a race-neutral basis for his peremptory strikes.  The issue here is the facial validity of the prosecutor's explanation, which must be based on something other than race.  While the prosecutor's criterion for exclusion -- whether jurors might have difficulty in accepting the translator's rendition of Spanish-language testimony -- might have resulted in the disproportionate removal of prospective Latino jurors, it is proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose that is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,  429 U. S. 264-265.  This Court need not address Hernandez's argument that Spanish-speaking ability bears such a close relation to ethnicity that exercising a peremptory challenge on the former ground violates equal protection, since the prosecutor explained that the jurors' specific responses and demeanor, and not their language proficiency alone, caused him to doubt their ability to defer to the official translation.  That a high percentage of bilingual jurors might hesitate before answering questions like those asked here and, thus, would be excluded under the prosecutor's criterion would not cause the criterion to fail the race neutrality test.  The reason offered by the prosecutor need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause, but the fact that it corresponds to a valid for-cause challenge will demonstrate its race-neutral character.  Pp.  500 U. S. 359-363.
(c) The trial court did not commit clear error in determining that the prosecutor did not discriminate on the basis of the Latino jurors' ethnicity.  A trial court should give appropriate weight to the disparate impact of the prosecutor's criterion in determining whether the prosecutor acted with a forbidden intent, even though that factor is not conclusive in the preliminary race neutrality inquiry.  Here, the court chose to believe the prosecutor's explanation and reject Hernandez's assertion that the reasons were pretextual.  That decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal, regardless of whether it is a state court decision and whether it relates to a constitutional issue.  See, e.g., 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335,  479 U. S. 351.  Deference makes particular sense in this context because the finding will largely turn on an evaluation of credibility.  Hernandez's argument that there should be ""independent"" appellate review of a state trial court's denial of a Batson claim is rejected.  Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485; Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587, distinguished.  Here, the court took a permissible view of the evidence in crediting the prosecutor's explanation.  Apart from the prosecutor's demeanor, the court could have relied on the facts that he defended his use of peremptory challenges without being asked to do so by 
Page 500 U. S. 354
 the judge, that he did not know which jurors were Latinos, and that ethnicity of the victims and the prosecution witnesses tended to undercut any motive to exclude Latinos from the jury.  Moreover, the court could rely on the facts that only three of the challenged jurors can with confidence be identified as Latinos, and that the prosecutor had a verifiable and legitimate explanation for two of those challenges.  Pp.  500 U. S. 363-370.
(d) This decision does not imply that exclusion of bilinguals from jury service is wise, or even constitutional in all cases.  It may be, for certain ethnic groups and in some communities, that proficiency in a particular language, like skin color, should be treated as a surrogate for race under an equal protection analysis.  Cf., e.g., Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, 271 U. S. 500.  And, a policy of striking all who speak a given language, without regard to the trial's particular circumstances or the jurors' individual responses, may be found by the trial judge to be a pretext for racial discrimination.  Pp.  500 U. S. 370-372.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, while agreeing that the Court should review for clear error the trial court's finding as to discriminatory intent, and that the finding of no discriminatory intent was not clearly erroneous in this case, concluded that JUSTICE KENNEDY's opinion goes further than necessary in assessing the constitutionality of the prosecutor's asserted justification for his peremptory strikes.  If, as in this case, the trial court believes the prosecutor's nonracial justification, and that finding is not clearly erroneous, that is the end of the inquiry.  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, does not require that a prosecutor justify a jury strike at the level of a for-cause challenge or that the justification be unrelated to race.  Batson requires only that the prosecutor's reason for striking a juror not be the juror's race.  Pp.  500 U. S. 372-375.

Argued March 18, 1991
Decided May 28, 1991
500 U.S. 380

Syllabus 
In a dispute between Illinois and Kentucky over their common boundary, the Special Master has recommended that this Court determine the boundary to be the ""low water mark on the northerly side of the Ohio River as it existed in the year 1792,"" rather than the river's northerly low water mark ""as it exists from time to time""; find that the record does not support Kentucky's affirmative defenses of acquiescence and laches and its defenses based on ""principles of riparian boundaries, including accretion, erosion and avulsion""; find that the construction of dams on the river has caused the present low water mark on the Illinois side to be farther north than it was in 1792; and order the two States' common boundary to be determined as nearly as the 1792 line can now be ascertained.  Kentucky has filed exceptions.
Held:
1. The boundary is the line of the low water mark as it was in 1792.  Pp.  500 U. S. 383-388.
(a) This is the rule that was used to determine the boundary between Kentucky and its neighboring States of Ohio, Ohio v. Kentucky, 444 U. S. 335, and Indiana, Indiana v. Kentucky, 136 U. S. 479; and the history and precedent that supplied the rule in those cases govern here.  P.  500 U. S. 383-384.
(b) Kentucky has not proved that, under the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, the boundary is a transient low water mark.  The record fails to support Kentucky's claim of a long and continuous possession of, and assertion of sovereignty over, land within the territory delimited by the transient mark.  Kentucky has imposed property taxes on only 3 of the 15 structures extending into the territory in question.  And evidence of its ad valorem taxation of barges and other watercraft traveling on the river fails to speak directly to the boundary issue, since it is undisputed that the sailing line on the river is within Kentucky's boundary and jurisdiction, and since barges and watercraft would rarely venture near the disputed territory.  Moreover, both the Legislative Research Commission of the Kentucky General Assembly and the Commonwealth's Attorney General have made references to the 1792 low water mark as the boundary.  Nor does the record support the claim of Illinois' acquiescence.  The descriptions of the boundary as following ""along [the Ohio River's] north-western shore"" in earlier versions of the 
Page 500 U. S. 381
 Illinois Constitution are verbatim recitations of the congressional language describing Illinois' boundary in that State's Enabling Act, and the Special Master correctly reasoned that Congress intended Illinois' southern boundary to be the same as that granted Ohio and Indiana when they were formed.  In addition, the Illinois Supreme Court took an even less hospitable view toward Kentucky's claim than the State Constitution when it adopted, and used for almost 50 years, a theory that would have ratchetted the boundary line forever southward toward the river's deepest point.  Pp.  500 U. S. 384-388.
(c) Kentucky's other affirmative defenses are likewise unavailing.  The laches defense is generally inapplicable against a State.  And the defenses based on the ""principles of riparian boundaries"" require no extended consideration, for Kentucky concedes that these would affect the ultimate boundary determination only if it prevailed on the issues of prescription and acquiescence.  P.  500 U. S. 388-389.
2. Kentucky's exception to the recommended finding that the construction of dams on the river has permanently raised its level above that of 1792, consequently placing the present low water mark on the Illinois side farther north than it was in 1792, is sustained.  Any question about the relative locations of the 1792 line and today's low water mark is premature, and should be determined after the Special Master has made further recommendations to resolve any disputes the parties may have about the exact location of the 1792 line.  Pp.  500 U. S. 389.
Exceptions to Special Master's Report sustained in part and overruled in part, Report adopted in part, and case remanded.
SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

1. The boundary is the line of the low water mark as it was in 1792.  Pp.  500 U. S. 383-388.
(a) This is the rule that was used to determine the boundary between Kentucky and its neighboring States of Ohio, Ohio v. Kentucky, 444 U. S. 335, and Indiana, Indiana v. Kentucky, 136 U. S. 479; and the history and precedent that supplied the rule in those cases govern here.  P.  500 U. S. 383-384.
(b) Kentucky has not proved that, under the doctrine of prescription and acquiescence, the boundary is a transient low water mark.  The record fails to support Kentucky's claim of a long and continuous possession of, and assertion of sovereignty over, land within the territory delimited by the transient mark.  Kentucky has imposed property taxes on only 3 of the 15 structures extending into the territory in question.  And evidence of its ad valorem taxation of barges and other watercraft traveling on the river fails to speak directly to the boundary issue, since it is undisputed that the sailing line on the river is within Kentucky's boundary and jurisdiction, and since barges and watercraft would rarely venture near the disputed territory.  Moreover, both the Legislative Research Commission of the Kentucky General Assembly and the Commonwealth's Attorney General have made references to the 1792 low water mark as the boundary.  Nor does the record support the claim of Illinois' acquiescence.  The descriptions of the boundary as following ""along [the Ohio River's] north-western shore"" in earlier versions of the 
Page 500 U. S. 381
 Illinois Constitution are verbatim recitations of the congressional language describing Illinois' boundary in that State's Enabling Act, and the Special Master correctly reasoned that Congress intended Illinois' southern boundary to be the same as that granted Ohio and Indiana when they were formed.  In addition, the Illinois Supreme Court took an even less hospitable view toward Kentucky's claim than the State Constitution when it adopted, and used for almost 50 years, a theory that would have ratchetted the boundary line forever southward toward the river's deepest point.  Pp.  500 U. S. 384-388.
(c) Kentucky's other affirmative defenses are likewise unavailing.  The laches defense is generally inapplicable against a State.  And the defenses based on the ""principles of riparian boundaries"" require no extended consideration, for Kentucky concedes that these would affect the ultimate boundary determination only if it prevailed on the issues of prescription and acquiescence.  P.  500 U. S. 388-389.
2. Kentucky's exception to the recommended finding that the construction of dams on the river has permanently raised its level above that of 1792, consequently placing the present low water mark on the Illinois side farther north than it was in 1792, is sustained.  Any question about the relative locations of the 1792 line and today's low water mark is premature, and should be determined after the Special Master has made further recommendations to resolve any disputes the parties may have about the exact location of the 1792 line.  Pp.  500 U. S. 389.
Exceptions to Special Master's Report sustained in part and overruled in part, Report adopted in part, and case remanded.

Syllabus 
Petitioner Yates and Henry Davis robbed a South Carolina grocery store owned by Willie Wood.  After Yates wounded Wood, he fled the store, but Davis remained, struggling with Wood.  When Wood's mother entered the store and grabbed Davis, he stabbed her once, killing her.  Wood then killed Davis.  Subsequently, Yates was arrested and charged, inter alia, with accomplice murder.  At his trial, the State argued that Yates and Davis had planned to rob the store and kill any witnesses, thus making Yates as guilty of the murder as Davis under South Carolina law, because it was a probable or natural consequence of the robbery.  As to the element of malice, the judge instructed the jury, among other things, that ""malice is implied or presumed"" from either the ""willful, deliberate, and intentional doing of an unlawful act"" or from the ""use of a deadly weapon.""  Yates was convicted, and his conviction was upheld by the State Supreme Court.  He then sought a writ of habeas corpus from that court, asserting that the presumption on the use of a deadly weapon was an unconstitutional burden-shifting instruction under, inter alia, this Court's decisions in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, and Francs v. Franklin, 471 U. S. 307, which found that similar jury instructions violated the Due Process Clause.  Twice the court denied relief, and twice this Court remanded the case for further consideration in light of Francis.  On the second remand, the state court again denied relief, holding that, although unconstitutional, both instructions allowing the jury to presume malice were harmless error.  It found that its enquiry was to determine
""whether it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found it unnecessary to rely on the erroneous mandatory presumption regarding the element of malice.""
Concluding that the State relied on Davis' malice to prove murder, the court found that the jury did not have to rely on the malice presumptions, because the facts showed that Davis had acted with malice when he ""lunged"" at Mrs. Wood and stabbed her multiple times.
Held:
1. The State Supreme Court failed to apply the proper harmless error standard, as stated in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18,  386 U. S. 24, which held that an error is harmless if it appears ""beyond a reasonable doubt 
Page 500 U. S. 392
 that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.""  Pp.  500 U. S. 400-407.
(a) An error does ""not contribute to a verdict"" only if it is unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record.  In applying Chapman, a court must first ask what evidence the jury actually considered in reaching its verdict, and it must then weigh the probative force of that evidence as against the probative force of the presumption standing alone.  It is not enough that the jury considered evidence from which it could have reached the verdict without reliance on the presumption.  The issue is whether the jury actually rested its verdict on evidence establishing the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, independently of the presumption.  Before looking to the entire trial record to assess the significance of the erroneous presumption, however, it is crucial to ascertain from the jury instructions that the jurors, as reasonable persons, would have considered that entire trial record.  Pp.  500 U. S. 402-406.
(b) The State Supreme Court employed a deficient standard of review.  Its stated enquiry can determine that the verdict could have been the same without the presumptions, when there was evidence sufficient to support the verdict independently of the presumptions' effect.  However, it does not satisfy Chapman's concerns, because it fails to determine whether the jury's verdict did rest on that evidence as well as on the presumptions, or whether that evidence was of such compelling force as to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the presumptions must have made no difference in reaching the verdict.  Pp.  500 U. S. 406-407.
2. The jury instructions may not be excused as harmless error.  Pp.  500 U. S. 407-411.
(a) Judicial economy is best served if this Court makes its own assessment of the errors' harmlessness in the first instance, because this case has already been remanded twice, once for such an analysis.  See Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570,  478 U. S. 584.  P.  500 U. S. 407.
(b) The trial judge instructed the jury that malice is the equivalent of an intent to kill.  While it can be inferred from the instructions and the record that the jury considered all of the evidence regarding Davis' intent to kill, it cannot be inferred beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful presumptions did not contribute to the finding on the necessary element of malice that Davis intended to kill Mrs. Wood, since the evidentiary record is simply not clear on that issue.  While an examination of the entire record reveals clear evidence of Davis' intent to kill Willie Wood, the jury was not instructed on a transferred intent theory and, thus, this Court is barred from treating such evidence as underlying the necessary finding of intent to kill Mrs. Wood.  The specific circumstances of Mrs. Wood's death do not indicate Davis' malice in killing her

 so convincingly that it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the jurors rested a finding of his malice on that evidence exclusive of the presumptions.  The record does not support the state court's description of Davis as having ""lunged"" at her and stabbed her multiple times.  The record reveals only that she joined in a struggle and died from a single stab wound, which Davis could have inflicted inadvertently.  Pp.  500 U. S. 407-411.

 Supreme Court of the United States 
 May 28, 1991
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting from denial of certiorari. 
 The question presented in this case is the scope of federal jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which criminalizes the making of false statements ""in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States."" Petitioner was convicted under that statute for making false statements on an application for Georgia state unemployment insurance benefits. The state program is certified by the United States Department of Labor to receive federal funds which are used only for administrative expenses, not for benefits. Receipt by the state program of these federal funds entitles the Department of Labor to oversee whether the state program's administrative structure complies with federal requirements, but does not entitle it to monitor the 
Page 500 U.S. 946, 947
 program's operation or award of benefits. The Department of Labor is also entitled to receive information about benefit claimants as part of the certification process, but it cannot withhold certification based on the state program's payment of fraudulent claims. Petitioner's false statements were discovered during an investigation of the state program by the Department of Labor. 
 The trial court rejected petitioner's claim that the statute did not confer federal jurisdiction over his conduct. Petitioner then entered a conditional guilty plea and was sentenced to one year in prison, which was suspended, and two years' probation. In affirming petitioner's conviction, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit determined that its prior decision in United States v. Suggs, 755 F.2d 1538 (CA11 1985), was controlling. See United States v. Herring, 916 F.2d 1543 (CA11 1990). In Suggs, the court had held that the use of federal funds by a state agency is generally sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction under 1001. 755 F.2d, at 1542. The court in the instant case recognized, however, that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has reached a contrary result on similar facts. In United States v. Facchini, 874 F.2d 638 (CA9 1989) (en banc), that court declared that jurisdiction under 1001 does not exist ""unless a direct relationship obtains between the false statement and an authorized function of a federal agency or department,"" id., at 641, and that because the Department of Labor has no power to control the award of state unemployment benefits, this direct relationship is lacking, id., at 641-642. 
 Respondent United States also acknowledges the conflict between the Eleventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, but asserts that the issue does not merit review both because it arises infrequently and because the Justice Department has determined that it is inappropriate for the Department of Labor to investigate false statements on state applications for unemployment benefits, so that future prosecutions are unlikely. Although the Government maintains that the Eleventh Circuit was correct in determining that federal jurisdiction exists, the asserted position of the Justice Department suggests otherwise. If the Eleventh Circuit's view is indeed erroneous, then petitioner has been convicted for conduct which is not a federal crime, and for which he would not have been convicted had his prosecution arisen in the Ninth Circuit. I would grant certiorari to resolve the conflict.

Nos. 89-1391, 89-1392
Argued Oct. 30, 1990
Decided May 23, 1991
500 U.S. 173

Syllabus 
Section 1008 of the Public Health Service Act specifies that none of the federal funds appropriated under the Act's Title X for family-planning services ""shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.""  In 1988, respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that, inter alia, prohibit Title X projects from engaging in counseling concerning, referrals for, and activities advocating abortion as a method of family planning, and require such projects to maintain an objective integrity and independence from the prohibited abortion activities by the use of separate facilities, personnel, and accounting records.  Before the regulations could be applied, petitioners -- Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds -- filed suits, which were consolidated, challenging the regulations' facial validity and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their implementation.  In affirming the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the Secretary, the Court of Appeals held that the regulations were a permissible construction of the statute and consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments.
Held:
1. The regulations are a permissible construction of Title X.  Pp.  500 U. S. 183-191.
(a) Because  1008 is ambiguous, in that it does not speak directly to the issues of abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy, or to ""program integrity,"" the Secretary's construction must be accorded substantial deference as the interpretation of the agency charged with administering the statute, and may not be disturbed as an abuse of discretion if it reflects a plausible construction of the statute's plain language and does not otherwise conflict with Congress' expressed intent.  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,  467 U. S. 842-844.  P.  500 U. S. 184.
(b) Title X's broad language plainly allows the abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy regulations.  Since the Title neither defines 
Page 500 U. S. 174
  1008's ""method of family planning"" phrase nor enumerates what types of medical and counseling services are entitled to funding, it cannot be said that the Secretary's construction of the  1008 prohibition to require a ban on such activities within Title X projects is impermissible.  Moreover, since the legislative history is ambiguous as to Congress' intent on these issues, this Court will defer to the Secretary's expertise.  Petitioners' contention, that the regulations are entitled to little or no deference because they reverse the Secretary's longstanding policy permitting nondirective counseling and referral for abortion, is rejected.  Because an agency must be given ample latitude to adapt its rules to changing circumstances, a revised interpretation may deserve deference.  The Secretary's change of interpretation is amply supported by a ""reasoned analysis"" indicating that the new regulations are more in keeping with the statute's original intent, are justified by client experience under the prior policy, and accord with a shift in attitude against the ""elimination of unborn children by abortion.""  Pp.  500 U. S. 184-187.
(c) The regulations' ""program integrity"" requirements are not inconsistent with Title X's plain language.  The Secretary's view, that the requirements are necessary to ensure that Title X grantees apply federal funds only to authorized purposes and avoid creating the appearance of governmental support for abortion-related activities, is not unreasonable in light of  1008's express prohibitory language and is entltled to deference.  Petitioners' contention is unpersuasive that the requirements frustrate Congress' intent, clearly expressed in the Act and the legislative history, that Title X programs be an integral part of a broader, comprehensive, health care system that envisions the efficient use of non-Title X funds.  The statements relied on are highly generalized and do not directly address the scope of  1008 and, therefore, cannot form the basis for enjoining the regulations.  Indeed, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended that Title X funds be kept separate and distinct from abortion-related activities.  Moreover, there is no need to invalidate the regulations in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality, since petitioners' constitutional arguments do not carry the day.  Pp.  500 U. S. 187-191.
2. The regulations do not violate the First Amendment free speech rights of private Title X fund recipients, their staffs, or their patients by impermissibly imposing viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on Government subsidies.  There is no question but that  1008's prohibition is constitutional, since the Government may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.  Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464,  432 U. S. 474.  In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of another.  Similarly, 
Page 500 U. S. 175
 in implementing the statutory prohibition by forbidding counseling, referral, and the provision of information regarding abortion as a method of family planning, the regulations simply ensure that appropriated funds are not used for activities, including speech, that are outside the federal program's scope.  Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, distinguished.  Petitioners' view that, if the Government chooses to subsidize one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart rights, has been soundly rejected.  See, e.g., Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540.  On their face, the regulations cannot be read, as petitioners contend, to bar abortion referral or counseling where a woman's life is placed in imminent peril by her pregnancy, since it does not seem that such counseling could be considered a ""method of family planning"" under  1008, and since provisions of the regulations themselves contemplate that a Title X project could engage in otherwise prohibited abortion-related activities in such circumstances.  Nor can the regulations' restrictions on the subsidization of abortion-related speech be held to unconstitutionally condition the receipt of a benefit, Title X funding, on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion advocacy and counseling.  The regulations do not force the Title X grantee, or its employees, to give up abortion-related speech; they merely require that such activities be kept separate and distinct from the activities of the Title X project.  FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364,  468 U. S. 400; Regan, supra, 461 U.S. at  461 U. S. 546, distinguished.  Although it could be argued that the traditional doctor-patient relationship should enjoy First Amendment protection from Government regulation, even when subsidized by the Government, cf., e.g., United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720,  497 U. S. 726, that question need not be resolved here, since the Title X program regulations do not significantly impinge on the doctor-patient relationship.  Pp.  500 U. S. 192-200.
3. The regulations do not violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy.  The Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because it is constitutionally protected, and may validly choose to allocate public funds for medical services relating to childbirth but not to abortion.  Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490,  492 U. S. 510.  That allocation places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman wishing to terminate her pregnancy, and leaves her with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family planning services at all.  See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297,  448 U. S. 315,  448 U. S. 317; Webster, supra, 492 U. S. 509.  Nor do the regulations place restrictions on the patient/doctor dialogue which violate a woman's right to make an informed and voluntary choice under Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 
Page 500 U. S. 176
 416, and Thornburg v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747.  Unlike the laws invalidated in those cases, which required all doctors to provide all pregnant patients contemplating abortion with specific antiabortion information, here, a doctor's ability to provide, and a woman's right to receive, abortion-related information remains unfettered outside the context of the Title X project.  The fact that most Title X clients may be effectively precluded by indigency from seeing a health care provider for abortion-related services does not affect the outcome here, since the financial constraints on such a woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions, but of her indigency.

			"|"Rust v. Sullivan
Nos. 89-1391, 89-1392
Argued Oct. 30, 1990
Decided May 23, 1991
500 U.S. 173

Syllabus 
Section 1008 of the Public Health Service Act specifies that none of the federal funds appropriated under the Act's Title X for family-planning services ""shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.""  In 1988, respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that, inter alia, prohibit Title X projects from engaging in counseling concerning, referrals for, and activities advocating abortion as a method of family planning, and require such projects to maintain an objective integrity and independence from the prohibited abortion activities by the use of separate facilities, personnel, and accounting records.  Before the regulations could be applied, petitioners -- Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds -- filed suits, which were consolidated, challenging the regulations' facial validity and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their implementation.  In affirming the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the Secretary, the Court of Appeals held that the regulations were a permissible construction of the statute and consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments.
Held:
1. The regulations are a permissible construction of Title X.  Pp.  500 U. S. 183-191.
(a) Because  1008 is ambiguous, in that it does not speak directly to the issues of abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy, or to ""program integrity,"" the Secretary's construction must be accorded substantial deference as the interpretation of the agency charged with administering the statute, and may not be disturbed as an abuse of discretion if it reflects a plausible construction of the statute's plain language and does not otherwise conflict with Congress' expressed intent.  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,  467 U. S. 842-844.  P.  500 U. S. 184.
(b) Title X's broad language plainly allows the abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy regulations.  Since the Title neither defines 
Page 500 U. S. 174
  1008's ""method of family planning"" phrase nor enumerates what types of medical and counseling services are entitled to funding, it cannot be said that the Secretary's construction of the  1008 prohibition to require a ban on such activities within Title X projects is impermissible.  Moreover, since the legislative history is ambiguous as to Congress' intent on these issues, this Court will defer to the Secretary's expertise.  Petitioners' contention, that the regulations are entitled to little or no deference because they reverse the Secretary's longstanding policy permitting nondirective counseling and referral for abortion, is rejected.  Because an agency must be given ample latitude to adapt its rules to changing circumstances, a revised interpretation may deserve deference.  The Secretary's change of interpretation is amply supported by a ""reasoned analysis"" indicating that the new regulations are more in keeping with the statute's original intent, are justified by client experience under the prior policy, and accord with a shift in attitude against the ""elimination of unborn children by abortion.""  Pp.  500 U. S. 184-187.
(c) The regulations' ""program integrity"" requirements are not inconsistent with Title X's plain language.  The Secretary's view, that the requirements are necessary to ensure that Title X grantees apply federal funds only to authorized purposes and avoid creating the appearance of governmental support for abortion-related activities, is not unreasonable in light of  1008's express prohibitory language and is entltled to deference.  Petitioners' contention is unpersuasive that the requirements frustrate Congress' intent, clearly expressed in the Act and the legislative history, that Title X programs be an integral part of a broader, comprehensive, health care system that envisions the efficient use of non-Title X funds.  The statements relied on are highly generalized and do not directly address the scope of  1008 and, therefore, cannot form the basis for enjoining the regulations.  Indeed, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended that Title X funds be kept separate and distinct from abortion-related activities.  Moreover, there is no need to invalidate the regulations in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality, since petitioners' constitutional arguments do not carry the day.  Pp.  500 U. S. 187-191.
2. The regulations do not violate the First Amendment free speech rights of private Title X fund recipients, their staffs, or their patients by impermissibly imposing viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on Government subsidies.  There is no question but that  1008's prohibition is constitutional, since the Government may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.  Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464,  432 U. S. 474.  In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of another.  Similarly, 
Page 500 U. S. 175
 in implementing the statutory prohibition by forbidding counseling, referral, and the provision of information regarding abortion as a method of family planning, the regulations simply ensure that appropriated funds are not used for activities, including speech, that are outside the federal program's scope.  Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, distinguished.  Petitioners' view that, if the Government chooses to subsidize one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart rights, has been soundly rejected.  See, e.g., Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540.  On their face, the regulations cannot be read, as petitioners contend, to bar abortion referral or counseling where a woman's life is placed in imminent peril by her pregnancy, since it does not seem that such counseling could be considered a ""method of family planning"" under  1008, and since provisions of the regulations themselves contemplate that a Title X project could engage in otherwise prohibited abortion-related activities in such circumstances.  Nor can the regulations' restrictions on the subsidization of abortion-related speech be held to unconstitutionally condition the receipt of a benefit, Title X funding, on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion advocacy and counseling.  The regulations do not force the Title X grantee, or its employees, to give up abortion-related speech; they merely require that such activities be kept separate and distinct from the activities of the Title X project.  FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364,  468 U. S. 400; Regan, supra, 461 U.S. at  461 U. S. 546, distinguished.  Although it could be argued that the traditional doctor-patient relationship should enjoy First Amendment protection from Government regulation, even when subsidized by the Government, cf., e.g., United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720,  497 U. S. 726, that question need not be resolved here, since the Title X program regulations do not significantly impinge on the doctor-patient relationship.  Pp.  500 U. S. 192-200.
3. The regulations do not violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy.  The Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because it is constitutionally protected, and may validly choose to allocate public funds for medical services relating to childbirth but not to abortion.  Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490,  492 U. S. 510.  That allocation places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman wishing to terminate her pregnancy, and leaves her with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family planning services at all.  See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297,  448 U. S. 315,  448 U. S. 317; Webster, supra, 492 U. S. 509.  Nor do the regulations place restrictions on the patient/doctor dialogue which violate a woman's right to make an informed and voluntary choice under Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 
Page 500 U. S. 176
 416, and Thornburg v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747.  Unlike the laws invalidated in those cases, which required all doctors to provide all pregnant patients contemplating abortion with specific antiabortion information, here, a doctor's ability to provide, and a woman's right to receive, abortion-related information remains unfettered outside the context of the Title X project.  The fact that most Title X clients may be effectively precluded by indigency from seeing a health care provider for abortion-related services does not affect the outcome here, since the financial constraints on such a woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions, but of her indigency.

No. 90-96
Argued Feb. 19, 1991
Decided May 23, 1991
500 U.S. 226

Syllabus 
In seeking to become ""credentialed"" in his new job at an Army hospital, petitioner Siegert, a clinical psychologist, asked his former employer, a federal hospital, to provide job performance and other information to his new employer.  Respondent Gilley, Siegert's supervisor at his former job, responded with a letter declaring that he could not recommend Siegert because he was inept, unethical, and untrustworthy.  After he was denied credentials and his federal service employment was terminated, Siegert filed a damages action against Gilley in the District Court, alleging, inter alia, that, under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, Gilley had caused an infringement of his ""liberty interests"" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment ""by maliciously and in bad faith publishing a defamatory per se statement . . . which [he] knew to be untrue.""  Gilley filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, asserting, among other things, the defense of qualified immunity under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, and contending that Siegert's factual allegations did not state the violation of any constitutional right ""clearly established"" at the time of the complained-of actions, see id. at  457 U. S. 818.  The court ultimately found Siegert's allegations to be sufficient, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions that the case be dismissed.  Although assuming that bad-faith motivation would suffice to make Gilley's actions in writing the letter a violation of Siegert's clearly established constitutional rights, the court held that Siegert's particular allegations were insufficient under its ""heightened pleading standard"" to overcome Gilley's qualified immunity claim.
Held:  The Court of Appeals properly concluded that the District Court should have dismissed Siegert's suit because he had not overcome Gilley's qualified immunity defense.  Siegert failed to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right -- indeed, of any constitutional right at all -- since, under Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693,  424 U. S. 708-709, injury to reputation, by itself, is not a protected ""liberty"" interest.  He therefore failed to satisfy the necessary threshold inquiry in the determination of a qualified immunity claim.  See, e.g., Harlow, supra, at  457 U. S. 818.  Thus, although the Court of Appeals reached the correct result, it should not have assumed without deciding the necessary preliminary

Having stopped respondent Jimeno's car for a traffic infraction, police officer Trujillo, who had been following the car after overhearing Jimeno arranging what appeared to be a drug transaction, declared that he had reason to believe that Jimeno was carrying narcotics in the car, and asked permission to search it.  Jimeno consented, and Trujillo found cocaine inside a folded paper bag on the car's floorboard.  Jimeno was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of Florida law, but the state trial court granted his motion to suppress the cocaine on the ground that his consent to search the car did not carry with it specific consent to open the bag and examine its contents.  The Florida District Court of Appeal and Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:  A criminal suspect's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches is not violated when, after he gives police permission to search his car, they open a closed container found within the car that might reasonably hold the object of the search.  The Amendment is satisfied when, under the circumstances, it is objectively reasonable for the police to believe that the scope of the suspect's consent permitted them to open the particular container.  Here, the authorization to search extended beyond the car's interior surfaces to the bag, since Jimeno did not place any explicit limitation on the scope of the search, and was aware that Trujillo would be looking for narcotics in the car, and since a reasonable person may be expected to know that narcotics are generally carried in some form of container.

No. 89-1918
Argued Jan. 8, 1991
Decided May 23, 1991
500 U.S. 257

Syllabus 
Petitioner McCormick, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1984, was a leading advocate of a legislative program allowing foreign medical school graduates to practice under temporary permits while studying for the state licensing exams.  Some doctors practiced for years under the program, as they repeatedly failed those exams.  He sponsored a bill, sought by an organization of those doctors, extending the program's expiration date and later agreed to sponsor legislation in the 1985 session that would grant the doctors a permanent license by virtue of their years of experience.  After advising the doctors' lobbyist, during his 1984 reelection campaign, that, inter alia, he had heard nothing from the doctors, he received four cash payments from them, which he neither listed as campaign contributions nor reported as income on his 1984 federal income tax return.  In 1985, he sponsored the permanent licensing legislation, and, after it was enacted, he received another payment from the doctors.  Subsequently, he was indicted in the Federal District Court on five counts of violating the Hobbs Act, by extorting payments under color of official right, and one count of filing a false income tax return.  The jury was instructed that extortion under color of official right does not occur where a ""public official receives a . . . voluntary political contribution,"" and that ""[v]oluntary is that which is freely given without expectation of benefit.""  The jury was also instructed on the tax count that a ""voluntary"" political contribution is not taxable income provided that the money is used for campaign expenses.  McCormick was convicted of one Hobbs Act count and the tax violation, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  It found that an elected official's conviction under the Hobbs Act does not require proof of a quid pro quo -- a payment made in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act -- unless the payments are ""legitimate"" campaign contributions.  It then listed seven factors to be considered in making an extortion determination, and concluded that McCormick extorted money from the doctors, and that the parties never intended that money to be a campaign contribution.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals erred in affirming McCormick's conviction under the Hobbs Act, because a quid pro quo is necessary for a conviction 
Page 500 U. S. 258
 when an official receives a campaign contribution, regardless of whether it is a legitimate contribution.  Pp.  500 U. S. 268-275.
(a) The court affirmed the conviction on legal and factual grounds that were never submitted to the jury when it announced a rule of law for determining when payments are made under color of official right and found sufficient evidence to support its extortion findings.  Assuming that the court was correct on the law, the judgment should have been set aside and a new trial ordered, since matters of intent are for the jury to consider, and since each of the court's seven factors presents an issue of historical fact.  Pp.  500 U. S. 269-270.
(b) A Hobbs Act violation would not be made out here even assuming an unfavorable response to all seven of the Court of Appeals' inquiries, including the factors of whether the official acted in his official capacity at or near the time of payment, whether he had supported legislation before the payment, and whether he had solicited the payor individually.  To hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for their constituents' benefit or support legislation furthering their constituents' interests, shortly before or after they solicit or receive campaign contributions from those beneficiaries, is an unrealistic assessment of what Congress could have meant when it made obtaining property from another ""under color of official right"" a crime.  Rather, under these circumstances, property is extorted in violation of the Hobbs Act only when an official asserts that his official conduct will be controlled by the terms of the promise or undertaking.  Pp.  500 U. S. 271-274.
(c) The Government's argument that the jury convicted on the basis that the payment was not a campaign contribution is mere speculation, since the instructions permitted the jury to find McCormick guilty of extortion if the payment, even though a campaign contribution, was not voluntary.  Nor can the tax conviction be relied on to show that the jury believed that the payment was not a contribution for Hobbs Act purposes, since the instruction on the tax count also failed to require the jury to find that the payment was not a contribution before it could convict on that count.  Pp.  500 U. S. 274-275.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in basing its affirmance of the tax conviction solely on the extortion conviction.  The extortion conviction does not demonstrate that the payments were not campaign contributions, and hence taxable, since the instructions permitted the jury to convict McCormick of the tax charge if it was convinced that the payments were campaign contributions, but was also convinced that the money was extorted.  However, this finding does not necessarily exhaust the possible grounds for affirming on the tax count.  Pp.  500 U. S. 275-276.

(a) The court affirmed the conviction on legal and factual grounds that were never submitted to the jury when it announced a rule of law for determining when payments are made under color of official right and found sufficient evidence to support its extortion findings.  Assuming that the court was correct on the law, the judgment should have been set aside and a new trial ordered, since matters of intent are for the jury to consider, and since each of the court's seven factors presents an issue of historical fact.  Pp.  500 U. S. 269-270.
(b) A Hobbs Act violation would not be made out here even assuming an unfavorable response to all seven of the Court of Appeals' inquiries, including the factors of whether the official acted in his official capacity at or near the time of payment, whether he had supported legislation before the payment, and whether he had solicited the payor individually.  To hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for their constituents' benefit or support legislation furthering their constituents' interests, shortly before or after they solicit or receive campaign contributions from those beneficiaries, is an unrealistic assessment of what Congress could have meant when it made obtaining property from another ""under color of official right"" a crime.  Rather, under these circumstances, property is extorted in violation of the Hobbs Act only when an official asserts that his official conduct will be controlled by the terms of the promise or undertaking.  Pp.  500 U. S. 271-274.
(c) The Government's argument that the jury convicted on the basis that the payment was not a campaign contribution is mere speculation, since the instructions permitted the jury to find McCormick guilty of extortion if the payment, even though a campaign contribution, was not voluntary.  Nor can the tax conviction be relied on to show that the jury believed that the payment was not a contribution for Hobbs Act purposes, since the instruction on the tax count also failed to require the jury to find that the payment was not a contribution before it could convict on that count.  Pp.  500 U. S. 274-275.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in basing its affirmance of the tax conviction solely on the extortion conviction.  The extortion conviction does not demonstrate that the payments were not campaign contributions, and hence taxable, since the instructions permitted the jury to convict McCormick of the tax charge if it was convinced that the payments were campaign contributions, but was also convinced that the money was extorted.  However, this finding does not necessarily exhaust the possible grounds for affirming on the tax count.  Pp.  500 U. S. 275-276.

Argued March 25, 1991
Decided May 23, 1991
500 U.S. 291

Syllabus 
When petitioner Farrey and respondent Sanderfoot divorced, a Wisconsin court awarded each one-half of their marital estate.  Among other things, the decree awarded Farrey's interest in the family home and real estate to Sanderfoot and ordered him to make payments to Farrey to equalize their net marital assets.  To secure the award, the court granted Farrey a lien against Sanderfoot's real property.  Sanderfoot did not pay Farrey, and subsequently filed for bankruptcy, listing the marital home and real estate as exempt homestead property.  The Bankruptcy Court denied his motion to avoid Farrey's lien under 11 U.S.C.  522(f)(1) -- which provides, inter alia, that a debtor ""may avoid the fixing of a [judicial] lien on an interest of the debtor in property"" -- finding that the lien could not be avoided because it protected Farrey's preexisting interest in the marital property.  The District Court reversed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Section 522(f)(1) requires a debtor to have possessed an interest to which a lien attached, before it attached, to avoid the fixing of a lien on that interest.  The statute does not permit avoidance of any lien on a property, but instead expressly permits avoidance of ""the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor.""  A fixing that takes place before the debtor acquires an interest, by definition, is not on the debtor's interest.  This reading fully comports with  522(f)'s purpose, which is to protect the debtor's exempt property, and its legislative history, which suggests that Congress primarily intended  522(f)(1) as a device to thwart creditors who, sensing an impending bankruptcy, rush to court to obtain a judgment to defeat the debtor's exemptions.  To permit lien avoidance where the debtor at no point possessed the interest without the judicial lien would allow judicial lienholders to be defrauded through the conveyance of an encumbered interest to a prospective debtor.  Pp.  500 U. S. 295-299.
2. Farrey's lien cannot be avoided under  522(f)(1).  The parties agree that, under state law, the divorce decree extinguished their joint tenancy, in which each had an undivided one-half interest, and created new interests in place of the old.  Thus, her lien fixed not on Sanderfoot's preexisting interest, but rather on the fee simple interest that he 
Page 500 U. S. 292
 was awarded in the decree that simultaneously granted Farrey her lien.  The result is the same even if the decree merely reordered the couple's preexisting interests, since the lien would have fastened only to what had been Farrey's preexisting interest, an interest that Sanderfoot would never have possessed without the lien already having fixed.  To permit Sanderfoot to use the Bankruptcy Code to deprive Farrey of protection for her own preexisting homestead interest would neither follow the statute's language nor serve its main goal.

Syllabus 
The Bankruptcy Code allows States to define what property is exempt from the estate that will be distributed among the debtor's creditors.  The Florida Constitution provides a homestead exemption, which the state courts have held inapplicable to liens that attach before the property in question acquires its homestead status.  Petitioner purchased his Florida condominium in 1984 subject to respondent's preexisting judgment lien, and the property first qualified as a homestead under a 1985 amendment to the State's homestead law.  After petitioner filed a chapter 7 petition for bankruptcy in 1986, the Bankruptcy Court, inter alia, sustained his claimed homestead exemption in the condominium, but subsequently denied his postdischarge motion to avoid respondent's lien pursuant to Code  522(f).  The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that, since the lien had attached before the condominium qualified for the homestead exemption, the property was not exempt under state law.
Held:
1. Judicial liens can be eliminated under  522(f) even though the State has defined the exempt property in such a way as specifically to exclude property encumbered by such liens.  The section provides, inter alia, that
""the debtor may avoid the fixing of a [judicial] lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under,""
in effect,  522(d), which lists federal exemptions, or under state law.  At first blush, respondent's argument seems entirely reasonable that her lien does not ""impair"" petitioner's Florida homestead exemption within the meaning of  522(f) because the exemption is not assertable against preexisting judicial liens, and that permitting avoidance of the lien would not preserve the exemption, but expand it.  However, this result has been widely and uniformly rejected by federal bankruptcy courts with respect to federal exemptions under  522(d).  To determine the application of  522(f), those courts ask not whether the lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor is in fact entitled, but whether it impairs an exemption to which he would have been entitled but for the lien itself.  This approach, which gives meaning to the phrase ""would have been entitled"" in the applicable text, is correct.  A different approach cannot be adopted

Syllabus 
Petitioners, organizations and individuals seeking the humane treatment of animals, filed suit in a Louisiana court to enjoin respondents, the Institutes for Behavior Resources (IBR), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund (Tulane), from using certain monkeys for federally funded medical experiments and to obtain custody over the animals.  NIH removed the case to the Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1442(a)(1), which permits removal when the defendant is
""[a]ny officer of the United States or any agency thereof, or person acting under him, [in a suit challenging] any act under color of such office. . . .""
The court granted the equivalent of a preliminary injunction barring NIH from euthanizing, and completing medical research on, some of the monkeys.  However, the Court of Appeals vacated the injunction and dismissed the case, finding that petitioners lacked Article III standing to seek protection of the monkeys, and that federal agencies have the power to remove cases under  1442(a)(1).
Held:
1. Petitioners have standing to challenge the removal of the case.  They have suffered an injury -- the lost right to sue in the forum of their choice -- that can be traced to NIH's action -- the removal.  And, if they prevail, their injury will be redressed because the federal courts will lose subject matter jurisdiction and the case will be remanded.  Although the Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners lacked standing to seek protection of the monkeys, the adverseness required for standing to contest the removal is supplied by petitioners' desire to prosecute their claims in state court.  Pp.  500 U. S. 76-78.
2. Section 1442(a)(1) excludes agencies from the removal power.  Pp.  500 U. S. 78-87.
(a) The section's grammar and language support the view that removal power is granted only to an ""officer"" either ""of the United States"" or of one of its agencies.  If the phrase ""or any agency thereof"" described a separate category of entities endowed with removal power, it would have been separated from the preceding phrase by a comma in the 
Page 500 U. S. 72
 same way that the subsequent ""person acting under him"" clause is set apart.  In addition, the ""acting under"" clause makes little sense if the immediately preceding words -- which should contain the antecedent for ""him"" -- refer to an agency, rather than to an individual.  Nor would an agency normally be described as exercising authority ""under color"" of an ""office.""  IBR mistakenly contends that the ""agency thereof"" language is redundant unless it signifies the agency itself because any agency officer is necessarily an officer of the United States.  However, when  1442(a)(1) was enacted in 1948, the relationship between certain independent agencies and the United States Government was often disputed.  Thus, it is more likely that Congress inserted the language to eliminate any doubt that officers of entities like the Tennessee Valley Authority had the same removal authority as other officers of the United States.  Pp.  500 U. S. 79-82.
(b) Also unpersuasive is NIH's alternative basis for agency removal power.  Reading the phrase ""person acting under him"" to refer to an agency acting under an officer is rather tortured.  Moreover, in common usage. the term ""person"" does not include the sovereign, especially where such a reading is decidedly awkward.  And there is no support in  1442(a)(1)'s legislative history for the argument that Congress' intent to extend removal authority to agencies can be inferred from contemporary changes it made to the federal administrative structure that created, and selectively waived the sovereign immunity of, several independent agencies.  Pp.  500 U. S. 82-84.
(c) This construction of  1442(a)(1) does not produce absurd results.  Congress could rationally have intended to have removability turn on the technicality of whether plaintiffs named an agency or only individual officers as defendants.  The removal statute's nine incarnations preceding  1442(a)(1)'s 1948 enactment clearly reflect Congress' belief that even hostile state courts could make the determination of an agency's sovereign immunity, and, hence, agencies would not need the protection of federal removal.  By contrast, the question of federal officers' immunity was much more complicated, since the determination whether a federal officer had acted ultra vires was fraught with difficulty and subject to considerable manipulation.  Thus, even in 1948, Congress could have concluded that officers needed the protection of a federal forum in which to raise their federal defenses.  Pp.  500 U. S. 84-87.

This case must be remanded to state court under the terms of 28 U.S.C.  1447(c), which declares that a removed case over which a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction ""shall be remanded.""

No. 90-516
Argued March 27, 1991
Decided May 20, 1991
500 U.S. 90

Syllabus 
Petitioner Kamen is a shareholder of respondent Cash Equivalent Fund, Inc. (Fund), a mutual fund whose investment adviser is respondent Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS).  The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA), which requires, inter alia, that at least 40% of a mutual fund's directors be financially independent of the investment adviser, that shareholders approve the contract between a fund and an adviser, and that dealings between the fund and the adviser measure up to a fiduciary standard.  In a shareholder's derivative action brought on behalf of the Fund against KFS, Kamen alleged that KFS had obtained shareholder approval of the investment adviser contract by causing the Fund to issue a materially misleading proxy statement in violation of the ICA, and that she had made no precomplaint demand on the Fund's board of directors because doing so would have been futile.  The District Court granted KFS' motion to dismiss on the ground that she had failed to plead the facts excusing demand with sufficient particularity for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that her failure to make a precomplaint demand was fatal and adopting as a rule of federal common law the American Law Institute's ""universal demand"" rule, which abolishes the futility exception to demand.

Pp.  500 U. S. 97-100.
(c) The Court of Appeals drew its demand rule from an improper source when it disregarded state law relating to the futility exception.  The demand requirement determines who -- the directors or the individual shareholder -- has the power to control corporate litigation, and thus clearly relates to the allocation of governing powers within the corporation.  States recognizing the futility exception place a limit upon the directors' usual power to control the initiation of corporate litigation.  In many States, the futility exception also determines the directors' power to terminate corporate litigation once initiated.  Superimposing a universal demand rule over these States' corporate doctrine would clearly upset the balance that they have struck between the individual shareholder's power and the directors' power to control corporate litigation.  KFS' proposal to detach the demand requirement from the standard for reviewing the directors' action would require federal courts to develop a body of review principles that would replicate the substantive effect of the States' demand futility doctrine, thus imposing on federal courts the very duty to fashion an entire body of federal corporate law that Burks sought to avoid.  Moreover, such a project would infuse corporate decisionmaking with uncertainty, and any likely judicial economies associated with the proposal do not justify replacing the entire corpus of state corporation law relating to demand futility.  Pp.  500 U. S. 101-107.
(d) The futility exception is not inconsistent with the policies underlying the ICA.  KFS mistakenly argues that allowing shareholders to bring suit without a board's permission permits them to usurp the independent directors' managerial oversight responsibility.  The ICA embodies a congressional expectation that the independent directors will look after a fund's interests by exercising only the authority granted to

No. 90-516
Argued March 27, 1991
Decided May 20, 1991
500 U.S. 90

Syllabus 
Petitioner Kamen is a shareholder of respondent Cash Equivalent Fund, Inc. (Fund), a mutual fund whose investment adviser is respondent Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS).  The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA), which requires, inter alia, that at least 40% of a mutual fund's directors be financially independent of the investment adviser, that shareholders approve the contract between a fund and an adviser, and that dealings between the fund and the adviser measure up to a fiduciary standard.  In a shareholder's derivative action brought on behalf of the Fund against KFS, Kamen alleged that KFS had obtained shareholder approval of the investment adviser contract by causing the Fund to issue a materially misleading proxy statement in violation of the ICA, and that she had made no precomplaint demand on the Fund's board of directors because doing so would have been futile.  The District Court granted KFS' motion to dismiss on the ground that she had failed to plead the facts excusing demand with sufficient particularity for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that her failure to make a precomplaint demand was fatal and adopting as a rule of federal common law the American Law Institute's ""universal demand"" rule, which abolishes the futility exception to demand.  While acknowledging that courts should incorporate state law when fashioning federal common law rules to fill the interstices of private causes of action brought under federal security laws, the court held that, because Kamen had not until her reply brief adverted to the established status of the futility exception under the law of Maryland, the Fund's State of incorporation, her challenge to the court's power to adopt a universal demand rule came too late to be considered.

No. 88-7247
Argued Feb. 19, 1991
Decided May 20. 1991
500 U.S. 110

Syllabus 
At petitioner Lankford's arraignment on two counts of first-degree murder, the Idaho trial judge advised him that the maximum punishment under state law that he could receive if convicted on either charge was life imprisonment or death.  A jury found him guilty on both counts, and, prior to his sentencing hearing, the court entered an order requiring the State to provide notice whether it would seek the death penalty.  The State filed a negative response, and there was no discussion of the death penalty as a possible sentence at the sentencing hearing, where both defense counsel and the prosecutor argued the merits of concurrent or consecutive, and fixed or indeterminate, sentence terms.  At the hearing's conclusion, however, the trial judge indicated that he considered Lankford's testimony unworthy of belief, stated that the crimes' seriousness warranted punishment more severe than that recommended by the State, and mentioned the possibility of death as a sentencing option.  Subsequently, he sentenced Lankford to death based, inter alia, on five specific aggravating circumstances.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected Lankford's claim that the trial court violated the Constitution by failing to give notice of its intention to consider imposing the death sentence despite the State's notice that it was not seeking that penalty.  The court concluded that the express advice given Lankford at his arraignment, together with the terms of the Idaho Code, were sufficient notice to him that the death penalty might be imposed.
Held:  The sentencing process in this case violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, at the time of the sentencing hearing, Lankford and his counsel did not have adequate notice that the judge might sentence him to death.  There is nothing in the record after the State's response to the presentencing order and before the judge's remarks at the end of the hearing to indicate that the judge contemplated death as a possible sentence or to alert the parties that the real issue they should have been debating at the hearing was the choice between life and death.  Moreover, the presentencing order was comparable to a pretrial order limiting the issues to be tried, such that it was reasonable for the defense to assume that there was no reason to present argument or evidence directed at whether the death penalty was either appropriate or permissible.  If defense counsel had had fair notice that the judge was contemplating a death sentence, presumably she would 
Page 500 U. S. 111
 have advanced arguments at the sentencing hearing addressing the aggravating circumstances identified by the judge and his reasons for disbelieving Lankford; she did not make these and other arguments, because they were entirely inappropriate in a discussion about the length of Lankford's incarceration.  Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that the notice provided by statute and the arraignment survived the State's response to the presentencing order.  The trial judge's silence following that response had the practical effect of concealing from the parties the principal issues to be decided at the hearing, and thereby created an impermissible risk that the adversary process may have malfunctioned in this case.

Syllabus 
Petitioner brought a District Court suit against various state prison officials alleging that, in violation of his constitutional rights, they used excessive force when transferring him from one cell to another.
Although he waived a jury trial and initially consented to have a magistrate try the entire case pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  636(c)(1), petitioner was permitted at trial to withdraw his consent to the Magistrate's jurisdiction.  However, the Magistrate ruled that he was nonetheless authorized to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to submit proposed findings of fact and a recommended disposition to the court under  636(b)(1)(B), which authorizes the nonconsensual referral to magistrates for such purposes ""of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.""  (Emphasis added.)  The District Court overruled petitioner's objection to the Magistrate's role and accepted the Magistrate's recommended findings and judgment for defendants.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 636(b)(1)(B) does not, as petitioner contends, permit nonconsensual referrals to a magistrate only when a prisoner challenges ongoing prison conditions, but encompasses cases alleging a specific episode of unconstitutional conduct by prison administrators.  Pp.  500 U. S. 138-144.
(a) Although the most natural reading of the phrase ""challenging conditions of confinement,"" when viewed in isolation, would not include suits seeking relief from isolated episodes of unconstitutional conduct,  636(b)(1)(B)'s text, when read in its entirety, suggests that Congress intended to include the two primary categories of prisoner suits -- habeas corpus applications and actions for monetary or injunctive relief -- and thus to authorize the nonconsensual reference of all prisoner petitions to a magistrate.  This interpretation is bolstered by Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475,  411 U. S. 498-499, which, just three years before  636(b)(1)(B) was drafted, described the same two broad categories of prisoner petitions and unambiguously embraced challenges to specific instances of unconstitutional conduct within ""conditions of confinement.""  The fact that Congress may have used the latter term to mean ongoing situations in other legislation having a different purpose cannot alter the interpretation of the  636(b)(1)(B) language that so clearly parallels the Preiser opinion.  Moreover, adoption of the Preiser definition comports with 
Page 500 U. S. 137
  636(b)(1)(B)'s central purpose of assisting federal judges in handling an ever-increasing caseload.  Pp.  500 U. S. 138-144.
(b) Petitioner argues that, because a prisoner is constitutionally entitled to a jury trial in a damages action arising out of a specific episode of misconduct, it is unlikely that Congress would authorize a nonconsensual reference in such a case to a magistrate who may not conduct a jury trial.  This argument is not persuasive.  Petitioner's statutory reading concededly would not eliminate in all actions the potential constitutional difficulty he identifies.  More important, the statute, properly interpreted, is not constitutionally infirm in cases like this one, in which the plaintiff waived the right to a jury trial, nor in cases in which the jury right exists and is not waived, in which the lower courts, guided by the principle of constitutional avoidance, have consistently held that the statute does not authorize reference to a magistrate.

Syllabus 
Michigan's ""rape-shield"" statute generally prohibits a criminal defendant from introducing at trial evidence of an alleged rape victim's past sexual conduct.  However, a statutory exception permits a defendant to introduce evidence of his own past sexual conduct with the victim, provided that he files a written motion and an offer of proof within 10 days after he is arraigned, whereupon the trial court may hold an in camera hearing to determine whether the proposed evidence is admissible.  Because respondent Lucas failed to give the statutorily required notice and, therefore, no admissibility hearing was held, a state court refused to let him introduce, at his bench trial on charges of criminal sexual assault, evidence of a prior sexual relationship with the victim, his ex-girlfriend.  He was convicted and sentenced to prison, but the State Court of Appeals reversed, adopting a per se rule that the statutory notice-and-hearing requirement violates the Sixth Amendment in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of a past sexual relationship between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.
1. Assuming, arguendo, that the Michigan rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion of the evidence as a remedy for a defendant's failure to comply with the notice-and-hearing requirement, the State Court of Appeals erred in adopting a per se rule that such preclusion is unconstitutional in all cases.  The Sixth Amendment is not so rigid.  The notice-and-hearing requirement serves legitimate state interests:  protecting rape victims against surprise, harassment, and unnecessary invasions of privacy and protecting against surprise to the prosecution.  This Court's decisions demonstrate that such interests may justify even the severe sanction of preclusion in an appropriate case.  Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400,  484 U. S. 413-414,  484 U.

Syllabus 
The Controlled Substances Act authorizes the Attorney General, upon compliance with specified procedures, to add new drugs to five ""schedules"" of controlled substances, the manufacture, possession, and distribution of which the Act regulates or prohibits.  Because compliance with the Act's procedures resulted in lengthy delays, drug traffickers were able to develop and market ""designer drugs"" -- which have pharmacological effects similar to, but chemical compositions slightly different from, scheduled substances -- long before the Government was able to schedule them and initiate prosecutions.  To combat this problem, Congress added  201(h) to the Act, creating an expedited procedure by which the Attorney General can schedule a substance on a temporary basis when doing so is ""necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety,"" and providing that a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicial review.  The Attorney General promulgated regulations delegating, inter alia, his temporary scheduling power to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which subsequently temporarily designated the designer drug ""Euphoria"" as a schedule I controlled substance.  While that temporary order was in effect, petitioners were indicted for manufacturing and conspiring to manufacture Euphoria.  The District Court denied their motion to dismiss, rejecting their contentions that  201(h) unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Attorney General, and that the Attorney General improperly delegated his temporary scheduling authority to the DEA.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' subsequent convictions.
Held:
1. Section 201(h) does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to the Attorney General.  Pp.  500 U. S. 164-169.
(a) The nondelegation doctrine does not prevent Congress from seeking assistance from a coordinate Branch, so long as it lays down an ""intelligible principle"" to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform.  See, e.g., J. W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394,  276 U. S. 409.  Section 201(h)'s ""imminent hazard to public safety"" standard is concededly such a principle.  Moreover, even if more specific guidance is required when Congress authorizes another Branch to promulgate regulations that contemplate criminal sanctions,  201(h) 
Page 500 U. S. 161
 passes muster.  Although it features fewer procedural requirements than the permanent scheduling statute, the section meaningfully constrains the Attorney General by placing multiple specific restrictions on his discretion to define criminal conduct.  He must also satisfy  202(b)'s requirements for adding substances to schedules.  Pp.  500 U. S. 164-167.
(b) Section 201(h) does not violate the principle of separation of powers by concentrating too much power in the Attorney General, who also wields the power to prosecute crimes.  The separation of powers principle focuses on the distribution of powers among the three coequal Branches of Government, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,  488 U. S. 382, and does not speak to the manner in which Congress parcels out authority within the Executive Branch.  P.  500 U. S. 167-168.
(c) Section 201(h) does not violate the nondelegation doctrine by barring judicial review.  Since  507 of the Act plainly authorizes judicial review of a permanent scheduling order, the effect of the  201(h) bar is merely to postpone legal challenges to a scheduling order until the administrative process has run its course.  Moreover, the  201(h) bar does not preclude an individual facing criminal charges from bringing a challenge to a temporary scheduling order as a defense to prosecution.  In these circumstances, the nondelegation doctrine does not require in addition an opportunity for preenforcement review of administrative determinations.  Pp.  500 U. S. 168-169.
2. The Attorney General did not improperly delegate his temporary scheduling power to the DEA.  Section 501(a) of the Act -- which authorizes delegation of ""any of [the Attorney General's] functions"" under the Act -- permits delegation unless a specific limitation appears elsewhere in the Act.  See United States v. Giordano, 416 U. S. 505,  416 U. S. 512-514.  No such limitation appears with regard to the temporary scheduling power.  P.  500 U. S. 169.

No. 90-6282
Argued April 17, 1991
Decided May 20, 1991
500 U.S. 160

Syllabus 
The Controlled Substances Act authorizes the Attorney General, upon compliance with specified procedures, to add new drugs to five ""schedules"" of controlled substances, the manufacture, possession, and distribution of which the Act regulates or prohibits.  Because compliance with the Act's procedures resulted in lengthy delays, drug traffickers were able to develop and market ""designer drugs"" -- which have pharmacological effects similar to, but chemical compositions slightly different from, scheduled substances -- long before the Government was able to schedule them and initiate prosecutions.  To combat this problem, Congress added  201(h) to the Act, creating an expedited procedure by which the Attorney General can schedule a substance on a temporary basis when doing so is ""necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety,"" and providing that a temporary scheduling order is not subject to judicial review.  The Attorney General promulgated regulations delegating, inter alia, his temporary scheduling power to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which subsequently temporarily designated the designer drug ""Euphoria"" as a schedule I controlled substance.  While that temporary order was in effect, petitioners were indicted for manufacturing and conspiring to manufacture Euphoria.  The District Court denied their motion to dismiss, rejecting their contentions that  201(h) unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the Attorney General, and that the Attorney General improperly delegated his temporary scheduling authority to the DEA.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' subsequent convictions.

|500 u.s. 20|"Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation
No. 90-18
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided May 13, 1991
500 U.S. 20

Syllabus 
Petitioner Gilmer was required by respondent, his employer, to register as a securities representative with, among others, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  His registration application contained, inter alia, an agreement to arbitrate when required to by NYSE rules.  NYSE Rule 347 provides for arbitration of any controversy arising out of a registered representative's employment or termination of employment.  Respondent terminated Gilmer's employment at age 62.  Thereafter, he filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and brought suit in the District Court, alleging that he had been discharged in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).  Respondent moved to compel arbitration, relying on the agreement in Gilmer's registration application and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).  The court denied the motion, based on Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 -- which held that an employee's suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not foreclosed by the prior submission of his claim to arbitration under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement -- and because it concluded that Congress intended to protect ADEA claimants from a waiver of the judicial forum.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  An ADEA claim can be subjected to compulsory arbitration.  Pp.  500 U. S. 24-35.
(a) Statutory claims may be the subject of an arbitration agreement, enforceable pursuant to the FAA.  See, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614.  Since the FAA manifests a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp., 460 U. S. 1,  460 U. S. 24, and since neither the text nor the legislative history of the ADEA explicitly precludes arbitration, Gilmer is bound by his agreement to arbitrate unless he can show an inherent conflict between arbitration and the ADEA's underlying purposes.  Pp.  500 U. S. 24-26.
(b) There is no inconsistency between the important social policies furthered by the ADEA and enforcing agreements to arbitrate age discrimination claims.  While arbitration focuses on specific disputes between the parties involved, so does judicial resolution of claims, yet both can further broader social purposes.  Various other laws, 
Page 500 U. S. 21
 including antitrust and securities laws and the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), are designed to advance important public policies, but claims under them are appropriate for arbitration.  Nor will arbitration undermine the EEOC's role in ADEA enforcement, since an ADEA claimant is free to file an EEOC charge even if he is precluded from instituting suit; since the EEOC has independent authority to investigate age discrimination; since the ADEA does not indicate that Congress intended that the EEOC be involved in all disputes; and since an administrative agency's mere involvement in a statute's enforcement is insufficient to preclude arbitration, see, e.g., Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477.  Moreover, compulsory arbitration does not improperly deprive claimants of the judicial forum provided for by the ADEA:  Congress did not explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial claims resolutions; the ADEA's flexible approach to claims resolution, which permits the EEOC to pursue informal resolution methods, suggests that out-of-court dispute resolution is consistent with the statutory scheme; and arbitration is consistent with Congress' grant of concurrent jurisdiction over ADEA claims to state and federal courts, since arbitration also advances the objective of allowing claimants a broader right to select the dispute resolution forum.  Pp.  500 U. S. 27-29.
(c) Gilmer's challenges to the adequacy of arbitration procedures are insufficient to preclude arbitration.  This Court declines to indulge his speculation that the parties and the arbitral body will not retain competent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators, especially when both the NYSE rules and the FAA protect against biased panels.  Nor is there merit to his argument that the limited discovery permitted in arbitration will make it difficult to prove age discrimination, since it is unlikely that such claims require more extensive discovery than RICO and antitrust claims, and since there has been no showing that the NYSE discovery provisions will prove insufficient to allow him a fair opportunity to prove his claim.  His argument that arbitrators will not issue written opinions resulting in a lack of public knowledge of employers' discriminatory policies, an inability to obtain effective appellate review, and a stifling of the law's development, is also rejected, since the NYSE rules require that arbitration awards be in writing and be made available to the public; since judicial decisions will continue to be issued for ADEA claimants without arbitration agreements; and since Gilmer's argument applies equally to settlements of ADEA claims.  His argument that arbitration procedures are inadequate because they do not provide for broad equitable relief is unpersuasive as well, since arbitrators have the power to fashion equitable relief; since the NYSE rules do not restrict the type of relief an arbitrator may award and provide for collective relief; since the 
Page 500 U. S. 22
 ADEA's provision for the possibility of collective action does not mean that individual attempts at conciliation are barred; and since arbitration agreements do not preclude the EEOC itself from seeking class-wide and equitable relief.  Pp.  500 U. S. 30-32.
(d) The unequal bargaining power between employers and employees is not a sufficient reason to hold that arbitration agreements are never enforceable in the employment context.  Cf. e.g., Rodriguez de Quijas, supra, at  490 U. S. 484.  Such a claim is best left for resolution in specific cases.  Here, there is no indication that Gilmer, an experienced businessman, was coerced or defrauded into agreeing to the arbitration clause.  P.  500 U. S. 32-33.
(e) Gilmer's reliance on Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, and its progeny, is also misplaced.  Those cases involved the issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims, not the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims.  The arbitration in those cases occurred in the context of a collective bargaining agreement, and thus there was concern about the tension between collective representation and individual statutory rights that is not applicable in this case.  And those cases were not decided under the FAA.  Pp.  500 U. S. 33-35.

|500 u.s. 44|"County of Riverside v. McLaughlin
No. 89-1817
Argued Jan. 7, 1991
Decided May 13, 1991
500 U.S. 44

Syllabus 
Respondent McLaughlin brought a class action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that petitioner County of Riverside (County) violated the holding of Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, by failing to provide ""prompt"" judicial determinations of probable cause to persons who, like himself, were arrested without a warrant.  The County combines such determinations with arraignment procedures which, under County policy, must be conducted within two days of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.  The County moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that McLaughlin lacked standing to bring the suit because the time for providing him a ""prompt"" probable cause determination had already passed and he had failed to show, as required by Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, that he would again be subject to the allegedly unconstitutional conduct.  The District Court never explicitly ruled on the motion to dismiss, but accepted for filing a second amended complaint -- the operative pleading here -- which named respondents James, Simon, and Hyde as additional individual plaintiffs and class representatives, and alleged that each of them had been arrested without a warrant, had not received a prompt probable cause hearing, and was still in custody.  The court granted class certification and subsequently issued a preliminary injunction requiring that all persons arrested by the County without a warrant be provided probable cause determinations within 36 hours of arrest, except in exigent circumstances.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the County's Lyons-based standing argument and ruling on the merits that the County's practice was not in accord with Gerstein's promptness requirement because no more than 36 hours were needed to complete the administrative steps incident to arrest.
Held:
1. Plaintiffs have Article III standing.  At the time the second amended complaint was filed, James, Simon, and Hyde satisfied the standing doctrine's core requirement that they allege personal injury fairly traceable to the County's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested injunction.  See, e.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,  468 U. S. 751.  Lyons, supra, distinguished.  Although the named 
Page 500 U. S. 45
 plaintiffs' claims were subsequently rendered moot by their receipt of probable cause hearings or their release from custody, they preserved the merits of the controversy for this Court's review by obtaining class certification.  See, e.g., Gerstein, 420 U.S. at  420 U. S. 110-111, n. 11.  This Court is not deprived of jurisdiction by the fact that the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims became moot.  Such claims are so inherently transitory, see, e.g., id. at  420 U. S. 110, n. 11, that the ""relation back"" doctrine is properly invoked to preserve the case's merits for judicial resolution, see, e.g., Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204,  438 U. S. 213-214, n. 11.  Pp.  500 U. S. 50-52.
2. The County's current policy and practice do not comport fully with Gerstein's requirement of a ""prompt"" probable cause determination.  Pp.  500 U. S. 52-59.
(a) Contrary to the Court of Appeals' construction, Gerstein implicitly recognized that the Fourth Amendment does not compel an immediate determination of probable cause upon completion of the administrative steps incident to arrest.  In requiring that persons arrested without a warrant ""promptly"" be brought before a neutral magistrate for such a determination, 420 U.S. at  420 U. S. 114,  420 U. S. 125, Gerstein struck a balance between the rights of individuals and the realities of law enforcement.  Id. at  420 U. S. 113.  Gerstein makes clear that the Constitution does not impose on individual jurisdictions a rigid procedural framework for making the required determination, but allows them to choose to comply in different ways.  Id. at  420 U. S. 123.  In contrast, the Court of Appeals' approach permits no flexibility, and is in error.  Pp.  500 U. S. 52-55.
(b) In order to satisfy Gerstein's promptness requirement, a jurisdiction that chooses to combine probable cause determinations with other pretrial proceedings must do so as soon as is reasonably feasible, but in no event later than 48 hours after arrest.  Providing a probable cause determination within that time frame will, as a general matter, immunize such a jurisdiction from systemic challenges.  Although a hearing within 48 hours may nonetheless violate Gerstein if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably, courts evaluating the reasonableness of a delay must allow a substantial degree of flexibility, taking into account the practical realities of pretrial procedures.  Where an arrested individual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, the burden of proof shifts to the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance, which cannot include intervening weekends or the fact that, in a particular case, it may take longer to consolidate pretrial proceedings.  Pp.  500 U. S. 55-58.
(c) Although the County is entitled to combine probable cause determinations with arraignments, it is not immune from systemic challenges 
Page 500 U. S. 46
 such as this class action.  Its regular practice exceeds the constitutionally permissible 48-hour period because persons arrested on Thursdays may have to wait until the following Monday before receiving a probable cause determination, and the delay is even longer if there is an intervening holiday.  Moreover, the lower courts, on remand, must determine whether the County's practice as to arrests that occur early in the week -- whereby arraignments usually take place on the last day possible -- is supported by legitimate reasons or constitutes delay for delay's sake.  P.  500 U. S. 58-59.

Respondent McLaughlin brought a class action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that petitioner County of Riverside (County) violated the holding of Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, by failing to provide ""prompt"" judicial determinations of probable cause to persons who, like himself, were arrested without a warrant.  The County combines such determinations with arraignment procedures which, under County policy, must be conducted within two days of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.  The County moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that McLaughlin lacked standing to bring the suit because the time for providing him a ""prompt"" probable cause determination had already passed and he had failed to show, as required by Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, that he would again be subject to the allegedly unconstitutional conduct.  The District Court never explicitly ruled on the motion to dismiss, but accepted for filing a second amended complaint -- the operative pleading here -- which named respondents James, Simon, and Hyde as additional individual plaintiffs and class representatives, and alleged that each of them had been arrested without a warrant, had not received a prompt probable cause hearing, and was still in custody.  The court granted class certification and subsequently issued a preliminary injunction requiring that all persons arrested by the County without a warrant be provided probable cause determinations within 36 hours of arrest, except in exigent circumstances.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the County's Lyons-based standing argument and ruling on the merits that the County's practice was not in accord with Gerstein's promptness requirement because no more than 36 hours were needed to complete the administrative steps incident to arrest.
Held:
1. Plaintiffs have Article III standing.  At the time the second amended complaint was filed, James, Simon, and Hyde satisfied the standing doctrine's core requirement that they allege personal injury fairly traceable to the County's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested injunction.  See, e.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737,  468 U. S. 751.  Lyons, supra, distinguished.  Although the named 
Page 500 U. S. 45
 plaintiffs' claims were subsequently rendered moot by their receipt of probable cause hearings or their release from custody, they preserved the merits of the controversy for this Court's review by obtaining class certification.  See, e.g., Gerstein, 420 U.S. at  420 U. S. 110-111, n. 11.  This Court is not deprived of jurisdiction by the fact that the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims became moot.  Such claims are so inherently transitory, see, e.g., id. at  420 U. S. 110, n. 11, that the ""relation back"" doctrine is properly invoked to preserve the case's merits for judicial resolution, see, e.g., Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204,  438 U. S. 213-214, n. 11.  Pp.  500 U. S. 50-52.
2. The County's current policy and practice do not comport fully with Gerstein's requirement of a ""prompt"" probable cause determination.  Pp.  500 U. S. 52-59.
(a) Contrary to the Court of Appeals' construction, Gerstein implicitly recognized that the Fourth Amendment does not compel an immediate determination of probable cause upon completion of the administrative steps incident to arrest.  In requiring that persons arrested without a warrant ""promptly"" be brought before a neutral magistrate for such a determination, 420 U.S. at  420 U. S. 114,  420 U. S. 125, Gerstein struck a balance between the rights of individuals and the realities of law enforcement.  Id. at  420 U. S. 113.  Gerstein makes clear that the Constitution does not impose on individual jurisdictions a rigid procedural framework for making the required determination, but allows them to choose to comply in different ways.  Id. at  420 U. S. 123.  In contrast, the Court of Appeals' approach permits no flexibility, and is in error.  Pp.  500 U. S. 52-55.
(b) In order to satisfy Gerstein's promptness requirement, a jurisdiction that chooses to combine probable cause determinations with other pretrial proceedings must do so as soon as is reasonably feasible, but in no event later than 48 hours after arrest.  Providing a probable cause determination within that time frame will, as a general matter, immunize such a jurisdiction from systemic challenges.  Although a hearing within 48 hours may nonetheless violate Gerstein if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably, courts evaluating the reasonableness of a delay must allow a substantial degree of flexibility, taking into account the practical realities of pretrial procedures.  Where an arrested individual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours, the burden of proof shifts to the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance, which cannot include intervening weekends or the fact that, in a particular case, it may take longer to consolidate pretrial proceedings.  Pp.  500 U. S. 55-58.
(c) Although the County is entitled to combine probable cause determinations with arraignments, it is not immune from systemic challenges 
Page 500 U. S. 46
 such as this class action.  Its regular practice exceeds the constitutionally permissible 48-hour period because persons arrested on Thursdays may have to wait until the following Monday before receiving a probable cause determination, and the delay is even longer if there is an intervening holiday.  Moreover, the lower courts, on remand, must determine whether the County's practice as to arrests that occur early in the week -- whereby arraignments usually take place on the last day possible -- is supported by legitimate reasons or constitutes delay for delay's sake.  P.  500 U. S. 58-59.

No. 89-1821
Argued March 19, 1991
Decided April 24, 1991
500 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
On April 26, 1987, petitioner Stevens, who was in his 60's, was subjected to an adverse personnel action by his employer, the Internal Revenue Service.  Believing that he had been the victim of age discrimination, he attempted to invoke his agency's administrative procedure for resolving such claims in September, 1987, long after the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations.  On October 19, he filed a formal administrative complaint of age discrimination with the Department of the Treasury, concluding with a notice of his intention to sue if the matter was not satisfactorily resolved.  The complaint was rejected because of the untimeliness of his initial attempt to obtain relief, and the EEOC's Office of Review and Appeals affirmed.  On May 3, 1988, Stevens filed a complaint against the Department and its Secretary in the District Court, which dismissed the case with prejudice, concluding that it was ""without jurisdiction"" to apply the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) in the circumstances.  Noting that a federal employee has two alternative avenues of relief under the ADEA, the court reasoned (1) that Stevens had not satisfied the requirements for proceeding directly to federal court under 29 U.S.C.  633a(d), which, the court declared, mandated that he ""initiate an action no later than 180 days from the unlawful action and notify the EEOC within 30 days prior to commencing suit,"" and (2) that his attempted administrative procedure had not properly been invoked because of untimeliness, whereas, having chosen the 
Page 500 U. S. 2
 administrative route under  633a(b), he was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing suit.  The Court of Appeals declared that, under  633a(d), Stevens had to file a notice of intent to sue within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory action, but did not have to initiate his federal suit within that period.  Nevertheless, the court affirmed the dismissal of his complaint on the ground that, since he had not initiated his suit until May 3, 1988, his October 19, 1987, notice to the EEOC was not effective.
Held:
1. Stevens' civil action was timely under  633a.   500 U. S.  5-8.
(a) Stevens clearly met the requirements of  633a(d), which calls for a notice of ""not less than"" 30 days to the EEOC of an intent to sue (not notification within 30 days), and provides that the ""notice shall be filed"" within 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice (not filed within 180 days of the notice).  Here, the EEOC -- which accepts a notice given to the employing agency as sufficient compliance with the statutory notice requirement -- was notified on October 19, 1987, the 176th day after the alleged discriminatory action of April 27, 1987.  And suit was not filed until May 3, 1988, a date more than 30 days after the notice was given.  Pp.  500 U. S. 5-7.
(b) There is no discernible basis for concluding that the suit was not filed within the applicable limitations period.  Since the statute does not expressly impose any additional limitations period for a complaint, it must be assumed that Congress intended to impose an appropriate period borrowed either from a state statute or from an analogous federal one.  It need not be decided here which limitations period is applicable to  633a(c) civil actions, since Stevens filed his suit only one year and six days after the allegedly discriminatory event.  As the Government acknowledges, that is well within whatever statute of limitations might apply.  Pp.  500 U. S. 7-8.
(c) The timeliness issue is properly before this Court, since the District Court heard the case on the merits, and the Court of Appeals in its turn specifically referred to Stevens' notice of intention to file a civil suit and answered the timeliness question incorrectly.  P.  500 U. S. 8.
2. This Court will not address the question whether Stevens, having filed an administrative complaint, was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a civil action, since the Government, in direct contradiction of its position before the Court of Appeals, now fully agrees with Stevens that exhaustion is not required.  Pp.  500 U. S. 8-11.

No. 90-97
Argued Feb. 25, 1991
Decided April 23, 1991
499 U.S. 606

Syllabus 
The National Labor Relations Board has promulgated a rule providing that, with exceptions for, inter alia, cases presenting ""extraordinary circumstances,"" eight, and only eight, defined employee units are appropriate for collective bargaining in acute care hospitals.  Petitioner, American Hospital Association, brought this action challenging the rule's facial validity on the grounds that (1)  9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) requires the Board to make a separate bargaining unit determination ""in each case,"" and therefore prohibits the Board from using general rules to define bargaining units; (2) the rule violates a congressional admonition to the Board to avoid the undue proliferation of bargaining units in the health care industry; and (3) the rule is arbitrary and capricious.  The District Court agreed with petitioner's second argument and enjoined the rule's enforcement, but the Court of Appeals found no merit in any of the three arguments, and reversed.
Held:  The Board's rule is not facially invalid.  Pp.  499 U. S. 609-620.
(a) The Board's broad rulemaking powers under  6 of the NLRA authorize the rule and are not limited by  9(b)'s mandate that the Board decide the appropriate bargaining unit ""in each case.""  Contrary to petitioner's reading, the clear and more natural meaning of the ""in each case"" requirement is simply to indicate that, whenever there is a disagreement between employers and employees about the appropriateness of a bargaining unit, the Board shall resolve the dispute.  In doing so, the Board is entitled to rely on rules that it has developed to resolve certain issues of general applicability.  See, e.g., United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U. S. 192,  351 U. S. 205.  The rule at issue does not differ significantly from the Board's many prior rules establishing general principles for the adjudication of bargaining unit disputes.  This interpretation is reinforced by the NLRA's structure and policy.  Nor is petitioner aided by  9(b)'s sparse legislative history.  Even if any ambiguity could be found in  9(b) after application of the traditional tools of statutory construction, this Court would still defer to the Board's reasonable interpretation of the statutory text.  Pp.  499 U. S. 609-614.
(b) The rule is not rendered invalid by the admonition, contained in congressional Reports accompanying the 1974 extension of NLRA coverage 
Page 499 U. S. 607
 to all acute care hospitals, that the Board should give ""[d]ue consideration . . . to preventing proliferation of bargaining units in the health care industry.""  The argument that the admonition -- when coupled with Congress' 1973 rejection of a bill that would have placed a general limit of five on the number of hospital bargaining units -- evinces an intent to emphasize the importance of  9(b)'s ""in each case"" requirement is no more persuasive than petitioner's reliance on  9(b) itself.  Moreover, even if this Court accepted petitioner's further suggestion that the admonition is an authoritative statement of what Congress intended by the 1974 legislation, the admonition must be read to express the desire that the Board consider the special problems that proliferation might create in acute care hospitals.  An examination of the rulemaking record reveals that the Board gave extensive consideration to this very issue.  In any event, the admonition is best understood as a congressional warning to the Board, and Congress is free to fashion a remedy for noncompliance if it believes that the Board has not given ""due consideration"" to the problem of proliferation in this industry.  Pp.  499 U. S. 614-617.
(c) The rule is not, as petitioner contends, arbitrary and capricious because it ignores critical differences among the many acute care hospitals in the country.  The Board's conclusion that, absent extraordinary circumstances, such hospitals do not differ in substantial, significant ways relating to the appropriateness of units was based on a ""reasoned analysis"" of an extensive rulemaking record and on the Board's years of experience in the adjudication of health care cases.

|499 u.s. 621|"California v. Hodari D.
No. 89-1632
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided April 23, 1991
499 U.S. 621

Syllabus 
A group of youths, including respondent Hodari D., fled at the approach of an unmarked police car on an Oakland, California, street.  Officer Pertoso, who was wearing a jacket with ""Police"" embossed on its front, left the car to give chase.  Pertoso did not follow Hodari directly, but took a circuitous route that brought the two face to face on a parallel street.  Hodari, however, was looking behind as he ran and did not turn to see Pertoso until the officer was almost upon him, whereupon Hodari tossed away a small rock.  Pertoso tackled him, and the police recovered the rock, which proved to be crack cocaine.  In the juvenile proceeding against Hodari, the court denied his motion to suppress the evidence relating to the cocaine.  The State Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Hodari had been ""seized"" when he saw Pertoso running towards him; that this seizure was ""unreasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment, the State having conceded that Pertoso did not have the ""reasonable suspicion"" required to justify stopping Hodari; and therefore that the evidence of cocaine had to be suppressed as the fruit of the illegal seizure.
Held:  The only issue presented here -- whether, at the time he dropped the drugs, Hodari had been ""seized"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment -- must be answered in the negative.  To answer this question, this Court looks to the common law of arrest.  To constitute a seizure of the person, just as to constitute an arrest -- the quintessential ""seizure of the person"" under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence -- there must be either the application of physical force, however slight, or, where that is absent, submission to an officer's ""show of authority"" to restrain the subject's liberty.

			"|"California v. Hodari D.
No. 89-1632
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided April 23, 1991
499 U.S. 621

Syllabus 
A group of youths, including respondent Hodari D., fled at the approach of an unmarked police car on an Oakland, California, street.  Officer Pertoso, who was wearing a jacket with ""Police"" embossed on its front, left the car to give chase.  Pertoso did not follow Hodari directly, but took a circuitous route that brought the two face to face on a parallel street.  Hodari, however, was looking behind as he ran and did not turn to see Pertoso until the officer was almost upon him, whereupon Hodari tossed away a small rock.  Pertoso tackled him, and the police recovered the rock, which proved to be crack cocaine.  In the juvenile proceeding against Hodari, the court denied his motion to suppress the evidence relating to the cocaine.  The State Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Hodari had been ""seized"" when he saw Pertoso running towards him; that this seizure was ""unreasonable"" under the Fourth Amendment, the State having conceded that Pertoso did not have the ""reasonable suspicion"" required to justify stopping Hodari; and therefore that the evidence of cocaine had to be suppressed as the fruit of the illegal seizure.
Held:  The only issue presented here -- whether, at the time he dropped the drugs, Hodari had been ""seized"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment -- must be answered in the negative.  To answer this question, this Court looks to the common law of arrest.  To constitute a seizure of the person, just as to constitute an arrest -- the quintessential ""seizure of the person"" under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence -- there must be either the application of physical force, however slight, or, where that is absent, submission to an officer's ""show of authority"" to restrain the subject's liberty.  No physical force was applied in this case, since Hodari was untouched by Pertoso before he dropped the drugs.  Moreover, assuming that Pertoso's pursuit constituted a ""show of authority"" enjoining Hodari to halt, Hodari did not comply with that injunction, and therefore was not seized until he was tackled.  Thus, the cocaine abandoned while he was running was not the fruit of a seizure, cf. Brower v. Inyo County, 489 U. S. 593,  489 U. S. 597; Nester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57,  265 U.

|499 u.s. 530|"Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd
No. 89-1598
Argued Oct. 29, 1990
Decided April 17, 1991
499 U.S. 530

Syllabus 
After petitioner's plane narrowly avoided crashing during a flight between Miami and the Bahamas, respondent passengers filed separate complaints seeking damages solely for mental distress arising out of the incident.  The District Court consolidated the proceedings and ruled that Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, which sets forth conditions under which an international air carrier can be held liable for injuries to passengers, does not allow recovery for mental anguish alone.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the phrase ""lesion corporelle"" in the authentic French text of Article 17 encompasses purely emotional distress.
Held:
1. Article 17 does not allow recovery for purely mental injuries.  Pp.  499 U. S. 534-553.
(a) When interpreting a treaty, this Court begins with the treaty's text and the context in which the written words are used.  Other general rules of construction may be brought to bear on difficult or ambiguous passages; and, since treaties are construed more liberally than private agreements, the Court may look beyond the written words to the treaty's history, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.  Pp.  499 U. S. 534-535.
(b) Neither the Warsaw Convention itself nor any of the applicable legal sources demonstrates that the relevant Article 17 phrase, ""lesion corporelle,"" should be translated other than as ""bodily injury"" -- a narrow meaning excluding purely mental injuries.  Bilingual dictionaries suggest that that translation is proper, and any concerns that the dictionary definitions may be too general for purposes of treaty interpretation are partly allayed when, as here, the definitions accord with the main English translations of the Convention, including the text employed by the Senate when it ratified the Convention.  Moreover, a review of relevant French legal materials reveals no legislation, judicial decisions, or scholarly writing indicating that, in 1929, the year the Convention was drafted, ""lesion corporelle"" had a meaning in French law encompassing psychic injuries.  It is unlikely that the understanding of the term ""lesion corporelle"" as ""bodily injury"" that was apparently held by the Convention's contracting parties would have been displaced by a meaning abstracted from French damages law, which, at the relevant time, 
Page 499 U. S. 531
 evidently allowed recovery for psychic injury, particularly when the psychic injury cause of action would not have been recognized in many other countries represented at the Convention.  Nor is this conclusion altered by an examination of Article 17's structure, whereby ""lesion corporelle"" might plausibly be read to refer to a general class of injuries including internal injuries, in contrast with other language in the Article covering bodily ruptures.  Although the official German translation of ""lesion corporelle"" adopted by Austria, Germany, and Switzerland used German terms whose closest English translation is apparently ""infringement on the health,"" this Court is reluctant to place much weight on an English translation of a German translation of a French text, particularly in the absence of any German, Austrian, or Swiss cases adhering to the broad interpretation that the German delegate evidently espoused.  Pp.  499 U. S. 535-542.
(c) Translating ""lesion corporelle"" as ""bodily injury"" is consistent with the negotiating history of the Convention.  It is reasonable to infer that the drafters of the language that ultimately became Article 17 rejected broader proposed language, which almost certainly would have permitted recovery for emotional distress, in order to limit the types of recoverable injuries.  Moreover, a review of the documentary record for the Warsaw Conference confirms that neither the drafters nor the signatories specifically considered liability for psychic injury, apparently because many, if not most, countries did not recognize recovery for such injuries at the time.  Thus, the drafters most likely would have felt compelled to make an unequivocal reference to purely mental injury if they had intended to allow such recovery, as did the signatories to the Berne Convention on International Rail.  The narrower reading of ""lesion corporelle"" also is consistent with the primary purpose of the Warsaw Convention's contracting parties, who were more concerned with limiting the liability of air carriers in order to foster the growth of the fledgling commercial aviation industry than they were with providing full recovery to injured passengers.  Pp.  499 U. S. 542-546.
(d) On balance, the evidence of the post-1929 conduct and interpretations of the Warsaw Convention signatories supports the narrow translation of ""lesion corporelle.""  Although a 1951 proposal to substitute ""affection corporelle"" for ""lesion corporelle"" was never implemented, the discussion and vote suggest that, in the view of the 20 signatories on the committee that adopted the proposal, ""lesion corporelle"" had a distinctly physical scope.  Moreover, although the Hague Protocol of 1955, the Montreal Agreement of 1966, and the Guatemala City Protocol of 1971 all refer to ""personal injury,"" rather than ""bodily injury,"" none of these agreements supports the broad interpretation reached by the Court of Appeals.  There is no evidence that any of them was intended to effect a substantive change in, or clarification of, the provisions of Article 17.  The Hague Protocol refers to ""personal injury"" only in the 
Page 499 U. S. 532
 context of giving airline passengers notice that the Warsaw Convention in most cases imposes limits of liability for ""death or personal injury.""  Additionally, the Montreal Agreement does not and cannot purport to speak for the Warsaw Convention signatories, since it is not a treaty, but merely an agreement among the major international air carriers.  Furthermore, the Guatemala City Protocol is not in effect in the international arena, since only a few countries have ratified it, and cannot be considered dispositive in this country, since it has not been ratified by the Senate.  Also unpersuasive is the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Israel, in the only apparent judicial decision from a Warsaw Convention signatory addressing the question, that ""desirable jurisprudential policy"" mandates an expansive reading of Article 17 to reach purely psychic injuries.  This Court cannot give effect to the Israeli court's perceived policy without convincing evidence that the signatories' intent with respect to Article 17 would allow recovery for purely psychic injury.  This Court's construction better accords with the Convention's stated purpose of achieving uniformity of rules governing claims arising from international air transportation, since subjecting international air carriers to strict liability for purely mental distress, as would the Guatemala City Protocol and the Montreal Agreement, would be controversial for most signatory countries.  Pp.  499 U. S. 546-552.
2. The issue whether passengers can recover for mental injuries accompanied by physical injuries is not presented or addressed here, since respondents do not allege physical injury or physical manifestation of injury.  Nor does this Court reach the question whether the Convention provides the exclusive cause of action for injuries sustained during international air transportation, since the Court of Appeals did not address it and certiorari was not granted to consider it here.  Pp.  499 U. S. 552-553.
872 F.2d 1462 (CA11 1989), reversed.

No. 89-1965
Argued Jan. 15, 1991
Decided April 17, 1991
499 U.S. 554

Syllabus 
Petitioner Cottage Savings Association simultaneously sold participation interests in 252 mortgages to four savings and loan associations and purchased from them participation interests in 305 other mortgages.  All of the loans were secured by single family homes.  The fair market value of the package of participation interests exchanged by each side was approximately $4.5 million.  The face value of the participation interests relinquished by Cottage Savings was $6.9 million.  For Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) accounting purposes, Cottage Savings' mortgages were treated as having been exchanged for ""substantially identical"" ones held by the other lenders.  On its 1980 federal income tax return, Cottage Savings claimed a deduction for the adjusted difference between the face value of the interests it traded and the fair market value of the interests it received.  Following the Commissioner's disallowance of the deduction, the Tax Court determined the deduction was permissible.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Cottage Savings had realized its losses through the transaction, but that it was not entitled to a deduction because its losses were not actually sustained for purposes of  165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows deductions only for bona fide losses.
Held:
1. Cottage Savings realized a tax-deductible loss because the properties it exchanged were materially different.  Pp.  499 U. S. 559-567.
(a) In order to avoid the cumbersome, abrasive, and unpredictable administrative task of valuing assets annually to determine whether their value has appreciated or depreciated,  1001(a) of the Code defers the tax consequences of a gain or loss in property until it is realized through the ""sale or disposition of [the] property.""  This rule serves administrative convenience because a change in the investment's form or extent can be easily detected by a taxpayer or an administrative officer.  P.  499 U. S. 559.
(b) An exchange of property constitutes a ""disposition of property"" under  1001(a) only if the properties exchanged are materially different.  Although the statute and its legislative history are silent on the subject, Treasury Regulation  1.1001-1 includes a material difference requirement 
Page 499 U. S. 555
 for realization to occur through a disposition of property.  Treasury Regulation  1.1001-1 should be given deference as a reasonable interpretation of  1001(a).  Where, as here, a Treasury Regulation long continues without substantial change and applies to a substantially reenacted statute, it is deemed to have congressional approval.  The regulation is also consistent with this Court's landmark precedents on realization, which make clear that a taxpayer realizes taxable income only if the properties exchanged are ""materially"" or ""essentially"" different.  United States v. Phellis, 257 U. S. 156,  257 U. S. 173; Weiss v. Stearn, 265 U. S. 242,  265 U. S. 253-254; Marr v. United States, 268 U. S. 536,  268 U. S. 540-542.  Since these cases were part of the contemporary legal context in which the substance of  1001(a) was originally enacted, and since Congress has left their principles undisturbed through subsequent reenactments, it can be presumed that Congress intended to codify these principles in  1001(a).  Pp.  499 U. S. 560-562.
(c) Properties are materially different if their respective possessors enjoy legal entitlements that are different in kind or extent.  As long as the property entitlements are not identical, their exchange will allow both the Commissioner and the transacting taxpayer to fix the appreciated or depreciated values of the property relative to their tax bases.  There is no support in Phellis, Weiss, or Marr for the Commissioner's ""economic substitute"" concept of material difference, under which differences would be material only when the parties, the relevant market, and the relevant regulatory body would consider them so.  Moreover, the complexity of the Commissioner's approach both ill-serves the goal of administrative convenience underlying the realization requirement and is incompatible with the Code's structure. Pp.  499 U. S. 562-566.
(d) Cottage Savings' transactions easily satisfy the material difference test.  Since the participation interests exchanged derived from loans that were made to different obligors and secured by different homes, the exchanged interests embodied legally distinct entitlements.  Thus, Cottage Savings realized its losses at the point of the exchange, at which time both it and the Commissioner were in a position to determine the change in the value of its mortgages relative to their tax bases.  The mortgages' status under the FHLBB's criteria has no bearing on this conclusion, since a mortgage can be ""substantially identical"" to the FHLBB and still exhibit ""differences"" that are ""material"" for purposes of the Code.  Pp.  499 U. S. 566-567.
2. Cottage Savings sustained its losses within the meaning of  165(a) of the Code.  The Commissioner's apparent argument that the losses were not bona fide is rejected, since there is no contention that the transaction was not conducted at arm's length or that Cottage Savings

499 U.S. 573

Syllabus 
During the 1981 tax year, respondent Centennial Savings Bank FSB exchanged participation interests in a set of mortgage loans for interests in a different set of mortgage loans held by another lender.  All of the loans were secured by residential properties and had a face value substantially higher than their fair market value.  In a separate set of transactions, Centennial collected early withdrawal penalties from customers who prematurely terminated their certificates of deposit (CD's).  In its 1981 federal income tax return, Centennial claimed a deduction for the difference between the face value of the mortgage interests it surrendered and the fair market value of the mortgage interests it received.  It also treated the early withdrawal penalties it received as ""income from the discharge . . . of indebtedness"" excludable from gross income under 26 U.S.C.  108(a)(1)(C) (1982 ed.).  After the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction of the losses associated with the mortgages and determined that Centennial was required to declare the early withdrawal penalties as income, Centennial paid the deficiencies and filed a refund action in the District Court.  The court entered a judgment for petitioner United States on the mortgage exchange issue and for Centennial on the early withdrawal penalty issue.  The Court of Appeals reversed the mortgage exchange ruling, but affirmed the early withdrawal penalty holding.
Held:
1. Centennial realized tax-deductible losses when it exchanged mortgage interests with the other lender.  Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner, ante, p.  499 U. S. 554.  P.  499 U. S. 578-579.
2. The early withdrawal penalties collected by Centennial were not excludable from income under  108(a)(1).  A debtor realizes income from the ""discharge of indebtedness"" only when the income results from the forgiveness of, or release from, an obligation to repay assumed by the debtor at the outset of the debtor-creditor relationship.  Here, the depositors who prematurely closed their accounts and incurred penalties did not forgive or release any repayment obligation on the part of Centennial, which paid exactly what it was obligated to pay according to the 
Page 499 U. S. 574
 terms of the agreements entered into at the time the CD's were established.  This reading best comports with  108's purpose, which is to mitigate the effect of treating a discharge of indebtedness as income so that the prospect of immediate tax liability will not discourage businesses from taking advantage of opportunities to repurchase or liquidate their debts at less than face value.  A debtor who negotiates in advance the circumstances in which he will liquidate the debt is in a position to anticipate his need for cash with which to pay the resulting income tax and can negotiate the terms of the anticipated liquidation accordingly.  Moreover, in this case, Centennial was committed to releasing the deposits at the sole election of the depositors.  Thus, unlike a debtor considering the negotiation of an adjustment of the terms of a duty to repay, Centennial had no discretion to take the tax effects of a transaction into account before liquidating its obligation at less than face value.

No. 89-1926
Argued Jan. 15, 1991
Decided April 17, 1991
499 U.S. 573

Syllabus 
During the 1981 tax year, respondent Centennial Savings Bank FSB exchanged participation interests in a set of mortgage loans for interests in a different set of mortgage loans held by another lender.  All of the loans were secured by residential properties and had a face value substantially higher than their fair market value.  In a separate set of transactions, Centennial collected early withdrawal penalties from customers who prematurely terminated their certificates of deposit (CD's).  In its 1981 federal income tax return, Centennial claimed a deduction for the difference between the face value of the mortgage interests it surrendered and the fair market value of the mortgage interests it received.  It also treated the early withdrawal penalties it received as ""income from the discharge . . . of indebtedness"" excludable from gross income under 26 U.S.C.  108(a)(1)(C) (1982 ed.).  After the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction of the losses associated with the mortgages and determined that Centennial was required to declare the early withdrawal penalties as income, Centennial paid the deficiencies and filed a refund action in the District Court.  The court entered a judgment for petitioner United States on the mortgage exchange issue and for Centennial on the early withdrawal penalty issue.

No. 89-1647
Argued Jan. 15, 1991
Decided April 17, 1991
499 U.S. 585

Syllabus 
After the respondents Shute, a Washington State couple, purchased passage on a ship owned by petitioner, a Florida-based cruise line, petitioner sent them tickets containing a clause designating courts in Florida as the agreed-upon fora for the resolution of disputes.  The Shutes boarded the ship in Los Angeles, and, while in international waters off the Mexican coast, Mrs. Shute suffered injuries when she slipped on a deck mat.  The Shutes filed suit in a Washington Federal District Court, which granted summary judgment for petitioner.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that the forum-selection clause should not be enforced under The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U. S. 1, because it was not ""freely bargained for,"" and because its enforcement would operate to deprive the Shutes of their day in court in light of evidence indicating that they were physically and financially incapable of pursuing the litigation in Florida.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in refusing to enforce the forum-selection clause.  Pp.  499 U. S. 590-597.
(a) The Bremen Court's statement that a freely negotiated forum-selection clause, such as the one there at issue, should be given full effect, 407 U.S. at  407 U. S. 12-13, does not support the Court of Appeals' determination that a nonnegotiated forum clause in a passage contract is never enforceable simply because it is not the subject of bargaining.  Whereas it was entirely reasonable for The Bremen Court to have expected the parties to have negotiated with care in selecting a forum for the resolution of disputes arising from their complicated international agreement, it would be entirely unreasonable to assume that a cruise passenger would or could negotiate the terms of a forum clause in a routine commercial cruise ticket form.  Nevertheless, including a reasonable forum clause in such a form contract well may be permissible for several reasons.  Because it is not unlikely that a mishap in a cruise could subject a cruise line to litigation in several different fora, the line has a special interest in limiting such fora.  Moreover, a clause establishing ex ante the dispute resolution forum has the salutary effect of dispelling confusion as to where suits may be brought and defended, thereby sparing litigants time and expense and conserving judicial resources.  Furthermore, it is likely that passengers purchasing tickets 
Page 499 U. S. 586
 containing a forum clause like the one here at issue benefit in the form of reduced fares reflecting the savings that the cruise line enjoys by limiting the fora in which it may be sued.  Pp.  499 U. S. 590-594.
(b) The Court of Appeals' conclusion that the clause here at issue should not be enforced because the Shutes are incapable of pursuing this litigation in Florida is not justified by The Bremen Court's statement that
""the serious inconvenience of the contractual forum to one or both of the parties might carry greater weight in determining the reasonableness of the forum clause.""
Id. at  407 U. S. 17.  That statement was made in the context of a hypothetical ""agreement between two Americans to resolve their essentially local disputes in a remote alien forum.""  Ibid.  Here, in contrast, Florida is not such a forum, nor -- given the location of Mrs. Shute's accident -- is this dispute an essentially local one inherently more suited to resolution in Washington than in Florida.  In light of these distinctions, and because the Shutes do not claim lack of notice of the forum clause, they have not satisfied the ""heavy burden of proof,"" ibid. required to set aside the clause on grounds of inconvenience.  Pp.  499 U. S. 594-595.
(c) Although forum selection clauses contained in form passage contracts are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental fairness, there is no indication that petitioner selected Florida to discourage cruise passengers from pursuing legitimate claims or obtained the Shutes' accession to the forum clause by fraud or overreaching.  P.  499 U. S. 595.
(d) By its plain language, the forum selection clause at issue does not violate 46 U.S.C. App.  183c, which, inter alia, prohibits a vessel owner from inserting in any contract a provision depriving a claimant of a trial ""by court of competent jurisdiction"" for loss of life or personal injury resulting from negligence.  Pp.  499 U. S. 595-597.

499 U.S. 432

Syllabus 
After respondent Kentucky Board of Elections denied petitioner Kay's request to have his name placed on a primary ballot for President of the United States, Kay, an attorney licensed to practice in Florida, filed a civil rights action on his own behalf in the District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the state statute on which the Board relied.  Although he prevailed on the merits, the court denied his request for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  A pro se litigant who is also a lawyer may not be awarded attorney's fees under  1988.  Neither  1988's text nor its legislative history provides a clear answer to the question whether a lawyer who represents himself should be treated like a client who has an independent attorney or like other pro se litigants, who, the Courts of Appeals have correctly decided, are not entitled to attorney's fees.  However,  1988's overriding concern is with obtaining independent counsel for victims of civil rights violations in order to ensure the effective prosecution of meritorious claims.  That policy is best served by a rule that creates an incentive to retain counsel in every case, rather than a disincentive to employ counsel whenever a plaintiff considers himself competent to litigate on his own behalf.  Even a skilled lawyer who represents himself is at a disadvantage in contested litigation because ethical considerations may make it inappropriate for him to appear as a witness, and because he is deprived of the judgment of an independent third party during the litigation.

Decided April 16, 1991
499 U.S. 439

Syllabus 
Arkansas' Gross Receipts Act imposes a tax on receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property and specified services, but expressly exempts, inter alia, certain receipts from newspaper and magazine sales.  In 1987, Act 188 amended the Gross Receipts Act to impose the tax on cable television.  Petitioners in No. 90 38, a cable television subscriber, a cable operator, and a cable trade organization (cable petitioners), brought this class action in the State Chancery Court, contending that their expressive rights under the First Amendment and their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the extension of the tax to cable services, the exemption from the tax of newspapers and magazines, and the exclusion from the list of services subject to the tax of scrambled satellite broadcast television services to home dish antennae owners.  In 1989, shortly after the Chancery Court upheld the constitutionality of Act 188, Arkansas adopted Act 769, which extended the tax to, among other things, all television services to paying customers.  On appeal, the State Supreme Court held that the tax was not invalid after the passage of Act 769 because the Constitution does not prohibit the differential taxation of different media.  However, believing that the First Amendment does prohibit discriminatory taxation among members of the same medium, and that cable and scrambled satellite television services were ""substantially the same,"" the Supreme Court held that the tax was unconstitutional for the period during which it applied to cable but not satellite broadcast services.
Held:
1. Arkansas' extension of its generally applicable sales tax to cable television services alone, or to cable and satellite services, while exempting the print media, does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.  499 U. S. 444-453.
(a) Although cable television, which provides news, information, and entertainment to its subscribers, is engaged in ""speech"" and is part of the ""press"" in much of its operation, the fact that it is taxed differently from other media does not, by itself, raise First Amendment concerns.  
Page 499 U. S. 440
 The Arkansas tax presents none of the First Amendment difficulties that have led this Court to strike down differential taxation of speakers.  See, e.g., Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233; Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221.  It is a tax of general applicability covering all tangible personal property and a broad range of services and, thus, does not single out the press, and thereby threaten to hinder it as a watchdog of government activity.  Furthermore, there is no indication that Arkansas has targeted cable television in a purposeful attempt to interfere with its First Amendment activities, nor is the tax structured so as to raise suspicion that it was intended to do so.  Arkansas has not selected a small group of speakers to bear fully the burden of the tax, since, even if the State Supreme Court's finding that cable and satellite television are the same medium is accepted, Act 188 extended the tax uniformly to the approximately 100 cable systems then operating in the State.  Finally, the tax is not content-based, since there is nothing in the statute's language that refers to the content of mass media communications, and since the record contains no evidence that the variety of programming cable television offers subscribers differs systematically in its message from that communicated by satellite broadcast programming, newspapers, or magazines.  Pp.  499 U. S. 444-449.
(b) Thus, cable petitioners can prevail only if the Arkansas tax scheme presents ""an additional basis"" for concluding that the State has violated their First Amendment rights.  See Arkansas Writers' supra, at  481 U. S. 233.  This Court's decisions do not support their argument that such a basis exists here, because the tax discriminates among media and discriminated for a time within a medium.  Taken together, cases such as Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington, 461 U. S. 540, Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co., 327 U. S. 178, and Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186, establish that differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas.  Nothing about Arkansas' choice to exclude or exempt certain media from its tax has ever suggested an interest in censoring the expressive activities of cable television.  Nor does anything in the record indicate that this broad-based, content-neutral tax is likely to stifle the free exchange of ideas.  Pp.  499 U. S. 449-453.

No. 89-7024
Argued Oct. 31, 1990
Decided April 16, 1991
499 U.S. 467

Syllabus 
To rebut petitioner McCleskey's alibi defense at his 1978 Georgia trial for murder and a related crime, the State called Officer Evans, the occupant of the jail cell next to McCleskey's, who testified that McCleskey had admitted and boasted about the killing.  On the basis of this and other evidence supporting McCleskey's guilt, the jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.  After the State Supreme Court affirmed, he filed an unsuccessful petition for state habeas corpus relief, alleging, inter alia, that his statements to Evans were elicited in a situation created by the State to induce him to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel in violation of Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201.  He then filed his first federal habeas petition, which did not raise a Massiah claim, and a second state petition, both of which were ultimately unsuccessful.  Finally, he filed his second federal habeas petition in 1987, basing a Massiah challenge on a 21-page statement that Evans had made to police two weeks before the trial.  The document, which the State furnished at McCleskey's request shortly before he filed his second federal petition, related conversations that were consistent with Evans' trial testimony, but also recounted the tactics used by Evans to engage McCleskey in conversation.  Moreover, at a hearing on the petition, Ulysses Worthy, a jailer during McCleskey's pretrial incarceration whose identity came to light after the petition was filed, gave testimony indicating that Evans' cell assignment had been made at the State's behest.  In light of the Evans statement and Worthy's testimony, the District Court found an ab initio relationship between Evans and the State, and granted McCleskey relief under Massiah.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of the doctrine of abuse of the writ, which defines the circumstances in which federal courts decline to entertain a claim presented for the first time in a second or subsequent habeas corpus petition.
Held:  McCleskey's failure to raise his Massiah claim in his first federal habeas petition constituted abuse of the writ.  Pp.  499 U. S. 477-503.
(a) Much confusion exists as to the proper standard for applying the abuse of the writ doctrine, which refers to a complex and evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions.  This Court has heretofore 
Page 499 U. S. 468
 defined such abuse in an oblique way, through dicta and denials of certiorari petitions or stay applications, see Witt v. Wainwright, 470 U. S. 1039, 1043 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), and, because of historical changes and the complexity of the subject, has not always followed an unwavering line in its conclusions as to the writ's availability, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391,  372 U. S. 411-412.  Pp.  499 U. S. 477-489.
(b) Although this Court's federal habeas decisions do not all admit of ready synthesis, a review of these precedents demonstrates that a claim need not have been deliberately abandoned in an earlier petition in order to establish that its inclusion in a subsequent petition constitutes abuse of the writ, see, e.g., Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1,  373 U. S. 18; that such inclusion constitutes abuse if the claim could have been raised in the first petition, but was omitted through inexcusable neglect, see, e.g., Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320,  495 U. S. 321-322, and that, because the doctrines of procedural default and abuse of the writ implicate nearly identical concerns, the determination of inexcusable neglect in the abuse context should be governed by the same standard used to determine whether to excuse a habeas petitioner's state procedural defaults, see, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72.  Thus, when a prisoner files a second or subsequent habeas petition, the government bears the burden of pleading abuse of the writ.  This burden is satisfied if the government, with clarity and particularity, notes petitioner's prior writ history, identifies the claims that appear for the first time, and alleges that petitioner has abused the writ.  The burden to disprove abuse then shifts to petitioner.  To excuse his failure to raise the claim earlier, he must show cause -- e.g., that he was impeded by some objective factor external to the defense, such as governmental interference or the reasonable unavailability of the factual basis for the claim -- as well as actual prejudice resulting from the errors of which he complains.  He will not be entitled to an evidentiary hearing if the district court determines as a matter of law that he cannot satisfy the cause and prejudice standard.  However, if he cannot show cause, the failure to earlier raise the claim may nonetheless be excused if he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice -- the conviction of an innocent person -- would result from a failure to entertain the claim.  Pp.  499 U. S. 478-497.
(c) McCleskey has not satisfied the foregoing standard for excusing the omission of his Massiah claim from his first federal habeas petition.  He lacks cause for that omission, and, therefore, the question whether he would be prejudiced by his inability to raise the claim need not be considered.  See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,  477 U. S. 494.  That he may not have known about, or been able to discover, the Evans document before filing his first federal petition does not establish cause, since knowledge gleaned from the trial about the jail cell conversations and 
Page 499 U. S. 469
 Evans' conduct, as well as McCleskey's admitted participation in those conversations, put him on notice that he should pursue the Massiah claim in the first federal petition as he had done in his first state petition.  Nor does the unavailability of Worthy's identity and testimony at the time of the first federal petition establish cause, since the fact that Evans' statement was the only new evidence McCleskey had when he filed the Massiah claim in his second federal petition demonstrates the irrelevance of Worthy to that claim.  Moreover, cause cannot be established by the State's allegedly wrongful concealment of the Evans document until 1987, since the District Court found no wrongdoing in the failure to hand over the document earlier, and since any initial concealment would not have prevented McCleskey from raising a Massiah claim in the first federal petition.  Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U. S. 214,  486 U. S. 224, distinguished.  Furthermore, the narrow miscarriage of justice exception to the cause requirement is of no avail to McCleskey, since he cannot demonstrate that the alleged Massiah violation caused the conviction of an innocent person.  The record demonstrates that that violation, if it be one, resulted in the admission at trial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect the reliability of the guilt determination.  In fact, the Evans statement that McCleskey now embraces confirms his guilt.  Pp.  499 U. S. 497-503.

|499 u.s. 365|"City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.
No. 89-1671
Argued Nov. 28, 1990
Decided April 1, 1991
499 U.S. 365

Syllabus 
After respondent Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., entered the billboard market in petitioner Columbia, South Carolina, petitioner Columbia Outdoor Advertising, Inc. (COA), which controlled more than 95% of the market and enjoyed close relations with city officials, lobbied these officials to enact zoning ordinances restricting billboard construction.  After such ordinances were passed, Omni filed suit against petitioners under  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and the State's Unfair Trade Practices Act, alleging, inter alia, that the ordinances were the result of an anticompetitive conspiracy that stripped petitioners of any immunity to which they might otherwise be entitled.  After Omni obtained a jury verdict on all counts, the District Court granted petitioners' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that their activities were outside the scope of the federal antitrust laws.  The Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the verdict.
Held:
1. The city's restriction of billboard construction is immune from federal antitrust liability under Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341,  317 U. S. 352 -- which held that principles of federalism and state sovereignty render the Sherman Act inapplicable to anticompetitive restraints imposed by the States ""as an act of government"" -- and subsequent decisions according Parker immunity to municipal restriction of competition in implementation of state policy, see, e.g., Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34,  471 U. S. 38.  Pp.  499 U. S. 370-379.
(a) The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the city was prima facie entitled to Parker immunity for its billboard restrictions.  Although Parker immunity does not apply directly to municipalities or other political subdivisions of the States, it does apply where a municipality's restriction of competition is an authorized implementation of state policy.  South Carolina's zoning statutes unquestionably authorized the city to regulate the size, location, and spacing of billboards.  The additional Parker requirement that the city possess clear delegated authority to suppress competition, see, e.g., Hallie, supra, 471 U.S. at  471 U. S. 40-42, is also met here, since suppression of competition is, at the very least, a foreseeable result of zoning regulations.  Pp.  499 U. S. 370-373. 
Page 499 U. S. 366

(b) The Court of Appeals erred, however, in applying a ""conspiracy"" exception to Parker, which is not supported by the language of that case.  Such an exception would swallow up the Parker rule if ""conspiracy"" means nothing more than agreement to impose the regulation in question, since it is both inevitable and desirable that public officials agree to do what one or another group of private citizens urges upon them.  It would be similarly impractical to limit ""conspiracy"" to instances of governmental ""corruption,"" or governmental acts ""not in the public interest""; virtually all anticompetitive regulation is open to such charges, and the risk of unfavorable ex post facto judicial assessment would impair the States' ability to regulate their domestic commerce.  Nor is it appropriate to limit ""conspiracy"" to instances in which bribery or some other violation of state or federal law has been established, since the exception would then be unrelated to the purposes of the Sherman Act, which condemns trade restraints, not political activity.  With the possible exception of the situation in which the State is acting as a market participant, any action that qualifies as state action is ipso facto exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws.  Pp.  499 U. S. 374-379.
2. COA is immune from liability for its activities relating to enactment of the ordinances under Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127,  365 U. S. 141, which states a corollary to Parker:  the federal antitrust laws do not regulate the conduct of private individuals in seeking anticompetitive action from the government.  The Court of Appeals erred in applying the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr doctrine.  This exception encompasses situations in which persons use the governmental process itself -- as opposed to the outcome of that process -- as an anticompetitive weapon.  That is not the situation here.  California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508,  404 U. S. 512, distinguished.  Omni's suggestion that this Court adopt a ""conspiracy"" exception to Noerr immunity is rejected for largely the same reasons that prompt the Court to reject such an exception to Parker.  Pp.  499 U. S. 379-384.
3. The Court of Appeals on remand must determine (if the theory has been properly preserved) whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict for Omni based solely on its assertions that COA engaged in private anticompetitive actions, and whether COA can be held liable to Omni on its state law claim.

|499 u.s. 400|"Powers v. Ohio
No. 89-5011
Argued Oct. 9, 1990
Decided April 1, 1991
499 U.S. 400

Syllabus 
During jury selection at his state court trial for aggravated murder and related offenses, petitioner Powers, a white man, objected to the State's use of peremptory challenges to remove seven black venirepersons from the jury.  Powers' objections, which were based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, were overruled, the impaneled jury convicted him on several counts, and he was sentenced to prison.  On appeal, he contended that the State's discriminatory use of peremptories violated, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and that his own race was irrelevant to the right to object to the peremptories.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.
Held:  Under the Equal Protection Clause, a criminal defendant may object to race-based exclusions of jurors through peremptory challenges whether or not the defendant and the excluded jurors share the same race.  Pp.  499 U. S. 404-416.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a prosecutor from using the State's peremptory challenges to exclude otherwise qualified and unbiased persons from the petit jury solely by reason of their race.  See, e.g., Batson, supra, at  476 U. S. 84; Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474.  Contrary to Ohio's contention, racial identity between the objecting defendant and the excluded jurors does not constitute a relevant precondition for a Batson challenge, and would, in fact, contravene the substantive guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause and the policies underlying federal statutory law.  Although Batson did involve such an identity, it recognized that the State's discriminatory use of peremptories harms the excluded jurors by depriving them of a significant opportunity to participate in civil life.  476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 87.  Moreover, the discriminatory selection of jurors has been the subject of a federal criminal prohibition since Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1875.  Thus, although an individual juror does not have the right to sit on any particular petit jury, he or she does possess the right not to be excluded from one on account of race.  This Court rejects, as contrary to accepted equal protection principles, the arguments that no particular stigma or dishonor results if a prosecutor uses the raw fact of skin color to determine a juror's objectivity or qualifications, see Batson, supra, at  476 U. S. 87, and that race-based 
Page 499 U. S. 401
 peremptory challenges are permissible when visited upon members of all races in equal degree, see Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1.  Pp.  499 U. S. 410-416.
(b) A criminal defendant has standing to raise the third-party equal protection claims of jurors excluded by the prosecution because of their race.  Cf., e.g., Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106,  428 U. S. 112-116.  First, the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges causes the defendant cognizable injury, and he or she has a concrete interest in challenging the practice, because racial discrimination in jury selection casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process and places the fairness of the criminal proceeding in doubt.  Second, the relationship between the defendant and the excluded jurors is such that he or she is fully as effective a proponent of their rights as they themselves would be, since both have a common interest in eliminating racial discrimination from the courtroom, and there can be no doubt that the defendant will be a motivated, effective advocate because proof of a discriminatorily constituted jury may lead to the reversal of the conviction under Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 100.  Third, it is unlikely that a juror dismissed because of race will possess sufficient incentive to set in motion the arduous process needed to vindicate his or her own rights.  Thus, the fact that Powers' race differs from that of the excluded jurors is irrelevant to his standing to object to the discriminatory use of peremptories.  Pp.  499 U. S. 410-416.
Reversed and remanded.

			"|"Powers v. Ohio
No. 89-5011
Argued Oct. 9, 1990
Decided April 1, 1991
499 U.S. 400

Syllabus 
During jury selection at his state court trial for aggravated murder and related offenses, petitioner Powers, a white man, objected to the State's use of peremptory challenges to remove seven black venirepersons from the jury.  Powers' objections, which were based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, were overruled, the impaneled jury convicted him on several counts, and he was sentenced to prison.  On appeal, he contended that the State's discriminatory use of peremptories violated, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and that his own race was irrelevant to the right to object to the peremptories.  The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.
Held:  Under the Equal Protection Clause, a criminal defendant may object to race-based exclusions of jurors through peremptory challenges whether or not the defendant and the excluded jurors share the same race.  Pp.  499 U. S. 404-416.
(a) The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a prosecutor from using the State's peremptory challenges to exclude otherwise qualified and unbiased persons from the petit jury solely by reason of their race.  See, e.g., Batson, supra, at  476 U. S. 84; Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474.  Contrary to Ohio's contention, racial identity between the objecting defendant and the excluded jurors does not constitute a relevant precondition for a Batson challenge, and would, in fact, contravene the substantive guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause and the policies underlying federal statutory law.  Although Batson did involve such an identity, it recognized that the State's discriminatory use of peremptories harms the excluded jurors by depriving them of a significant opportunity to participate in civil life.  476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 87.  Moreover, the discriminatory selection of jurors has been the subject of a federal criminal prohibition since Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1875.  Thus, although an individual juror does not have the right to sit on any particular petit jury, he or she does possess the right not to be excluded from one on account of race.  This Court rejects, as contrary to accepted equal protection principles, the arguments that no particular stigma or dishonor results if a prosecutor uses the raw fact of skin color to determine a juror's objectivity or qualifications, see Batson, supra, at  476 U. S. 87, and that race-based 
Page 499 U. S. 401
 peremptory challenges are permissible when visited upon members of all races in equal degree, see Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1.  Pp.  499 U. S. 410-416.
(b) A criminal defendant has standing to raise the third-party equal protection claims of jurors excluded by the prosecution because of their race.  Cf., e.g., Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106,  428 U. S. 112-116.  First, the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges causes the defendant cognizable injury, and he or she has a concrete interest in challenging the practice, because racial discrimination in jury selection casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process and places the fairness of the criminal proceeding in doubt.  Second, the relationship between the defendant and the excluded jurors is such that he or she is fully as effective a proponent of their rights as they themselves would be, since both have a common interest in eliminating racial discrimination from the courtroom, and there can be no doubt that the defendant will be a motivated, effective advocate because proof of a discriminatorily constituted jury may lead to the reversal of the conviction under Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at  476 U. S. 100.  Third, it is unlikely that a juror dismissed because of race will possess sufficient incentive to set in motion the arduous process needed to vindicate his or her own rights.  Thus, the fact that Powers' race differs from that of the excluded jurors is irrelevant to his standing to object to the discriminatory use of peremptories.  Pp.  499 U. S. 410-416.
Reversed and remanded.

No. 89-1909
Argued Jan. 9, 1991
Decided March 27, 1991
499 U.S. 340

Syllabus 
Respondent Rural Telephone Service Company is a certified public utility providing telephone service to several communities in Kansas.  Pursuant to state regulation, Rural publishes a typical telephone directory, consisting of white pages and yellow pages.  It obtains data for the directory from subscribers, who must provide their names and addresses to obtain telephone service.  Petitioner Feist Publications, Inc., is a publishing company that specializes in area-wide telephone directories covering a much larger geographic range than directories such as Rural's.  When Rural refused to license its white pages listings to Feist for a directory covering 11 different telephone service areas, Feist extracted the listings it needed from Rural's directory without Rural's consent.  Although Feist altered many of Rural's listings, several were identical to listings in Rural's white pages.  The District Court granted summary judgment to Rural in its copyright infringement suit, holding that telephone directories are copyrightable.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Rural's white pages are not entitled to copyright, and therefore Feist's use of them does not constitute infringement.  Pp.   499 U. S. 344-364.
(a) Article I,  8, cl. 8, of the Constitution mandates originality as a prerequisite for copyright protection.  The constitutional requirement necessitates independent creation plus a modicum of creativity.  Since facts do not owe their origin to an act of authorship, they are not original, and thus are not copyrightable.  Although a compilation of facts may possess the requisite originality because the author typically chooses which facts to include, in what order to place them, and how to arrange the data so that readers may use them effectively, copyright protection extends only to those components of the work that are original to the author, not to the facts themselves.  This fact/expression dichotomy severely limits the scope of protection in fact-based works.  Pp.  499 U. S. 344-351.
(b) The Copyright Act of 1976 and its predecessor, the Copyright Act of 1909, leave no doubt that originality is the touchstone of copyright protection in directories and other fact-based works.  The 1976 Act explains that copyright extends to ""original works of authorship,"" 17 U.S.C.  102(a), and that there can be no copyright in facts,  102(b).  
Page 499 U. S. 341
 A compilation is not copyrightable per se, but is copyrightable only if its facts have been ""selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.""   101 (emphasis added).  Thus, the statute envisions that some ways of selecting, coordinating, and arranging data are not sufficiently original to trigger copyright protection.  Even a compilation that is copyrightable receives only limited protection, for the copyright does not extend to facts contained in the compilation.   103(b).  Lower courts that adopted a ""sweat of the brow"" or ""industrious collection"" test -- which extended a compilation's copyright protection beyond selection and arrangement to the facts themselves -- misconstrued the 1909 Act and eschewed the fundamental axiom of copyright law that no one may copyright facts or ideas.  Pp.  499 U. S. 351-361.
(c) Rural's white pages do not meet the constitutional or statutory requirements for copyright protection.  While Rural has a valid copyright in the directory as a whole because it contains some forward text and some original material in the yellow pages, there is nothing original in Rural's white pages.  The raw data are uncopyrightable facts, and the way in which Rural selected, coordinated, and arranged those facts is not original in any way.  Rural's selection of listings -- subscribers' names, towns, and telephone numbers -- could not be more obvious, and lacks the modicum of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression.  In fact, it is plausible to conclude that Rural did not truly ""select"" to publish its subscribers' names and telephone numbers, since it was required to do so by state law.  Moreover, there is nothing remotely creative about arranging names alphabetically in a white pages directory.  It is an age-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come to be expected as a matter of course.  Pp.  499 U. S. 361-364.

Arabian American Oil Company
Nos. 89-1838, 89-1845
Argued Jan. 16, 1991
Decided March 26, 1991
499 U.S. 244

Syllabus 
Petitioner Boureslan, a naturalized United States citizen born in Lebanon and working in Saudi Arabia, was discharged by his employer, respondent Arabian American Oil Company, a Delaware corporation.  After filing a charge with petitioner Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), he instituted suit in the District Court, seeking relief under, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the ground that he had been discriminated against because of his race, religion, and national origin.  In dismissing this claim, the court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Title VII's protections do not extend to United States citizens employed abroad by American employers.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Title VII does not apply extraterritorially to regulate the employment practices of United States firms that employ American citizens abroad.  Petitioners' evidence, while not totally lacking in probative value, falls short of demonstrating the clearly expressed affirmative congressional intent that is required to overcome the well-established presumption against statutory extraterritoriality.  Pp.  499 U. S. 249-259.
(a) Petitioners argue unpersuasively that Title VII's ""broad jurisdictional language"" -- which extends the Act's protections to commerce ""between a State and any place outside thereof"" -- evinces a clear intent to legislate extraterritorially.  The language relied on is ambiguous, does not speak directly to the question presented here, and constitutes boilerplate language found in any number of congressional Acts, none of which have been held to apply overseas.  Petitioners' argument also finds no support in this Court's decisions, which have repeatedly held that even statutes containing broad language in their definitions of ""commerce"" that expressly refer to ""foreign commerce"" do not apply abroad.  See, e.g., McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10,  372 U. S. 15,  372 U. S. 19.  Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280,  344 U. S. 286, distinguished.  Pp.  499 U. S. 249-253. 
Page 499 U. S. 245

(b) Petitioners also argue unpersuasively that Title VII's ""alien exemption"" clause -- which renders the statute inapplicable ""to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State"" -- clearly manifests the necessary congressional intent to cover employers of United States citizens working abroad.  If petitioners were correct, there would be no statutory basis for distinguishing between American employers and foreign employers.  Absent clearer evidence of congressional intent, this Court is unwilling to ascribe to Congress a policy which would raise difficult international law issues by imposing this country's employment discrimination regime upon foreign corporations operating in foreign commerce.  This conclusion is fortified by other factors suggesting a purely domestic focus, including Title VII's failure even to mention foreign nations or proceedings, despite a number of provisions indicating a concern that the sovereignty and laws of States not be unduly interfered with, and the Act's failure to provide any mechanisms for its overseas enforcement.  It is also reasonable to conclude that, had Congress intended Title VII to apply overseas, it would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures, as it did in amending the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to apply abroad.  Pp.  499 U. S. 253-256.
(c) Petitioners' contention that this Court should defer to the EEOC's position that Title VII applies abroad is rejected.  The EEOC's interpretation does not fare well under the deference standards set forth in General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125,  429 U. S. 140-146, since the interpretation has been neither contemporaneous with Title VII's enactment nor consistent with an earlier contrary position enunciated by the EEOC closer to the date the statute came into law, since the EEOC offers no basis in its experience for the change, and since the interpretation lacks support in the statute's plain language.  Although this Court does not wholly discount the interpretation, it is of insufficient weight, even when considered in combination with petitioners' other arguments, to overcome the presumption against extraterritorial application.  Pp.
499 U. S. 256-258.
(d) Congress' awareness of the need to make a clear statement that a statute applies overseas is amply demonstrated by the numerous occasions on which it has legislated extraterritoriality, including its amendment of the ADEA.  Congress may similarly amend Title VII, and, in doing so, will be able to calibrate its provisions in a way that this Court cannot.  Pp.  499 U. S. 258-259.

|499 u.s. 279|"Arizona v. Fulminante
No. 89-839
Argued Oct. 10, 1990
Decided March 26, 1991
499 U.S. 279

Syllabus 
After respondent Fulminante's 11-year-old stepdaughter was murdered in Arizona, he left the State, was convicted of an unrelated federal crime, and was incarcerated in a federal prison in New York.  There he was befriended by Anthony Sarivola, a fellow inmate who was a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was masquerading as an organized crime figure.  When Sarivola told Fulminante that he knew Fulminante was getting tough treatment from other inmates because of a rumor that he was a child murderer, and offered him protection in exchange for the truth, Fulminante admitted that he had killed the girl and provided details about the crime.  After Fulminante was released from prison, he also confessed to Sarivola's wife, whom he had never met before.  Subsequently, he was indicted in Arizona for first-degree murder.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress, inter alia, the confession to Sarivola, rejecting his contention that it was coerced, and thus barred by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court held that the confession was coerced and that this Court's precedent precluded the use of harmless error analysis in such a case.  It remanded the case for a new trial without the use of the confession.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
161 Ariz. 237, 778 P.2d 602, (1988), affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:
1. The State Supreme Court properly concluded that Fulminante's confession was coerced.  The court applied the appropriate test, totality of the circumstances, cf. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218,  412 U. S. 226, to determine the confession's voluntariness, and plainly found that Fulminante was motivated to confess by a fear of physical violence, absent protection from his friend Sarivola.  The court's finding, permissible on this record, that there was a credible threat of physical violence is sufficient to support a finding of coercion.  Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199,  361 U. S. 206.  Pp.  499 U. S. 285-288.
2. Under harmless error analysis, which the Court has determined applies to the admission of coerced confessions, post at  499 U. S. 306-312, the State has failed to meet its burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, 
Page 499 U. S. 280
 that the admission of Fulminante's confession to Sarivola was harmless.  Pp.  499 U. S. 295-302.
(a) A defendant's confession is like no other evidence.  It is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him, and, if it is a full confession, a jury may be tempted to rely on it alone in reaching its decision.  The risk that a coerced confession is unreliable, coupled with the profound impact that it has upon the jury, requires a reviewing court to exercise extreme caution before determining that the confession's admission was harmless.  Pp.  499 U. S. 295-296.
(b) The evidence shows that the State has failed to meet its burden.  First, the transcript reveals that both the trial court and the State recognized that a successful prosecution depended on the jury's believing both confessions, since it is unlikely that the physical and circumstantial evidence alone would have been sufficient to convict.  Second, the jury's assessment of the second confession could easily have depended on the presence of the first.  The jury might have believed that the two confessions reinforced and corroborated each other, since the only evidence corroborating some aspects of the second confession was in the first confession.  Without that confession, the jurors might have found the wife's story unbelievable because the second confession was given under questionable circumstances, and they might have believed that she was motivated to lie in order to receive favorable treatment from federal authorities for herself and her husband.  Third, the admission of the first confession led to the admission of evidence about Sarivola's organized crime connections, which depicted Fulminante as someone who willingly sought out the company of criminals and, thus, was prejudicial to him.  Finally, it is impossible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, who, during the sentencing phase, relied on evidence that could only be found in the two confessions, would have passed the same sentence without the confession.  Pp.  499 U. S. 296-302.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the harmless error rule adopted in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, is applicable to the admission of involuntary confessions.  The admission of such a confession is a ""trial error,"" which occurs during a case's presentation to the trier of fact, and may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738.  A trial error differs markedly from violations that are structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, and thus defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335; Tumey v. Ohio, 
Page 499 U. S. 281
 273 U. S. 510, distinguished.  It is also not the type of error that transcends the criminal process.  In fact, it is impossible to create a meaningful distinction between confessions elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, whose admission is subject to harmless error analysis, see, e.g., Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U. S. 371, and those elicited in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, since both confessions have the same evidentiary impact and may have been elicited by equally egregious conduct.  Pp.  499 U. S. 306-312.

			"|"Arizona v. Fulminante
No. 89-839
Argued Oct. 10, 1990
Decided March 26, 1991
499 U.S. 279

Syllabus 
After respondent Fulminante's 11-year-old stepdaughter was murdered in Arizona, he left the State, was convicted of an unrelated federal crime, and was incarcerated in a federal prison in New York.  There he was befriended by Anthony Sarivola, a fellow inmate who was a paid informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was masquerading as an organized crime figure.  When Sarivola told Fulminante that he knew Fulminante was getting tough treatment from other inmates because of a rumor that he was a child murderer, and offered him protection in exchange for the truth, Fulminante admitted that he had killed the girl and provided details about the crime.  After Fulminante was released from prison, he also confessed to Sarivola's wife, whom he had never met before.  Subsequently, he was indicted in Arizona for first-degree murder.  The trial court denied his motion to suppress, inter alia, the confession to Sarivola, rejecting his contention that it was coerced, and thus barred by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  The State Supreme Court held that the confession was coerced and that this Court's precedent precluded the use of harmless error analysis in such a case.  It remanded the case for a new trial without the use of the confession.
Held:  The judgment is affirmed.
161 Ariz. 237, 778 P.2d 602, (1988), affirmed.
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding that:
1. The State Supreme Court properly concluded that Fulminante's confession was coerced.  The court applied the appropriate test, totality of the circumstances, cf. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218,  412 U. S. 226, to determine the confession's voluntariness, and plainly found that Fulminante was motivated to confess by a fear of physical violence, absent protection from his friend Sarivola.  The court's finding, permissible on this record, that there was a credible threat of physical violence is sufficient to support a finding of coercion.  Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199,  361 U. S. 206.  Pp.  499 U. S. 285-288.
2. Under harmless error analysis, which the Court has determined applies to the admission of coerced confessions, post at  499 U. S. 306-312, the State has failed to meet its burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, 
Page 499 U. S. 280
 that the admission of Fulminante's confession to Sarivola was harmless.  Pp.  499 U. S. 295-302.
(a) A defendant's confession is like no other evidence.  It is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him, and, if it is a full confession, a jury may be tempted to rely on it alone in reaching its decision.  The risk that a coerced confession is unreliable, coupled with the profound impact that it has upon the jury, requires a reviewing court to exercise extreme caution before determining that the confession's admission was harmless.  Pp.  499 U. S. 295-296.
(b) The evidence shows that the State has failed to meet its burden.  First, the transcript reveals that both the trial court and the State recognized that a successful prosecution depended on the jury's believing both confessions, since it is unlikely that the physical and circumstantial evidence alone would have been sufficient to convict.  Second, the jury's assessment of the second confession could easily have depended on the presence of the first.  The jury might have believed that the two confessions reinforced and corroborated each other, since the only evidence corroborating some aspects of the second confession was in the first confession.  Without that confession, the jurors might have found the wife's story unbelievable because the second confession was given under questionable circumstances, and they might have believed that she was motivated to lie in order to receive favorable treatment from federal authorities for herself and her husband.  Third, the admission of the first confession led to the admission of evidence about Sarivola's organized crime connections, which depicted Fulminante as someone who willingly sought out the company of criminals and, thus, was prejudicial to him.  Finally, it is impossible to say beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge, who, during the sentencing phase, relied on evidence that could only be found in the two confessions, would have passed the same sentence without the confession.  Pp.  499 U. S. 296-302.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the harmless error rule adopted in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, is applicable to the admission of involuntary confessions.  The admission of such a confession is a ""trial error,"" which occurs during a case's presentation to the trier of fact, and may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See, e.g., Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738.  A trial error differs markedly from violations that are structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, and thus defy analysis by harmless error standards.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335; Tumey v. Ohio, 
Page 499 U. S. 281
 273 U. S. 510, distinguished.  It is also not the type of error that transcends the criminal process.  In fact, it is impossible to create a meaningful distinction between confessions elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment, whose admission is subject to harmless error analysis, see, e.g., Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U. S. 371, and those elicited in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, since both confessions have the same evidentiary impact and may have been elicited by equally egregious conduct.  Pp.  499 U. S. 306-312.

No. 89-1793
Argued Nov. 26, 1990
Decided March 26, 1991
499 U.S. 315

Syllabus 
When the events in this case occurred, the Home Owners' Loan Act authorized the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) to proscribe rules and regulations providing ""for the organization, incorporation, examination, and regulation"" of federal savings and loan associations, and to issue charters, ""giving primary consideration to the best practices of thrift institutions in the United States.""  12 U.S.C.  1464(a).  Pursuant to the Act, the FHLBB and the Federal Home Loan Bank-Dallas (FHLBD) undertook to advise about and oversee certain aspects of the operation of Independent American Savings Association (IASA), but instituted no formal action against the institution.  At their request, respondent Gaubert, chairman of the board and IASA's largest stockholder, removed himself from IASA's management and posted security for his personal guarantee that IASA's net worth would exceed regulatory minimums.  When the regulators threatened to close IASA unless its management and directors resigned, new management and directors were recommended by FHLB-D.  Thereafter, FHLB-D became more involved in IASA's day-to-day business, recommending the hiring of a certain consultant to advise it on operational and financial matters; advising it concerning whether, when, and how its subsidiaries should be placed into bankruptcy; mediating salary disputes; reviewing the draft of a complaint to be used in litigation; urging it to convert from state to federal charter; and intervening when the state savings and loan department attempted to install a supervisory agent at IASA.  The new directors soon announced that IASA had a substantial negative net worth, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) assumed receivership of the institution.  After his administrative tort claim was denied, Gaubert filed an action in the District Court against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), seeking damages for the lost value of his shares and for the property forfeited under his personal guarantee on the ground that the FHLBB and FHLB-D had been negligent in carrying out their supervisory activities.  The court granted the Government's motion to dismiss on the ground that the regulators' actions fell within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, 28 U.S.C.  2680(a).  The Court of Appeals reversed in part.  Relying on Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 61, 
Page 499 U. S. 316
 the court found that the claims concerning the regulators' activities after they assumed a supervisory role in IASA's day-to-day affairs were not ""policy decisions,"" which fall within the exception, but were ""operational actions,"" which do not.
Held:
1. The discretionary function exception covers acts involving an element of judgment or choice if they are based on considerations of public policy.  It is the nature of the conduct, rather than the status of the actor, that governs whether the exception applies.  In addition to protecting policymaking or planning functions and the promulgation of regulations to carry out programs, the exception also protects Government agents' actions involving the necessary element of choice and grounded in the social, economic, or political goals of a statute and regulations.  If an employee obeys the direction of a mandatory regulation, the Government will be protected because the action will be deemed in furtherance of the policies which led to the regulation's promulgation; and if an employee violates a mandatory regulation, there will be no shelter from liability, because there is no room for choice, and the action will be contrary to policy.  On the other hand, when established governmental policy, as expressed or implied by statute, regulation, or agency guidelines, allows a Government agent to exercise discretion, there is a strong presumption that the agent's acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.  Pp.  499 U. S. 322-325.
2. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the discretionary function exception does not reach decisions made at the operational or management level of IASA.  There is nothing in the description of a discretionary act that refers exclusively to policymaking or planning functions.  Day-to-day management of banking affairs regularly requires judgment as to which of a range of permissive courses is the wisest.  Neither Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15; Indian Towing, supra, nor Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U. S. 531, supports Gaubert's and the Court of Appeals' position that there is a dichotomy between discretionary functions and operational activities.  Pp.  499 U. S. 325-326.
3. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that some of the acts alleged in Gaubert's Amended Complaint were not discretionary acts within the meaning of  2680(a).  The challenged actions did not go beyond ""normal regulatory activity.""  They were discretionary, since there were no formal regulations governing the conduct in question, and since the relevant statutory provisions left to the agency's judgment when to institute proceedings against a financial institution and which mechanism to use.  Although the statutes provided only for formal proceedings, they did not prevent regulators from supervising IASA by informal means, a view held by the FHLBB, FHLBB Resolution No. 82-381.  Gaubert's 
Page 499 U. S. 317
 argument that the actions fall outside the exception because they involved the mere application of technical skills and business expertise was rejected when the rationale of the Court of Appeals' decision was disapproved.  The FHLBB's Resolution, coupled with the relevant statutory provisions, established governmental policy which is presumed to have been furthered when the regulators undertook day-to-day operational decisions.  Each of the regulators' actions was based on public policy considerations related either to the protection of the FSLIC's insurance fund or to federal oversight of the thrift industry.  Although the regulators used the power of persuasion to accomplish their goals, neither the pervasiveness of their presence nor the forcefulness of their recommendations is sufficient to alter their actions' supervisory nature.

No. 89-1541
Argued Nov. 27, 1990
Decided March 20, 1991
499 U.S. 144

Syllabus 
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 assigns distinct regulatory tasks to two independent administrative actors:  petitioner Secretary of Labor is charged with setting and enforcing workplace health and safety standards, and respondent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission is responsible for carrying out adjudicatory functions.  The Act also requires a court of appeals reviewing a Commission order to treat as ""conclusive"" Commission findings of fact that are ""supported by substantial evidence.""  In this case, having found that respondent CF & I Steel Corporation had equipped some of its employees with loose-fitting respirators that exposed them to impermissible coke oven emission levels, the Secretary issued a citation to CF & I and assessed a monetary penalty against it for violating a regulation promulgated by the Secretary requiring an employer to institute a respiratory protection program.  The Commission vacated the citation, ruling that the facts did not establish a violation of that regulation, which was the sole asserted basis for liability, since the regulation expressly requires only that an employer train employees in the proper use of respirators, whereas another regulation expressly states the employer's obligation to assure a proper fit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that where, as here, the relevant regulations are ambiguous, a reviewing court must defer to the Commission's reasonable interpretation rather than the Secretary's interpretation, since Congress intended to delegate to the Commission the normal complement of adjudicative powers possessed by traditional administrative agencies, including the power to ""declare' the law.""  Concluding that the Commission's interpretation was a reasonable one, the court did not assess the reasonableness of the Secretary's competing view.
Held:  A reviewing court should defer to the Secretary when the Secretary and the Commission furnish reasonable but conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous regulation promulgated by the Secretary under the Act.  Pp.  499 U. S. 150-159.
(a) It must be inferred from the Act's unusual ""split enforcement"" structure and from its legislative history that the power to render authoritative interpretations of the Secretary's regulations is a necessary adjunct of the Secretary's rulemaking and enforcement powers.  The 
Page 499 U. S. 145
 Secretary, as the promulgator of standards, is in a better position than the Commission to reconstruct the purpose of particular regulations.  Moreover, since the Secretary, as enforcer, comes into contact with a much greater number of regulatory problems than does the Commission, the Secretary is more likely to develop the expertise relevant to assessing the effect of a particular regulatory interpretation.  Furthermore, dividing the power to make and enforce standards from the power to make law by interpreting them would make two administrative actors ultimately responsible for implementing the Act's policy objectives, an outcome inconsistent with Congress' intent in combining legislative and enforcement powers in the Secretary.  It must also be concluded that Congress did not intend to endow the Commission with the normal adjudicative powers possessed by a traditional, unitary agency.  Such an agency permissibly uses adjudication to engage in lawmaking and policymaking only because it also has been delegated the power to make law and policy through rulemaking, and necessarily interprets regulations that it has promulgated.  The more plausible inference is that the Commission was meant to have the type of nonpolicymaking adjudicatory powers typically exercised by a court in the agency-review context, such that the Commission is authorized to review the Secretary's interpretations only for consistency with the regulatory language and for reasonableness, and possesses no more power than is necessary to make authoritative findings of fact and to apply the Secretary's standards to those facts in making a decision.  Although the Commission was established in response to concerns that combining rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudicatory power in the Secretary would leave employers unprotected from prosecutorial bias, such concerns are dispelled by the vesting of authoritative factfinding and review powers in a body wholly independent of the administrative enforcer; regulated parties are protected from biased interpretations when the Commission and ultimately the court of appeals review the Secretary's interpretation for reasonableness.  Nor is such an interpretation, when furnished in the course of an administrative adjudication, a mere ""litigating position"" undeserving of judicial deference under this Court's precedents.  Since such an interpretation is agency action, not a post hoc rationalization of it, and assumes a form expressly provided for by Congress when embodied in a citation, the Secretary's litigating position before the Commission is as much an exercise of delegated lawmaking powers as is the Secretary's promulgation of health and safety standards.  Pp.  499 U. S. 150-157.
(b) The reviewing court should defer to the Secretary only if the Secretary's interpretation of an ambiguous regulation is reasonable.  That interpretation is subject to the same Administrative Procedure Act standard of substantive review that applies to any other exercise of delegated 
Page 499 U. S. 146
 lawmaking power.  Moreover, the decision to use a citation as the initial means for announcing a particular interpretation may bear on the adequacy of notice to regulated parties, the quality of the Secretary's elaboration of pertinent policy considerations, and other factors relevant to the reasonableness of the Secretary's exercise of delegated lawmaking powers.  Since the Court of Appeals did not address the reasonableness of the Secretary's interpretation, it, rather than this Court, must do so in the first instance on remand.  Pp.  499 U. S. 157-159.

The court granted the Government's motion to substitute itself for Marshall pursuant to the Gonzalez Act, which provides that, in a suit against military medical personnel for employment-related torts, the Government is to be substituted as the defendant and the suit is to proceed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  The court then dismissed the suit on the ground that the FTCA excludes recovery for injuries sustained abroad.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that neither the Gonzalez Act nor the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Act) required substitution of the Government or otherwise immunized Marshall.  It ruled that  5 of the Act -- which, with two exceptions not here relevant, confers absolute immunity on Government employees by making an FTCA action against the Government the exclusive remedy for their employment-related torts -- applies only when the FTCA provides a remedy.
Held:  The Act immunizes Government employees from suit even when an FTCA exception precludes recovery against the Government.  Pp.  499 U. S. 165-175
(a) The Act's language confirms that  5 makes the FTCA the exclusive mode of recovery.  Congress recognized that requiring substitution of the Government would sometimes foreclose a tort plaintiff's recovery altogether when it provided in  6 of the Act that suits proceeding under the FTCA are subject to the ""limitations and exceptions"" applicable to FTCA actions.  Moreover, in light of  5's two express exceptions preserving employee liability, a third exception preserving liability when the FTCA bars suit cannot be implied, absent a contrary legislative intent.  Furthermore, the enactment of  9 of the Act -- which provides for the substitution of the Tennessee Valley Authority as defendant in employment-related tort suits against its employees -- supports no inference on the scope of  5 immunity when the FTCA precludes suit against the United States.  Pp.  499 U. S. 165-169
(b) Respondents' several arguments to support the decision below are rejected.  Construing the Act to preclude Marshall's tort liability does 
Page 499 U. S. 161
 not result in an implied repeal of the Gonzalez Act.  The Gonzalez Act functions solely to protect military medical personnel from malpractice liability, and does not create rights in favor of malpractice plaintiffs, whose rights arise instead under state or foreign law.  Since respondents' rights as malpractice plaintiffs were not created by Congress, the rule disfavoring implied repeals is not implicated when Congress limits those rights.  Similarly, respondents' suggestion that the Act was meant to apply solely to those Government employees not already protected from tort liability by a preexisting federal immunity statute is inconsistent with the Act's purpose.  The Act's plain language makes no distinction between employees who are covered under pre-Act immunity statutes and those who are not.  Congress clearly was aware of the pre-Act immunity statutes.  Congress' enactment of the two express limitations of immunity under  5 of the Act indicates that, if it intended to limit the Act's protection to employees not covered under the pre-Act immunity statutes, it would have said this expressly.  Finally, since nothing in the Gonzalez Act imposes any obligations or duties of care upon military physicians, respondents' malpractice claim does not involve a violation of the Gonzalez Act.  Thus, it does not fall within the Act's exception for suits brought for a violation of a United States statute under which action against an employee is otherwise authorized.  Pp.  499 U. S. 169-175.

Syllabus 
A primary ingredient in respondent's battery manufacturing process is lead, occupational exposure to which entails health risks, including the risk of harm to any fetus carried by a female employee.  After eight of its employees became pregnant while maintaining blood lead levels exceeding that noted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as critical for a worker planning to have a family, respondent announced a policy barring all women, except those whose infertility was medically documented, from jobs involving actual or potential lead exposure exceeding the OSHA standard.  Petitioners, a group including employees affected by respondent's fetal-protection policy, filed a class action in the District Court, claiming that the policy constituted sex discrimination violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.  The court granted summary judgment for respondent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The latter court held that the proper standard for evaluating the policy was the business necessity inquiry applied by other Circuits; that respondent was entitled to summary judgment because petitioners had failed to satisfy their burden of persuasion as to each of the elements of the business necessity defense under Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642; and that, even if the proper evaluative standard was bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) analysis, respondent still was entitled to summary judgment because its fetal-protection policy is reasonably necessary to further the industrial safety concern that is part of the essence of respondent's business.
Held:  Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), forbids sex-specific fetal-protection policies.  Pp.  499 U. S. 197-211.
(a) By excluding women with childbearing capacity from lead-exposed jobs, respondent's policy creates a facial classification based on gender and explicitly discriminates against women on the basis of their sex under  703(a) of Title VII.  Moreover, in using the words ""capable of bearing children"" as the criterion for exclusion, the policy explicitly classifies on the basis of potential for pregnancy, which classification must be 
Page 499 U. S. 188
 regarded, under the PDA, in the same light as explicit sex discrimination.  The Court of Appeals erred in assuming that the policy was facially neutral because it had only a discriminatory effect on women's employment opportunities, and because its asserted purpose, protecting women's unconceived offspring, was ostensibly benign.  The policy is not neutral, because it does not apply to male employees in the same way as it applies to females, despite evidence about the debilitating effect of lead exposure on the male reproductive system.  Also, the absence of a malevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a neutral policy with a discriminatory effect.  Cf. Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U. S. 542.  Because respondent's policy involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination, the business necessity defense and its burden-shifting under Wards Cove are inapplicable here.  Rather, as indicated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's enforcement policy, respondent's policy may be defended only as a BFOQ, a more stringent standard than business necessity.  Pp.  499 U. S. 197-200.
(b) The language of both the BFOQ provision set forth in  703(e)(1) of Title VII -- which allows an employer to discriminate on the basis of sex ""in those certain instances where . . . sex . . . is a [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of [the] particular business"" -- and the PDA provision that amended Title VII-which specifies that, unless pregnant employees differ from others ""in their ability or inability to work,"" they must be ""treated the same"" as other employees ""for all employment-related purposes"" -- as well as these provisions' legislative history and the case law, prohibit an employer from discriminating against a woman because of her capacity to become pregnant unless her reproductive potential prevents her from performing the duties of her job.  The so-called safety exception to the BFOQ is limited to instances in which sex or pregnancy actually interferes with the employee's ability to perform, and the employer must direct its concerns in this regard to those aspects of the woman's job-related activities that fall within the ""essence"" of the particular business.  Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U. S. 321,  433 U. S. 333,  433 U. S. 335; Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U. S. 400,  472 U. S. 413.  The unconceived fetuses of respondent's female employees are neither customers nor third parties whose safety is essential to the business of battery manufacturing.  Pp.  499 U. S. 200-206.
(c) Respondent cannot establish a BFOQ.  Fertile women, as far as appears in the record, participate in the manufacture of batteries as efficiently as anyone else.  Moreover, respondent's professed concerns about the welfare of the next generation do not suffice to establish a BFOQ of female sterility.  Title VII, as amended by the PDA, mandates that decisions about the welfare of future children be left to the parents 
Page 499 U. S. 189
 who conceive, bear, support, and raise them, rather than to the employers who hire those parents or the courts.  Pp.  499 U. S. 206-207.
(d) An employer's tort liability for potential fetal injuries and its increased costs due to fertile women in the workplace do not require a different result.  If, under general tort principles, Title VII bans sex-specific fetal-protection policies, the employer fully informs the woman of the risk, and the employer has not acted negligently, the basis for holding an employer liable seems remote, at best.  Moreover, the incremental cost of employing members of one sex cannot justify a discriminatory refusal to hire members of that gender.  See, e.g., Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702,  435 U. S. 716-718, and n. 32.  Pp.  499 U. S. 208-211.

Syllabus 
Respondent Russell filed a diversity action in the District Court, alleging, inter alia, that petitioner college, located in Rhode Island, had breached an implied agreement to educate her when it asked her to withdraw from its nursing program for failing to meet certain weight loss commitments.  The court denied petitioner's motion for a directed verdict, concluding that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would apply the commercial doctrine of substantial performance in an academic setting, such that Russell could prevail even though she had not fully complied with the contract's terms.  The jury returned a verdict for Russell, which the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Applying the appellate deference that it customarily accords to interpretations of state law made by federal judges of that State, the Court of Appeals found that the District Court's state law determination did not constitute reversible error.
Held:  Courts of appeals must review de novo district courts' state law determinations.  Pp.  499 U. S. 231-240.
(a) The general rule of independent appellate review of legal issues best serves the dual goals of doctrinal coherence and economy of judicial administration.  Courts of appeals are structurally suited to the collaborative juridical process that promotes decisional accuracy.  They are able to devote their primary attention to legal issues.  They have the advantage of refined briefs which bring to bear on the legal issues more information and more comprehensive analysis than was provided to the district judge.  And they employ multi-judge panels that permit reflective dialogue and collective judgment.  P.  499 U. S. 231-233.
(b) Departure from the rule of independent appellate review is not warranted by the exercise of diversity jurisdiction.  Appellate deference to the district court's state law determination is inconsistent with the aims of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, to discourage forum shopping and to avoid inequitable administration of the laws, since it invites divergent development of state law among the federal trial courts within a single State and creates a dual system of enforcement of state-created rights, in which the substantive rule applied to a dispute may depend on the choice of forum.  Such deference is also contrary to this Court's cases decided after Erie. See, e.g., New York Life Ins. Co. v. Jackson, 304 U. S. 261.  Pp.  499 U. S. 233-235.

(c) Russell's argument that appellate courts professing adherence to the deference rule actually are reviewing de novo the district court state law determinations is rejected.  Courts of appeals that profess deference are, in fact, deferring.  When de novo review is compelled, no form of appellate deference is acceptable.  Russell's argument that district judges are better arbiters of unsettled state law because they have exposure to the judicial system of the State in which they sit is based on overbroad generalizations and is foreclosed by this Court's decision in Erie.

|499 u.s. 65|"Air Line Pilots Association, International v. O'Neill
No. 89-1493
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided March 19, 1991
499 U.S. 65

Syllabus 
After Continental Airlines, Inc., filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, it repudiated its collective bargaining agreement with petitioner Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA).  An acrimonious strike ensued, during which Continental hired replacement pilots and reemployed several hundred crossover strikers.  Two years into the strike, Continental announced in its ""Supplementary Base Vacancy Bid 1985-5"" (85-5 bid) that it would fill a large number of anticipated vacancies using a system that allows pilots to bid for positions and that, in the past, had assigned positions by seniority.  Although ALPA authorized strikers to submit bids, Continental announced that all of the positions had been awarded to working pilots.  ALPA and Continental then agreed to end the strike, dispose of some related litigation, and reallocate the positions covered by the 85-5 bid.  Striking pilots were offered the option of settling all outstanding claims with Continental and participating in the 85-5 bid positions' allocations, electing not to return to work and receiving severance pay, or retaining their individual claims against Continental and becoming eligible to return to work only after all the settling pilots had been reinstated.  Thus, striking pilots received some of the positions previously awarded to the working pilots.  After the settlement, respondents, former striking pilots, filed suit in the District Court against ALPA, charging, inter alia, that the union had breached its duty of fair representation.  The court granted ALPA's motion for summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It rejected ALPA's argument that a union cannot breach the fair representation duty without intentional misconduct, applying, instead, the rule announced in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, that a union violates the duty if its actions are either ""arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith,"" id. at 190.  With respect to the test's first component, the court found that a nonarbitrary decision must be (1) based upon relevant permissible union factors, (2) a rational result of the consideration of those factors, and (3) inclusive of a fair and impartial consideration of all employees' interests.  Applying that test, the court concluded that a jury could find that ALPA acted arbitrarily by negotiating a settlement less favorable than the consequences of a complete surrender 
Page 499 U. S. 66
 to Continental, which the court believed would have left intact the striking pilots' seniority rights with regard to the 85-5 bid positions.  It also found the existence of a material issue of fact whether the favored treatment of working pilots in the allocation of the 85-5 bid positions constituted discrimination against the strikers.
Held:

Thus, when acting in that capacity, the union is not, as ALPA contends, required only to act in good faith and treat its members equally and in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  Rather, it also has a duty to act in a rational, nonarbitrary fashion to provide its members fair and adequate representation.  See, e.g., Vaca v. Sipes, supra, 386 U.S. at  386 U. S. 177; Steele v.

The Court of Appeals' refinement of the arbitrariness component authorizes more judicial review of the substance of negotiated agreements than is consistent with national labor policy.  Congress did not intend judicial review of a union's performance to permit the court to substitute its own view of the proper bargain for that reached by the union.  See, e.g., NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477,  361 U. S. 488.  Rather, Congress envisioned the relationship between the courts and labor unions as similar to that between the courts and the legislature.  See Steele, supra, 323 U.S. at  323 U. S. 198.  Any substantive examination of a union's performance, therefore, must be highly deferential, recognizing the wide latitude that negotiators need for the effective performance of their bargaining responsibilities.

Given Continental's resistance during the strike, it would have been rational for ALPA to recognize that a voluntary return to work might have precipitated litigation over the strikers' right to the positions, and that Continental might not have abandoned its bargaining position without a settlement disposing of the pilots' individual claims.  Thus, it would have been rational to negotiate a settlement

 that produced certain and prompt access to a share of the new jobs, avoided the costs and risks associated with major litigation, and was more favorable than a return to work for the significant number of pilots who chose severance.  Any discrimination between striking and working pilots in the allocation of the 85-5 bid positions does not represent a breach of the duty, because, if it is correct that ALPA's decision to accept a compromise was rational, some form of allocation was inevitable.

No. 89-1493
Argued Jan. 14, 1991
Decided March 19, 1991
499 U.S. 65

Syllabus 
After Continental Airlines, Inc., filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, it repudiated its collective bargaining agreement with petitioner Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA).  An acrimonious strike ensued, during which Continental hired replacement pilots and reemployed several hundred crossover strikers.  Two years into the strike, Continental announced in its ""Supplementary Base Vacancy Bid 1985-5"" (85-5 bid) that it would fill a large number of anticipated vacancies using a system that allows pilots to bid for positions and that, in the past, had assigned positions by seniority.  Although ALPA authorized strikers to submit bids, Continental announced that all of the positions had been awarded to working pilots.  ALPA and Continental then agreed to end the strike, dispose of some related litigation, and reallocate the positions covered by the 85-5 bid.  Striking pilots were offered the option of settling all outstanding claims with Continental and participating in the 85-5 bid positions' allocations, electing not to return to work and receiving severance pay, or retaining their individual claims against Continental and becoming eligible to return to work only after all the settling pilots had been reinstated.  Thus, striking pilots received some of the positions previously awarded to the working pilots.  After the settlement, respondents, former striking pilots, filed suit in the District Court against ALPA, charging, inter alia, that the union had breached its duty of fair representation.  The court granted ALPA's motion for summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  It rejected ALPA's argument that a union cannot breach the fair representation duty without intentional misconduct, applying, instead, the rule announced in Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, that a union violates the duty if its actions are either ""arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith,"" id. at 190.  With respect to the test's first component, the court found that a nonarbitrary decision must be (1) based upon relevant permissible union factors, (2) a rational result of the consideration of those factors, and (3) inclusive of a fair and impartial consideration of all employees' interests.  Applying that test, the court concluded that a jury could find that ALPA acted arbitrarily by negotiating a settlement less favorable than the consequences of a complete surrender 
Page 499 U. S. 66
 to Continental, which the court believed would have left intact the striking pilots' seniority rights with regard to the 85-5 bid positions.  It also found the existence of a material issue of fact whether the favored treatment of working pilots in the allocation of the 85-5 bid positions constituted discrimination against the strikers.
Held:
1. The tripartite standard announced in Vaca v. Sipes, supra, applies to a union in its negotiating capacity.  See, e.g., Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U. S. 735,  487 U. S. 743.

Syllabus 
After petitioner West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. (WVUH), prevailed at trial in its suit under 42 U.S.C.  1983 against respondent Pennsylvania officials over medicaid reimbursement rates for services provided Pennsylvania residents, the District Court awarded fees pursuant to  1988, which, inter alia, gives the court in certain civil rights suits discretion to allow the prevailing party ""a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.""  WVUH's award included fees attributable to an accounting firm and three doctors specializing in hospital finance hired to assist in the preparation of the suit and to testify.  The Court of Appeals affirmed as to the merits, but reversed as to the expert fees, disallowing them except to the extent that they fell within the $30-per-day fees for witnesses provided by 28 U.S.C.  1920(3) and 1821(b).
Held:  Fees for services rendered by experts in civil rights litigation may not be shifted to the losing party as part of ""a reasonable attorney's fee"" under  1988.  Pp.  499 U. S. 86-102.
(a) Sections 1920 and 1821(b) define the full extent of a federal court's power to shift expert fees, whether testimonial or nontestimonial, absent ""explicit statutory authority to the contrary.""  Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437,  482 U. S. 439; see id. at  482 U. S. 441.  This Court will not lightly infer that Congress has repealed those sections through a provision like  1988 that does not refer explicitly to witness fees.  See id. at  482 U. S. 445.  Pp.  499 U. S. 86-87
(b) Statutory usage before, during, and after 1976 (the date of  1988's enactment) did not regard the phrase ""attorney's fees"" as embracing fees for experts' services.  Pp.  499 U. S. 88-92.
(c) At the time of  1988's enactment, judicial usage did not regard the phrase ""attorney's fees"" as including experts' fees.  Pp.  499 U. S. 92-97.
(d) Where, as here, a statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous, this Court's sole function is to enforce it according to its terms.  See, e.g., United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,  489 U. S. 241.  Although chronology and the remarks of some sponsors of the bill that became  1988 suggest that it was viewed as a response to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.

  1988 is both broader and narrower than the pre-Alyeska regime.  The best evidence of congressional purpose is the statutory text, which cannot be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the enactment process.  WVUH's argument that Congress would have included expert fees in  1988 if it had thought about it, as it did in the EAJA, and that this Court has a duty to ask how Congress would have decided had it actually considered the question, profoundly mistakes the Court's role with respect to unambiguous statutory terms.

Once the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) has approved a rail carrier consolidation under the conditions set forth in Chapter 113 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Act), 49 U.S.C.  11301 et seq., a carrier in such a consolidation
""is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let [it] carry out the transaction. . . .""
 11341(a).  In these cases, the ICC issued orders exempting parties to approved railway mergers from the provisions of collective bargaining agreements.  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that  11341(a) does not authorize the ICC to relieve a party of collectively bargained obligations that impede implementation of an approved transaction.  Reasoning, inter alia, that the legislative history demonstrates a congressional intent that  11341(a) apply to specific types of positive laws, and not to common law rules of liability such as those governing contracts, the court declined to decide whether the section could operate to override provisions of the Railway Labor Act (RLA) governing the formation, construction, and enforcement of the collective bargaining agreements at issue.
Held:  The  11341(a) exemption ""from all other law"" includes a carrier's legal obligations under a collective bargaining agreement when necessary to carry out an ICC-approved transaction.  The exemption's language, as correctly interpreted by the ICC, is clear, broad, and unqualified, bespeaking an unambiguous congressional intent to include any obstacle imposed by law.  That language neither admits of a distinction between positive enactments and common law liability rules nor supports the exclusion of contractual obligations.  Thus, the exemption effects an override of such obligations by superseding the law -- here, the RLA -- which makes the contract binding.  Cf. Schwabacher v. United States, 334 U. S. 182,  334 U. S. 194-195,  334 U. S. 200-201.  This determination makes sense of the Act's consolidation provisions, which were designed to promote economy and efficiency in interstate transportation by removing 
Page 499 U. S. 118
 the burdens of excessive expenditure.  Whereas  11343(a)(1) requires the ICC to approve consolidations in the public interest, and  11347 conditions such approval on satisfaction of certain labor-protective conditions, the  11341(a) exemption guarantees that, once employee interests are accounted for and the consolidation is approved, the RLA -- whose major disputes resolution process is virtually interminable -- will not prevent the efficiencies of consolidation from being achieved.  Moreover, this reading will not, as the lower court feared, lead to bizarre results, since  11341(a) does not exempt carriers from all law, but rather from all law necessary to carry out an approved transaction.  Although it might be true that  11341(a)'s scope is limited by  11347, and that the breadth of the exemption is defined by the scope of the approved transaction, the conditions of approval and the standard for necessity are not at issue, because the lower court did not pass on them and the parties do not challenge them here.

Syllabus 
After respondents' health insurance lapsed when one Ruffin, an agent for petitioner insurance company and another, unaffiliated insurance company, misappropriated premiums issued by respondents' employer for payment to the other insurer, respondents filed an action for damages in state court, claiming fraud by Ruffin and seeking to hold petitioner liable on a respondeat superior theory.  Following the trial court's charge instructing the jury that it could award punitive damages if, inter alia, it determined there was liability for fraud, the jury, among other things, returned a verdict for respondent Haslip of over $1 million against petitioner and Ruffin, which sum included a punitive damages award that was more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages Haslip claimed.  The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed, specifically upholding the punitive damages award.
Held:  The punitive damages award in this case did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  499 U. S. 9-24.
(a) Holding petitioner responsible for Ruffin's acts did not violate substantive due process.  The jury's finding that Ruffin was acting within the scope of his apparent authority as an agent of petitioner when he defrauded respondents was not disturbed by the State Supreme Court and is amply supported by the record.  Moreover, Alabama's longstanding common law rule that an insurer is liable for both compensatory and punitive damages for the intentional fraud of its agent effected within the scope of his employment rationally advances the State's interest in minimizing 
Page 499 U. S. 2
 fraud, since that rule creates a strong financial incentive for vigilance by insurers.  Thus, imposing liability on petitioner under the respondeat superior doctrine is not fundamentally unfair.  Pp.  499 U. S. 12-15.
(b) Since every state and federal court considering the question has ruled that the common law method for assessing punitive damages does not in itself violate due process, it cannot be said that that method is so inherently unfair as to be per se unconstitutional.  The method was well established before the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, and nothing in the Amendment's text or history indicates an intention to overturn it.  Pp.  499 U. S. 15-18.
(c) Nevertheless, unlimited jury or judicial discretion in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that are unacceptable under the Due Process Clause.  Although a mathematical bright line cannot be drawn between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case, general concerns of reasonableness and adequate guidance from the court when the case is tried to a jury properly enter into the constitutional calculus.

			"|"Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip
No. 89-1279
Argued Oct. 3, 1990
Decided March 4, 1991
No. 89-1279
499 U.S. 1

Syllabus 
After respondents' health insurance lapsed when one Ruffin, an agent for petitioner insurance company and another, unaffiliated insurance company, misappropriated premiums issued by respondents' employer for payment to the other insurer, respondents filed an action for damages in state court, claiming fraud by Ruffin and seeking to hold petitioner liable on a respondeat superior theory.  Following the trial court's charge instructing the jury that it could award punitive damages if, inter alia, it determined there was liability for fraud, the jury, among other things, returned a verdict for respondent Haslip of over $1 million against petitioner and Ruffin, which sum included a punitive damages award that was more than 4 times the amount of compensatory damages Haslip claimed.  The Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed, specifically upholding the punitive damages award.
Held:  The punitive damages award in this case did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  499 U. S. 9-24.
(a) Holding petitioner responsible for Ruffin's acts did not violate substantive due process.  The jury's finding that Ruffin was acting within the scope of his apparent authority as an agent of petitioner when he defrauded respondents was not disturbed by the State Supreme Court and is amply supported by the record.  Moreover, Alabama's longstanding common law rule that an insurer is liable for both compensatory and punitive damages for the intentional fraud of its agent effected within the scope of his employment rationally advances the State's interest in minimizing 
Page 499 U. S. 2
 fraud, since that rule creates a strong financial incentive for vigilance by insurers.  Thus, imposing liability on petitioner under the respondeat superior doctrine is not fundamentally unfair.  Pp.  499 U. S. 12-15.
(b) Since every state and federal court considering the question has ruled that the common law method for assessing punitive damages does not in itself violate due process, it cannot be said that that method is so inherently unfair as to be per se unconstitutional.  The method was well established before the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, and nothing in the Amendment's text or history indicates an intention to overturn it.  Pp.  499 U. S. 15-18.
(c) Nevertheless, unlimited jury or judicial discretion in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that are unacceptable under the Due Process Clause.  Although a mathematical bright line cannot be drawn between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case, general concerns of reasonableness and adequate guidance from the court when the case is tried to a jury properly enter into the constitutional calculus.  Pp.  499 U. S. 18.
(d) The punitive damages assessed against petitioner, although large in comparison to the compensatory damages claimed by Haslip, did not violate due process, since the award did not lack objective criteria and was subject to the full panoply of procedural protections.  First, the trial court's instructions placed reasonable constraints on the exercise of the jury's discretion by expressly describing punitive damages' purposes of retribution and deterrence, by requiring the jury to consider the character and degree of the particular wrong, and by explaining that the imposition of punitive damages was not compulsory.

Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma
No. 89-1322
Argued Jan. 7, 1991
Decided Feb. 26, 1991
498 U.S. 505

Syllabus 
Although, for many years, respondent Indian Tribe has sold cigarettes at a convenience store that it owns and operates in Oklahoma on land held in trust for it by the Federal Government, it has never collected Oklahoma's cigarette tax on these sales.  In 1987, petitioner, the Oklahoma Tax Commission (Oklahoma or Commission), served the Tribe with an assessment letter, demanding that it pay taxes on cigarette sales occurring between 1982 and 1986.  The Tribe filed suit in the District Court to enjoin the assessment, and Oklahoma counterclaimed to enforce the assessment and to enjoin the Tribe from making future sales without collecting and remitting state taxes.  The court refused to dismiss the counterclaims on the Tribe's motion, which was based on the assertion that the Tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity from suit.  The court held on the merits that the Commission lacked authority to tax on-reservation sales to tribal members or to tax the Tribe directly, and therefore that the Tribe was immune from Oklahoma's suit to collect past unpaid taxes directly, but that the Tribe could be required to collect taxes prospectively for on-reservation sales to nonmembers.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding, inter alia, that the lower court erred in entertaining Oklahoma's counterclaims because the Tribe enjoys absolute sovereign immunity from suit and had not waived that immunity by filing its action for injunctive relief, and that Oklahoma lacked authority to tax any on-reservation sales, whether to tribesmen or nonmembers.
Held:  Under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, a State that has not asserted jurisdiction over Indian lands under Public Law 280 may not tax sales of goods to tribesmen occurring on land held in trust for a federally recognized Indian tribe, but is free to collect taxes on such sales to nonmembers of the tribe.  Pp.  498 U. S. 509-514.
(a) The Tribe did not waive its inherent sovereign immunity from suit merely by seeking an injunction against the Commission's proposed tax assessment.  United States v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506,  309 U. S. 511-512,  309 U. S. 513.  In light of this Court's reaffirmation, in a number of cases, of its longstanding doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity, and Congress' consistent reiteration of its approval of the doctrine in order to promote Indian self-government, self-sufficiency, an 
Page 498 U. S. 506
 economic development, the Court is not disposed to modify or abandon the doctrine at this time.  Nor is there merit to Oklahoma's contention that immunity should not apply because the Tribe's cigarette sales do not occur on a formally designated ""reservation.""  Trust land qualifies as a reservation for tribal immunity purposes where, as here, it has been ""validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government.""  United States v. John, 437 U. S. 634,  437 U. S. 648-649.  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145,  411 U. S. 148-149, which approved nondiscriminatory state taxation of activities on non-reservation, nontrust Government land leased by Indians, is not to the contrary.  Pp.  498 U. S. 509-511.
(b) Nevertheless, the Tribe's sovereign immunity does not deprive Oklahoma of the authority to tax cigarette sales to nonmembers of the Tribe at the Tribe's store, and the Tribe has an obligation to assist in the collection of validly imposed state taxes on such sales.  Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, 425 U. S. 463,  425 U. S. 482, 483; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134.  This case is not distinguishable from Moe and Colville on the ground that Oklahoma disclaimed jurisdiction over Indian lands upon entering the Union and did not reassert jurisdiction over civil causes of action in such lands as permitted by Public Law 280.  Neither of those cases depended on the assertion of such jurisdiction by the State in question, and it is simply incorrect to conclude that the Public Law was the essential (yet unspoken) basis for the Court's decision in Colville.  Although the Tribe's sovereign immunity bars Oklahoma from pursuing its most efficient remedy -- a lawsuit -- to enforce its rights, adequate alternatives may exist, since individual Indians employed in ""smoke-shops"" may not share tribal immunity, and since States are free to collect their sales taxes from cigarette wholesalers or to enter into mutually satisfactory agreements with tribes for the collection of taxes.  If these alternatives prove to be unsatisfactory, States may seek appropriate legislation from Congress.  Pp.  498 U. S. 511-514.

Syllabus 
The United States Postal Service's monopoly over the carriage of letters in and for the Nation is codified in a group of statutes known as the Private Express Statutes (PES).  The monopoly was created by Congress as a revenue protection measure for the Postal Service vis-a-vis private competitors.  Pursuant to a PES provision allowing it to suspend PES restrictions as to any mail route where the public interest so requires, the Postal Service issued a regulation authorizing a practice called ""international remailing,"" which entails bypassing the Service and using private couriers to deposit with foreign postal services letters destined for foreign addresses.  Respondent Unions, representing Postal Service employees, sued in the District Court, challenging the regulation pursuant to the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and claiming that the rulemaking record was inadequate to support a finding that the regulation's suspension of the PES was in the public interest.  The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Postal Service and petitioner Air Courier Conference of America (ACCA), holding that the Unions satisfied the zone-of-interests requirement for APA review under Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U. S. 388, and, on the merits, that the PES suspension was not justified by the public interest.
Held:
1. This Court declines to decide whether 39 U.S.C.  410(a) exempts the Postal Service from judicial review under the APA, since the question was not argued to, nor considered by, either of the lower courts, was not raised by ACCA in its certiorari petition, was raised by the Postal Service for the first time in its brief in opposition to the petition, and is not encompassed by the questions presented upon which certiorari was granted.  Pp.  498 U. S. 522-523.
2. The Unions do not have standing to challenge the Postal Service's suspension of the PES to permit private couriers to engage in international remailing.  To establish APA standing under Clarke and similar cases, the Unions must show, among other things, that the claimed adverse effect on postal workers' employment opportunities resulting from the suspension is within the zone of interests encompassed by the PES. 
Page 498 U. S. 518
 This they cannot do, since the language, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  1696(c) and 39 U.S.C.  601(a), and legislative history of the PES demonstrate that, in enacting those statutes, Congress was concerned not with protecting postal employment or furthering postal job opportunities, but with the receipt of necessary revenues for the Postal Service.  The PES enable the Service to fulfill its responsibilities to provide service to all communities at a uniform rate by preventing private couriers from competing selectively on the Service's most profitable routes.  The postal monopoly, therefore, exists to protect the citizenry at large, not postal workers.  Nor can the courts, in applying the zone-of-interests test, look beyond the PES to the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act (PRA), which, in addition to reenacting the PES without substantive changes, contains various labor-management provisions designed to improve pay, working conditions, and labor-management relations for postal employees.  None of the PES provisions have any integral relationship with the PRA labor-management provisions, and the PRA's legislative history contains no indication that such a connection exists.  It stretches the zone-of-interests test too far to say that, simply because the PES may be the linchpin of the Postal Service, those whom a different part of the PRA was designed to benefit may challenge a violation of the PES.

No. 89-1500
Argued Nov. 26, 1990

498 U.S. 533

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides, in relevant part, that ""[t]he signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper"" and ""to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well-grounded in fact,"" and that a court shall impose an appropriate sanction ""upon the person who signed"" a pleading, motion, or other paper in violation of the Rule.  (Emphasis added).  After finding that there was no basis in fact for the copyright infringement action and request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) filed by petitioner, through its counsel, against respondents, the District Court imposed Rule 11 monetary sanctions against petitioner on the ground that it had failed to make a reasonable inquiry before its president signed the initial TRO application and its research director signed a supplemental affidavit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Rule 11 applies to represented parties.  The Rule's relevant portion unambiguously states that a party who signs a pleading or other paper without first conducting a reasonable inquiry shall be sanctioned, and there is nothing in the Rule's full text that detracts from this plain meaning.  The reading urged by petitioner -- that since the Rule does not require a represented party to sign most pleadings, a party who chooses to sign need not comply with the certification procedure -- is inconsistent with the Rule's language and purpose.  That a represented party may not be required to sign a pleading does not prohibit that party from attesting to the merit of a document filed on its behalf, and the signature of ""an attorney or party"" conveys the same message of certification.  Thus, whether it is required or voluntary, a represented party's signature is capable of violating the Rule.  A represented party's signature would fall outside the Rule's scope only if the phrase ""attorney or party"" were given the unnatural reading ""attorney or unrepresented party.""  Had the Advisory Committee responsible for the Rule intended to limit the certification requirement's application to pro se parties, it would have expressly distinguished between represented and unrepresented parties, which it did elsewhere in the Rule, rather than lumping 
Page 498 U. S. 534
 the two types together.  Including all parties is also an eminently sensible reading of the Rule, since the Rule's essence is that signing denotes merit.  Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, 493 U. S. 120, which held that the Rule contemplates sanctions against an attorney signer rather than the law firm of which he or she is a member, is entirely consistent with the result here that a represented party who signs his or her name bears a personal, nondelegable responsibility to certify the document's truth and reasonableness.  The issue whether the signatures of petitioner's agents can be treated as its signature need not be resolved here, since it was not raised below.  Pp.  498 U. S. 540-548.
2. The certification standard for a party is an objective one of reasonableness under the circumstances.  The Rule speaks of attorneys and parties in a single breath, and unambiguously states that the signer must conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" or face sanctions.  In amending the Rule in 1983, the Advisory Committee specifically deleted the existing subjective standard and replaced it with an objective one at the same time that it amended the Rule to cover parties.  There is no public policy reason not to hold represented parties to a reasonable inquiry standard.  The client is often better positioned to investigate the facts supporting a pleading or paper, and the fact that a represented party is less able to investigate the legal basis for a paper or pleading means only that what is objectively reasonable for a client may differ from what is objectively reasonable for an attorney.

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 provides, in relevant part, that ""[t]he signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper"" and ""to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well-grounded in fact,"" and that a court shall impose an appropriate sanction ""upon the person who signed"" a pleading, motion, or other paper in violation of the Rule.  (Emphasis added).  After finding that there was no basis in fact for the copyright infringement action and request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) filed by petitioner, through its counsel, against respondents, the District Court imposed Rule 11 monetary sanctions against petitioner on the ground that it had failed to make a reasonable inquiry before its president signed the initial TRO application and its research director signed a supplemental affidavit.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. Rule 11 applies to represented parties.  The Rule's relevant portion unambiguously states that a party who signs a pleading or other paper without first conducting a reasonable inquiry shall be sanctioned, and there is nothing in the Rule's full text that detracts from this plain meaning.  The reading urged by petitioner -- that since the Rule does not require a represented party to sign most pleadings, a party who chooses to sign need not comply with the certification procedure -- is inconsistent with the Rule's language and purpose.  That a represented party may not be required to sign a pleading does not prohibit that party from attesting to the merit of a document filed on its behalf, and the signature of ""an attorney or party"" conveys the same message of certification.  Thus, whether it is required or voluntary, a represented party's signature is capable of violating the Rule.  A represented party's signature would fall outside the Rule's scope only if the phrase ""attorney or party"" were given the unnatural reading ""attorney or unrepresented party.""  Had the Advisory Committee responsible for the Rule intended to limit the certification requirement's application to pro se parties, it would have expressly distinguished between represented and unrepresented parties, which it did elsewhere in the Rule, rather than lumping 
Page 498 U. S. 534
 the two types together.  Including all parties is also an eminently sensible reading of the Rule, since the Rule's essence is that signing denotes merit.  Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, 493 U. S. 120, which held that the Rule contemplates sanctions against an attorney signer rather than the law firm of which he or she is a member, is entirely consistent with the result here that a represented party who signs his or her name bears a personal, nondelegable responsibility to certify the document's truth and reasonableness.  The issue whether the signatures of petitioner's agents can be treated as its signature need not be resolved here, since it was not raised below.  Pp.  498 U. S. 540-548.
2. The certification standard for a party is an objective one of reasonableness under the circumstances.  The Rule speaks of attorneys and parties in a single breath, and unambiguously states that the signer must conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" or face sanctions.  In amending the Rule in 1983, the Advisory Committee specifically deleted the existing subjective standard and replaced it with an objective one at the same time that it amended the Rule to cover parties.  There is no public policy reason not to hold represented parties to a reasonable inquiry standard.  The client is often better positioned to investigate the facts supporting a pleading or paper, and the fact that a represented party is less able to investigate the legal basis for a paper or pleading means only that what is objectively reasonable for a client may differ from what is objectively reasonable for an attorney.  Pp.  498 U. S. 548-551.
3. The imposition of sanctions against a represented party that did not act in bad faith does not violate the Rules Enabling Act.  Rule 11 is not a fee-shifting statute.  The sanctions are not designed to reallocate the burdens of litigation, since they are tied not to the litigation's outcome, but to the issue whether a specific filing was well-founded; they shift only the cost of a discrete event, rather than the litigation's entire cost, and the Rule calls only for an appropriate sanction, but does not mandate attorney's fees.  Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240,  421 U. S. 247,  421 U. S. 258-259, distinguished.  Also without merit is petitioner's argument that the Rule creates a federal common law of malicious prosecution.  The Rule's objective is not to reward parties who are victimized by litigation; it is to deter baseless filings and curb abuses.  While the Rule may confer a benefit on other litigants, the Rules Enabling Act is not violated by incidental effects on substantive rights where the Rule is reasonably necessary to maintain the integrity of the federal practice and procedure system.

Petitioner motor carrier filed suit in a Nebraska trial court, claiming, inter alia, that certain ""retaliatory"" taxes and fees the State imposed on motor carriers and vehicles such as his, which are registered in other States but operate in Nebraska, constituted an unlawful burden on interstate commerce and that respondents were liable under 42 U.S.C.  1983.  Among other things, the court concluded that the taxes and fees violated the Commerce Clause and permanently enjoined respondents from assessing, levying, or collecting them; but it dismissed petitioner's  1983 claim.  The State Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that there is no cause of action under  1983 for Commerce Clause violations because the Clause allocates power between the State and Federal Governments, and does not establish individual rights against the government.
Held:  Suits for violations of the Commerce Clause may be brought under  1983.  Pp.  495 U. S. 443-451.
(a) A broad construction of  1983 is compelled by the statutory language, which speaks of deprivations of ""any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.""  It is also supported by  1983's legislative history and by this Court's decisions, which have rejected attempts to limit the types of constitutional rights that are encompassed within the phrase ""rights, privileges, or immunities,"" see, e.g., Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U. S. 538.  Pp.  495 U. S. 443-446.
(b) The Commerce Clause confers ""rights, privileges, or immunities"" within the meaning of  1983.  In addition to conferring power on the Federal Government, the Clause is a substantive restriction on permissible state regulation of interstate commerce.  And individuals injured by state action violating this aspect of the Clause may sue and obtain injunctive and declaratory relief.  The three considerations for determining whether a federal statute confers a ""right"" within the meaning of  1983 -- that the provision creates obligations binding on the governmental unit, that the plaintiff's interest is not too vague and amorphous to be beyond the judiciary's competence to enforce, and that the provision was intended to benefit the plaintiff -- also weigh in favor of recognition of a right under the Clause.  Respondents' argument that the Clause was not designed to benefit the individual has been implicitly rejected, 
Page 498 U. S. 440
 Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318,  429 U. S. 321, n. 3, and this Court's repeated references to ""rights"" under the Clause constitute a recognition that it was intended to benefit those who are engaged in interstate commerce, see, e.g., Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U. S. 47,  141 U. S. 57.  Respondents' attempt to analogize the Commerce Clause to the Supremacy Clause, which does not confer ""rights, privileges, or immunities"" under  1983, is also rejected.  Unlike the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause is not a source of federal rights, but merely secures federal rights by according them priority when they come into conflict with state law.  The fact that the protection from interference with trade conferred by the Commerce Clause may be qualified or eliminated by Congress does not mean that it cannot be a ""right,"" for, until Congress does so, such protection operates as a guarantee of freedom for private conduct that the State may not abridge.

Respondent, an unsuccessful candidate in prior elections of petitioner Union, advised the Union that he would be a candidate in the upcoming 1988 election and requested that he be provided with mailing labels so that he could arrange for a timely mailing of election literature to members prior to the Union's nominating convention.  The request was denied because a Union rule prohibited such preconvention mailings.  Respondent filed suit under  401(c) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), which places every union
""under a duty, enforceable at the suit of any bona fide candidate . . . , to comply with all reasonable requests of any candidate to distribute by mail or otherwise at the candidate's expense campaign literature. . . .""
The District Court entered a preliminary injunction in respondent's favor, ruling, inter alia, that  401(c)'s clear language required it to focus on the reasonableness of respondent's request rather than on the reasonableness of the Union rule under which the request was denied, that the request was clearly reasonable, and alternatively, that the Union rule was invalid.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  Section 401(c) does not require a court to evaluate the reasonableness of a union rule before it decides whether a candidate's request was reasonable.  Pp.  498 U. S. 473-478.
(a) It is undisputed, first, that the case is not moot, even though respondent's campaign literature has been distributed and he lost the 1988 election, because he has run for office before, and may well do so again, and the likelihood that the Union rule would again present an obstacle to his preconvention mailing makes this controversy sufficiently capable of repetition to preserve this Court's jurisdiction; second, that respondent was a ""bona fide candidate"" within  401(c)'s meaning when he made his preconvention request; and, third, that there is no basis for contending that the request was not ""reasonable"" under  401(c) apart from the fact that it violated the Union rule.  Pp.  498 U. S. 473-475.
(b) The text, structure, and purpose of Title IV of the LMRDA all demonstrate that  401(c) simply prescribes a straightforward test:  Is the candidate's distribution request reasonable?  The section's language plainly requires unions to comply with ""all reasonable requests"" (emphasis 
Page 498 U. S. 467
 added), and just as plainly does not require union members to comply with ""all reasonable rules"" when making such requests.  Moreover, Congress gave the candidate's  401(c) right a special status not conferred upon other Title IV rights granted union members, which are expressly made subject to ""reasonable"" conditions imposed by unions, and are judicially enforceable only in actions brought by the Secretary of Labor.  A broad interpretation of the candidate's right also is consistent with the statute's basic purpose of insuring free and democratic union elections by offsetting the inherent advantage incumbent union leadership has over potential rank and file challengers.  Furthermore, the Union's arguments supporting its position that a request is per se unreasonable simply because it conflicts with a Union rule are unpersuasive.  The Union does not advance any other reason for suggesting that respondent's request was unreasonable; thus, the request must be granted.  Pp.  498 U. S. 475-478.

The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (Reform Act) amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) creating, inter alia, a ""Special Agricultural Workers"" (SAW) amnesty program for specified alien farmworkers.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) determined SAW status eligibility based on evidence presented at a personal interview with each applicant.  Section 210(e)(1) of the INA barred judicial review ""of a determination respecting an application"" except in the context of judicial review of a deportation order, a review conducted by the courts of appeals.  Respondents, the Haitian Refugee Center and unsuccessful individual SAW applicants, filed a class action in the District Court, alleging that the initial application review process was conducted in an arbitrary manner in violation of the Reform Act and the applicants' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.  While recognizing that individual aliens could not obtain judicial review of denials of their SAW status applications except in deportation proceedings in the courts of appeals, the District Court accepted jurisdiction because the complaint did not challenge any individual determination of any application for SAW status, but rather contained allegations about the manner in which the entire program was being implemented.  The court found that a number of INS practices violated the Reform Act and were unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:  The District Court had federal question jurisdiction to hear respondents' constitutional and statutory challenges to the INS procedures.  Pp.  498 U. S. 491-499.
(a) There is no clear congressional language mandating preclusion of jurisdiction.  Section 210(e)(1)'s language prohibiting judicial review ""of a determination respecting an application"" refers to the process of direct review of individual denials of SAW status, not to general collateral challenges to unconstitutional practices and policies used by the INS in processing applications.  The reference to ""a determination"" describes a single act, as does the language of  210(e)(3), which provides for ""judicial review of such a denial.""  Section 210(e)(3)(B), which specifies that judicial review is to be based on the administrative record, and that factual 
Page 498 U. S. 480
 determinations contained in such a record shall be conclusive absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, supports this reading.  A record emerging from the administrative appeals process does not address the kind of procedural and constitutional claims respondents have brought, and the abuse-of-discretion standard does not apply to constitutional or statutory determinations, which are subject to de novo review.  Limiting judicial review of general constitutional and statutory challenges to the provisions set forth in  210(e) therefore is not contemplated.  Moreover, had Congress intended the limited review provisions of  210(e) to encompass challenges to INS procedures and practices, it could easily have used broader statutory language.  Pp.  498 U. S. 481-494.
(b) As a practical matter, the individual respondents would be unable to obtain meaningful judicial review of their application denials or of their objections to INS procedures if they were required to avail themselves of the INA's limited judicial review procedures.  Under the statutory scheme, review of an individual determination would be limited to the administrative record, which respondents have alleged is inadequate; aliens would have to surrender themselves for deportation in order to receive any judicial review, which is tantamount to a complete denial of such review; and a court of appeals reviewing an individual determination would most likely not have an adequate record as to a pattern of allegedly unconstitutional practices, and would lack a district court's factfinding and record-developing capabilities.  Given this Court's well settled presumption favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial review of administrative action, the Court cannot conclude that Congress so intended to foreclose all forms of meaningful judicial review of SAW application denials and general collateral challenges to INS procedures.  This case is therefore controlled by Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, which interpreted the Medicare statute to permit individuals to challenge a payment regulation's validity even though the statute barred judicial review of individual claims for payment under the regulation.

Given this Court's well settled presumption favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial review of administrative action, the Court cannot conclude that Congress so intended to foreclose all forms of meaningful judicial review of SAW application denials and general collateral challenges to INS procedures.  This case is therefore controlled by Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, which interpreted the Medicare statute to permit individuals to challenge a payment regulation's validity even though the statute barred judicial review of individual claims for payment under the regulation.

498 U.S. 337

Syllabus 
Respondent Wilander, a paint foreman injured at work while assigned to a ""paint boat"" chartered by petitioner McDermott International, sued McDermott under the Jones Act.  The Act provides a cause of action in negligence for ""any seaman"" injured ""in the course of his employment,"" but does not define ""seaman.""  McDermott moved for summary judgment, alleging that, as a matter of law, Wilander was not a ""seaman.""  The District Court denied the motion, and the jury entered an award for Wilander, finding, inter alia, that the performance of his duties contributed to his vessel's function or to the accomplishment of its mission, and therefore satisfied the Fifth Circuit's test for seaman status.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, refusing to abandon its test in favor of the Seventh Circuit's more stringent standard, which, in effect, requires that a ""seaman"" aid in the navigation of the vessel.
Held:  One need not aid in the navigation of a vessel in order to qualify as a ""seaman"" under the Jones Act.  Pp.  498 U. S. 341-357.
(a) In the absence of contrary indication, it may be assumed that the Jones Act's failure to define ""seaman"" indicates a congressional intent that the word have its established meaning under general maritime law at the time of the Act's passage.  Pp.  498 U. S. 341-342.
(b) At the time of its passage in 1920, the Jones Act established no requirement that a seaman aid in navigation.  Although certain early cases had imposed such a requirement, a review of later cases demonstrates that, by 1920, general maritime law had abandoned that requirement in favor of a rule requiring only that a seaman be employed on board a vessel in furtherance of its purpose.  Pp.  498 U. S. 343-346.
(c) The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) -- which was enacted in 1927 and provides recovery for injury to a broad range of land-based maritime workers, but explicitly excludes from its coverage ""a master or member of a crew of any vessel"" -- does not change the rule that a seaman need not aid in navigation.  That Act and the Jones Act are mutually exclusive, such that a ""seaman"" under the Jones Act is the same as a ""master or member of a crew of any vessel.""  Swanson v. Marra Brothers, Inc., 328 U. S. 1,  328 U. S. 7.  Although the LHWCA exception thus refines the Jones Act term ""seaman,"" restricting 
Page 498 U. S. 338
 it to sea-based maritime employees, it does not indicate that members of a crew are required to navigate.  Pp.  498 U. S. 346-348.
(d) The conflict addressed here has as its source this Court's inconsistent use of an aid in navigation requirement in LHWCA and Jones Act cases.  That requirement slipped into the Court's case law in South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251,  309 U. S. 260, an LHWCA case decided before the Court recognized in Swanson, supra, that the two Acts are mutually exclusive.  Although the Court subsequently ruled in another pre-Swanson LHWCA case, Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U. S. 565, that the Bassett aid in navigation test was not to be read restrictively, and that navigation under the test embraces duties of a ""member of a crew"" that are essential to the operation and welfare of his vessel, a series of post-Swanson Jones Act cases either asserted an aid in navigation requirement or relied on Bassett even though they afforded seaman status to claimants working on board vessels whose jobs had no connection to navigation, see, e.g., Butler v. Whiteman, 356 U. S. 271.  Such cases have engendered confusion and have led the lower courts to a myriad of standards and lack of uniformity in administering the elements of seaman status.  Pp.  498 U. S. 348-353.
(e) The time has come to jettison the aid in navigation language.  The better rule -- the rule that best explains the Court's case law and is consistent with the pre-Jones Act interpretation of ""seaman"" and Congress' land-based/sea-based distinction in the two Acts -- is to define ""master or member of a crew"" under the LHWCA, and therefore ""seaman"" under the Jones Act, not in terms of the employee's particular job, but solely in terms of the employee's connection to a vessel in navigation.  A necessary element of the connection is that a seaman perform the work of a vessel, i.e., that the employee's duties contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.  Pp.  498 U. S. 353-355.
(f) The question of who is a ""seaman"" under the Jones Act is better characterized as a mixed question of law and fact than as a pure question of fact for the jury.  It is for the court to define the proper legal standard and for the jury to find the facts and apply that standard.  The narrow question presented here -- whether Wilander should be precluded from seaman status because he did not perform transportation-related functions on board the vessel -- is a question of law that must be answered in the negative.

|498 u.s. 358|"Trinova Corporation v. Michigan Department of Treasury
No. 89-1106
Argued Oct. 1, 1990
Decided Feb. 19, 1991
498 U.S. 358

Syllabus 
Michigan's single business tax (SBT) is a value added tax (VAT) levied against entities having ""business activity"" within the State.  As part of the SBT computation, a taxpayer doing business both within and without the State must determine its apportioned tax base by multiplying its total value added -- which consists of its profit, as represented by its federal taxable income, plus compensation paid to labor, depreciation on capital, and other factors -- by the portion of its business activity attributable to Michigan -- which consists of the average of three ratios:  (1) Michigan payroll to total payroll, (2) Michigan property to total property, and (3) Michigan sales to total sales.  During 1980, the tax year in question, petitioner Trinova, an Ohio corporation, maintained a 14-person sales office in Michigan.  Under the SBT formula, its 1980 payroll and property apportionment factors were only .2328% and .0930% respectively, while its sales factor was 26.5892%, representing Michigan sales of over $100 million.  Although its 1980 federal taxable income showed a loss of almost $42.5 million, Trinova's SBT computation resulted in a tax of over $293,000.  Trinova paid the tax, but subsequently filed an amended return and refund claim, alleging that it was entitled to relief under Michigan law because the SBT's apportionment provisions did not fairly represent the extent of its business activity within the State.  The amended return proposed that Trinova's company-wide compensation and depreciation be excluded from its pre-apportionment value added, and that its actual Michigan compensation and depreciation be added back into its apportioned tax base, which would result in a negative value added apportioned to Michigan and entitle the company to a refund for its entire 1980 SBT payment.  When respondent Department of Treasury denied relief, Trinova sued for a refund in the State Court of Claims, which ruled in its favor.  However, the State Court of Appeals held that Trinova was not entitled to statutory relief, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the SBT's three- factor apportionment formula did not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. 
Page 498 U. S. 359

Held:  As applied to Trinova during the tax year at issue, the SBT's three-factor apportionment formula does not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  498 U. S. 372-387.
(a) Under the test stated in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,  430 U. S. 279, a state tax levied upon multistate businesses is valid under the Commerce Clause if, as relevant here, it is fairly apportioned and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Moreover, the Complete Auto test encompasses the Due Process Clause requirement that, inter alia, a rational relationship exist between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.  See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425,  445 U. S. 436-437.  Pp.  498 U. S. 372-373.
(b) Because the SBT attempts to tax a base that cannot be assigned to one geographic location with any precision, the decision to apportion the tax is not unconstitutional.  Although Trinova's compensation and depreciation may appear in isolation to be susceptible of geographic designation, those elements cannot be separated from income, which cannot be located in a single State.  The SBT is not a combination or series of several smaller taxes on compensation, depreciation, and income, but is an indivisible tax upon a different, bona fide measure of business activity, the value added.  This conclusion is no different than the one this Court has reached in upholding the validity of state apportionment of income taxes.  The same factors that prevent determination of the geographic location where income is generated -- such as functional integration of the intrastate and extrastate activities of a unitary business enterprise, centralization of management, and economies of scale -- make it impossible to determine the location of value added with exact precision.  See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at  445 U. S. 438; Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, New Jersey Dept. of Treasury, 490 U. S. 66,  490 U. S. 74.  Thus, although Trinova had no federal income during 1980, it cannot be relieved of tax upon its Michigan business.  Such relief would be incompatible with the rationale of a VAT, under which tax becomes due even if the taxpayer was unprofitable, and is unsupported by the record.  Trinova's approach would require the conclusion that it added value only at the factory through the consumption of capital and labor, while the record would as easily support a finding that its production operations added little value, and its sales offices added significant value.  Although Trinova's 14 Michigan sales personnel need not be relied on as the sole, or even a substantial, source of all the value added that can be apportioned fairly to Michigan, it cannot be doubted that, without the company's $100 million in Michigan sales, its total value added would have been 
Page 498 U. S. 360
 lower to a remarkable degree.  It distorts the SBT both in application and theory to confine value added consequences of the Michigan market solely to the labor and capital expended by the resident sales force.  Pp.  498 U. S. 373-379.
(c) The SBT's three-factor apportionment formula cannot be ruled unfair, since Trinova has failed to meet its burden of proving, by clear and cogent evidence, that there is no rational relationship between its tax base measure attributed to Michigan and the contribution of its Michigan business activity to the entire value added process.  Cf., e.g., Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159,  463 U. S. 169, 180-181; Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267,  437 U. S. 274.  This Court has approved the same formula for apportionment of income, see, e.g., Butler Bros v. McColgan, 315 U. S. 501, and the formula has gained wide acceptance in that context ""because payroll, property, and sales appear in combination to reflect a very large share of the activities by which value is generated,"" Container Corp., supra, 463 U.S. at  463 U. S. 183 (emphasis added).  Trinova's argument -- that the formula leads to a distorted result, out of all proportion to the company's Michigan business, because sales have no relationship to, and add nothing to, the value that compensation and depreciable plant contribute to the Michigan tax base -- is rejected, since sales (as a measure of market demand) do have a profound impact upon the amount of an enterprise's value added, and since there is no basis for distinguishing similar arguments that were pressed, and rejected by this Court, with regard to the apportionment of income.  Because the three-factor formula causes no distortion, the SBT does not tax value earned outside Michigan.  The argument that the value was added in Ohio, by labor and capital, and that no value has been added in Michigan, wrongly assumes that value added is subject to geographic ascertainment and that a sales factor is inappropriate in apportionment.  Trinova gives no estimate of the value added that would take account of both its Michigan sales activity and Michigan market demand for its products, whereas the State has consistently applied the three-factor formula and has enacted further provisions giving relief to labor-intensive taxpayers like Trinova.  Pp.  498 U. S. 379-384.
(d) The SBT does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Trinova cannot point to any treatment of in-state and out-of-state firms that is discriminatory on its face.  Although American Trucking Assns. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266,  483 U. S. 281, states that the Commerce Clause has a ""deeper meaning"" that may be implicated even absent facial discrimination, that meaning is embodied in the requirement of fair apportionment, and does not encompass Trinova's vague accusation of discrimination.  Nor is that accusation supported by a statement of Michigan's Governor that the SBT was enacted to promote business 
Page 498 U. S. 361
 development and investment within the State.  Such promotion is a laudatory goal in the absence of evidence of an impermissible motive to export tax burdens or import tax revenues.  Pp.  498 U. S. 384-386.

Michigan's single business tax (SBT) is a value added tax (VAT) levied against entities having ""business activity"" within the State.  As part of the SBT computation, a taxpayer doing business both within and without the State must determine its apportioned tax base by multiplying its total value added -- which consists of its profit, as represented by its federal taxable income, plus compensation paid to labor, depreciation on capital, and other factors -- by the portion of its business activity attributable to Michigan -- which consists of the average of three ratios:  (1) Michigan payroll to total payroll, (2) Michigan property to total property, and (3) Michigan sales to total sales.  During 1980, the tax year in question, petitioner Trinova, an Ohio corporation, maintained a 14-person sales office in Michigan.  Under the SBT formula, its 1980 payroll and property apportionment factors were only .2328% and .0930% respectively, while its sales factor was 26.5892%, representing Michigan sales of over $100 million.  Although its 1980 federal taxable income showed a loss of almost $42.5 million, Trinova's SBT computation resulted in a tax of over $293,000.  Trinova paid the tax, but subsequently filed an amended return and refund claim, alleging that it was entitled to relief under Michigan law because the SBT's apportionment provisions did not fairly represent the extent of its business activity within the State.  The amended return proposed that Trinova's company-wide compensation and depreciation be excluded from its pre-apportionment value added, and that its actual Michigan compensation and depreciation be added back into its apportioned tax base, which would result in a negative value added apportioned to Michigan and entitle the company to a refund for its entire 1980 SBT payment.  When respondent Department of Treasury denied relief, Trinova sued for a refund in the State Court of Claims, which ruled in its favor.  However, the State Court of Appeals held that Trinova was not entitled to statutory relief, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the SBT's three- factor apportionment formula did not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.

Held:  As applied to Trinova during the tax year at issue, the SBT's three-factor apportionment formula does not violate either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause.  Pp.  498 U. S. 372-387.
(a) Under the test stated in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,  430 U. S. 279, a state tax levied upon multistate businesses is valid under the Commerce Clause if, as relevant here, it is fairly apportioned and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Moreover, the Complete Auto test encompasses the Due Process Clause requirement that, inter alia, a rational relationship exist between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.  See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425,  445 U. S. 436-437.  Pp.  498 U. S. 372-373.
(b) Because the SBT attempts to tax a base that cannot be assigned to one geographic location with any precision, the decision to apportion the tax is not unconstitutional.  Although Trinova's compensation and depreciation may appear in isolation to be susceptible of geographic designation, those elements cannot be separated from income, which cannot be located in a single State.

Cf., e.g., Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159,  463 U. S. 169, 180-181; Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267,  437 U. S. 274.  This Court has approved the same formula for apportionment of income, see, e.g., Butler Bros v. McColgan, 315 U. S. 501, and the formula has gained wide acceptance in that context ""because payroll, property, and sales appear in combination to reflect a very large share of the activities by which value is generated,"" Container Corp., supra, 463 U.S. at  463 U. S. 183 (emphasis added).  Trinova's argument -- that the formula leads to a distorted result, out of all proportion to the company's Michigan business, because sales have no relationship to, and add nothing to, the value that compensation and depreciable plant contribute to the Michigan tax base -- is rejected, since sales (as a measure of market demand) do have a profound impact upon the amount of an enterprise's value added, and since there is no basis for distinguishing similar arguments that were pressed, and rejected by this Court, with regard to the apportionment of income.  Because the three-factor formula causes no distortion, the SBT does not tax value earned outside Michigan.  The argument that the value was added in Ohio, by labor and capital, and that no value has been added in Michigan, wrongly assumes that value added is subject to geographic ascertainment and that a sales factor is inappropriate in apportionment.  Trinova gives no estimate of the value added that would take account of both its Michigan sales activity and Michigan market demand for its products, whereas the State has consistently applied the three-factor formula and has enacted further provisions giving relief to labor-intensive taxpayers like Trinova.  Pp.  498 U. S. 379-384.
(d) The SBT does not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Trinova cannot point to any treatment of in-state and out-of-state firms that is discriminatory on its face.  Although American Trucking Assns. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266,  483 U. S. 281, states that the Commerce Clause has a ""deeper meaning"" that may be implicated even absent facial discrimination, that meaning is embodied in the requirement of fair apportionment, and does not encompass Trinova's vague accusation of discrimination.  Nor is that accusation supported by a statement of Michigan's Governor that the SBT was enacted to promote business 
Page 498 U. S. 361

498 U.S. 395

Syllabus 
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Reform Act) eliminated special parole, supervised by the United States Parole Commission, for drug offenders after incarceration and established conditions for a new system of supervised release to be overseen by the sentencing court.  However, the supervised release provisions' effective date was delayed until November 1, 1987.  In October, 1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA) was enacted, which, in  1002, sets minimum and maximum sentences and mandates terms of supervised release for certain drug offenses.  Some ADAA sections, but not  1002, specified a November 1, 1987, effective date. Petitioner was convicted of, inter alia, offenses to which  1002 applies that occurred after the ADAA's enactment but before the effective date of the Reform Act's supervised release provisions.  The District Court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms and imposed concurrent 5-year terms of special parole for each offense, ruling that Congress intended that parole be imposed in cases where the offenses were committed in the interim between the ADAA's enactment and November 1, 1987, and rejecting petitioner's argument that no post-confinement supervision was appropriate for offenses committed during that time.  The Court of Appeals vacated the sentence, holding that  1002's plain language required that petitioner be sentenced to terms of supervised release, rather than special parole.
Held:  Supervised release applies for all drug offenses in the categories specified by ADAA  1002 that were committed after the ADAA was enacted but before November 1, 1987.  Pp.  498 U. S. 404-410.
(a) Section 1002 contains no provision for its effective date, and therefore took effect on its date of enactment.  There is no clear direction to the contrary by Congress, whose silence here contrasts with its expression of effective dates for other ADAA sections.  Nothing about Congress' apparent purpose in enacting  1002 -- to rectify an error in the Controlled Substances Act that would have required supervised release for small- but not big-time drug offenders -- rebuts this presumption.  In arguing that Congress must have intended to postpone all of  1002's penalty provisions in order to avoid creating a conflict with  1007(a) and 10O9(a) -- which, effective November 1, 1987, authorize shorter sentences for certain offenders who cooperate with the Government -- since 
Page 498 U. S. 396
  1002's mandatory minimum sentence requirements otherwise would eliminate the possibility of such shorter sentences for offenses committed during the interim period, petitioner is mistaken.  Congress corrected these problems in December, 1987, by permitting departures from mandatory minimum sentences for cooperating defendants whose offenses were committed before November 1, 1987, a move that can be explained only if Congress believed that the mandatory penalties had gone into effect as of the ADAA's date of enactment.  Also rejected is petitioner's argument that the delayed implementation of  1004, which provides that all references to ""special parole"" in the Controlled Substances Act were to be changed to ""supervised release,"" delayed the effect of  1002's supervised release provisions.  Since a specific provision controls over one of a more general application and  1002 made the change from special parole to supervised release independent of  1004,  1004's general change-over provision does not apply.  Moreover, it is unlikely that Congress intended to delay some, but not all, of  1002's provisions.  Pp.  498 U. S. 404-407.
(b) That the term ""supervised release"" was defined in the enacted, but not yet effective, Reform Act, rather than in the ADAA, does not mean that the term as used in the ADAA had no significance before November 1, 1987.  It is not uncommon to refer to other, related legislative enactments when interpreting specialized statutory terms, a device whose utility is not defeated by the fact that the Act referred to is not yet effective.  At the time the ADAA was enacted, the Reform Act had all of the weight and dignity of a deliberate, considered enactment of Congress, presented to and approved by the President, and it is reasonable to assume that Congress, when it passed the ADAA, knew that the full definition of supervised release existed in the Reform Act and legislated with reference to it. It is also possible that Congress, knowing that it was unlikely that anyone committing a drug offense during the interim period would be released from custody before November 1 1987, concluded that, in all such cases, the Reform Act would be effective at the time a district court began its duties under the supervised release program.  Section 1002's plain language also forecloses the possibility that the rules governing special parole should apply to crimes committed in .the interim period.  Pp.  498 U. S. 407-409.
(c) The absence of an effective date provision in  1002 does not create an ambiguity calling for the invocation of the rule of lenity.  While  1002 may have created some minor inconsistencies with other statutory provisions, its post-confinement supervision provisions are not ambiguous.  Pp.  498 U. S. 409-410.

No. 87-6796
Argued Nov. 6, 1990
Decided Feb. 19, 1991
498 U.S. 411

Syllabus 
Petitioner Ford, a black man charged with, inter alia, the murder of a white woman, filed a pretrial ""Motion to Restrict Racial Use of Peremptory Challenges,"" alleging that the county prosecutor had ""over a long period of time"" excluded black persons from juries where the issues to be tried involved members of the opposite race.  In opposing the motion, the prosecution referred to Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, in which this Court recognized that the purposeful exclusion of members of the defendant's race from his petit jury would work a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, but held that the defendant would have to prove a pattern of racial discrimination in prior cases as well as his own to prevail.  The trial judge denied the motion, declaring that in ""numerous or several"" cases he had seen the prosecutor strike prospective white jurors but leave prospective black jurors in trials of black defendants.  During jury selection, the prosecution exercised 9 of its 10 peremptory challenges to strike black prospective jurors, leaving 1 black venire member on the jury.  After the jury convicted Ford and he was sentenced to death, he moved for a new trial, claiming, among other things, that his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury was violated by the prosecutor's racially based exercise of peremptory challenges.  The motion was denied, and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction.  While Ford's first petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, the Court decided Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, which dropped the Swain requirement of proof of prior discrimination by holding it possible for a defendant to make out a prima facie equal protection violation entirely by reference to the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges in the defendant's own case.  This Court ultimately vacated Ford's conviction and remanded in light of Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, which decided that Batson's new evidentiary standard would apply retroactively in cases such as the present.  On remand, the State Supreme Court concluded that before his trial Ford had raised a Swain claim that was decided adversely to him on appeal, and could not be reviewed again.  The court then suggested that a Batson claim was never raised at trial, but held sua sponte that any equal protection claim that Ford might have was untimely under the rule the court had stated in State v. Sparks, 257 Ga. 97, 98, 355 S.E.2d 658, 659, which, as interpreted by the court, 
Page 498 U. S. 412
 requires that a contemporaneous objection to a jury be made under Batson in the period between the jurors' selection and the administration of their oaths.  Although Sparks was decided long after Ford's trial, the court regarded the Sparks rule as a ""valid state procedural bar"" to federal review of Ford's claim under Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72.
Held:  The Sparks rule is not an adequate and independent state procedural ground that would bar federal judicial review of Ford's Batson claim.  Pp.  498 U. S. 418-425.
(a) The State Supreme Court erred in concluding that Ford failed to present the trial court with a cognizable Batson equal protection claim.  Although Ford's pretrial motion did not mention the Equal Protection Clause, and his new trial motion cited the Sixth Amendment rather than the Fourteenth, the pretrial motion's reference to a pattern of excluding black venire members ""over a long period of time"" constitutes the assertion of an equal protection claim on the evidentiary theory articulated in Batson's antecedent, Swain.  That the Georgia courts, in fact, adopted this interpretation is demonstrated by the prosecutor's citation to Swain in opposing the pretrial motion, by the trial judge's clear implication of Swain in ruling that Ford had failed to prove the systematic exclusion of blacks from petit juries, and by the State Supreme Court's explicit statement on remand that Ford had raised a Swain claim.  Because Batson did not change the nature of the violation recognized in Swain, but merely the quantum of proof necessary to substantiate a particular claim, it follows that a defendant alleging a Swain equal protection violation necessarily states such a violation subject to Batson's more lenient burden of proof.  Pp.  498 U. S. 418-420.
(b) The State Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Sparks contemporaneous objection rule can bar federal consideration of Ford's Batson claim as untimely raised.  Although the Sparks rule is a sensible one, its imposition here is nevertheless subject to this Court's standards for assessing the adequacy of independent state procedural bars to the entertainment of federal constitutional claims.  These include the requirement, under James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341,  466 U. S. 348-351, that only a state practice that is ""firmly established and regularly followed"" at the time at which it is to be applied may be interposed to prevent subsequent review by this Court of such a claim.  To apply Sparks retroactively to bar consideration of a claim not raised between the jurors' selection and oaths would apply a rule that was unannounced at the time of Ford's trial and is therefore inadequate to serve as an independent state ground under James.  Indeed, Sparks would not, by its own terms, apply here,

In a diversity action filed in the Federal District Court, petitioners McMoRan Oil and Gas Company (McMoRan) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc., both Delaware corporations, alleged that respondent K N Energy, Inc., a Kansas corporation with its principal place of business in Colorado, had failed to pay the parties' contract price for natural gas.  After suit was filed, McMoRan transferred its interest in the contract to FMP Operating Company (FMPO), a limited partnership. whose partners included citizens of Kansas and Colorado.  The District Court permitted petitioners to add FMPO as a plaintiff and ruled in petitioners' favor.  The Court of Appeals reversed and directed that the suit be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, holding that, under Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, the addition of FMPO destroyed diversity jurisdiction.
Held:  Diversity jurisdiction, once established, is not defeated by the addition of a nondiverse party to the action.  Carden considered whether limited partners' citizenship must be taken into account in determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists in an action brought by a limited partnership, but suggested nothing to change the well-established rule that, if jurisdiction exists at the time an action is codmmenced, it may not be divested by subsequent events, see, e.g.,  22 U. S.  Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537.  The opinions of both the District Court and the Court of Appeals establish that the parties were diverse at the time the action arose and at the time the proceedings commenced.  This Court's decision in Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365 -- that a District Court's ancillary jurisdiction did not extend to the entertaining of a claim by an original plaintiff in a diversity action against a nondiverse third-party defendant impleaded by the original defendant -- also casts no doubt on the principle that diversity jurisdiction is to be assessed at the time a lawsuit is commenced.

No. 90-5393
Decided Feb. 19, 1991
498 U.S. 430

Syllabus 
Petitioner Lozada failed to file a direct appeal from his Nevada state court convictions.  After exhausting state postconviction remedies, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that he had been deprived of the opportunity to appeal his convictions by the ineffective assistance of his counsel, who, inter alia, never told him of his right to appeal.  The court dismissed the petition, holding that Lozada's allegations failed to show prejudice under the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, because Lozada had not demonstrated that an appeal might have succeeded.  Subsequently, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals denied Lozada a certificate of probable cause to appeal the dismissal of his petition.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in denying Lozada a certificate of probable cause because, under the standards set forth in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880,  463 U. S. 893, for issuance of a certificate, he made a substantial showing that he was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel.  The issue of prejudice could be resolved in a different manner than the one followed by the District Court.  At least two Courts of Appeals have presumed prejudice by the denial of the right to appeal, yet the Court of Appeals in the instant case neither cited nor analyzed this line of authority.

No. 90-5393
Decided Feb. 19, 1991
498 U.S. 430

Syllabus 
Petitioner Lozada failed to file a direct appeal from his Nevada state court convictions.  After exhausting state postconviction remedies, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that he had been deprived of the opportunity to appeal his convictions by the ineffective assistance of his counsel, who, inter alia, never told him of his right to appeal.  The court dismissed the petition, holding that Lozada's allegations failed to show prejudice under the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, because Lozada had not demonstrated that an appeal might have succeeded.  Subsequently, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals denied Lozada a certificate of probable cause to appeal the dismissal of his petition.
Held:  The Court of Appeals erred in denying Lozada a certificate of probable cause because, under the standards set forth in Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880,  463 U.

No. 90-5796
Decided Feb. 19, 1991
498 U.S. 433

Syllabus 
At the time that they were charged with several murders, petitioner Burden and his nephew, Henry Dixon, were both represented by attorney Kondritzer.  A different attorney represented Burden at his trial.  However, Dixon was never indicted, and he provided the sole evidence linking Burden to the murders.  Both Dixon and the prosecutor acknowledged that Dixon testified under a grant of immunity, a fact credited by the trial court in its mandatory post-trial report.  Burden was convicted and exhausted his state remedies.  Subsequently, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel because his counsel counsel labored under a conflict of interest.  The court denied relief on the ground that he had not shown an adverse impact on the representation of his  counsel, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  That court rejected Burden's argument that his interest was adversely affected by Kondritzer's negotiation of an immunity agreement for Dixon, finding that there was no evidence that Dixon testified under such an agreement.
Held:  In rejecting Burden's conflict of interest claim, the Court of Appeals improperly failed to give a presumption of correctness to a state court factual finding as required by 28 U.S.C.  2254(d).  A habeas court may not disregard the presumption unless it expressly finds that one of the enumerated exceptions to  2254(d).  A habeas court may not disregard the presumption unless it expressly finds that one of the enumerated exceptions to  2254(d) is met, and it explains the reasoning in support of its conclusion.  See Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539,  498 U. S. 549,  498 U. S. 551.  However, the Court of Appeals neither mentioned the trial court's finding that Dixon received immunity nor explained why the finding was not entitled to a presumption of correctness.  Respondent's contention that Burden waived reliance on  2254(d) in the Court of Appeals by failing to sufficiently emphasize the trial court's finding mischaracterizes the record, since the immunity agreement was the central fact supporting his conflict of interest claim.

 Reginald JELLS, petitioner v. OHIO. No. 90-6713. 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 February 19, 1991 
 On petition for writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
 Feb. 19, 1991. The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. 

 Justice MARSHALL, dissenting. 
 The question in this case is whether petitioner's waiver of his right to a jury trial was knowing and voluntary when there is no evidence that petitioner was aware that his waiver also applied to his right to be sentenced by a jury that could not impose death by less than a unanimous vote and without the trial judge's independent agreement that death was the proper sentence. Because I believe that petitioner could not be understood to have made a ""knowing"" decision without such critical information, I would grant the petition for certiorari. 
 I [1111-Continued.] 
 The jury plays a vital role in Ohio's capital sentencing scheme. Under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, a felony defendant who does not waive the right to a jury trial is tried before a twelve-person jury. See Ohio Rule Crim.Proc. 23(b) (1987). When the defendant is accused of a crime punishable by death, the same jury presides at both the guilt phase and the penalty phase. See State v. Mapes, 19 Ohio St.3d 108, 116, 484 N. E.2d 140, 147 (1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1178, 106 S.Ct. 2905d 991 (1986); see also Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2929.03(C)(2)(b) (1987). Unless the jury unanimously finds beyond reasonable doubt that death is the proper sentence, the defendant must be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after either twenty or thirty years imprisonment. See Ohio Rev.Code Ann. 2929.03(D)(2) (1987); see also State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 200, 473 N.E.2d 264, 297 (1984), cert. denied 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S.Ct. 3514, 87 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985). Significantly, even if the jury unanimously recommends the death penalty, the trial court also must independently find beyond reasonable doubt that death is the correct sentence before the defendant may be sentenced to death. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2929.03(D)(2)-(3) (1987); see also State v. Jenkins, supra, 15 Ohio St.3d, at 200-201, 473 N.E.2d, at 297.

 Petitioner signed the statement, as did his two witnessing attorneys. Ibid. The trial court also conducted a hearing to determine whether petitioner signed the form voluntarily: 
 Petitioner maintains that his waiver was not constitutionally sufficient because at no point did the trial judge advise him that by waiving his jury trial right he also waived jury sentencing. The Ohio Supreme Court did not address the sufficiency of petitioner's waiver under federal constitutional standards even though it acknowledged that petitioner had claimed his waiver was ""constitutionally insufficient."" See id., at 24, 559 N.E.2d, at 467. The court did hold, however, that under Ohio law the trial court is not required to determine whether a defendant ""is fully apprised [498 U.S. 1111, 1113]

No. 89-1436
Argued Oct. 29, 1990
Decided Jan. 22, 1991
498 U.S. 292

Syllabus 
Pursuant to an investigation into allegations of interstate transportation of obscene materials, a federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia issued subpoenas duces tecum to Model Magazine Distributors, Inc. (Model), and to respondents R. Enterprises, Inc., and MFR Court Street Books, Inc. (MFR), all of which were based in New York and wholly owned by the same person.  The subpoenas sought a variety of corporate books and records and, in Model's case, copies of certain videotapes that it had shipped to retailers in the Eastern District.  The District Court denied the companies' motions to quash the subpoenas and, when the companies refused to comply with the subpoenas, found each of them in contempt.  The Court of Appeals, inter alia, quashed the subpoenas issued to respondents, ruling that the subpoenas did not satisfy the relevancy prong of the test set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,  418 U. S. 699-700 -- which requires the Government to establish relevancy, admissibility, and specificity in order to enforce a subpoena in the trial context -- and that the subpoenas therefore failed to meet the requirement that any document subpoenaed under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c) be admissible as evidence at trial.  The court did not consider respondents' contention that enforcement of the subpoenas would likely infringe their First Amendment rights.
Held:
1. The Court of Appeals did not apply the proper standard in evaluating the subpoenas issued to respondents.  Pp.  498 U. S. 297-303.
(a) The Nixon standard does not apply in the context of grand jury proceedings.  The unique role of a grand jury makes its subpoenas much different from subpoenas issued in the context of a criminal trial.  Thus, this Court has held that a grand jury may compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers appropriate, and that its operation generally is unrestrained by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing the conduct of criminal trials.  Nixon's multi-factor test would invite impermissible procedural delays and detours while courts evaluate the relevancy and admissibility of documents sought by a particular subpoena.  Additionally, requiring the Government to explain in too much detail the particular reasons underlying a subpoena threatens to compromise the indispensable secrecy of grand 
Page 498 U. S. 293
 jury proceedings.  Broad disclosure also affords the targets of investigation far more information about the grand jury's workings than the Rules of Criminal Procedure appear to contemplate.  Pp.  498 U. S. 297-299.
(b) The grand jury's investigatory powers are nevertheless subject to the limit imposed by Rule 17(c), which provides that ""the court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive"" (emphasis added).  Since a grand jury subpoena issued through normal channels is presumed to be reasonable, the burden of showing unreasonableness, as the above language indicates, must be on the recipient who seeks to avoid compliance, and the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it placed an initial burden on the Government.  Moreover, where, as here, a subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds, the motion to quash must be denied unless the district court determines that there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jury's investigation.  Since respondents did not challenge the subpoenas as being too indefinite or claim that compliance would be overly burdensome, this Court does not consider these aspects of the subpoenas.  Pp.  498 U. S. 299-301.
(c) Because it seems unlikely that a challenging party who does not know the general subject matter of the grand jury's investigation will be able to make the necessary showing that compliance with a subpoena would be unreasonable, a court may be justified in requiring the Government to reveal the investigation's general subject before requiring the challenger to carry its burden of persuasion.  However, this question need not be resolved here, since there is no doubt that respondents knew the subject of the particular investigation.  Pp.  498 U. S. 301-302.
(d) Application of the above principles demonstrates that the District Court correctly denied respondents' motions to quash.  Based on the undisputed facts that all three companies are owned by the same person, that all do business in the same area, and that Model has shipped sexually explicit materials into the Eastern District of Virginia, the court could have concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that respondents' business records would produce information relevant to the grand jury's investigation, notwithstanding respondents' self-serving denial of any connection to Virginia.  Pp.  498 U. S. 302-303.
2. This Court expresses no view on, and leaves to the Court of Appeals to resolve, the issue whether, based on respondents' contention that the records subpoenaed related to First Amendment activities, the Government was required to demonstrate that they were particularly relevant to the investigation.

|498 u.s. 308|"Parker v. Dugger
No. 89-5961
Argued Nov. 7, 1990
Decided Jan. 22, 1991
498 U.S. 308

Syllabus 
A Florida jury convicted petitioner Parker of first-degree murder for the killings of Richard Padgett and Nancy Sheppard.  At the advisory sentencing hearing, the jury found that sufficient aggravating circumstances existed to justify a death sentence as to both murders, but that sufficient mitigating circumstances existed to outweigh those aggravating factors, and therefore recommended that Parker be sentenced to life imprisonment on both counts.  The trial judge, who has ultimate sentencing authority under state law, accepted the jury's recommendation for the Padgett murder, but overrode the recommendation for the Sheppard murder and sentenced Parker to death.  The judge explained, inter alia, that he had found, based on a review of the evidence, six statutory aggravating circumstances as to the Sheppard murder, and no statutory mitigating circumstances.  He did not discuss evidence of, or reach any explicit conclusions concerning, nonstatutory mitigating evidence, but declared that ""[t]here are no mitigating circumstances that outweigh the aggravating circumstances in"" either count.  Although concluding that there was insufficient evidence of two of the aggravating circumstances relied on by the trial judge, the State Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, declaring that the trial court had found no mitigating circumstances to balance against the four properly applied aggravating factors.  The court ruled that the facts suggesting the death sentence were ""so clear and convincing that no reasonable person could differ,"" and therefore that judicial override of the jury's recommendation of life was appropriate under state law.  The Federal District Court granted Parker's habeas corpus petition as to the imposition of the death penalty, ruling that the sentence was unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Florida Supreme Court acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to treat adequately Parker's nonstatutory mitigating evidence.  Pp.  498 U. S. 313-323.
(a) Although the trial judge's order imposing the death sentence does not state explicitly what effect he gave Parker's nonstatutory mitigating evidence, it must be concluded that the judge found and weighed such evidence before imposing the sentence.  The record contains substantial 
Page 498 U. S. 309
 evidence, much of it uncontroverted, favoring mitigation.  Moreover, the judge declined to override the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment for the Padgett murder, indicating that he found nonstatutory mitigating circumstances in that murder.  Furthermore, the judge stated that he found no mitigating circumstances ""that outweigh"" aggravating circumstances, indicating that nonstatutory mitigating circumstances did, in fact, exist.  Pp.  498 U. S. 313-318.
(b) Thus, the State Supreme Court erred in concluding that the trial judge found no mitigating circumstances to balance against the aggravating factors, and consequently erred in its review of Parker's sentence.  Where a reviewing court in a weighing State strikes one or more of the aggravating factors on which the sentencer relies, the reviewing court may, consistent with the Constitution, reweigh the remaining evidence or conduct a harmless error analysis.  Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738,  494 U. S. 741.  The State Supreme Court did not conduct an independent reweighing of the evidence, since it explicitly relied on what it took to be the trial judge's findings of no mitigating circumstances.  Moreover, even if the court conducted a harmless error analysis, that analysis was flawed by the court's ignoring of the evidence of mitigating circumstances in the record.

			"|"Parker v. Dugger
No. 89-5961
Argued Nov. 7, 1990
Decided Jan. 22, 1991
498 U.S. 308

Syllabus 
A Florida jury convicted petitioner Parker of first-degree murder for the killings of Richard Padgett and Nancy Sheppard.  At the advisory sentencing hearing, the jury found that sufficient aggravating circumstances existed to justify a death sentence as to both murders, but that sufficient mitigating circumstances existed to outweigh those aggravating factors, and therefore recommended that Parker be sentenced to life imprisonment on both counts.  The trial judge, who has ultimate sentencing authority under state law, accepted the jury's recommendation for the Padgett murder, but overrode the recommendation for the Sheppard murder and sentenced Parker to death.  The judge explained, inter alia, that he had found, based on a review of the evidence, six statutory aggravating circumstances as to the Sheppard murder, and no statutory mitigating circumstances.  He did not discuss evidence of, or reach any explicit conclusions concerning, nonstatutory mitigating evidence, but declared that ""[t]here are no mitigating circumstances that outweigh the aggravating circumstances in"" either count.  Although concluding that there was insufficient evidence of two of the aggravating circumstances relied on by the trial judge, the State Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, declaring that the trial court had found no mitigating circumstances to balance against the four properly applied aggravating factors.  The court ruled that the facts suggesting the death sentence were ""so clear and convincing that no reasonable person could differ,"" and therefore that judicial override of the jury's recommendation of life was appropriate under state law.  The Federal District Court granted Parker's habeas corpus petition as to the imposition of the death penalty, ruling that the sentence was unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals reversed.
Held:  The Florida Supreme Court acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to treat adequately Parker's nonstatutory mitigating evidence.  Pp.  498 U. S. 313-323.
(a) Although the trial judge's order imposing the death sentence does not state explicitly what effect he gave Parker's nonstatutory mitigating evidence, it must be concluded that the judge found and weighed such evidence before imposing the sentence.  The record contains substantial 
Page 498 U. S. 309
 evidence, much of it uncontroverted, favoring mitigation.  Moreover, the judge declined to override the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment for the Padgett murder, indicating that he found nonstatutory mitigating circumstances in that murder.  Furthermore, the judge stated that he found no mitigating circumstances ""that outweigh"" aggravating circumstances, indicating that nonstatutory mitigating circumstances did, in fact, exist.  Pp.  498 U. S. 313-318.
(b) Thus, the State Supreme Court erred in concluding that the trial judge found no mitigating circumstances to balance against the aggravating factors, and consequently erred in its review of Parker's sentence.  Where a reviewing court in a weighing State strikes one or more of the aggravating factors on which the sentencer relies, the reviewing court may, consistent with the Constitution, reweigh the remaining evidence or conduct a harmless error analysis.  Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738,  494 U. S. 741.  The State Supreme Court did not conduct an independent reweighing of the evidence, since it explicitly relied on what it took to be the trial judge's findings of no mitigating circumstances.  Moreover, even if the court conducted a harmless error analysis, that analysis was flawed by the court's ignoring of the evidence of mitigating circumstances in the record.  Although a federal court on habeas review must give deference to a state appellate court's resolution of an ambiguity in a state trial court's statement, Wainwright v. Goode, 464 U. S. 78,  464 U. S. 83-85, it need not do so where, as here, the appellate court's conclusion is not fairly supported by the record in the case.  Pp.  498 U. S. 318-320.
(c) The State Supreme Court's affirmance of Parker's death sentence based upon nonexistent findings was invalid because it deprived Parker of the individualized treatment to which he is entitled under the Constitution.  Clemons, supra, 494 U.S. at  494 U. S. 752.  Pp.  498 U. S. 321-322.

 Oscar DIAZ-ALBERTINI, petitioner, v. UNITED STATES  No. 90-552 
 Supreme Court of the United States 
 January 22, 1991
 On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
 The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for further consideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed December 12, 1990 and asserted in his brief for the United States filed February 27, 1990, in No. 89-1040, Chappell v. United States. 

 THE CHIEF JUSTICE, with whom Justice SCALIA and Justice KENNEDY join, dissenting. 
 The Court vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and remands for ""further consideration in light of the position presently asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed December 12, 1990 and asserted in his brief for the United States filed February 27, 1990, in No. 89-1040, Chappell v. United States. "" The Solicitor General, however, has taken the position that the judgment and reasoning of the Court of Appeals were correct and that certiorari should be denied. The Court's disposition fails to provide the Court of Appeals with any useful guidance on remand, leaving that court with the task of spending scarce judicial resources trying to divine what we mean. I therefore dissent. 
 Petitioner filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 seeking to vacate a sentence previously imposed on the ground that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel's failure to raise a juror-bias claim until after the trial. 
 The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of relief holding that petitioner was procedurally barred from raising 
Page 498 U.S. 1061, 1062
 his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on collateral attack. App. to Pet. for Cert. A1-A6. The court reasoned that the claim should have been raised on direct appeal because petitioner was represented by new counsel on direct appeal and because appellate counsel had ""all the information available to him necessary to frame a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel."" Id., at A5. Because petitioner had not shown "" cause"" for his failure to raise the issue on direct appeal, the court concluded that he was barred from raising it under 2255. 
 Petitioner then filed a petition for rehearing, arguing that the panel should reconsider its decision in light of this Court's disposition of the certiorari petition in Chappell v. United States, 494 U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1800, 108 L.Ed.2d 931 (1990). In Chappell, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had held that the defendant was barred from raising a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a 2255 motion because he had been represented by new counsel on direct appeal and therefore could have raised the claim at that time. Chappell v. United States, 878 F.2d 384 (1989) (judgment order). In response to the petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General submitted a brief on behalf of the United States which stated that it was the position of the United States that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel ordinarily should be raised for the first time on collateral attack under 2255 rather than on direct appeal. The Solicitor General further stated that where claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are to be raised in a 2255 motion, a failure to raise such a claim should not constitute procedural default. The Court granted the petition for certiorari in Chappell, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded to that court for further consideration in light of the position taken by the United States in its brief. 494 U.S. ___, 110 S.Ct. 1800, 108 L.Ed.2d 931 (1990). 
 In this case, the Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing without requesting a response from the United States. Petitioner then filed a petition for certiorari, arguing that we should grant the petition, vacate the judgment of the Tenth Circuit, and remand for further consideration in light of the position taken by the United States in Chappell. However, in its brief for the United States in opposition, the Solicitor General recommended that the Court deny the petition. The Solicitor General asserted that this case was distinguishable from Chappell because ""[h]ere, a hearing was held in the district court, in connection with petitioner's motion for a new trial, on the circumstances surround- [498 U.S. 1061, 1063]

No. 89-1080
Argued Oct. 2, 1990
Decided Jan. 15, 1991
498 U.S. 237

Syllabus 
In 1972, finding that previous efforts had not been successful at eliminating de jure segregation, the District Court entered a decree imposing a school desegregation plan on petitioner Board of Education.  In 1977, finding that the school district had achieved ""unitary"" status, the court issued an order terminating the case which respondents, black students and their parents, did not appeal.  In 1984, the Board adopted its Student Reassignment Plan (SRP), under which a number of previously desegregated schools would return to primarily one-race status for the asserted purpose of alleviating greater busing burdens on young black children caused by demographic changes.  The District Court thereafter denied respondents' motion to reopen the terminated case, holding, inter alia, that its 1977 unitariness finding was res judicata.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondents could challenge the SRP because the school district was still subject to the desegregation decree, nothing in the 1977 order having indicated that the 1972 injunction itself was terminated.  On remand, the District Court dissolved the injunction, finding, among other things, that the original plan was no longer workable, that the Board had complied in good faith for more than a decade with the court's orders, and that the SRP was not designed with discriminatory intent.  The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that a desegregation decree remains in effect until a school district can show ""grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions,'"" United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106,  286 U. S. 119, and that circumstances had not changed enough to justify modification of the 1972 decree.
Held:
1. Respondents may contest the District Court's order dissolving the 1972 injunction.  Although respondents did not appeal from the court's 1977 order, that order did not dissolve the desegregation decree, and, since the order is unclear with respect to what it meant by ""unitary"" and the necessary result of that finding, it is too ambiguous to bar respondents 
Page 498 U. S. 238
 from challenging later action by the Board.  If a desegregation decree is to be terminated or dissolved, the parties are entitled to a rather precise statement to that effect from the court.  Pp.  498 U. S. 244-246.
2. The Court of Appeals' test for dissolving a desegregation decree is more stringent than is required either by this Court's decisions dealing with injunctions or by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  498 U. S. 246-251.
(a) Considerations based on the allocation of powers within the federal system demonstrate that the Swift test does not provide the proper standard to apply to injunctions entered in school desegregation cases.  Such decrees, unlike the one in Swift, are not intended to operate in perpetuity, federal supervision of local school systems always having been intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination.  The legal justification for displacement of local authority in such cases is a violation of the Constitution, and dissolution of a desegregation decree after local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period is proper.  Thus, in this case, a finding by the District Court that the school system was being operated in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, and that it was unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully achieved, and no additional showing of ""grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions"" would be required of the Board.  Pp.  498 U. S. 246-248.
(b) The Court of Appeals also erred in relying on United States v. W.T. Grant Co. 345 U. S. 629,  345 U. S. 633, for the proposition that ""compliance alone cannot become the basis for modifying or dissolving an injunction.""  That case did not involve the dissolution of an injunction, but the question whether an injunction should be issued in the first place in light of the wrongdoer's promise to comply with the law.  Although a district court need not accept at face value a school board's profession that it will cease to intentionally discriminate in the future, the board's compliance with previous court orders is obviously relevant in deciding whether to modify or dissolve a desegregation decree, since the passage of time results in changes in board personnel and enables the court to observe the board's good faith in complying with the decree.  The Court of Appeals' test would improperly condemn a school district to judicial tutelage for the indefinite future.  Pp.  498 U. S. 248-249.
(c) In deciding whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional compliance as of 1985, when the SRP was adopted, to allow the injunction to be dissolved, the District Court, on remand, should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether, in light of every facet of school operations, the vestiges of past de jure segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable.  If it decides that the Board 
Page 498 U. S. 239
 was entitled to have the decree terminated, the court should proceed to decide whether the Board's decision to implement the SRP complies with appropriate equal protection principles.  Pp.  498 U. S. 249-251.

2. The Court of Appeals' test for dissolving a desegregation decree is more stringent than is required either by this Court's decisions dealing with injunctions or by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.  498 U. S. 246-251.
(a) Considerations based on the allocation of powers within the federal system demonstrate that the Swift test does not provide the proper standard to apply to injunctions entered in school desegregation cases.  Such decrees, unlike the one in Swift, are not intended to operate in perpetuity, federal supervision of local school systems always having been intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination.  The legal justification for displacement of local authority in such cases is a violation of the Constitution, and dissolution of a desegregation decree after local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period is proper.  Thus, in this case, a finding by the District Court that the school system was being operated in compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, and that it was unlikely that the Board would return to its former ways, would be a finding that the purposes of the desegregation litigation had been fully achieved, and no additional showing of ""grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions"" would be required of the Board.  Pp.  498 U. S. 246-248.
(b) The Court of Appeals also erred in relying on United States v. W.T. Grant Co. 345 U. S. 629,  345 U. S. 633, for the proposition that ""compliance alone cannot become the basis for modifying or dissolving an injunction.""  That case did not involve the dissolution of an injunction, but the question whether an injunction should be issued in the first place in light of the wrongdoer's promise to comply with the law.  Although a district court need not accept at face value a school board's profession that it will cease to intentionally discriminate in the future, the board's compliance with previous court orders is obviously relevant in deciding whether to modify or dissolve a desegregation decree, since the passage of time results in changes in board personnel and enables the court to observe the board's good faith in complying with the decree.  The Court of Appeals' test would improperly condemn a school district to judicial tutelage for the indefinite future.  Pp.  498 U. S. 248-249.
(c) In deciding whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional compliance as of 1985, when the SRP was adopted, to allow the injunction to be dissolved, the District Court, on remand, should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether, in light of every facet of school operations, the vestiges of past de jure segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable.  If it decides that the Board 
Page 498 U. S. 239
 was entitled to have the decree terminated, the court should proceed to decide whether the Board's decision to implement the SRP complies with appropriate equal protection principles.  Pp.  498 U. S. 249-251.

Syllabus 
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2) provides that a
""notice of appeal filed after the announcement of a decision or order but before the entry of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on the day thereof.""
On January 26, 1989, the District Court announced from the bench that it intended to grant a motion for summary judgment filed by respondent Investors Mortgage Insurance Co. (IMI) in a suit brought by petitioner FirsTier Mortgage Co. against IMI, requested that the parties file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to support that ruling, and clarified that its ruling extinguished all of FirsTier's claims.  FirsTier filed a notice of appeal on February 8, identifying the January 26 ruling as the decision from which it was appealing, but the District Court did not enter judgment until March 3.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the ground that the January 26 decision was not a final decision appealable under 28 U.S.C.  1291.
Held:  Rule 4(a)(2) permits a notice of appeal filed from a nonfinal decision to serve as an effective notice of appeal from a subsequently entered final judgment when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.  In such an instance, it would be reasonable for a litigant to believe that the decision is final, and permitting a notice of appeal to become effective when judgment is entered would not catch the appellee by surprise.  This interpretation of the Rule best comports with its drafters' intent.  And it does not contravene Rule 1(b)'s prohibition on construing the appellate rules to extend or limit courts' jurisdiction as established by law.  Even if a bench ruling were not final under  1291, Rule 4(a)(2) would not render that ruling appealable in contravention of  1291.  Rather, it treats the premature notice as a notice filed from the subsequently entered judgment.  The instant bench ruling is a ""decision"" under the Rule.  It purported to dispose of all of FirsTier's claims, and would have been final under  1291 had the judge set forth his judgment immediately and the clerk entered the judgment on the docket.  FirsTier's confusion as to the litigation's status was understandable, and no unfairness to IMI results from allowing the appeal to go forward.  Pp.  498 U. S. 272-277.

No. 89-1149
Argued Oct. 29, 1990
Decided Jan. 15, 1991
498 U.S. 279

Syllabus 
Respondent Garner filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, listing a fraud judgment in petitioners' favor as a dischargeable debt.  Petitioners then filed a complaint in the proceeding requesting a determination that their claim should be exempted from discharge pursuant to  523(a), which provides that a debtor may not be discharged from, inter alia, obligations for money obtained by ""actual fraud.""  Presented with portions of the fraud case record, the Bankruptcy Court found that the elements of actual fraud under  523 were proved and that the doctrine of collateral estoppel required a holding that the debt was not dischargeable.  It and the District Court rejected Garner's argument that collateral estoppel does not apply because the fraud trial's jury instructions required that fraud be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, whereas  523 requires proof by clear and convincing evidence.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the clear-and-convincing evidence standard applies in fraud cases, since Congress would not have silently changed pre- 523(a) law, which generally applied the higher standard in common law fraud litigation and in resolving dischargeability issues, and since the Code's general ""fresh start"" policy militated in favor of a broad construction favorable to the debtor.
Held:  Preponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof for  523(a)'s dischargeability exceptions.  Neither  523 and its legislative history nor the legislative history of  523's predecessor prescribes a standard of proof, a silence that is inconsistent with the view that Congress intended to require a clear-and-convincing evidence standard.  The preponderance standard is presumed to be applicable in civil actions between private parties unless particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake, and, in the context of the discharge exemption provisions, a debtor's interest in discharge is insufficient to require a heightened standard.  Such a standard is not required to effectuate the Code's ""fresh start"" policy.  Since the Code limits the opportunity for a completely unencumbered new beginning to the honest but unfortunate debtor by exempting certain debts from discharge, it is unlikely that Congress would have fashioned a proof standard that favored an interest in giving the perpetrators of fraud a fresh start over an interest in protecting the victims of fraud.  It is also fair to infer from  523(a)'s structure that 
Page 498 U. S. 280
 Congress intended the preponderance standard to apply to all of the discharge exceptions.  That they are grouped together in the same subsection with no suggestion that any particular exception is subject to a special standard implies that the same standard should govern all of them, and it seems clear that a preponderance standard is sufficient to establish nondischargeability of some claims.  The fact that many States required proof of fraud by clear and convincing evidence at the time the current Code was enacted does not mean that Congress silently endorsed such a rule for the fraud discharge exception.  Unlike many States, Congress has chosen a preponderance standard when it has created substantive causes of action for fraud.  In addition, it amended the Bankruptcy Act in 1970 to make nondischargeability a question of federal law independent of the issue of the underlying claim's validity, which is determined by state law.  Moreover, both before and after 1970, courts were split over the appropriate proof standard for the fraud discharge exception.  Application of the preponderance standard will also permit exception from discharge of all fraud claims creditors have reduced to judgment, a result that accords with the historical development of the discharge exceptions, which have been altered to broaden the coverage of the fraud exceptions.

498 U.S. 233

Syllabus 
Petitioner Berger, an attorney appointed to represent a capital defendant in proceedings before this Court, filed a motion requesting compensation for services rendered in an amount exceeding the $2,500 maximum permitted under the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) and adhered to by this Court.  She argued that the cap for capital cases had been lifted by the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments Act of 1988, which permits the Court to award compensation in an amount ""reasonably necessary"" to ensure competent representation, 21 U.S.C.  848(q)(10).
Held:
1. Section 848(q)(10)'s language authorizes federal courts to compensate attorneys appointed to represent capital defendants under the CJA in an amount exceeding the $2,500 limit.  This interpretation is supported by the guidelines developed by the Judicial Conference to assist courts in interpreting and applying  848(q)'s mandate.
2. The amount of compensation that is ""reasonably necessary"" to ensure that capital defendants receive competent representation in proceedings before this Court may not exceed $5,000.  The existing practice has allowed for a level of representation that has been of high quality, and the administrative ease by which requests for fees are disposed of under the CJA's bright-line rule has assisted in conserving the Court's limited resources.  However, it is possible that the $2,500 cap may, at the margins, deter otherwise willing and qualified attorneys from offering their services to represent indigent capital defendants.  While compensation should be increased, given the rising costs of practicing law today, it would not be a wise expenditure of the Court's resources to deal with fee applications on an individual case-by-case basis.  Such an inquiry is time-consuming, its result imprecise, and it would lead the Court into an area in which it has little experience.
3. Berger is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $5,000.

However, the State Supreme Court refused to review petitioner's submissions, declaring that ""[c]omparative proportionality review is not constitutionally required."" Ibid. Although the court cited its own prior decisions for that conclusion, ibid., those precedents ultimately derive from this Court's opinion in Pulley v.

In Pulley, the Court sustained California's capital punishment statute against Eighth Amendment attack, rejecting the claim that the ""Eighth Amendment . . . requires a state appellate court, before it affirms a death sentence, to compare the sentence in the case before it with the penalties imposed in similar cases if requested to do so by the prisoner."" 465 U.S., at 43-44, 104 S.Ct., at 876. 
 I dissented from the decision in Pulley, and I continue to believe that it was wrongly decided. The singling out of particular defendants for the death penalty when their crimes are no more aggravated than those committed by numerous other defendants given lesser sentences is unacceptable. As Justice Brennan pointed out in his dissent in Pulley, comparative proportionality review, at the very least, ""serves to eliminate some of the irrationality that currently surrounds imposition of a death sentence"" and ""can be administered without much difficulty by a court of statewide jurisdiction."" 465 U.S., at 71, 104 S.Ct., at 890. In the present case, petitioner has not merely ""requested"" review for comparative proportionality, cf. id., at 44, 104 S.Ct., at 876, but has ( in the lower court's own words) ""present[ed] an elaborate survey of published Court of Appeal decisions,"" allegedly showing that ""many first degree murderers of equal and greater culpability have received sentences less than death."" 50 Cal.3d, at 718, 268 Cal.Rptr., at 735, 789 P.2d, at 916.

No. 89-5916
Argued Nov. 6, 1990
Decided Jan. 8, 1991
498 U.S. 184

Syllabus 
Petitioner Demarest, an inmate in a state correctional facility, testified as a witness in a federal criminal trial pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum issued by the District Court.  In accordance with 28 U.S.C.  1825(a), he requested that respondent clerk of the court certify that he was entitled to fees as a ""witness . . . in attendance"" under  1821.  After the request was denied, he filed a petition for a writ of mandamus requesting the court to order the clerk to certify the fees, which was dismissed on the ground that  1821 does not authorize the payment of witness fees to prisoners.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, while  1821's language was unqualified, other evidence revealed that Congress did not intend to permit prisoners to receive witness fees.
Held:  Section 1821 requires payment of witness fees to a convicted state prisoner who testifies at a federal trial pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.  The statute's terms make virtually inescapable the conclusion that a ""witness in attendance at any court of the United States"" under  1821(a)(1) includes prisoners unless they are otherwise excepted in the statute.  That Congress was thinking about incarcerated persons when it drafted the statute is shown by the fact that subsection (d)(1) excluded incarcerated witnesses from eligibility for subsistence payments and subsection (e) expressly excepted another class of incarcerated witnesses -- detained aliens -- from any eligibility for fees.  The Government's argument that the language of  1825(a) -- which requires that fees be paid to defense witnesses ""appearing pursuant to subpoenas issued upon approval of the court"" -- modifies the ""in attendance"" at court language of  1821(a)(1) to exclude prisoners because they are ""produced"" under a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum is rejected.  That reading is inconsistent with the Government's concession that fees are routinely paid to defense witnesses appearing by verbal agreement among the parties and with Hurtado v. United States, 410 U. S. 578, which upheld the right to fees of material witnesses who, rather than being subpoenaed, were detained under former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 46(b).  If these are exceptions to the Government's concept of ""in attendance,"" then that concept means no more than ""summoned by a means other than a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.""  Such a 
Page 498 U. S. 185
 view is not supported by the statutory language, and would lead to the anomaly that prisoners summoned to testify for the Government would receive fees -- since  1825(a) does not require them to appear personally by subpoena -- while witnesses summoned by the defendant would not.  In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals mistakenly relied on long-standing administrative construction of the statute and other Courts of Appeals' decisions denying attendance fees to prisoners, followed by congressional revision of the statute.  Administrative interpretation of a statute contrary to the statute's plain language is not entitled to deference, and where the law is plain, subsequent reenactment does not constitute adoption of a previous administrative construction.  This case does not present a rare and exceptional circumstance where the application of the statute as written will produce a result demonstrably at odds with its drafters' intentions.  While there may be good reasons to deny fees to prisoners, who are seldom gainfully employed and therefore do not suffer the loss of income for attendance that many other witnesses do, the same can be said of children and retired persons, who are clearly entitled to fees.  This Court declines to consider the Government's argument that defects in Demarest's petition constitute an independent basis for the clerk's decision to withhold certification, since it was not raised in the courts below.

No. 89-658
Argued Oct. 3, 1990
Decided Jan. 8, 1991
498 U.S. 192

Syllabus 
Petitioner Cheek was charged with six counts of willfully failing to file a federal income tax return in violation of  7203 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and three counts of willfully attempting to evade his income taxes in violation of  7201.  Although admitting that he had not filed his returns, he testified that he had not acted willfully because he sincerely believed, based on his indoctrination by a group believing that the federal tax system is unconstitutional and his own study, that the tax laws were being unconstitutionally enforced and that his actions were lawful.  In instructing the jury, the court stated that an honest but unreasonable belief is not a defense, and does not negate willfulness, and that Cheek's beliefs that wages are not income and that he was not a taxpayer within the meaning of the Code were not objectively reasonable.  It also instructed the jury that a person's opinion that the tax laws violate his constitutional rights does not constitute a good-faith misunderstanding of the law.  Cheek was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held:
1. A good-faith misunderstanding of the law or a good-faith belief that one is not violating the law negates willfulness, whether or not the claimed belief or misunderstanding is objectively reasonable.  Statutory willfulness, which protects the average citizen from prosecution for innocent mistakes made due to the complexity of the tax laws, United States v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, is the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.  United States v. Pomponio, 429 U. S. 10.  Thus, if the jury credited Cheek's assertion that he truly believed that the Code did not treat wages as income, the Government would not have carried its burden to prove willfulness, however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief.  Characterizing a belief as objectively unreasonable transforms what is normally a factual inquiry into a legal one, thus preventing a jury from considering it.  And forbidding a jury to consider evidence that might negate willfulness would raise a serious question under the Sixth Amendment's jury trial provision, which this interpretation of the statute avoids.  Of course, in deciding whether to credit Cheek's claim, the jury is free to consider any admissible evidence showing that he had knowledge of his legal duties.  Pp.  498 U. S. 199-204. 
Page 498 U. S. 193

2. It was proper for the trial court to instruct the jury not to consider Cheek's claim that the tax laws are unconstitutional, since a defendant's views about the tax statutes' validity are irrelevant to the issue of willfulness, and should not be heard by a jury.  Unlike the claims in the Murdock-Pomponio line of cases, claims that Code provisions are unconstitutional do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the Code's complexity.  Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable.  Congress could not have contemplated that a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore his duties under the Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms Congress provided to present his invalidity claims to the courts and to abide by their decisions.  Cheek was free to pay the tax, file for a refund, and, if denied, present his claims to the courts.  Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court.  Pp.  498 U. S. 204-207.

Syllabus 
In response to ongoing natural gas shortages, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), which, inter alia, established higher price ceilings for ""new"" gas in order to encourage production and carried over the preexisting system of ""vintage"" price ceilings for ""old"" gas in order to protect consumers.  However, recognizing that some of the vintage ceilings might be too low, Congress, in  104(b)(2) of the NGPA, authorized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise them whenever traditional pricing principles under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) would dictate a higher price.  After the new production incentives resulted in serious market distortions, the Commission issued its Order No. 451, which, among other things, collapsed the existing vintage price categories into a single classification and set forth a single new ceiling that exceeded the then-current market price for old gas; established a ""Good Faith Negotiation"" (GFN) procedure that producers must follow before they can collect a higher price from current pipeline customers, whereby producers may in certain circumstances abandon their existing obligations if the parties cannot come to terms; and rejected suggestions that the Commission undertake to resolve in the Order No. 451 proceeding the issue of take-or-pay provisions in certain gas contracts.  Such provisions obligate a pipeline to purchase a specified volume of gas at a specified price, and, if it is unable to do so, to pay for that volume.  They have caused significant hardships for gas purchasers under current market conditions.  On review, the Court of Appeals vacated Order No. 451, ruling that the Commission lacked authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas under  104(b)(2) of the NGPA; that the ceiling price actually set was unreasonable; that the Commission lacked authority to provide for across-the-board, preauthorized abandonment under  7(b) of the NGA; and that the Commission should have addressed the take-or-pay issue in this proceeding, even though it was considering the matter in a separate proceeding. 
Page 498 U. S. 212

Held:  Order No. 451 does not exceed the Commission's authority under the NGPA.  Pp.  498 U. S. 221-231.
(a) Section 104(b)(2) of the NGPA -- which authorizes the Commission to prescribe ""a . . . ceiling price, applicable to . . . any natural gas (or category thereof; as determined by the Commission) . . . , if such price"" is (1) ""higher than"" the old vintage ceilings, and (2) ""just and reasonable"" under the NGA (emphasis added) clearly and unambiguously gives the Commission authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas.  The NGPA's structure -- which created detailed incentives for new gas, but carefully preserved the old gas vintaging scheme -- does not require a contrary conclusion, since the statute's bifurcated approach implies no more than that Congress found the need to encourage new gas production sufficiently pressing to deal with the matter directly, but was content to leave old gas pricing within the Commission's discretion to alter as conditions warranted.  Further, the Commission's decision to set a single ceiling fully accords with the two restrictions  104(b)(2) does establish, since the ""higher than"" requirement does nothing to prevent the Commission from consolidating existing categories and setting one price, and since the ""just and reasonable"" requirement preserves the pricing flexibility that the Commission historically exercised and accords the Commission broad ratemaking authority that its decision to set a single ceiling does not exceed.  Respondents' contention that the Commission's institution of the GFN process amounts to an acknowledgment of the unreasonableness of the new ceiling price is rejected, since there is nothing incompatible in the belief that a price is reasonable and the belief that it ought not to be imposed without prior negotiations.  An otherwise lawful rate should not be disallowed because additional safeguards accompany it.  Respondents' objection that no order ""deregulating"" the price of old gas can be deemed just and reasonable is also rejected, since Order No. 451 does not deregulate in any legally relevant sense, and it cannot be concluded that deregulation results simply because a given ceiling price may be above the market price.  Pp.  498 U. S. 221-226.
(b) Order No. 451's abandonment procedures fully comport with the requirements of  7(b) of the NGA, which, inter alia, prohibits a gas producer from abandoning its contractual service obligations to a purchaser unless the Commission has (1) granted its ""permission and approval"" of the abandonment; (2) made a ""finding"" that ""present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment"" and (3) held a ""hearing"" that is ""due.""  First, although Order No. 451's approval of the abandonment at issue is not specific to any single abandonment, but is instead general, prospective, and conditional, nothing in  7(b) prevents the Commission from giving advance approval or mandates individualized proceedings involving interested parties before a specific abandonment 
Page 498 U. S. 213
 can take place.  Second, in reviewing ""all relevant factors involved in determining the overall public interest,"" and in finding that preauthorized abandonment under the GFN regime would generally protect purchasers, safeguard producers, and serve the market by releasing previously unused reserves of old gas, the Commission made the necessary ""finding"" required by  7(b), which does not compel the agency to make ""specific findings"" with regard to every abandonment when the issues involved are general.  Finally, the Commission discharged its  7(b) duty to hold a ""due hearing,"" since, before promulgating Order No. 451, it held a notice and comment hearing and an oral hearing.  See, e.g., Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458,  461 U. S. 467.  United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. McCombs, 442 U. S. 529, distinguished.  Respondents cannot claim that the Commission made no provision for individual determinations under its abandonment procedures where appropriate, since Order No. 451 authorizes a purchaser objecting to a given abandonment on the grounds that the conditions the agency has set forth have not been met to file a complaint with the Commission.  Pp.  498 U. S. 226-229.
(c) The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the Commission had a duty to address the take-or-pay problem more fully in this proceeding.  The court clearly overshot its mark if it meant to order the Commission to resolve the problem, since an agency enjoys broad discretion in determining how best to handle related yet discrete issues in terms of procedures, and it is likely that the Commission's separate proceeding addressing the matter will generate relevant data more effectively.  The court likewise erred if it meant that the Commission should have addressed the take-or-pay problem insofar as Order No. 451 ""exacerbated"" it, since an agency need not solve every problem before it in the same proceeding, and the Commission has articulated rational grounds for concluding that the order would do more to ameliorate the problem than worsen it.  This Court is neither inclined nor prepared to second-guess the Commission's reasoned determination in this complex area.  Pp.  498 U. S. 229-231.

After the new production incentives resulted in serious market distortions, the Commission issued its Order No. 451, which, among other things, collapsed the existing vintage price categories into a single classification and set forth a single new ceiling that exceeded the then-current market price for old gas; established a ""Good Faith Negotiation"" (GFN) procedure that producers must follow before they can collect a higher price from current pipeline customers, whereby producers may in certain circumstances abandon their existing obligations if the parties cannot come to terms; and rejected suggestions that the Commission undertake to resolve in the Order No. 451 proceeding the issue of take-or-pay provisions in certain gas contracts.  Such provisions obligate a pipeline to purchase a specified volume of gas at a specified price, and, if it is unable to do so, to pay for that volume.  They have caused significant hardships for gas purchasers under current market conditions.  On review, the Court of Appeals vacated Order No. 451, ruling that the Commission lacked authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas under  104(b)(2) of the NGPA; that the ceiling price actually set was unreasonable; that the Commission lacked authority to provide for across-the-board, preauthorized abandonment under  7(b) of the NGA; and that the Commission should have addressed the take-or-pay issue in this proceeding, even though it was considering the matter in a separate proceeding. 
Page 498 U. S. 212

Held:  Order No. 451 does not exceed the Commission's authority under the NGPA.  Pp.  498 U. S. 221-231.
(a) Section 104(b)(2) of the NGPA -- which authorizes the Commission to prescribe ""a . . . ceiling price, applicable to . . . any natural gas (or category thereof; as determined by the Commission) . . . , if such price"" is (1) ""higher than"" the old vintage ceilings, and (2) ""just and reasonable"" under the NGA (emphasis added) clearly and unambiguously gives the Commission authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas.  The NGPA's structure -- which created detailed incentives for new gas, but carefully preserved the old gas vintaging scheme -- does not require a contrary conclusion, since the statute's bifurcated approach implies no more than that Congress found the need to encourage new gas production sufficiently pressing to deal with the matter directly, but was content to leave old gas pricing within the Commission's discretion to alter as conditions warranted.  Further, the Commission's decision to set a single ceiling fully accords with the two restrictions  104(b)(2) does establish, since the ""higher than"" requirement does nothing to prevent the Commission from consolidating existing categories and setting one price, and since the ""just and reasonable"" requirement preserves the pricing flexibility that the Commission historically exercised and accords the Commission broad ratemaking authority that its decision to set a single ceiling does not exceed.  Respondents' contention that the Commission's institution of the GFN process amounts to an acknowledgment of the unreasonableness of the new ceiling price is rejected, since there is nothing incompatible in the belief that a price is reasonable and the belief that it ought not to be imposed without prior negotiations.  An otherwise lawful rate should not be disallowed because additional safeguards accompany it.  Respondents' objection that no order ""deregulating"" the price of old gas can be deemed just and reasonable is also rejected, since Order No. 451 does not deregulate in any legally relevant sense, and it cannot be concluded that deregulation results simply because a given ceiling price may be above the market price.  Pp.  498 U. S. 221-226.
(b) Order No. 451's abandonment procedures fully comport with the requirements of  7(b) of the NGA, which, inter alia, prohibits a gas producer from abandoning its contractual service obligations to a purchaser unless the Commission has (1) granted its ""permission and approval"" of the abandonment; (2) made a ""finding"" that ""present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment"" and (3) held a ""hearing"" that is ""due.""  First, although Order No. 451's approval of the abandonment at issue is not specific to any single abandonment, but is instead general, prospective, and conditional, nothing in  7(b) prevents the Commission from giving advance approval or mandates individualized proceedings involving interested parties before a specific abandonment 
Page 498 U. S. 213
 can take place.  Second, in reviewing ""all relevant factors involved in determining the overall public interest,"" and in finding that preauthorized abandonment under the GFN regime would generally protect purchasers, safeguard producers, and serve the market by releasing previously unused reserves of old gas, the Commission made the necessary ""finding"" required by  7(b), which does not compel the agency to make ""specific findings"" with regard to every abandonment when the issues involved are general.  Finally, the Commission discharged its  7(b) duty to hold a ""due hearing,"" since, before promulgating Order No. 451, it held a notice and comment hearing and an oral hearing.  See, e.g., Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458,  461 U. S. 467.  United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. McCombs, 442 U. S. 529, distinguished.  Respondents cannot claim that the Commission made no provision for individual determinations under its abandonment procedures where appropriate, since Order No. 451 authorizes a purchaser objecting to a given abandonment on the grounds that the conditions the agency has set forth have not been met to file a complaint with the Commission.  Pp.  498 U. S. 226-229.
(c) The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the Commission had a duty to address the take-or-pay problem more fully in this proceeding.  The court clearly overshot its mark if it meant to order the Commission to resolve the problem, since an agency enjoys broad discretion in determining how best to handle related yet discrete issues in terms of procedures, and it is likely that the Commission's separate proceeding addressing the matter will generate relevant data more effectively.  The court likewise erred if it meant that the Commission should have addressed the take-or-pay problem insofar as Order No. 451 ""exacerbated"" it, since an agency need not solve every problem before it in the same proceeding, and the Commission has articulated rational grounds for concluding that the order would do more to ameliorate the problem than worsen it.  This Court is neither inclined nor prepared to second-guess the Commission's reasoned determination in this complex area.  Pp.  498 U. S. 229-231.
885 F.2d 209 (CA 5 1989), reversed.
WHITE, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except KENNEDY, J., who took no part in the decision of the case.

|498 u.s. 177|"In re Sindram
No. 90-6051
Decided Jan. 7, 1991
498 U.S. 177

PER CURIAM.
Pro se petitioner Sindram sought an extraordinary writ and permission to proceed in forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.  In the past three, years, he has filed 43 petitions and motions with the Court.  The legal bases offered in support of his request for extraordinary relief are identical to those presented in many of his prior petitions for certiorari or rehearing.
Held:  Sindram is denied in forma pauperis status in this and all future petitions for extraordinary relief, and the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions from him for such relief unless he pays the docketing fee required by this Court's Rule 38(a) and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.  On its face, his petition does not even remotely satisfy the requirements for issuance of an extraordinary writ.  Forcing the Court to devote its limited resources to processing frivolous and abusive petitions such as Sindram's compromises the goal of fairly dispensing justice.  Pro se petitioners, who are not subject to the financial considerations that deter other litigants from filing frivolous petitions, have a greater capacity than most to disrupt the fair allocation of judicial resources.  In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180,  489 U. S. 184.  The risk of abuse is particularly acute with respect to applications for extraordinary relief, which are not subject to any time limitations.  Sindram remains free to file in forma pauperis requests for relief other than an extraordinary wit if he qualifies under Rule 39 and does not similarly abuse that privilege.
Motion denied.
