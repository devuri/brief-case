02-682||"VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICES OF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLP
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 02682. Argued October 14, 2003Decided January 13, 2004
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 imposes upon an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) the obligation to share its telephone network with competitors, 47 U. S.C. 251(c), including the duty to provide access to individual network elements on an unbundled basis, see 251(c)(3).  New entrants, so-called competitive LECs, combine and resell these unbundled network elements (UNEs).  Petitioner Verizon Communications Inc., the incumbent LEC in New York State, has signed interconnection agreements with rivals such as AT&T, as 252 obliges it to do, detailing the terms on which it will make its network elements available.  Part of Verizons 251(c)(3) UNE obligation is the provision of access to operations support systems (OSS), without which a rival cannot fill its customers orders.  Verizons interconnection agreement, approved by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC), and its authorization to provide long-distance service, approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), each specified the mechanics by which its OSS obligation would be met.  When competitive LECs complained that Verizon was violating that obligation, the PSC and FCC opened parallel investigations, which led to the imposition of financial penalties, remediation measures, and additional reporting requirements on Verizon.  Respondent, a local telephone service customer of AT&T, then filed this class action alleging, inter alia, that Verizon had filled rivals orders on a discriminatory basis as part of an anticompetitive scheme to discourage customers from becoming or remaining customers of competitive LECs in violation of 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.C. 2.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that respondents allegations of deficient assistance to rivals failed to satisfy 2s requirements.  The Second Circuit reinstated the antitrust claim.
Held:Respondents complaint alleging breach of an incumbent LECs 1996 Act duty to share its network with competitors does not state a claim under 2 of the Sherman Act.  Pp.516.
(a)The 1996 Act has no effect upon the application of traditional antitrust principles.  Its saving clausewhich provides that nothing in this Act  shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws, 47 U. S.C. 152, notepreserves claims that satisfy established antitrust standards, but does not create new claims that go beyond those standards.  Pp.57.


(b)The activity of which respondent complains does not violate pre-existing antitrust standards.  The leading case imposing 2 liability for refusal to deal with competitors is Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, in which the Court concluded that the defendants termination of a voluntary agreement with the plaintiff suggested a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.  Aspen is at or near the outer boundary of 2 liability, and the present case does not fit within the limited exception it recognized.  Because the complaint does not allege that Verizon ever engaged in a voluntary course of dealing with its rivals, its prior conduct sheds no light upon whether its lapses from the legally compelled dealing were anticompetitive.  Moreover, the Aspen defendant turned down its competitors proposal to sell at its own retail price, suggesting a calculation that its future monopoly retail price would be higher, whereas Verizons reluctance to interconnect at the cost-based rate of compensation available under 251(c)(3) is uninformative.  More fundamentally, the Aspen defendant refused to provide its competitor with a product it already sold at retail, whereas here the unbundled elements offered pursuant to 251(c)(3) are not available to the public, but are provided to rivals under compulsion and at considerable expense.  The Courts conclusion would not change even if it considered to be established law the essential facilities doctrine crafted by some lower courts.  The indispensable requirement for invoking that doctrine is the unavailability of access to the essential facilities; where access exists, as it does here by virtue of the 1996 Act, the doctrine serves no purpose.  Pp.711.


(c)Traditional antitrust principles do not justify adding the present case to the few existing exceptions from the proposition that there is no duty to aid competitors.  Antitrust analysis must always be attuned to the particular structure and circumstances of the industry at issue.  When there exists a regulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm, the additional benefit to competition provided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small, and it will be less plausible that the antitrust laws contemplate such additional scrutiny.  Here Verizon was subject to oversight by the FCC and the PSC, both of which agencies responded to the OSS failure raised in respondents complaint by imposing fines and other burdens on Verizon.  Against the slight benefits of antitrust intervention here must be weighed a realistic assessment of its costs.  Allegations of violations of 251(c)(3) duties are both technical and extremely numerous, and hence difficult for antitrust courts to evaluate.  Applying 2s requirements to this regime can readily result in false positive mistaken inferences that chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.  Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 594.  Pp.1116.
305 F.3d 89, reversed and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and OConnor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Souter and Thomas, JJ., joined.

|540 u.s. 366|"MARYLAND v. PRINGLE
certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland
No. 02809. Argued November 3, 2003Decided December 15, 2003
A police officer stopped a car for speeding at 3:16 a.m.; searched the car, seizing $763 from the glove compartment and cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest; and arrested the cars three occupants after they denied ownership of the drugs and money.  Respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine, and was sentenced to 10 years incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed, but the State Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringles knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when Pringle was a front-seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner was insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession.
Held:Because the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle, the arrest did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Maryland law authorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests, inter alia, where the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or is being committed in the officers presence.  Here, it is uncontested that the officer, upon recovering the suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed; the question is whether he had probable cause to believe Pringle committed that crime.  The substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 175, and that belief must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized, Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U. S. 85, 91.  To determine whether an officer had probable cause to make an arrest, a court must examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to probable cause.  Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696.  As it is an entirely reasonable inference from the facts here that any or all of the cars occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine, a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.  Pringles attempt to characterize this as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  Ybarra v. Illinois, supra, and United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, distinguished.  Pp. 38.

|540 u.s. 375|"CASTRO v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 026683. Argued October 15, 2003Decided December 15, 2003
In 1994, petitioner Castro attacked his federal drug conviction in a pro se motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.  The Government responded that the claims were more cognizable as federal habeas claims under 28 U. S.C. 2255.  The District Court denied Castros motion on the merits, referring to it as both a Rule 33 and a 2255 motion.  Castro did not challenge this recharacterization of his motion on his pro se appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit summarily affirmed.  In 1997, Castro, again pro se, filed a 2255 motion raising, inter alia, a new claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Eleventh Circuit remanded for the District Court to consider, among other things, whether this was Castros second 2255 motion.  The District Court appointed counsel, determined that the 1997 motion was indeed Castros second 2255 motion (the 1994 motion being his first), and dismissed the motion for failure to comply with 2255s requirement that Castro obtain the Court of Appeals permission to file a second or successive motion.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1.This Courts review of Castros claim is not barred by the requirement that the grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application  shall not be the subject of a [certiorari] petition, 28 U. S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E).  Castro nowhere asked the Eleventh Circuit to grant, and it nowhere denied, such authorization.  Contrary to the Governments position, the courts statement that Castros petition could not meet the requirements for second or successive petitions cannot be taken as a statutorily relevant denial of an authorization request not made.  Even accepting the Governments characterization, the argument would founder because the certiorari petitions subject is not the Eleventh Circuits authorization denial, but the lower courts refusal to recognize that this 2255 motion is Castros first.  Moreover, reading the statute as the Government suggests would create procedural anomalies, allowing review where the lower court decision disfavors, but denying review where it favors, the Government; would close this Courts doors to a class of habeas petitioners without any clear indication that such was Congress intent; and would be difficult to reconcile with the principle that this Court reads limitations on its jurisdiction narrowly.  Pp.35.


2.A federal court cannot recharacterize a pro se litigants motion as a first 2255 motion unless it first informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize, warns the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on second or successive motions, and provides the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the 2255 claims he believes he has.  If these warnings are not given, the motion cannot be considered to have become a 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the laws second or successive restrictions.  Nine Circuits have placed such limits on recharacterization, and no one here contests the lawfulness of this judicially created requirement.  Pp.57.


3.Because the District Court failed to give the prescribed warnings, Castros 1994 motion cannot be considered a first 2255 motion and his 1997 motion cannot be considered a second or successive one.  The Government argues that Castros failure to appeal the 1994 recharacterization makes the recharacterization valid as a matter of law of the case.  And, according to the Government, since the 1994 recharacterization is valid, the 1997 2255 motion is Castros second, not his first.  This Court disagrees.  The point of a warning is to help the pro se litigant understand not only (1) whether he should withdraw or amend his motion, but also (2) whether he should contest the recharacterization, say, on appeal.  The lack of warning prevents his making an informed judgment as to both.  The failure to appeal simply underscores the practical importance of providing the warning.  Hence, an unwarned recharacterization cannot count as a 2255 motion for purposes of the second or successive provision whether or not the unwarned pro se litigant takes an appeal.  Even assuming that the law of the case doctrine applies here, the doctrine simply expresses common judicial practice; it does not limit the courts power.  Pp.79.
290 F.3d 1270, vacated and remanded.

|540 u.s. 93|"McCONNELL, UNITED STATES SENATOR, et al. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION et al.
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 021674. Argued September 8, 2003Decided December 10, 2003
The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), the Communications Act of 1934, and other portions of the United States Code, is the most recent of nearly a century of federal enactments designed to purge national politics of what [is] conceived to be the pernicious influence of big money campaign contributions.  United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 572.  In enacting BCRA, Congress sought to address three important developments in the years since this Courts landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam):the increased importance of soft money, the proliferation of issue ads, and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections.


With regard to the first development, prior to BCRA, FECAs disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations extended only to so-called hard money contributions made for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office.  Political parties and candidates were able to circumvent FECAs limitations by contributing soft moneymoney as yet unregulated under FECAto be used for activities intended to influence state or local elections; for mixed-purpose activities such as get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives and generic party advertising; and for legislative advocacy advertisements, even if they mentioned a federal candidates name, so long as the ads did not expressly advocate the candidates election or defeat.  With regard to the second development, parties and candidates circumvented FECA by using issue ads that were specifically intended to affect election results, but did not contain magic words, such as Vote Against Jane Doe, which would have subjected the ads to FECAs restrictions.  Those developments were detailed in a 1998 Senate Committee Report summarizing an investigation into the 1996 federal elections, which concluded that the soft-money loophole had led to a meltdown of the campaign finance system; and discussed potential reforms, including a soft-money ban and restrictions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups.


Congress enacted many of the committees proposals in BCRA: Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates; Title II primarily prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for communications that are intended to, or have the effect of, influencing federal election outcomes; and Titles III, IV, and V set out other requirements.  Eleven actions challenging BCRAs constitutionality were filed.  A three-judge District Court held some parts of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others.  The parties challenging the law are referred to here as plaintiffs, and those who intervened in support of the law are intervenor-defendants.
Held:The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  
251 F.Supp. 2d 176, 251 F.Supp. 2d 948, affirmed in part and reversed in part.  
Justice Stevens and Justice OConnor delivered the Courts opinion with respect to BCRA Titles I and II, concluding that the statutes two principal, complementary featuresCongress effort to plug the soft-money loophole and its regulation of electioneering communicationsmust be upheld in the main.  Pp. 23118.


1.New FECA 323 survives plaintiffs facial First Amendment challenge.  Pp. 2377.


(a)In evaluating 323, the Court applies the less rigorous standard of review applicable to campaign contribution limits under Buckley and its progeny.  Such limits are subject only to closely drawn scrutiny, see 424  U. S., at 25, rather than to strict scrutiny, because, unlike restrictions on campaign expenditures, contribution limits entai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributors ability to engage in free communication, e.g., id., at 2021.  Moreover, contribution limits are grounded in the important governmental interests in preventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.  E.g., Federal Election Commn v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 208.  The less rigorous review standard shows proper deference to Congress ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise, and provides it with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the political process integrity.  Finally, because Congress, in its lengthy deliberations leading to BCRAs enactment, properly relied on Buckley and its progeny, stare decisis considerations, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits the Court has consistently followed since Buckley.  The Court rejects plaintiffs argument that the type of speech and associational burdens that 323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied Buckleys contribution limits.  Pp. 2432.


(b)New FECA 323(a)which forbids national party committees and their agents to solicit, receive,  direct  , or spend any funds  that are not subject to [FECAs] limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(a)(1), (2)does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp. 3252.


(1)The governmental interest underlying 323(a)preventing the actual or apparent corruption of federal candidates and officeholdersconstitutes a sufficiently important interest to justify contribution limits.  That interest is not limited to the elimination of quid pro quo, cash-for-votes exchanges, see Buckley, supra, at 28, but extends also to undue influence on an officeholders judgment, and the appearance of such influence, Federal Election Commn v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 441 (Colorado II).  These interests are sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves, but also laws preventing the circumvention of such limits.  Id., at 456.  While the quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments varies with the novelty or plausibility of the justification raised, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 391, the idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible, see, e.g., Buckley, supra, at 38.  There is substantial evidence in these cases to support Congress determination that such contributions of soft money give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.  For instance, the record is replete with examples of national party committees peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations.  Pp. 3245.


(2)Section 323(a) is not impermissibly overbroad because it subjects all funds raised and spent by national parties to FECAs hard-money source and amount limits, including, e.g., funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.  The record demonstrates that the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship, have made all large soft-money contributions to national parties suspect, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.  The Governments strong interests in preventing corruption, and particularly its appearance, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to FECAs source, amount, and disclosure limitations.  Pp. 4547.


(3)Nor is 323(a)s prohibition on national parties soliciting or directing soft-money contributions substantially overbroad.  That prohibitions reach is limited, in that it bars only soft-money solicitations by national party committees and party officers acting in their official capacities; the committees themselves remain free to solicit hard money on their own behalf or that of state committees and state and local candidates and to contribute hard money to state committees and candidates.  Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that the solicitation bans overbreadth is demonstrated by 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited amounts of soft money from individual donors under certain circumstances.  The differences between 323(a) and 323(e) are without constitutional significance, see National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210, reflecting Congress reasonable and expert judgments about national committees functions and their interactions with officeholders.  Pp. 4748.


(4)Section 323(a) is not substantially overbroad with respect to the speech and associational rights of minor parties, even though the latter may have slim prospects for electoral success.  It is reasonable to require that all parties and candidates follow the same rules designed to protect the electoral processs integrity.  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 3435.  A nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if 323(a) prevents it from amassing the resources necessary to engage in effective advocacy.  Id., at 21.  Pp. 4851.


(5)Plaintiffs argument that 323(a) unconstitutionally interferes with the ability of national committees to associate with state and local committees is unpersuasive because it hinges on an unnaturally broad reading of the statutory terms spend, receive, direct, and solicit.  Nothing on 323(a)s face prohibits national party officers from sitting down with state and local party committees or candidates to plan and advise how to raise and spend soft money, so long as the national officers do not personally spend, receive, direct, or solicit soft money.  Pp. 5152.


(c)On its face, new FECA 323(b)which prohibits state and local party committees from using soft money for activities affecting federal elections, 2 U. S.C.A. 442i(b)is closely drawn to match the important governmental interest of preventing corruption and its appearance.  Pp. 5266.


(1)Recognizing that the close ties between federal candidates and state party committees would soon render 323(a)s anticorruption measures ineffective if state and local committees remained available as a conduit for soft-money donations, Congress designed 323(b) to prevent donors from contributing nonfederal funds to such committees to help finance Federal election activity, which is defined to encompass (1) voter registration activity during the 120 days before a federal election; (2) voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity conducted in connection with an election in which a [federal] candidate  appears on the ballot; (3) any public communication that refers to a clearly identified [federal] candidate and promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes such a candidate; and (4) the services of a state committee employee who dedicates more than 25% of his or her compensated time to activities in connection with a Federal election, 2 U. S.C.A. 431(20)(A)(iiv).  All activities that fall within this definition must be funded with hard money.  441i(b)(1).  The Levin Amendment carves out an exception to this general rule, allowing state and local party committees to pay for certain federal election activitiesnamely, activities falling within categories (1) and (2) above that either do not refer to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office, or, if they involve broadcast communications, refer solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office, 441i(b)(2)(B)(i)(ii)with an allocated ratio of hard money and so-called Levin funds.  Levin funds are subject only to state regulation, but for two additional restrictions.  First, no contributor can donate more than $10,000 per year to a single committees Levin account.  441i(b)(2)(B)(iii).  Second, both Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money to pay for such activities must be raised by the state or local committee that spends them, though the committee can team up with other national, state, or local committees to solicit the hard-money portion.  441i(b)(2)(B)(iv), 441i(b)(2)(C).  Pp. 5255.


(2)In addressing soft-money contributions to state committees, Congress both drew a conclusion and made a prediction.  It concluded from the record that soft moneys corrupting influence insinuates itself into the political process not only through national party committees, but also through state committees, which function as an alternate avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.  Indeed, the evidence shows that both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached their direct contribution limit to donate to state committees.  Congress reasonable prediction, based on the history of campaign finance regulation, was that donors would react to 323(a) by directing soft-money contributions to state committees for the purpose of influencing federal candidates and elections, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties.  Preventing corrupting activity from shifting wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating FECA clearly qualifies as an important governmental interest.  Pp. 5557.


(3)Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that, even if 323(b) serves a legitimate interest, its restrictions are so unjustifiably burdensome and overbroad that they cannot be considered closely drawn to match the Governments objectives.  Pp. 5766.


(i)Section 323(b) is not substantially overbroad.  Although 323(b) captures some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices, these are the same activities that were covered by the FECs pre-BCRA allocation rules, and so had to be funded in part by hard money because they affected both federal and state elections.  As a practical matter, BCRA merely codifies the FECs allocation regime principles while justifiably adjusting the applicable formulas in order to restore the efficacy of FECAs longstanding restriction on contributions to state and local committees for the purpose of influencing federal elections.  By limiting its reach to Federal election activities, 323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that directly benefit federal candidates and thus pose the greatest risk of corruption or its appearance.  The first two categories of Federal election activityvoter registration efforts and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal electionclearly capture activities that confer a substantial benefit on federal candidates by getting like-minded voters to the polls.  If a voter registration drive does not specifically mention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendments higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions.  Moreover, because the record demonstrates abundantly that the third category of Federal election activity, public communication[s] that promote or attack a federal candidate, directly affects the election in which that candidate is participating, application of 323(b)s contribution caps to such communications is closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.  Finally, Congress interest in preventing circumvention of 323(b)s other restrictions justifies the requirement of the fourth category of Federal election activity that federal funds be used to pay any state or local party employee who spends more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities connected with a federal election.  Pp. 5863.


(ii)The Levin Amendment does not unjustifiably burden association among party committees by forbidding transfers of Levin funds among state parties, transfers of hard money to fund the allocable federal portion of Levin expenditures, and joint fundraising of Levin funds by state parties.  While preserving parties associational freedom is important, not every minor restriction on parties otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension.  See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.  Given the delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme at issue here, any associational burdens imposed by the Levin Amendment restrictions are far outweighed by the need to prevent circumvention of the entire scheme.  Pp. 6365.


(iii)The evidence supporting the argument that the Levin Amendment prevents parties from amassing the resources needed to engage in effective advocacy is speculative.  The history of campaign finance regulation proves that political parties are extraordinarily flexible in adapting to new restrictions on their fundraising abilities.  Moreover, the mere fact that 323(b) may reduce the money available to state and local parties to fund federal election activities is largely inconsequential.  The question is not whether the amount available over previous election cycles is reduced, but whether the reduction is so radical as to drive the sound of the recipients voice below the level of notice.  Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 397.  If state or local parties can make such a showing, as-applied challenges remain available.  Pp. 6566.


(d)New FECA 323(d)which forbids national, state, and local party committees and their agents to solicit any funds for, or make or direct any donations to 501(c) tax exempt organizations that make expenditures in connection with a federal election, and to 527 political organizations other than a political committee, a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or the authorized campaign committee of a candidate for State or local office, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(d)is not facially invalid.  Pp. 6673.


(1)Section 323(d)s restriction on solicitations is a valid anti-circumvention measure.  Absent this provision, national, state, and local party committees would have significant incentives to mobilize their formidable fundraising apparatuses, including the peddling of access to federal officeholders, into the service of like-minded tax-exempt organizations that conduct activities benefiting their candidates.  All of the corruption and the appearance of corruption attendant on the operation of those fundraising apparatuses would follow.  Plaintiffs argument that 323(d)s solicitations ban cannot be squared with 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations engaged in federal election activities, is not persuasive.  If 323(d)s solicitation restriction is otherwise valid, it is not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have.  See National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210.  Furthermore, the difference between the two provisions is explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, remain free to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities.  Given 323(e)s tight content, source, and amount restrictions on soft-money solicitations by federal candidates and officeholders, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, 323(e)s greater solicitation allowances do not render 323(d)s solicitation restriction facially invalid.  Pp. 6771.


(2)Section 323(d)s restriction on donations to qualifying 501(c) or 527 organizations is a valid anticircumvention measure insofar as it prohibits donations of funds not already raised in compliance with FECA.  Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectlyraising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities.  Although the ban raises overbreadth concerns if read to restrict donations from a partys federal accounti.e., funds already raised in compliance with FECAs source, amount, and disclosure limitationsthese concerns do not require that the facial challenge be sustained, given this Courts obligation to construe a statute, if possible, in such a way as to avoid constitutional questions, see, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62.  Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Congress intended donations to include donations from a partys hard-money account, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, the Court narrowly construes 323(d)s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.  Pp. 7173.


(e)New FECA 323(e)which, with many exceptions, forbids federal candidates and officeholders to solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend soft money in connection with federal elections, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(e)(1)(A), and limits their ability to do so for state and local elections, 441i(e)(1)(B)does not violate the First Amendment.  No party seriously questions the constitutionality of the general ban on soft-money donations directly to federal candidates and officeholders and their agents.  By severing the most direct link to the soft-money donor, the ban is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  The solicitation restrictions are valid anticircumvention measures.  Even before BCRAs passage, federal candidates and officeholders solicited donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their partys, electoral cause.  See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 458.  The incentives to do so will only increase with Title Is restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money by national, state, and local parties.  Section 323(e) addresses these concerns while accommodating the individual speech and associational rights of federal candidates and officeholders.  Pp. 7477.


(f)New FECA 323(f)which forbids state and local candidates or officeholders to raise and spend soft money to fund ads and other public communications that promote or attack federal candidates, 2 U. S.C. 442i(f)is a valid anticircumvention provision.  The section places no cap on the funds that such candidates can spend on any activity, but, rather, limits only the source and amount of contributions that they can draw on to fund expenditures that directly impact federal elections.  And, by regulating only contributions used to fund public communications, the section focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. Plaintiffs principal arguments against the section(1) that the definition of public communications as communications that support or attack a clearly identified federal candidate is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) that soft-money contributions to state and local candidates for public communications do not corrupt or appear to corrupt federal candidatesare rejected.  Pp. 7778.


2.Several plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that BCRA Title I exceeds Congress Election Clause authority to make or alter rules governing federal elections, U. S. Const., Art. I, 4, and violates constitutional federalism principles by impairing the States authority to regulate their own elections.  In examining federal Acts for Tenth Amendment infirmity, the Court focuses on whether States and state officials are commandeered to carry out federal regulatory schemes.  See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898.  By contrast, Title I only regulates private parties conduct, imposing no requirements upon States or state officials.  And, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, Title I leaves States free to enforce their own restrictions on state electoral campaign financing.  Moreover, while this Court has policed the absolute boundaries of Congress Article I power, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA.  Indeed, as already found, Title I is closely drawn to match Congress important interest in preventing the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  That interest is sufficient to ground Congress exercise of its Elections Clause power.  Pp. 7980.


3.Also rejected is the argument that BCRA Title I violates equal protection by discriminating against political parties in favor of special interest groups, which remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications).  First, BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways, e.g., by allowing party committees to receive individual contributions substantially exceeding FECA limits on contributions to nonparty political committees.  More importantly, Congress is fully entitled to consider the salient, real-world differences between parties and interest groups when crafting a campaign finance regulation system, see National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210, including the fact that parties have influence and power in the legislature vastly exceeding any interest groups.  Taken seriously, plaintiffs equal protection arguments would call into question not just BCRA Title I, but much of FECAs pre-existing structure.  Pp. 8285.


4.Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed insofar as it upheld 323(e) and 323(f) and reversed insofar as it invalidated 323(a), 323(b), and 323(d).  P. 82.


5.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the disclosure requirements in amended FECA 304 and rejected the facial attack on the provisions relating to donors of $1,000 or more, but reversed to the extent that it invalidated FECA 304(f)(5).  Pp. 8295.


(a)BCRA 201 comprehensively amends FECA 304, which requires political committees to file detailed periodic financial reports with the FEC.  The narrowing construction adopted in Buckley limited FECAs disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.  BCRA adopts a new term, electioneering communication, which encompasses any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that clearly identifies a candidate for federal office, airs within a specific time period (e.g., within 60 days of a general election and 30 days of a primary), and is targeted to the relevant electorate.  2 U. S.C.A. 434(f)(3)(A)(i).  BCRA also amends 304 to provide disclosure requirements for persons who fund electioneering communications (and BCRA 203 amends FECA 316(b)(2) to extend those requirements to corporations and labor unions).


Plaintiffs challenge the new terms constitutionality as it applies to both disclosures and expenditures, arguing primarily that Buckley drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers have an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.  However, a plain reading of Buckley and Federal Election Commn v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (MCFL), shows that the express advocacy restriction is a product of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional command.  Both the concept of express advocacy and the class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional problems of vagueness and overbreadth in the statute before the Buckley Court.  Consistent with the principle that a constitutional rule should never be formulated more broadly than required by the facts to which it is to be applied, Buckley and MCFL were specific to the statutory language before the Court and in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.  The notion that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express and issue advocacy also cannot be squared with this Courts longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.  Buckleys express advocacy line has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found.  Finally, because the components of new FECA 304(f)(3)s definition of electioneering communication are both easily understood and objectively determinable, the vagueness objection that persuaded the Buckley Court to limit FECAs reach to express advocacy is inapposite here.  Pp. 8288.


(b)With regard to plaintiffs other concerns about the use of the phrase electioneering communication, the District Court correctly rejected their submission that new FECA 304 unnecessarily requires disclosure of the names of persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the individual or group paying for the communication, but erred in finding 304(f)(5) invalid because it mandates disclosure of executory contracts for communications that have not yet aired.  Because the important state interests identified in Buckleyproviding the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding its appearance, and gathering data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictionsapply in full to BCRA, Buckley amply supports application of FECA 304s disclosure requirements to the entire range of electioneering communications.  Buckley also forecloses a facial attack on the new 304 provision that requires disclosure of the names of persons who contribute $1,000 or more to segregated funds or spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications.  Under Buckleys standard of proof, the evidence here did not establish the requisite reasonable probability of harm to any plaintiff group or its members resulting from compelled disclosure.  However, the rejection of this facial challenge does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that disclosure requirement.


This Court is also unpersuaded by plaintiffs challenge to new FECA 304(f)(5)s requirement regarding the disclosure of executory contracts.  The new provision mandates disclosure only when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.  Given the relatively short time frames in which such communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made in time to provide relevant information to voters is significant.  Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole without the advance disclosure requirement, for political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures about ads slated to run during a campaigns final weeks simply by making a preelection downpayment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election.  The record contains little evidence of any harm that might flow from the requirements enforcement, and the District Courts speculation about such harm cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place.  Pp. 8895.


6.The District Courts judgment is affirmed insofar as it held that plaintiffs advanced no basis for finding unconstitutional BCRA 202, which amends FECA 315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for electioneering communications that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party, 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a)(7)(C).  That provision clarifies the scope of 315(a)(7)(B), which provides that expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or party constitute contributions.  BCRA pre-empts a possible claim that the term expenditure in 315(a)(7)(B) is limited to spending for express advocacy.  Because Buckleys narrow interpretation of that term was only a statutory limitation on Congress power to regulate federal elections, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats other coordinated expenditures.  Pp. 9697.


7.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of new FECA 316(b)(2), and reversed to the extent that it invalidated any part of that section.  BCRA 203 extends to all electioneering communications FECA 316(b)(2)s restrictions on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds.  2 U. S.C.A. 441b(b)(2).  Because those entities may still organize and administer segregated funds, or PACs, for such communications, the provision is a regulation of, not a ban on, expression.  Beaumont, 539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  This Courts consideration of plaintiffs claim that the expanded regulation is both overinclusive and underinclusive is informed by the conclusion that the distinction between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled.  Thus, the Court examines the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluates whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden.  Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving that new FECA 316(b)(2) is overbroad.  They argue that the justifications that adequately support regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the electioneering communications definition.  That argument fails to the extent that issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for regulating express advocacy apply equally to those ads if they have an electioneering purpose, which the vast majority do.  Also rejected is plaintiffs argument that new FECA 316(b)(2)s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive because it does not apply to print or Internet advertising.  The record here reflects that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the relevant period.  Congress justifiably concluded that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money.  Finally, 304(f)(3)(B)(i), which excludes news items and commentary from the electioneering communications definition, is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles as applied to the media.  Pp. 97103.


8.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld new FECA 316(c)(6), as limited to nonprofit entities that are not so-called MCFL organizations.  BCRA 204, which adds 316(c)(6), 2 U. S.C.A. 441b(c)(2), extends to nonprofit corporations the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications.  This Court upheld a similar restriction in Beaumont, supra, except as it applied to organizations that are formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, have no shareholders, are not established by a business corporation or labor union, and do not accept contributions from those entities, MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  The same constitutional objection to applying the pre-BCRA restrictions to such organizations necessarily applies with equal force to FECA 316(c)(6).  That 316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt MCFL organizations is not a sufficient reason to invalidate it.  This Court presumes that the legislators were fully aware that the provision could not apply to MCFL-type entities, and the Government concedes that it does not.  As so construed, the provision is plainly valid.  Pp. 103106.


9.Because this Court has already found BCRA 201s executory contract disclosure requirement constitutional, plaintiffs challenge to a similar disclosure requirement in BCRA 212, which added FECA 304(g), 2 U. S.C.A. 434, is essentially moot.  Pp. 106107.


10.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it invalidated BCRA 213, which amends FECA 315(d)(4) to require political parties to choose between coordinated and independent expenditures during the postnomination, preelection period.  2 U. S.C.A. 441a(d)(4).  That provision places an unconstitutional burden on the parties right to make unlimited independent expenditures.  Although the category of burdened speech is limited to independent expenditures for express advocacyand therefore is relatively smallit plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection.  The governmental interest in requiring parties to avoid using magic words is not sufficient to support the burden imposed by 315(d)(4).  The fact that the provision is cast as a choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures does not make it constitutional.  Pp. 107114.


11.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it rejected plaintiffs challenges to BCRA 214, which adds FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(ii), 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a)(7)(b)(ii).  FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(i) long has provided that expenditures that are controlled by or coordinated with a candidate will be treated as contributions to the candidate.  BCRA 214(a) extends that rule to expenditures coordinated with political parties; and 214 (b) and (c) direct the FEC to promulgate new regulations that do not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination, 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a) note.  FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is not overbroad simply because it permits a finding of coordination in the absence of a pre-existing agreement.  Congress has always treated expenditures made after a wink or nod as coordinated.  Nor does the absence of an agreement requirement render 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague.  An agreement has never been required under 315(a)(7)(B)(i), which uses precisely the same language as the new provision to address coordination with candidates, and which has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades.  Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that that the definition has chilled political speech, and have made no attempt to explain how an agreement requirement would prevent the FEC from engaging in what they fear will be intrusive and politically motivated investigations.  Finally, in this facial challenge to BCRA, plaintiffs challenge to 214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that they allege constitutional infirmities in the FECs new regulations rather than the statute.  Pp. 114119.


The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to miscellaneous BCRA Title III and IV provisions, concluding that the District Courts judgment with respect to these provisions must be affirmed.  Pp.211.


1.The plaintiffs challenges to BCRA 305, 307, and the millionaire provisions are nonjusticiable.  Pp.28.


(a)The McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA 305, which amends the federal Communications Act of 1934 requirement that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, broadcast stations sell air time to a qualified candidate at their lowest unit charge, 47 U. S.C. 315(b).  Section 305s amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that charge in specified circumstances.  47 U. S.C.A. 315(b)(2)(A), (C).  Senator McConnells testimony that he plans to run ads critical of his opponents and had run them in the past is too remote temporally to satisfy the Article III standing requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate an injury in fact that is actual or imminent, Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155, 158, given that the lowest unit charge requirement is not available until 45 days before a primary, that Senator McConnells current term does not expire until 2009, and that, therefore, the earliest day he could be affected by 305 is 45 days before the 2008 Republican primary election.  Pp.24.


(b)The Adams and Paul plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA 307, which amends FECA 315(a)(1) to increase and index for inflation certain contribution limits.  Neither injury alleged by the Adams plaintiffs, a group of voters, voter organizations, and candidates, is sufficient to confer standing.  First, their assertion that 307 deprives them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status does not satisfy the standing requirement that a plaintiffs alleged injury be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560, since political free trade does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257.  Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates contention that 307 puts them at a fundraising disadvantage compared to their opponents because they do not wish to solicit or accept the large campaign contributions BCRA permits does not meet the standing requirement that their alleged injury be fairly traceable to 307, see Lujan, supra, at 562, since their alleged inability to compete stems not from 307s operation, but from their own personal choice not to solicit or accept large contributions.  Also inadequate for standing purposes is the Paul plaintiffs contention that their congressional campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities, such that 307s contribution limits, together with FECA 315s individual and PAC contribution limitations, impose unconstitutional editorial control on them in violation of the First Amendments Freedom of the Press Clause.  These plaintiffs cannot show the requisite substantial likelihood their requested relief will remedy their alleged injury in fact, see Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 771, since, even if the Court were to strike down BCRA 307s increases and indexes, as they ask, both FECAs contribution limits and an exemption for institutional news media would remain unchanged.  Pp.48.


(c)The Adams plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the so-called millionaire provisions, BCRA 304, 315, and 316, which provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidates opponent spends a triggering amount of his personal funds, and eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances.  Because these plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA 307, they fail to state a cognizable injury that is fairly traceable to BCRA.  Additionally, none of them is a candidate in an election affected by the millionaire provisions, and it would be purely conjectural to assume that any of them ever will be.  P.8.


2.The District Courts decision upholding BCRA 311s expansion of FECA 318(a) to include mandatory electioneering-communications-disbursements disclosure is affirmed because such inclusion bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of shed[ding] the light of publicity on campaign financing, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 81.  Assuming, as the Court must, that FECA 318 is valid both to begin with and as amended by BCRA 311s amendments other than the electioneering-communications inclusion, the latter inclusion is not itself unconstitutional.  P.9.


3.BCRA 318which forbids individuals 17 years old or younger to make contributions to candidates and political parties, 2 U. S.C.A. 441kviolates the First Amendment rights of minors, see, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511513.  Because limitations on an individuals political contributions impinge on the freedoms of expression and association, see Buckley, 424 U. S., at 2022, the Court applies heightened scrutiny to such a limitation, asking whether it is justified by a sufficiently important interest and closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of the First Amendment, see e.g., post, at 2526 (joint opinion of Stevens and OConnor, JJ.).  The Government offers scant evidence for its assertion that 318 protects against corruption by conduiti.e., donations by parents through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents.  Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for 318 to withstand heightened scrutiny.  See Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 391.  Even assuming, arguendo, the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive, as shown by the States adoption of more tailored approaches.  Pp.911.


4.Because the FEC clearly has standing, the Court need not address whether the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FECs, were properly granted intervention pursuant to, inter alia, BCRA 403(b).  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 431432, n.19.  P.11.


Justice Breyer delivered the Courts opinion with respect to BCRA Title V504 of which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require broadcasters to keep publicly available records of politically related broadcasting requests, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)concluding that the portion of the judgment below invalidating 504 as facially violative of the First Amendment must be reversed.  Pp.215.


1.Section 504s candidate request requirementswhich call for broadcasters to keep records of broadcast requests made by or on behalf of any  candidate, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(A)are upheld.  They are virtually identical to those contained in a longstanding FCC regulation.  The McConnell plaintiffs argument that the requirements are intolerably burdensome and invasive is rejected.  The FCC has consistently estimated that its regulation imposes upon a licensee a comparatively small additional administrative burden.  Moreover, the 504 requirement is supported by significant governmental interests in verifying that licensees comply with their obligations to allow political candidates equal time, 47 U. S.C. 315(a), and to sell such time at the lowest unit charge, 315(b); in evaluating whether they are processing candidate requests in an evenhanded fashion to help assure broadcasting fairness, 315(a); in making the public aware of how much candidates spend on broadcast messages; 2 U. S.C.A. 434; and in providing an independently compiled set of data for verifying candidates compliance with BCRAs and FECAs disclosure requirements and source limitations, ibid.  Because the Court cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, it cannot strike down BCRA 504s candidate request provision, which simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.  Pp.37.


2.Because 504s candidate request requirements are constitutional, its election message requirementswhich serve similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden in requiring broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast message[s] that refer either to a legally qualified candidate or to any election to Federal office, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii)must be constitutional as well.  Pp.89.


3.BCRA 504s issue request requirementswhich call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast message[s] related to a national legislative issue of public importance, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or a political matter of national importance, 315(e)(1)(B)survive the McConnell plaintiffs facial challenge.  These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help determine whether broadcasters are fulfilling their obligations under the FCCs regulations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on important public issues or whether they too heavily favor entertainment, discriminating against public affairs broadcasts.  The plaintiffs claim that the above-quoted statutory language is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad is unpersuasive, given that it is no more general than language Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters and is roughly comparable to other BCRA language upheld in this litigation.  Whether the issue request requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies them.  The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCCs regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Without the greater information any such challenge will likely provide, the Court cannot say that the provisions administrative burdens are so great, or their justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding them facially unconstitutional.  Similarly, the argument that the issue request requirement will force the purchasers to disclose information revealing their political strategies to opponents does not show that BCRA 504 is facially unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when 504 is applied.  Pp.912.

			"|"McCONNELL, UNITED STATES SENATOR, et al. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION et al.
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 021674. Argued September 8, 2003Decided December 10, 2003
The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), the Communications Act of 1934, and other portions of the United States Code, is the most recent of nearly a century of federal enactments designed to purge national politics of what [is] conceived to be the pernicious influence of big money campaign contributions.  United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567, 572.  In enacting BCRA, Congress sought to address three important developments in the years since this Courts landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam):the increased importance of soft money, the proliferation of issue ads, and the disturbing findings of a Senate investigation into campaign practices related to the 1996 federal elections.


With regard to the first development, prior to BCRA, FECAs disclosure requirements and source and amount limitations extended only to so-called hard money contributions made for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office.  Political parties and candidates were able to circumvent FECAs limitations by contributing soft moneymoney as yet unregulated under FECAto be used for activities intended to influence state or local elections; for mixed-purpose activities such as get-out-the-vote (GOTV) drives and generic party advertising; and for legislative advocacy advertisements, even if they mentioned a federal candidates name, so long as the ads did not expressly advocate the candidates election or defeat.  With regard to the second development, parties and candidates circumvented FECA by using issue ads that were specifically intended to affect election results, but did not contain magic words, such as Vote Against Jane Doe, which would have subjected the ads to FECAs restrictions.  Those developments were detailed in a 1998 Senate Committee Report summarizing an investigation into the 1996 federal elections, which concluded that the soft-money loophole had led to a meltdown of the campaign finance system; and discussed potential reforms, including a soft-money ban and restrictions on sham issue advocacy by nonparty groups.


Congress enacted many of the committees proposals in BCRA: Title I regulates the use of soft money by political parties, officeholders, and candidates; Title II primarily prohibits corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for communications that are intended to, or have the effect of, influencing federal election outcomes; and Titles III, IV, and V set out other requirements.  Eleven actions challenging BCRAs constitutionality were filed.  A three-judge District Court held some parts of BCRA unconstitutional and upheld others.  The parties challenging the law are referred to here as plaintiffs, and those who intervened in support of the law are intervenor-defendants.
Held:The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  
251 F.Supp. 2d 176, 251 F.Supp. 2d 948, affirmed in part and reversed in part.  
Justice Stevens and Justice OConnor delivered the Courts opinion with respect to BCRA Titles I and II, concluding that the statutes two principal, complementary featuresCongress effort to plug the soft-money loophole and its regulation of electioneering communicationsmust be upheld in the main.  Pp. 23118.


1.New FECA 323 survives plaintiffs facial First Amendment challenge.  Pp. 2377.


(a)In evaluating 323, the Court applies the less rigorous standard of review applicable to campaign contribution limits under Buckley and its progeny.  Such limits are subject only to closely drawn scrutiny, see 424  U. S., at 25, rather than to strict scrutiny, because, unlike restrictions on campaign expenditures, contribution limits entai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributors ability to engage in free communication, e.g., id., at 2021.  Moreover, contribution limits are grounded in the important governmental interests in preventing both the actual corruption threatened by large financial contributions and the eroding of public confidence in the electoral process through the appearance of corruption.  E.g., Federal Election Commn v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197, 208.  The less rigorous review standard shows proper deference to Congress ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise, and provides it with sufficient room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the political process integrity.  Finally, because Congress, in its lengthy deliberations leading to BCRAs enactment, properly relied on Buckley and its progeny, stare decisis considerations, buttressed by the respect that the Legislative and Judicial Branches owe one another, provide additional powerful reasons for adhering to the analysis of contribution limits the Court has consistently followed since Buckley.  The Court rejects plaintiffs argument that the type of speech and associational burdens that 323 imposes are fundamentally different from the burdens that accompanied Buckleys contribution limits.  Pp. 2432.


(b)New FECA 323(a)which forbids national party committees and their agents to solicit, receive,  direct  , or spend any funds  that are not subject to [FECAs] limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(a)(1), (2)does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp. 3252.


(1)The governmental interest underlying 323(a)preventing the actual or apparent corruption of federal candidates and officeholdersconstitutes a sufficiently important interest to justify contribution limits.  That interest is not limited to the elimination of quid pro quo, cash-for-votes exchanges, see Buckley, supra, at 28, but extends also to undue influence on an officeholders judgment, and the appearance of such influence, Federal Election Commn v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, 441 (Colorado II).  These interests are sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves, but also laws preventing the circumvention of such limits.  Id., at 456.  While the quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments varies with the novelty or plausibility of the justification raised, Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 391, the idea that large contributions to a national party can corrupt or create the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders is neither novel nor implausible, see, e.g., Buckley, supra, at 38.  There is substantial evidence in these cases to support Congress determination that such contributions of soft money give rise to corruption and the appearance of corruption.  For instance, the record is replete with examples of national party committees peddling access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large soft-money donations.  Pp. 3245.


(2)Section 323(a) is not impermissibly overbroad because it subjects all funds raised and spent by national parties to FECAs hard-money source and amount limits, including, e.g., funds spent on purely state and local elections in which no federal office is at stake.  The record demonstrates that the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties, as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship, have made all large soft-money contributions to national parties suspect, regardless of how those funds are ultimately used.  The Governments strong interests in preventing corruption, and particularly its appearance, are thus sufficient to justify subjecting all donations to national parties to FECAs source, amount, and disclosure limitations.  Pp. 4547.


(3)Nor is 323(a)s prohibition on national parties soliciting or directing soft-money contributions substantially overbroad.  That prohibitions reach is limited, in that it bars only soft-money solicitations by national party committees and party officers acting in their official capacities; the committees themselves remain free to solicit hard money on their own behalf or that of state committees and state and local candidates and to contribute hard money to state committees and candidates.  Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that the solicitation bans overbreadth is demonstrated by 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited amounts of soft money from individual donors under certain circumstances.  The differences between 323(a) and 323(e) are without constitutional significance, see National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210, reflecting Congress reasonable and expert judgments about national committees functions and their interactions with officeholders.  Pp. 4748.


(4)Section 323(a) is not substantially overbroad with respect to the speech and associational rights of minor parties, even though the latter may have slim prospects for electoral success.  It is reasonable to require that all parties and candidates follow the same rules designed to protect the electoral processs integrity.  Buckley, 424 U. S., at 3435.  A nascent or struggling minor party can bring an as-applied challenge if 323(a) prevents it from amassing the resources necessary to engage in effective advocacy.  Id., at 21.  Pp. 4851.


(5)Plaintiffs argument that 323(a) unconstitutionally interferes with the ability of national committees to associate with state and local committees is unpersuasive because it hinges on an unnaturally broad reading of the statutory terms spend, receive, direct, and solicit.  Nothing on 323(a)s face prohibits national party officers from sitting down with state and local party committees or candidates to plan and advise how to raise and spend soft money, so long as the national officers do not personally spend, receive, direct, or solicit soft money.  Pp. 5152.


(c)On its face, new FECA 323(b)which prohibits state and local party committees from using soft money for activities affecting federal elections, 2 U. S.C.A. 442i(b)is closely drawn to match the important governmental interest of preventing corruption and its appearance.  Pp. 5266.


(1)Recognizing that the close ties between federal candidates and state party committees would soon render 323(a)s anticorruption measures ineffective if state and local committees remained available as a conduit for soft-money donations, Congress designed 323(b) to prevent donors from contributing nonfederal funds to such committees to help finance Federal election activity, which is defined to encompass (1) voter registration activity during the 120 days before a federal election; (2) voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activity conducted in connection with an election in which a [federal] candidate  appears on the ballot; (3) any public communication that refers to a clearly identified [federal] candidate and promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes such a candidate; and (4) the services of a state committee employee who dedicates more than 25% of his or her compensated time to activities in connection with a Federal election, 2 U. S.C.A. 431(20)(A)(iiv).  All activities that fall within this definition must be funded with hard money.  441i(b)(1).  The Levin Amendment carves out an exception to this general rule, allowing state and local party committees to pay for certain federal election activitiesnamely, activities falling within categories (1) and (2) above that either do not refer to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office, or, if they involve broadcast communications, refer solely to a clearly identified candidate for State or local office, 441i(b)(2)(B)(i)(ii)with an allocated ratio of hard money and so-called Levin funds.  Levin funds are subject only to state regulation, but for two additional restrictions.  First, no contributor can donate more than $10,000 per year to a single committees Levin account.  441i(b)(2)(B)(iii).  Second, both Levin funds and the allocated portion of hard money to pay for such activities must be raised by the state or local committee that spends them, though the committee can team up with other national, state, or local committees to solicit the hard-money portion.  441i(b)(2)(B)(iv), 441i(b)(2)(C).  Pp. 5255.


(2)In addressing soft-money contributions to state committees, Congress both drew a conclusion and made a prediction.  It concluded from the record that soft moneys corrupting influence insinuates itself into the political process not only through national party committees, but also through state committees, which function as an alternate avenue for precisely the same corrupting forces.  Indeed, the evidence shows that both candidates and parties already ask donors who have reached their direct contribution limit to donate to state committees.  Congress reasonable prediction, based on the history of campaign finance regulation, was that donors would react to 323(a) by directing soft-money contributions to state committees for the purpose of influencing federal candidates and elections, and that federal candidates would be just as indebted to these contributors as they had been to those who had formerly contributed to the national parties.  Preventing corrupting activity from shifting wholesale to state committees and thereby eviscerating FECA clearly qualifies as an important governmental interest.  Pp. 5557.


(3)Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that, even if 323(b) serves a legitimate interest, its restrictions are so unjustifiably burdensome and overbroad that they cannot be considered closely drawn to match the Governments objectives.  Pp. 5766.


(i)Section 323(b) is not substantially overbroad.  Although 323(b) captures some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices, these are the same activities that were covered by the FECs pre-BCRA allocation rules, and so had to be funded in part by hard money because they affected both federal and state elections.  As a practical matter, BCRA merely codifies the FECs allocation regime principles while justifiably adjusting the applicable formulas in order to restore the efficacy of FECAs longstanding restriction on contributions to state and local committees for the purpose of influencing federal elections.  By limiting its reach to Federal election activities, 323(b) is narrowly focused on regulating contributions that directly benefit federal candidates and thus pose the greatest risk of corruption or its appearance.  The first two categories of Federal election activityvoter registration efforts and voter identification, GOTV, and generic campaign activities conducted in connection with a federal electionclearly capture activities that confer a substantial benefit on federal candidates by getting like-minded voters to the polls.  If a voter registration drive does not specifically mention a federal candidate, state committees can take advantage of the Levin Amendments higher contribution limits and relaxed source restrictions.  Moreover, because the record demonstrates abundantly that the third category of Federal election activity, public communication[s] that promote or attack a federal candidate, directly affects the election in which that candidate is participating, application of 323(b)s contribution caps to such communications is closely drawn to the anticorruption interest it is intended to address.  Finally, Congress interest in preventing circumvention of 323(b)s other restrictions justifies the requirement of the fourth category of Federal election activity that federal funds be used to pay any state or local party employee who spends more than 25% of his or her compensated time on activities connected with a federal election.  Pp. 5863.


(ii)The Levin Amendment does not unjustifiably burden association among party committees by forbidding transfers of Levin funds among state parties, transfers of hard money to fund the allocable federal portion of Levin expenditures, and joint fundraising of Levin funds by state parties.  While preserving parties associational freedom is important, not every minor restriction on parties otherwise unrestrained ability to associate is of constitutional dimension.  See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 450, n. 11.  Given the delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme at issue here, any associational burdens imposed by the Levin Amendment restrictions are far outweighed by the need to prevent circumvention of the entire scheme.  Pp. 6365.


(iii)The evidence supporting the argument that the Levin Amendment prevents parties from amassing the resources needed to engage in effective advocacy is speculative.  The history of campaign finance regulation proves that political parties are extraordinarily flexible in adapting to new restrictions on their fundraising abilities.  Moreover, the mere fact that 323(b) may reduce the money available to state and local parties to fund federal election activities is largely inconsequential.  The question is not whether the amount available over previous election cycles is reduced, but whether the reduction is so radical as to drive the sound of the recipients voice below the level of notice.  Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 397.  If state or local parties can make such a showing, as-applied challenges remain available.  Pp. 6566.


(d)New FECA 323(d)which forbids national, state, and local party committees and their agents to solicit any funds for, or make or direct any donations to 501(c) tax exempt organizations that make expenditures in connection with a federal election, and to 527 political organizations other than a political committee, a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or the authorized campaign committee of a candidate for State or local office, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(d)is not facially invalid.  Pp. 6673.


(1)Section 323(d)s restriction on solicitations is a valid anti-circumvention measure.  Absent this provision, national, state, and local party committees would have significant incentives to mobilize their formidable fundraising apparatuses, including the peddling of access to federal officeholders, into the service of like-minded tax-exempt organizations that conduct activities benefiting their candidates.  All of the corruption and the appearance of corruption attendant on the operation of those fundraising apparatuses would follow.  Plaintiffs argument that 323(d)s solicitations ban cannot be squared with 323(e), which allows federal candidates and officeholders to solicit limited soft-money donations to tax-exempt organizations engaged in federal election activities, is not persuasive.  If 323(d)s solicitation restriction is otherwise valid, it is not rendered unconstitutional by the mere fact that Congress chose not to regulate the activities of another group as stringently as it might have.  See National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210.  Furthermore, the difference between the two provisions is explained by the fact that national party officers, unlike federal candidates and officeholders, remain free to solicit soft money on behalf of nonprofit organizations in their individual capacities.  Given 323(e)s tight content, source, and amount restrictions on soft-money solicitations by federal candidates and officeholders, as well as the less rigorous standard of review, 323(e)s greater solicitation allowances do not render 323(d)s solicitation restriction facially invalid.  Pp. 6771.


(2)Section 323(d)s restriction on donations to qualifying 501(c) or 527 organizations is a valid anticircumvention measure insofar as it prohibits donations of funds not already raised in compliance with FECA.  Absent such a restriction, state and local party committees could accomplish directly what the antisolicitation restrictions prevent them from doing indirectlyraising large sums of soft money to launder through tax-exempt organizations engaging in federal election activities.  Although the ban raises overbreadth concerns if read to restrict donations from a partys federal accounti.e., funds already raised in compliance with FECAs source, amount, and disclosure limitationsthese concerns do not require that the facial challenge be sustained, given this Courts obligation to construe a statute, if possible, in such a way as to avoid constitutional questions, see, e.g., Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62.  Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Congress intended donations to include donations from a partys hard-money account, and because of the constitutional infirmities such an interpretation would raise, the Court narrowly construes 323(d)s ban to apply only to donations of funds not raised in compliance with FECA.  Pp. 7173.


(e)New FECA 323(e)which, with many exceptions, forbids federal candidates and officeholders to solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend soft money in connection with federal elections, 2 U. S.C.A. 441i(e)(1)(A), and limits their ability to do so for state and local elections, 441i(e)(1)(B)does not violate the First Amendment.  No party seriously questions the constitutionality of the general ban on soft-money donations directly to federal candidates and officeholders and their agents.  By severing the most direct link to the soft-money donor, the ban is closely drawn to prevent the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  The solicitation restrictions are valid anticircumvention measures.  Even before BCRAs passage, federal candidates and officeholders solicited donations to state and local parties, as well as tax-exempt organizations, in order to help their own, as well as their partys, electoral cause.  See Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 458.  The incentives to do so will only increase with Title Is restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money by national, state, and local parties.  Section 323(e) addresses these concerns while accommodating the individual speech and associational rights of federal candidates and officeholders.  Pp. 7477.


(f)New FECA 323(f)which forbids state and local candidates or officeholders to raise and spend soft money to fund ads and other public communications that promote or attack federal candidates, 2 U. S.C. 442i(f)is a valid anticircumvention provision.  The section places no cap on the funds that such candidates can spend on any activity, but, rather, limits only the source and amount of contributions that they can draw on to fund expenditures that directly impact federal elections.  And, by regulating only contributions used to fund public communications, the section focuses narrowly on those soft-money donations with the greatest potential to corrupt or give rise to the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders. Plaintiffs principal arguments against the section(1) that the definition of public communications as communications that support or attack a clearly identified federal candidate is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad; and (2) that soft-money contributions to state and local candidates for public communications do not corrupt or appear to corrupt federal candidatesare rejected.  Pp. 7778.


2.Several plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that BCRA Title I exceeds Congress Election Clause authority to make or alter rules governing federal elections, U. S. Const., Art. I, 4, and violates constitutional federalism principles by impairing the States authority to regulate their own elections.  In examining federal Acts for Tenth Amendment infirmity, the Court focuses on whether States and state officials are commandeered to carry out federal regulatory schemes.  See, e.g., Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898.  By contrast, Title I only regulates private parties conduct, imposing no requirements upon States or state officials.  And, because it does not expressly pre-empt state legislation, Title I leaves States free to enforce their own restrictions on state electoral campaign financing.  Moreover, while this Court has policed the absolute boundaries of Congress Article I power, see, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, plaintiffs offer no reason to believe that Congress has overstepped its Elections Clause power in enacting BCRA.  Indeed, as already found, Title I is closely drawn to match Congress important interest in preventing the corruption or the appearance of corruption of federal candidates and officeholders.  That interest is sufficient to ground Congress exercise of its Elections Clause power.  Pp. 7980.


3.Also rejected is the argument that BCRA Title I violates equal protection by discriminating against political parties in favor of special interest groups, which remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration, GOTV activities, mailings, and broadcast advertising (other than electioneering communications).  First, BCRA actually favors political parties in many ways, e.g., by allowing party committees to receive individual contributions substantially exceeding FECA limits on contributions to nonparty political committees.  More importantly, Congress is fully entitled to consider the salient, real-world differences between parties and interest groups when crafting a campaign finance regulation system, see National Right to Work, 459 U. S., at 210, including the fact that parties have influence and power in the legislature vastly exceeding any interest groups.  Taken seriously, plaintiffs equal protection arguments would call into question not just BCRA Title I, but much of FECAs pre-existing structure.  Pp. 8285.


4.Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed insofar as it upheld 323(e) and 323(f) and reversed insofar as it invalidated 323(a), 323(b), and 323(d).  P. 82.


5.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the disclosure requirements in amended FECA 304 and rejected the facial attack on the provisions relating to donors of $1,000 or more, but reversed to the extent that it invalidated FECA 304(f)(5).  Pp. 8295.


(a)BCRA 201 comprehensively amends FECA 304, which requires political committees to file detailed periodic financial reports with the FEC.  The narrowing construction adopted in Buckley limited FECAs disclosure requirement to communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates.  BCRA adopts a new term, electioneering communication, which encompasses any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that clearly identifies a candidate for federal office, airs within a specific time period (e.g., within 60 days of a general election and 30 days of a primary), and is targeted to the relevant electorate.  2 U. S.C.A. 434(f)(3)(A)(i).  BCRA also amends 304 to provide disclosure requirements for persons who fund electioneering communications (and BCRA 203 amends FECA 316(b)(2) to extend those requirements to corporations and labor unions).


Plaintiffs challenge the new terms constitutionality as it applies to both disclosures and expenditures, arguing primarily that Buckley drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy, and that speakers have an inviolable First Amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.  However, a plain reading of Buckley and Federal Election Commn v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (MCFL), shows that the express advocacy restriction is a product of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional command.  Both the concept of express advocacy and the class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional problems of vagueness and overbreadth in the statute before the Buckley Court.  Consistent with the principle that a constitutional rule should never be formulated more broadly than required by the facts to which it is to be applied, Buckley and MCFL were specific to the statutory language before the Court and in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.  The notion that the First Amendment erects a rigid barrier between express and issue advocacy also cannot be squared with this Courts longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad.  Buckleys express advocacy line has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption, and Congress enacted BCRA to correct the flaws it found.  Finally, because the components of new FECA 304(f)(3)s definition of electioneering communication are both easily understood and objectively determinable, the vagueness objection that persuaded the Buckley Court to limit FECAs reach to express advocacy is inapposite here.  Pp. 8288.


(b)With regard to plaintiffs other concerns about the use of the phrase electioneering communication, the District Court correctly rejected their submission that new FECA 304 unnecessarily requires disclosure of the names of persons who contributed $1,000 or more to the individual or group paying for the communication, but erred in finding 304(f)(5) invalid because it mandates disclosure of executory contracts for communications that have not yet aired.  Because the important state interests identified in Buckleyproviding the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and avoiding its appearance, and gathering data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictionsapply in full to BCRA, Buckley amply supports application of FECA 304s disclosure requirements to the entire range of electioneering communications.  Buckley also forecloses a facial attack on the new 304 provision that requires disclosure of the names of persons who contribute $1,000 or more to segregated funds or spend more than $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications.  Under Buckleys standard of proof, the evidence here did not establish the requisite reasonable probability of harm to any plaintiff group or its members resulting from compelled disclosure.  However, the rejection of this facial challenge does not foreclose possible future challenges to particular applications of that disclosure requirement.


This Court is also unpersuaded by plaintiffs challenge to new FECA 304(f)(5)s requirement regarding the disclosure of executory contracts.  The new provision mandates disclosure only when a person makes disbursements totaling more than $10,000 in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.  Given the relatively short time frames in which such communications are made, the interest in assuring that disclosures are made in time to provide relevant information to voters is significant.  Yet fixing the deadline for filing disclosure statements based on the date when aggregate disbursements exceed $10,000 would open a significant loophole without the advance disclosure requirement, for political supporters could avoid preelection disclosures about ads slated to run during a campaigns final weeks simply by making a preelection downpayment of less than $10,000, with the balance payable after the election.  The record contains little evidence of any harm that might flow from the requirements enforcement, and the District Courts speculation about such harm cannot outweigh the public interest in ensuring full disclosure before an election actually takes place.  Pp. 8895.


6.The District Courts judgment is affirmed insofar as it held that plaintiffs advanced no basis for finding unconstitutional BCRA 202, which amends FECA 315(a)(7)(C) to provide that disbursements for electioneering communications that are coordinated with a candidate or party will be treated as contributions to, and expenditures by, that candidate or party, 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a)(7)(C).  That provision clarifies the scope of 315(a)(7)(B), which provides that expenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or party constitute contributions.  BCRA pre-empts a possible claim that the term expenditure in 315(a)(7)(B) is limited to spending for express advocacy.  Because Buckleys narrow interpretation of that term was only a statutory limitation on Congress power to regulate federal elections, there is no reason why Congress may not treat coordinated disbursements for electioneering communications in the same way it treats other coordinated expenditures.  Pp. 9697.


7.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld the constitutionality of new FECA 316(b)(2), and reversed to the extent that it invalidated any part of that section.  BCRA 203 extends to all electioneering communications FECA 316(b)(2)s restrictions on the use of corporate and union general treasury funds.  2 U. S.C.A. 441b(b)(2).  Because those entities may still organize and administer segregated funds, or PACs, for such communications, the provision is a regulation of, not a ban on, expression.  Beaumont, 539 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  This Courts consideration of plaintiffs claim that the expanded regulation is both overinclusive and underinclusive is informed by the conclusion that the distinction between express advocacy and so-called issue advocacy is not constitutionally compelled.  Thus, the Court examines the degree to which BCRA burdens First Amendment expression and evaluates whether a compelling governmental interest justifies that burden.  Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving that new FECA 316(b)(2) is overbroad.  They argue that the justifications that adequately support regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the electioneering communications definition.  That argument fails to the extent that issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for regulating express advocacy apply equally to those ads if they have an electioneering purpose, which the vast majority do.  Also rejected is plaintiffs argument that new FECA 316(b)(2)s segregated-fund requirement is underinclusive because it does not apply to print or Internet advertising.  The record here reflects that corporations and unions used soft money to finance a virtual torrent of televised election-related ads during the relevant period.  Congress justifiably concluded that remedial legislation was needed to stanch that flow of money.  Finally, 304(f)(3)(B)(i), which excludes news items and commentary from the electioneering communications definition, is wholly consistent with First Amendment principles as applied to the media.  Pp. 97103.


8.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it upheld new FECA 316(c)(6), as limited to nonprofit entities that are not so-called MCFL organizations.  BCRA 204, which adds 316(c)(6), 2 U. S.C.A. 441b(c)(2), extends to nonprofit corporations the prohibition on the use of general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications.  This Court upheld a similar restriction in Beaumont, supra, except as it applied to organizations that are formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas, have no shareholders, are not established by a business corporation or labor union, and do not accept contributions from those entities, MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  The same constitutional objection to applying the pre-BCRA restrictions to such organizations necessarily applies with equal force to FECA 316(c)(6).  That 316(c)(6) does not, on its face, exempt MCFL organizations is not a sufficient reason to invalidate it.  This Court presumes that the legislators were fully aware that the provision could not apply to MCFL-type entities, and the Government concedes that it does not.  As so construed, the provision is plainly valid.  Pp. 103106.


9.Because this Court has already found BCRA 201s executory contract disclosure requirement constitutional, plaintiffs challenge to a similar disclosure requirement in BCRA 212, which added FECA 304(g), 2 U. S.C.A. 434, is essentially moot.  Pp. 106107.


10.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it invalidated BCRA 213, which amends FECA 315(d)(4) to require political parties to choose between coordinated and independent expenditures during the postnomination, preelection period.  2 U. S.C.A. 441a(d)(4).  That provision places an unconstitutional burden on the parties right to make unlimited independent expenditures.  Although the category of burdened speech is limited to independent expenditures for express advocacyand therefore is relatively smallit plainly is entitled to First Amendment protection.  The governmental interest in requiring parties to avoid using magic words is not sufficient to support the burden imposed by 315(d)(4).  The fact that the provision is cast as a choice rather than an outright prohibition on independent expenditures does not make it constitutional.  Pp. 107114.


11.The District Courts judgment is affirmed to the extent that it rejected plaintiffs challenges to BCRA 214, which adds FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(ii), 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a)(7)(b)(ii).  FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(i) long has provided that expenditures that are controlled by or coordinated with a candidate will be treated as contributions to the candidate.  BCRA 214(a) extends that rule to expenditures coordinated with political parties; and 214 (b) and (c) direct the FEC to promulgate new regulations that do not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination, 2 U. S.C.A. 441a(a) note.  FECA 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) is not overbroad simply because it permits a finding of coordination in the absence of a pre-existing agreement.  Congress has always treated expenditures made after a wink or nod as coordinated.  Nor does the absence of an agreement requirement render 315(a)(7)(B)(ii) unconstitutionally vague.  An agreement has never been required under 315(a)(7)(B)(i), which uses precisely the same language as the new provision to address coordination with candidates, and which has survived without constitutional challenge for almost three decades.  Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that that the definition has chilled political speech, and have made no attempt to explain how an agreement requirement would prevent the FEC from engaging in what they fear will be intrusive and politically motivated investigations.  Finally, in this facial challenge to BCRA, plaintiffs challenge to 214(b) and (c) is not ripe to the extent that they allege constitutional infirmities in the FECs new regulations rather than the statute.  Pp. 114119.


The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to miscellaneous BCRA Title III and IV provisions, concluding that the District Courts judgment with respect to these provisions must be affirmed.  Pp.211.


1.The plaintiffs challenges to BCRA 305, 307, and the millionaire provisions are nonjusticiable.  Pp.28.


(a)The McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA 305, which amends the federal Communications Act of 1934 requirement that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election, broadcast stations sell air time to a qualified candidate at their lowest unit charge, 47 U. S.C. 315(b).  Section 305s amendment, in turn, denies a candidate the benefit of that charge in specified circumstances.  47 U. S.C.A. 315(b)(2)(A), (C).  Senator McConnells testimony that he plans to run ads critical of his opponents and had run them in the past is too remote temporally to satisfy the Article III standing requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate an injury in fact that is actual or imminent, Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155, 158, given that the lowest unit charge requirement is not available until 45 days before a primary, that Senator McConnells current term does not expire until 2009, and that, therefore, the earliest day he could be affected by 305 is 45 days before the 2008 Republican primary election.  Pp.24.


(b)The Adams and Paul plaintiffs lack standing to challenge BCRA 307, which amends FECA 315(a)(1) to increase and index for inflation certain contribution limits.  Neither injury alleged by the Adams plaintiffs, a group of voters, voter organizations, and candidates, is sufficient to confer standing.  First, their assertion that 307 deprives them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status does not satisfy the standing requirement that a plaintiffs alleged injury be an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560, since political free trade does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257.  Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates contention that 307 puts them at a fundraising disadvantage compared to their opponents because they do not wish to solicit or accept the large campaign contributions BCRA permits does not meet the standing requirement that their alleged injury be fairly traceable to 307, see Lujan, supra, at 562, since their alleged inability to compete stems not from 307s operation, but from their own personal choice not to solicit or accept large contributions.  Also inadequate for standing purposes is the Paul plaintiffs contention that their congressional campaigns and public interest advocacy involve traditional press activities, such that 307s contribution limits, together with FECA 315s individual and PAC contribution limitations, impose unconstitutional editorial control on them in violation of the First Amendments Freedom of the Press Clause.  These plaintiffs cannot show the requisite substantial likelihood their requested relief will remedy their alleged injury in fact, see Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 771, since, even if the Court were to strike down BCRA 307s increases and indexes, as they ask, both FECAs contribution limits and an exemption for institutional news media would remain unchanged.  Pp.48.


(c)The Adams plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the so-called millionaire provisions, BCRA 304, 315, and 316, which provide for a series of staggered increases in otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the candidates opponent spends a triggering amount of his personal funds, and eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in certain circumstances.  Because these plaintiffs allege the same injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA 307, they fail to state a cognizable injury that is fairly traceable to BCRA.  Additionally, none of them is a candidate in an election affected by the millionaire provisions, and it would be purely conjectural to assume that any of them ever will be.  P.8.


2.The District Courts decision upholding BCRA 311s expansion of FECA 318(a) to include mandatory electioneering-communications-disbursements disclosure is affirmed because such inclusion bears a sufficient relationship to the important governmental interest of shed[ding] the light of publicity on campaign financing, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 81.  Assuming, as the Court must, that FECA 318 is valid both to begin with and as amended by BCRA 311s amendments other than the electioneering-communications inclusion, the latter inclusion is not itself unconstitutional.  P.9.


3.BCRA 318which forbids individuals 17 years old or younger to make contributions to candidates and political parties, 2 U. S.C.A. 441kviolates the First Amendment rights of minors, see, e.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511513.  Because limitations on an individuals political contributions impinge on the freedoms of expression and association, see Buckley, 424 U. S., at 2022, the Court applies heightened scrutiny to such a limitation, asking whether it is justified by a sufficiently important interest and closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of the First Amendment, see e.g., post, at 2526 (joint opinion of Stevens and OConnor, JJ.).  The Government offers scant evidence for its assertion that 318 protects against corruption by conduiti.e., donations by parents through their minor children to circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents.  Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this interest is simply too attenuated for 318 to withstand heightened scrutiny.  See Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 391.  Even assuming, arguendo, the Government advances an important interest, the provision is overinclusive, as shown by the States adoption of more tailored approaches.  Pp.911.


4.Because the FEC clearly has standing, the Court need not address whether the intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the FECs, were properly granted intervention pursuant to, inter alia, BCRA 403(b).  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 431432, n.19.  P.11.


Justice Breyer delivered the Courts opinion with respect to BCRA Title V504 of which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require broadcasters to keep publicly available records of politically related broadcasting requests, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)concluding that the portion of the judgment below invalidating 504 as facially violative of the First Amendment must be reversed.  Pp.215.


1.Section 504s candidate request requirementswhich call for broadcasters to keep records of broadcast requests made by or on behalf of any  candidate, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(A)are upheld.  They are virtually identical to those contained in a longstanding FCC regulation.  The McConnell plaintiffs argument that the requirements are intolerably burdensome and invasive is rejected.  The FCC has consistently estimated that its regulation imposes upon a licensee a comparatively small additional administrative burden.  Moreover, the 504 requirement is supported by significant governmental interests in verifying that licensees comply with their obligations to allow political candidates equal time, 47 U. S.C. 315(a), and to sell such time at the lowest unit charge, 315(b); in evaluating whether they are processing candidate requests in an evenhanded fashion to help assure broadcasting fairness, 315(a); in making the public aware of how much candidates spend on broadcast messages; 2 U. S.C.A. 434; and in providing an independently compiled set of data for verifying candidates compliance with BCRAs and FECAs disclosure requirements and source limitations, ibid.  Because the Court cannot, on the present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation unconstitutional, it cannot strike down BCRA 504s candidate request provision, which simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.  Pp.37.


2.Because 504s candidate request requirements are constitutional, its election message requirementswhich serve similar governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden in requiring broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast message[s] that refer either to a legally qualified candidate or to any election to Federal office, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii)must be constitutional as well.  Pp.89.


3.BCRA 504s issue request requirementswhich call for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone) to broadcast message[s] related to a national legislative issue of public importance, 47 U. S.C.A. 315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or a political matter of national importance, 315(e)(1)(B)survive the McConnell plaintiffs facial challenge.  These recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help determine whether broadcasters are fulfilling their obligations under the FCCs regulations to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on important public issues or whether they too heavily favor entertainment, discriminating against public affairs broadcasts.  The plaintiffs claim that the above-quoted statutory language is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad is unpersuasive, given that it is no more general than language Congress has used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters and is roughly comparable to other BCRA language upheld in this litigation.  Whether the issue request requirements impose disproportionate administrative burdens will depend on how the FCC interprets and applies them.  The parties remain free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCCs regulations, or as otherwise applied.  Without the greater information any such challenge will likely provide, the Court cannot say that the provisions administrative burdens are so great, or their justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding them facially unconstitutional.  Similarly, the argument that the issue request requirement will force the purchasers to disclose information revealing their political strategies to opponents does not show that BCRA 504 is facially unconstitutional, but the plaintiffs remain free to raise this argument when 504 is applied.  Pp.912.

|540 u.s. 44|"RAYTHEON CO. v. HERNANDEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02749. Argued October 8, 2003Decided December 2, 2003
After respondent tested positive for cocaine and admitted that his behavior violated petitioners workplace conduct rules, he was forced to resign.  More than two years later, he applied to be rehired, stating on his application that petitioner had previously employed him, and attaching letters both from his pastor about his active church participation and from an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor about his regular attendance at meetings and his recovery.  The employee who reviewed and rejected respondents application testified that petitioner has a policy against rehiring employees who are terminated for workplace misconduct and that she did not know that respondent was a former drug addict when she rejected his application.  Respondent filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that he had been discriminated against in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter, and respondent filed this ADA action, arguing that petitioner rejected his application because of his record of drug addition and/or because he was regarded as being a drug addict.  In response to petitioners summary judgment motion, respondent for the first time argued in the alternative that if petitioner applied a neutral no-rehire policy in his case, it still violated the ADA because of that policys disparate impact.  The District Court granted petitioners motion for summary judgment on the disparate-treatment claim and found that the disparate-impact claim had not been timely pleaded or raised.  The Ninth Circuit agreed as to the disparate-impact claim, but held as to the disparate-treatment claim that, under the burden-shifting approach of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, respondent had proffered a prima facie case of discrimination, and petitioner had not met its burden to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action because its no-rehire policy, though lawful on its face, was unlawful as applied to employees who were lawfully forced to resign for illegal drug use but have since been rehabilitated.
Held:The Ninth Circuit improperly applied a disparate-impact analysis to respondents disparate-treatment claim.  This Court has consistently distinguished between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims.  The former arise when an employer treats some people less favorably than others because of a protected characteristic.  Liability depends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employers action.  The latter involve facially neutral employment practices that fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.  Such practices may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employers subjective discrimination.  Both claims are cognizable under the ADA, but courts must be careful to distinguish between the theories.  Here, respondent was limited to the disparate-treatment theory that petitioner refused to rehire him because it regarded him as disabled and/or because of his record of disability.

			"|"RAYTHEON CO. v. HERNANDEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02749. Argued October 8, 2003Decided December 2, 2003
After respondent tested positive for cocaine and admitted that his behavior violated petitioners workplace conduct rules, he was forced to resign.  More than two years later, he applied to be rehired, stating on his application that petitioner had previously employed him, and attaching letters both from his pastor about his active church participation and from an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor about his regular attendance at meetings and his recovery.  The employee who reviewed and rejected respondents application testified that petitioner has a policy against rehiring employees who are terminated for workplace misconduct and that she did not know that respondent was a former drug addict when she rejected his application.  Respondent filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that he had been discriminated against in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter, and respondent filed this ADA action, arguing that petitioner rejected his application because of his record of drug addition and/or because he was regarded as being a drug addict.  In response to petitioners summary judgment motion, respondent for the first time argued in the alternative that if petitioner applied a neutral no-rehire policy in his case, it still violated the ADA because of that policys disparate impact.  The District Court granted petitioners motion for summary judgment on the disparate-treatment claim and found that the disparate-impact claim had not been timely pleaded or raised.  The Ninth Circuit agreed as to the disparate-impact claim, but held as to the disparate-treatment claim that, under the burden-shifting approach of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, respondent had proffered a prima facie case of discrimination, and petitioner had not met its burden to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action because its no-rehire policy, though lawful on its face, was unlawful as applied to employees who were lawfully forced to resign for illegal drug use but have since been rehabilitated.
Held:The Ninth Circuit improperly applied a disparate-impact analysis to respondents disparate-treatment claim.  This Court has consistently distinguished between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims.  The former arise when an employer treats some people less favorably than others because of a protected characteristic.  Liability depends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employers action.  The latter involve facially neutral employment practices that fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.  Such practices may be deemed illegally discriminatory without evidence of the employers subjective discrimination.  Both claims are cognizable under the ADA, but courts must be careful to distinguish between the theories.  Here, respondent was limited to the disparate-treatment theory that petitioner refused to rehire him because it regarded him as disabled and/or because of his record of disability.  Petitioners proffer of its neutral no-rehire policy plainly satisfied its obligation under McDonnell Douglas to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent.  Thus, the only remaining question before the Ninth Circuit was whether there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that petitioner did make its employment decision based on respondents status as disabled despite its proffered explanation.  Instead, that court concluded that, as a matter of law, the policy was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason sufficient to defeat a prima facie case of discrimination.  In doing so, the Ninth Circuit improperly focused on factors that pertain only to disparate-impact claims, and thus ignored the fact that petitioners no-hire policy is a quintessential legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire an employee who was terminated for violating workplace conduct rules.

A person is disabled, and thereby eligible for Social Security disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.  42 U. S.C. 423(d)(2)(A), 1382c(a)(3)(B) (emphasis added) (hereinafter 423(d)(2)(A)).  After her job as an elevator operator was eliminated, respondent Thomas applied for disability insurance benefits and SSI.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that her impairments did not prevent her from performing her past relevant work as an elevator operator, rejecting her argument that she is unable to do that work because it no longer exists in significant numbers in the national economy.  The District Court affirmed the ALJ, concluding that whether Thomass old job exists is irrelevant under the Social Security Administrations (SSA) regulations.  In reversing and remanding, the en banc Third Circuit held that 423(d)(2)(A) unambiguously provides that the ability to perform prior work disqualifies from benefits only if it is substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.
Held:The SSAs determination that it can find a claimant not disabled where she remains physically and mentally able to do her previous work, without investigating whether that work exists in significant numbers in the national economy, is a reasonable interpretation of 423(d)(2)(A) that is entitled to deference under Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837.  Section 423(d)(2)(A) establishes two requirements: An impairment must render an individual unable to do his previous work and must also preclude him from engag[ing] in any other kind of substantial gainful work.  The clause which exists in the national economy clearly qualifies the latter requirement.  The issue in this case is whether that clause also qualifies the former requirement.  The SSAs regulations, which create a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine disability, answer that question in the negative.  At step four, the SSA will find not disabled a claimant who can do his previous work, without inquiring whether that work exists in the national economy.  Rather, it reserves inquiry into the national economy for the fifth step, when it considers vocational factors and determines whether the claimant can perform other jobs in the national economy.  See 20 CFR 404.1520(f), 404.1560(c), 416.920(f), 416.960(c).  That interpretation is a reasonable construction of 423(d)(2)(A).  The Third Circuits contrary reading ignores the grammatical rule of the last antecedent, under which a limiting clause or phrase should be read to modify only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.  Construing 423(d)(2)(A) in accord with this rule is quite sensible.  Congress could have determined that an analysis of a claimants capacity to do his previous work would in most cases be an effective and efficient administrative proxy for the claimants ability to do some work that exists in the national economy.  There is good reason to use such a proxy to avoid the more expansive and individualized step-five analysis.  The proper Chevron inquiry is not whether an agency construction can give rise to undesirable results in some instances (which both the SSAs and the Third Circuits constructions can), but whether, in light of the alternatives, the agency construction is reasonable.  Here, the SSAs authoritative interpretation satisfies that test.  Pp. 310.

|540 u.s. 12|"BETTY MITCHELL, WARDEN v. GREGORY ESPARZA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 021369. Decided November 3, 2003
Per Curiam.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the grant of habeas relief to respondent Gregory Esparza after concluding that, because the Eighth Amendment requires the State to narrow the class of death eligible defendants, the Ohio Court of Appeals had improperly subjected respondents claims to harmless-error review.  310 F.3d 414 (2002).  This decision ignores the limits imposed on federal habeas review by 28 U. S.C. 2254(d), and we therefore grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.


In February 1983, respondent Esparza entered a store in Toledo, Ohio, and approached two employees, Melanie Gerschultz and James Barailloux.  No one else was in the store.  At gunpoint, he ordered Gerschultz to open the cash register.  Barailloux meanwhile fled the store through a rear door, entering the attached home of the storeowner, Evelyn Krieger.  As Barailloux was alerting Krieger to the robbery, he heard a gunshot.  Barailloux and Krieger returned to the store and found Gerschultz lying on the floor, fatally wounded by a single gunshot to her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $110 was missing.


Respondent was charged with aggravated murder during the commission of an aggravated robbery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2903.01 (Anderson 2002), and aggravated robbery, 2911.01.  He was convicted on both counts, and the trial judge accepted the jurys recommendation that he be sentenced to death for the murder conviction.  The trial judge additionally sentenced respondent to 7 to 25 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus 3 years for the firearm specification.  The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and the sentences.  State v. Esparza, 39 Ohio St. 3d 8, 529 N.E. 2d 192 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U. S. 1012 (1989).


On state postconviction review, respondent argued, for the first time, that he had not been convicted of an offense for which a death sentence could be imposed under Ohio law.  Although the indictment charged him with aggravated murder in the course of committing aggravated robbery, it did not charge him as a principal offender.[Footnote 1]  The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected his claim, holding that literal compliance with the statute was not required: [W]here only one defendant is named in an indictment alleging felony murder, it would be redundant to state that the defendant is being charged as a principal offender.  Only where more than one defendant is named need the indictment specify the allegation principal offender.  State v. Esparza, No. L90235, 1992 WL 113827, *9 (May 29, 1992), cause dismd, 65 Ohio St. 3d 1453, 602 N.E. 2d 250 (1992).


Respondent then filed a second petition for state postconviction relief alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because his attorney did not argue that the States failure to comply with its sentencing procedures violated the Eighth Amendment.  The Ohio Court of Appeals in a conclusory opinion denied his claim, referring back to its previous decision.  State v. Esparza, No. L84224, 1994 WL 395114, *5 (July 27, 1994), cause dismd, 70 Ohio St. 3d 1473, 640 N.E. 2d 845 (Ohio 1994).  The import of the courts decision was clear: Respondent failed to prove he was prejudiced because any error committed by counsel was harmless.  In respondents words, The state court  determined that since [respondent] was the only individual charged, the jury must have determined that [respondent] was the principal offender.  Brief in Opposition 2.


Having exhausted his avenues for relief under state law, respondent filed a habeas petition in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The District Court concluded that the Ohio Court of Appeals decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because it was contrary to our opinions in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993).  In light of this error, as well as others not relevant to this opinion, the court granted respondents petition in part and issued a writ of habeas corpus as to the death sentence.  Esparza v. Anderson, No. 3:96CV7434 (Oct. 13, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a240a.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, holding that the Eighth Amendment precluded respondents death sentence and that harmless-error review was inappropriate.  The State of Ohio petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we now grant, along with respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.


A federal court may grant a state habeas petitioner relief for a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals, however, failed to cite, much less apply, this section.


A state courts decision is contrary to our clearly established law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405406 (2000); see also Price v. Vincent, 538 U. S. ___, ___ (2003) (slip op., at 5); Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 78 (2002) (per curiam).  A state courts decision is not contrary to  clearly established Federal law simply because the court did not cite our opinions.  Id., at 8.  We have held that a state court need not even be aware of our precedents, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.  Ibid.


According to the Sixth Circuit, Ohios failure to charge in the indictment that respondent was a principal was the functional equivalent of dispensing with the reasonable doubt requirement.  310 F.3d, at 421 (citing Sullivan v. Louisiana, supra, at 280).  Our precedents, however, do not support its conclusion.  In noncapital cases, we have often held that the trial courts failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense is subject to harmless-error analysis.  E.g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 19 (1999); California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2 (1996) (percuriam); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (percuriam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987).  In Neder, for example, we held that such an error differs markedly from the constitutional violations we have found to defy harmless-error review.  527 U. S., at 8.  In so holding, we explicitly distinguished Sullivan because the error in Sullivanthe failure to instruct the jury that the State must prove the elements of an offense beyond a reasonable doubtvitiate[d] all the jurys findings, 527 U. S., at 11, whereas, the trial courts failure to instruct the jury on one element of an offense did not, see id., at 1315.  Where the jury was precluded from determining only one element of an offense, we held that harmless-error review is feasible.  Ibid.


We cannot say that because the violation occurred in the context of a capital sentencing proceeding that our precedent requires the opposite result.  Indeed, a number of our harmless-error cases have involved capital defendants,[Footnote 2] Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991) (unconstitutional admission of coerced confession at guilt stage); Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990) (unconstitutionally broad jury instructions at sentencing stage); Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U. S. 249 (1988) (unconstitutional admission of evidence at sentencing stage), and we left a question similar to the one presented here open in another capital case, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 609, n.7 (2002) (We do not reach the States assertion that any error was harmless because a pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jurys guilty verdict).


In relying on the absence of precedent to distinguish our noncapital cases, and to hold that harmless-error review is not available for this type of Eighth Amendment claim, the Sixth Circuit exceeded its authority under 2254(d)(1).  A federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own, when the precedent from this Court is, at best, ambiguous.  As the Ohio Court of Appeals decision does not conflict with the reasoning or the holdings of our precedent, it is not contrary to  clearly established Federal law.


The question then becomes whether the Ohio Court of Appeals determination is an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.  (Emphasis added; punctuation omitted.)  A constitutional error is harmless when it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.  Neder, supra, at 15 (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986).  We may not grant respondents habeas petition, however, if the state court simply erred in concluding that the States errors were harmless; rather, habeas relief is appropriate only if the Ohio Court of Appeals applied harmless-error review in an objectively unreasonable manner.  Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 7577 (2003); see also Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 25 (2002) (per curiam); Williams, supra, at 410 (An unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law).


The Ohio Court of Appeals conclusion was hardly objectively unreasonable.  The Ohio Supreme Court has defined a principal offender as the actual killer, State v. Chinn, 85 Ohio St. 3d 548, 559, 709 N.E. 2d 1166, 1177 (1999), and in this case, the jury was instructed on the elements of aggravated murder, defined as purposely causing the death of another while committing Aggravated Robbery, 310 F.3d, at 432 (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting).  The trial judge further instructed the jury that it must determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense of Aggravated Murder was committed while the Defendant was committing Aggravated Robbery.  Ibid.  In light of these instructions, the jury verdict would surely have been the same had it been instructed to find as well that the respondent was a principal in the offense.  After all, he was the only defendant charged in the indictment.  There was no evidence presented that anyone other than respondent was involved in the crime or present at the store.[Footnote 3]  Cf. Neder, 527 U. S., at 19 ([W]here a defendant did not, and apparently could not, bring forth facts contesting the omitted element, answering the question whether the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error does not fundamentally undermine the purposes of the jury trial guarantee).  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the state courts conclusion that respondent was convicted of a capital offense was objectively unreasonable.  That being the case, we may not set aside its decision on habeas review.[Footnote 4]


The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2929.04(A) (Anderson 2002) provides, in relevant part:


Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded, unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or count in the indictment  and proved beyond a reasonable doubt:
.      .      .      .      .


(7) The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit  aggravated robbery,  and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.
The Sixth Circuit cited Presnell v. Georgia, 439 U. S. 14 (1978) (per curiam), a due process case, noting that rather than remand for a harmless-error analysis, we simply reversed.  In Presnell, we held that the Georgia Supreme Court violated due process when it sustained a death sentence because the sentence was supported by the evidence, even though the defendant was unaware of the charge and the issue was never submitted to a jury.  Presnell, however, relied on the defendants lack of notice and his inability to defend himself, not a faulty indictment or an incomplete jury instruction.
The Court of Appeals noted evidence brought to light for the first time in the habeas proceeding in the District Court that suggested there might have been another participant in the crime, Joe Jasso.  The jury, however, was not presented with this evidence at trial, and thus it has no bearing on the correctness of the Ohio Court of Appeals decision that the State need not charge a defendant as a principal offender if the failure to so charge is harmless error.
Our decision, like the Court of Appeals, is limited to the issue presented here.  We express no view whether habeas relief would be available to respondent on other grounds.

E. GENTRY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021597. Decided October 20, 2003
Per Curiam.
I

Respondent Lionel Gentry was convicted in California state court of assault with a deadly weapon for stabbing his girlfriend, Tanaysha Handy.  Gentry claimed he stabbed her accidentally during a dispute with a drug dealer.
Handy testified for the prosecution.  She stated that she recalled being stabbed but could not remember the details of the incident.  The prosecution then confronted Handy with her testimony from a preliminary hearing that Gentry had placed his hand around her throat before stabbing her twice.


Albert Williams, a security guard in a neighboring building, testified that he saw Gentry, Handy, and another man from his third-floor window.  According to Williams, Gentry swung his hand into Handys left side with some object, causing her to lean forward and scream.  Williams was inconsistent about the quality of light at the time, stating variously that it was pretty dark or getting dark, that it wasnt that dark, and that the area of the stabbing was lighted up.  See Gentry v. Roe, 320 F.3d 891, 896897 (CA9 2003).


Gentry testified in his own defense that he had stabbed Handy accidentally while pushing her out of the way.  When asked about prior convictions, he falsely stated that he had been convicted only once; evidence showed he had been separately convicted of burglary, grand theft, battery on a peace officer, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  He attributed his error to confusion about whether a plea bargain counted as a conviction.


In her closing argument, the prosecutor expressed sympathy for Handys plight as a pregnant, drug-addicted mother of three and highlighted her damaging preliminary hearing testimony.  She accused Gentry of telling the jury a pack of lies.  See id., at 897898.  Defense counsel responded with the following closing argument:
I dont have a lot to say today.  Just once Id like to find a prosecutor that doesnt know exactly what happened.  Just once Id like to find a D. A. that wasnt there and that can tell and they can stand up here and be honest and say I dont know who is lying and who is not cause she wasnt there, ladies and gentlemen.  [I] wasnt there.  None of the 12 of you were there.  None of the other people in this courtroom were there except those two people and that one guy who saw parts of it, or saw it all.  Pretty dark.  Dark.  It was light.  Those are the three versions of his testimony with regard to what he saw and what he saw.  I dont know what happened.  I cant tell you.  And if I sit here and try to tell you what happened, Im lying to you.  I dont know.  I wasnt there.  I dont have to judge.  I dont have to decide.  You heard the testimony come from the truth chair.  You heard people testify.  You heard good things that made you feel good.  You heard bad things that made you feel bad. 


I dont care that Tanaysha is pregnant. I dont care that she has three children. I dont know why that had to be brought out in closing.  What does that have to do with this case?  She was stabbed.


The question is, did he intend to stab her?  He said he did it by accident.  If hes lying and you think hes lying then you have to convict him.  If you dont think hes lying, bad person, lousy drug addict, stinking thief, jail bird, all that to the contrary, hes not guilty.  Its as simple as that.  I dont care if hes been in prison.  And for the sake of this thing you ought not care because that doesnt have anything to do with what happened on April 30th, 1994.


He doesnt know whether or not hes been convicted.  Didnt understand the term conviction.  That is not inconsistent with this whole thing of being spoken and doing all this other crime stuff as opposed to going to school.  I dont know.  I cant judge the man.  The reason that they bring 12 jurors from all different walks of life, let them sit here and listen to people testify, and the reason that the court will give you instructions with regard to not having your life experience, leaving it at the door, is because you cant just assume that because a guy has done a bunch of bad things that hes now done this thing.


I dont know if thievery and stabbing your girlfriend are all in the same pot.  I dont know if just because of the fact that you stole some things in the past that means you must have stabbed your girlfriend.  That sounds like a jump to me, but thats just [me].  Im not one of the 12 over there.


All I ask you to do is to look at the evidence and listen to everything youve heard and then make a decision.  Good decision or bad decision, its still a decision.  I would like all 12 of you to agree; but if you dont, I cant do anything about that either.


You heard everything just like all of us have heard it.  I dont know whos lying.  I dont know if anybody is lying.  And for someone to stand here and tell you that they think someone is lying and that they know that lying goes on, ladies and gentlemen, if that person was on the witness stand Id be objecting that they dont have foundation because they werent there.  And thats true.  The defense attorney and the prosecutor, no different than 12 of you.


So Id ask you to listen to what youve heard when you go back, ask you to take some time to think about it, and be sure thats what you want to do, then come out and do it.


Thank you.  Id., at 898899 (one paragraph break omitted).

After deliberating for about six hours, the jury convicted.


On direct appeal, Gentry argued that his trial counsels closing argument deprived him of his right to effective assistance of counsel.  The California Court of Appeal rejected that contention, and the California Supreme Court denied review.  Gentrys petition for federal habeas relief was denied by the District Court, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  We grant the States petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and reverse.
II

The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the effective assistance of counsel.  That right is denied when a defense attorneys performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and thereby prejudices the defense.  Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. __, __ (2003) (slip op., at 8); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687 (1984).  If a state court has already rejected an ineffective-assistance claim, a federal court may grant habeas relief if the decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Where, as here, the state courts application of governing federal law is challenged, it must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.  Wiggins, supra, at __ (slip op., at 8); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 2425 (2002) (per curiam); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000).
The right to effective assistance extends to closing arguments.  See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 701702 (2002); Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 865 (1975).  None-
theless, counsel has wide latitude in deciding how best to represent a client, and deference to counsels tactical decisions in his closing presentation is particularly important because of the broad range of legitimate defense strategy at that stage.  Closing arguments should sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the trier of fact, id., at 862, but which issues to sharpen and how best to clarify them are questions with many reasonable answers.  Indeed, it might sometimes make sense to forgo closing argument altogether.  See Bell, supra, at 701702.  Judicial review of a defense attorneys summation is therefore highly deferentialand doubly deferential when it is conducted through the lens of federal habeas.


In light of these principles, the Ninth Circuit erred in finding the California Court of Appeals decision objectively unreasonable.  The California courts opinion cited state case law setting forth the correct federal standard
for evaluating ineffective-assistance claims and concluded that counsels performance was not ineffective.  That conclusion was supported by the record.  The summation for the defense made several key points: that Williamss testimony about the quality of light was inconsistent; that Handys personal circumstances were irrelevant to Gentrys guilt; that the case turned on whether the stabbing was accidental, and the jury had to acquit if it believed Gentrys version of events; that Gentrys criminal history was irrelevant to his guilt, particularly given the seriousness of the charge compared to his prior theft offenses; and that Gentrys misstatement of the number of times he had been convicted could be explained by his lack of education.  Woven through these issues was a unifying themethat the jury, like the prosecutor and defense counsel himself, were not at the scene of the crime and so could only speculate about what had happened and who was lying.


The Ninth Circuit rejected the state courts conclusion in large part because counsel did not highlight various other potentially exculpatory pieces of evidence: that Handy had used drugs on the day of the stabbing and during the early morning hours of the day of her preliminary hearing; that Williamss inability to see the stabbing clearly was relevant to the issue of intent; that Gentrys testimony was consistent with Williamss in some respects; that the government did not call as a witness Williamss co-worker, who also saw the stabbing; that the stab wound was only one inch deep, suggesting it may have been accidental; that Handy testified she had been stabbed twice, but only had one wound; and that Gentry, after being confronted by Williams, did not try to retrieve his weapon but instead moved toward Handy while repeating, shes my girlfriend.  See 320 F.3d, at 900901.


These other potential arguments do not establish that the state courts decision was unreasonable.  Some of the omitted items, such as Gentrys reaction to Williams, are thoroughly ambiguous.  Some of the others might well have backfired.  For example, although Handy claimed at trial she had used drugs before the preliminary hearing, she testified at the hearing that she was not under the influence and could remember exactly what had happened the day of the stabbing.  And, although Handys wound was only one inch deep, it still lacerated her stomach and diaphragm, spilling the stomachs contents into her chest cavity and requiring almost two hours of surgery.  These are facts that the prosecutor could have exploited to great advantage in her rebuttal.


Even if some of the arguments would unquestionably have supported the defense, it does not follow that counsel was incompetent for failing to include them.  Focusing on a small number of key points may be more persuasive than a shotgun approach.  As one expert advises: The number of issues introduced should definitely be restricted.  Research suggests that there is an upper limit to the number of issues or arguments an attorney can present and still have persuasive effect.  R. Matlon, Opening Statements/Closing Arguments 60 (1993) (citing Calder, Insko, & Yandei, The Relation of Cognitive and Memorial Process to Persuasion in a Simulated Jury Trial, 4 J. Applied Social Psychology 62 (1974)).  Another authority says: The advocate is not required to summarize or
comment upon all the facts, opinions, inferences, and
law involved in a case.  A decision not to address an
issue, an opponents theory, or a particular fact should
be based on an analysis of the importance of that subject and the ability of the advocate and the opponent to
explain persuasively the position to the fact finder.
R. Haydock & J. Sonsteng, Advocacy: Opening and Closing 3.10, p. 70 (1994).  In short, judicious selection of argu-
ments for summation is a core exercise of defense counsels
discretion. 


When counsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others, there is a strong presumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect.  See Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690 (counsel is strongly presumed to make decisions in the exercise of professional judgment).  That presumption has particular force where a petitioner bases his ineffective-assistance claim solely on the trial record, creating a situation in which a court may have no way of knowing whether a seemingly unusual or misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motive.  Massaro v. United States, 538 U. S. __, __ (2003) (slip op., at 4).  Moreover, even if an omission is inadvertent, relief is not automatic.  The Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.  See Bell, 535 U. S., at 702; Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 382 (1986); Strickland, supra, at 689; United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656 (1984).  To recall the words of Justice (and former Solicitor General) Jackson: I made three arguments of every case.  First came the one that I plannedas I thought, logical, coherent, complete.  Second was the one actually presentedinterrupted, incoherent, disjointed, disappointing.  The third was the utterly devastating argument that I thought of after going to bed that night.  Advocacy Before the Supreme Court, 37 A.B.A. J. 801, 803 (1951).  Based on the record in this case, a state court could reasonably conclude that Gentry had failed to rebut the presumption of adequate assistance.  Counsel plainly put to the jury the centerpiece of his case: that the only testimony regarding what had happened that the jury heard come from the truth chair was conflicting; that none of his clients testimony was demonstrably a lie; and that the testimony contradicting his client came in three versions.  See 320 F.3d, at 898.  The issues counsel omitted were not so clearly more persuasive than those he discussed that their omission can only be attributed to a professional error of constitutional magnitude.


The Ninth Circuit found other flaws in counsels presentation.  It criticized him for mentioning a host of details that hurt his clients position, none of which mattered as a matter of law.  Id., at 900.  Of course the reason counsel mentioned those details was precisely to remind the jury that they were legally irrelevant.  That was not an unreasonable tactic.  See F. Bailey & H. Rothblatt, Successful Techniques for Criminal Trials 19:23, p. 461 (2d ed. 1985) (Face up to [the defendants] defects  [and] call upon the jury to disregard everything not connected to the crime with which he is charged).  The Ninth Circuit singled out for censure counsels argument that the jury must acquit if Gentry was telling the truth, even though he was a bad person, lousy drug addict, stinking thief, jail bird.  See 320 F.3d, at 900.  It apparently viewed the remark as a gratuitous swipe at Gentrys character.  While confessing a clients shortcomings might remind the jury of facts they otherwise would have forgotten, it might also convince them to put aside facts they would have remembered in any event.  This is precisely the sort of calculated risk that lies at the heart of an advocates discretion.  By candidly acknowledging his clients shortcomings, counsel might have built credibility with the jury and persuaded it to focus on the relevant issues in the case.  See J. Stein, Closing Argument 204, p. 10 (19921996) ([I]f you make certain concessions showing that you are earnestly in search of the truth, then your comments on matters that are in dispute will be received without the usual apprehension surrounding the remarks of an advocate).  As Judge Kleinfeld pointed out in dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, the courts criticism applies just as well to Clarence Darrows closing argument in the Leopold and Loeb case: I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. . . . [Y]our Honor would be merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die; merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind.  320 F.3d, at 895 (quoting Famous American Jury Speeches 1086 (Hicks ed. 1925) (reprint 1990)).


The Ninth Circuit rebuked counsel for making only a passive request that the jury reach some verdict, rather than an express demand for acquittal.  But given a patronizing and overconfident summation by a prosecutor, a low-key strategy that stresses the jurys autonomy is not unreasonable.  One treatise recommends just such a technique: Avoid challenging the jury to find for your client, or phrasing your argument in terms suggesting what their finding must be. [S]cientific research indicates that jurors will react against a lawyer who they think is blatantly trying to limit their freedom of thought.  Stein, supra, 206, at 15.


The Ninth Circuit faulted counsel for not arguing explicitly that the government had failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Counsels entire presentation, however, made just that point.  He repeatedly stressed that no onenot the prosecutor, the jury, nor even himselfcould be sure who was telling the truth.  This is the very essence of a reasonable-doubt argument.  To be sure, he did not insist that the existence of a reasonable doubt would require the jury to acquitbut he could count on the judges charge to remind them of that requirement, and by doing so he would preserve his strategy of appearing as the friend of jury autonomy.  


Finally, the Ninth Circuit criticized counsels approach on the ground that, by confessing that he too could not be sure of the truth, counsel implied that even he did not believe Gentrys testimony.  320 F.3d, at 900.  But there is nothing wrong with a rhetorical device that personalizes the doubts anyone but an eyewitness must necessarily have.  Winning over an audience by empathy is a technique that dates back to Aristotle.  See P. Lagarias, Effective Closing Argument 2.052.06, pp. 99101 (1989) (citing Aristotles Rhetoric for the point that [a] speech should indicate to the audience that the speaker shares the attitudes of the listener, so that, in turn, the listener will respond positively to the views of the speaker); id., 3.03, at 112 (deriving from this principle the advice that counsel may couch his arguments in terms of we, rather than you, the jury).  


To be sure, Gentrys lawyer was no Aristotle or even Clarence Darrow.  But the Ninth Circuits conclusionnot only that his performance was deficient, but that any disagreement with that conclusion would be objectively unreasonablegives too little deference to the state courts that have primary responsibility for supervising defense counsel in state criminal trials.

The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.
It is so ordered.

GEORGIA v. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

No. 02-182. Argued April 29, 2003-Decided June 26, 2003
Georgia's 1997 State Senate districting plan is the benchmark plan for this litigation. That plan drew 56 districts, 11 of them with a total black population of over 50%, and 10 of them with a black voting age population of over 50%. The 2000 census revealed that these numbers had increased so that 13 districts had a black population of at least 50%, with the black voting age population exceeding 50% in 12 of those districts. Mter the 2000 census, the Georgia General Assembly began redistricting the Senate once again. It is uncontested that a substantial majority of Georgia's black voters vote Democratic, and that all elected black representatives in the General Assembly are Democrats. The Senator who chaired the subcommittee that developed the new plan testified he believed that as a district's black voting age population increased beyond what was necessary to elect a candidate, it would push the Senate more toward the Republicans, and correspondingly diminish the power of African-Americans overall. Thus, part of the Democrats' strategy was not only to maintain the number of majority-minority districts and increase the number of Democratic Senate seats, but also to increase the number of so-called ""influence"" districts, where black voters would be able to exert a significant-if not decisive-force in the election process. The new plan therefore ""unpacked"" the most heavily concentrated majority-minority districts in the benchmark plan, and created a number of new influence districts, drawing 13 districts with a majority-black voting age population, 13 additional districts with a black voting age population of between 30%-50%, and 4 other districts with a black voting age population of between 25%-30%. When the Senate adopted the new plan, 10 of the 11 black Senators voted for it. The Georgia House of Representatives passed the plan with 33 of the 34 black Representatives voting for it. No Republican in either body voted for the plan, making the votes of the black legislators necessary for passage. The Governor signed the Senate plan into law in 2001.
Because Georgia is a covered jurisdiction under  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it must submit any new voting ""standard, practice, or procedure"" for preclearance by either the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia in order to ensure that the change ""does not have the purpose [or] effect of denying

No change should be precleared if it ""would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."" Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 141. In order to preclear its 2001 plan, Georgia filed suit in the District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the plan does not violate  5. To satisfy its burden of proving nonretrogression, Georgia submitted detailed evidence documenting, among other things, the total population, total black population, black voting age population, percentage of black registered voters, and the overall percentage of Democratic votes in each district; evidence about how each of these statistics compared to the benchmark districts; testimony from numerous participants in the plan's enactment that it was designed to increase black voting strength throughout the State as well as to help ensure a continued Democratic majority in the Senate; expert testimony that black and nonblack voters have equal chances of electing their preferred candidate when the black voting age population of a district is at 44.3%; and, in response to the United States' objections, more detailed statistical evidence with respect to three proposed Senate districts that the United States found objectionable-Districts 2, 12, and 26-and two districts challenged by the intervenors-Districts 15 and 22. The United States argued that the plan should not be precleared because the changes to the boundaries of Districts 2, 12, and 26 unlawfully reduced black voters' ability to elect candidates of their choice. The United States' evidence focused only on those three districts and was not designed to permit the court to assess the plan's overall impact. The intervenors, four African-Americans, argued that retrogression had occurred in Districts 15 and 22, and presented proposed alternative plans and an expert report critiquing the State's expert report. A three-judge District Court panel held that the plan violated  5, and was therefore not entitled to preclearance.
Held:
1. The District Court did not err in allowing the private litigants to intervene. That court found that the intervenors' analysis of the plan identifies interests not adequately represented by the existing parties. Private parties may intervene in  5 actions assuming they meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, NAACP v. New York, 413 U.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No.02-311. Argued March 24, 2003-Decided June 26, 2003
In 1989, petitioner Wiggins was convicted of capital murder by a Maryland judge and subsequently elected to be sentenced by a jury. His public defenders, Schlaich and Nethercott, moved to bifurcate the sentencing, representing that they planned to prove that Wiggins did not kill the victim by his own hand and then, if necessary, to present a mitigation case. The court denied the motion. At sentencing, Nethercott told the jury in her opening statement that they would hear, among other things, about Wiggins' difficult life, but such evidence was never introduced. Before closing arguments and outside the presence of the jury, Schlaich made a proffer to the court to preserve the bifurcation issue for appeal, detailing the mitigation case counsel would have presented. Schlaich never mentioned Wiggins' life history or family background. The jury sentenced Wiggins to death, and the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed. Represented by new counsel, Wiggins sought postconviction relief, arguing that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence of his dysfunctional background. He presented expert testimony by a forensic social worker about the severe physical and sexual abuse he had suffered at the hands of his mother and while under the care of a series of foster parents. Schlaich testified that he did not remember retaining a forensic social worker to prepare a social history before sentencing, even though state funds were available for that purpose, and explained that he and N ethercott had decided to focus on retrying the factual case and disputing Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. The trial court denied the petition, and the State Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that trial counsel had made a reasoned choice to proceed with what they considered their best defense. Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted Wiggins relief on his federal habeas petition, holding that the Maryland courts' rejection of his ineffective assistance claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. In reversing, the Fourth Circuit found trial counsel's strategic decision to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility to be reasonable.
Held: The performance of Wiggins' attorneys at sentencing violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Pp. 519-538.

511
(a) A federal writ can be granted only if a state court decision ""was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established"" precedents of this Court. 28 U. S. C.  2254(d)(1). This ""unreasonable application"" prong permits the writ to be granted when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applies it to the facts of a petitioner's case. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,413. For this standard to be satisfied, the state court decision must have been ""objectively unreasonable,"" id., at 409, not just incorrect or erroneous. An ineffective assistance claim has two components: A petitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient, and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 687. Performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness, which is defined in terms of prevailing professional norms. Id., at 688. Here, as in Strickland, counsel claim that their limited investigation into petitioner's background reflected a tactical judgment not to present mitigating evidence and to pursue an alternative strategy instead. In evaluating petitioner's claim, this Court's principal concern is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but whether the investigation supporting their decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' background was itselfreasonable. The Court thus conducts an objective review of their performance, measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, including a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct as seen from counsel's perspective at the time of that conduct. Id., at 688, 689. Pp. 519-523.
(b) Counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation. Their decision not to expand their investigation beyond a presentence investigation (PSI) report and Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS) records fell short of the professional standards prevailing in Maryland in 1989. Standard practice in Maryland capital cases at that time included the preparation of a social history report. Although there were funds to retain a forensic social worker, counsel chose not to commission a report. Their conduct similarly fell short of the American Bar Association's capital defense work standards. Moreover, in light of the facts counsel discovered in the DSS records concerning Wiggins' alcoholic mother and his problems in foster care, counsel's decision to cease investigating when they did was unreasonable. Any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing such leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses, particularly given the apparent absence of aggravating factors from Wiggins' background. Indeed, counsel discovered no evidence to suggest that a mitigation case would have been counterproductive or that further investigation would have been fruitless, thus distinguishing this case

S. 668, 687. Performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness, which is defined in terms of prevailing professional norms. Id., at 688. Here, as in Strickland, counsel claim that their limited investigation into petitioner's background reflected a tactical judgment not to present mitigating evidence and to pursue an alternative strategy instead. In evaluating petitioner's claim, this Court's principal concern is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case, but whether the investigation supporting their decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' background was itselfreasonable. The Court thus conducts an objective review of their performance, measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, including a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct as seen from counsel's perspective at the time of that conduct. Id., at 688, 689. Pp. 519-523.
(b) Counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation. Their decision not to expand their investigation beyond a presentence investigation (PSI) report and Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS) records fell short of the professional standards prevailing in Maryland in 1989. Standard practice in Maryland capital cases at that time included the preparation of a social history report. Although there were funds to retain a forensic social worker, counsel chose not to commission a report. Their conduct similarly fell short of the American Bar Association's capital defense work standards. Moreover, in light of the facts counsel discovered in the DSS records concerning Wiggins' alcoholic mother and his problems in foster care, counsel's decision to cease investigating when they did was unreasonable. Any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing such leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses, particularly given the apparent absence of aggravating factors from Wiggins' background. Indeed, counsel discovered no evidence to suggest that a mitigation case would have been counterproductive or that further investigation would have been fruitless, thus distinguishing this case

LAWRENCE ET AL. v. TEXAS
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TEXAS, FOURTEENTH DISTRICT
No. 02-102. Argued March 26, 2003-Decided June 26, 2003
Responding to a reported weapons disturbance in a private residence, Houston police entered petitioner Lawrence's apartment and saw him and another adult man, petitioner Garner, engaging in a private, consensual sexual act. Petitioners were arrested and convicted of deviate sexual intercourse in violation of a Texas statute forbidding two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. In affirming, the State Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that the statute was not unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court considered Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, controlling on that point.
Held: The Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct violates the Due Process Clause. pp. 564-579.
(a) Resolution of this case depends on whether petitioners were free as adults to engage in private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause. For this inquiry the Court deems it necessary to reconsider its Bowers holding. The Bowers Court's initial substantive statement-""The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy ... ,"" 478 U. S., at 190-discloses the Court's failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake. To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it said that marriage is just about the right to have sexual intercourse. Although the laws involved in Bowers and here purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act, their penalties and purposes have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home. They seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals. The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to choose to enter upon relationships in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons. Pp. 564-567.
[559]
(b) Having misapprehended the liberty claim presented to it, the Bowers Court stated that proscriptions against sodomy have ancient roots. 478 U. S., at 192. It should be noted, however, that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter. Early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally, whether between men and women or men and men. Moreover, early sodomy laws seem not to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. Instead, sodomy prosecutions often involved predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent: relations between men and minor girls or boys, between adults involving force, between adults implicating disparity in status, or between men and animals. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which Bowers placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character. Far from possessing ""ancient roots,"" ibid., American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century. Even now, only nine States have singled out samesex relations for criminal prosecution. Thus, the historical grounds relied upon in Bowers are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger there indicated. They are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated. The Bowers Court was, of course, making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral, but this Court's obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate its own moral code, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 850. The Nation's laws and traditions in the past half century are most relevant here. They show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 857. Pp. 567-573.
(c) Bowers' deficiencies became even more apparent in the years following its announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the conduct referenced in Bowers are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct. In those States, including Texas, that still proscribe sodomy (whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct), there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. Casey, supra, at 851-which confirmed that the Due Process Clause protects personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education-and Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 624-which struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals-cast Bow-
[560]
ers' holding into even more doubt. The stigma the Texas criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. Although the offense is but a minor misdemeanor, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged, including notation of convictions on their records and on job application forms, and registration as sex offenders under state law. Where a case's foundations have sustained serious erosion, criticism from other sources is of greater significance. In the United States, criticism of Bowers has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not just as to its historical assumptions. And, to the extent Bowers relied on values shared with a wider civilization, the case's reasoning and holding have been rejected by the European Court of Human Rights, and that other nations have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct. There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent. Stare decisis is not an inexorable command. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828. Bowers' holding has not induced detrimental reliance of the sort that could counsel against overturning it once there are compelling reasons to do so. Casey, supra, at 855856. Bowers causes uncertainty, for the precedents before and after it contradict its central holding. Pp. 573577.
(d) Bowers' rationale does not withstand careful analysis. In his dissenting opinion in Bowers JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that (1) the fact a State's governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice, and (2) individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by due process. That analysis should have controlled Bowers, and it controls here. Bowers was not correct when it was decided, is not correct today, and is hereby overruled. This case does not involve minors, persons who might be injured or coerced, those who might not easily refuse consent, or public conduct or prostitution. It does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. Petitioners' right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in private conduct without government intervention. Casey, supra, at 847. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the individual's personal and private life. Pp. 577-579.

STOGNER v. CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT

No. 01-1757. Argued March 31, 2003-Decided June 26, 2003
In 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limitations permitting prosecution for sex-related child abuse where the prior limitations period has expired if, inter alia, the prosecution is begun within one year of a victim's report to police. A subsequently added provision makes clear that this law revives causes of action barred by prior limitations statutes. In 1998, petitioner Stogner was indicted for sex-related child abuse committed between 1955 and 1973. At the time those crimes were allegedly committed, the limitations period was three years. Stogner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution. The trial court agreed, but the California Court of Appeal reversed. The trial court denied Stogner's subsequent dismissal motion, in which he argued that his prosecution violated the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses. The Court of Appeal affirmed.
Held: A law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution. California's law extends the time in which prosecution is allowed, authorizes prosecutions that the passage of time has previously barred, and was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Such features produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids. First, the law threatens the kinds of harm that the Clause seeks to avoid, for the Clause protects liberty by preventing governments from enacting statutes with ""manifestly unjust and oppressive"" retroactive effects. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391. Second, the law falls literally within the categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws that Justice Chase set forth more than 200 years ago in Calder v. Bull, which this Court has recognized as an authoritative account of the Clause's scope, Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,46. It falls within the second category, which Justice Chase understood to include a new law that inflicts punishments where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment. Third, numerous legislators, courts, and commentators have long believed it well settled that the Clause forbids resurrection of a time-barred prosecution. The Reconstruction Congress of 1867 rejected a bill that would have revived time-barred treason prosecutions against Jefferson Davis

608
Syllabus
and others, passing instead a law extending unexpired limitations periods. Roughly contemporaneous State Supreme Courts echoed the view that laws reviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto. Even courts that have upheld extensions of unexpired statutes of limitations have consistently distinguished situations where the periods have expired, often using language that suggests a presumption that reviving time-barred criminal cases is not allowed. This Court has not previously spoken decisively on this matter. Neither its recognition that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not apply after the relevant limitations period has expired, Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 597-598, nor its holding that a Civil War statute retroactively tolling limitations periods during the war was valid as an exercise of Congress' war powers, Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 503504, dictates the outcome here. Instead, that outcome is determined by the nature of the harms that the law creates, the fact that the law falls within Justice Chase's second category, and a long line of authority. Pp. 610-633.

UNITED STATES ET AL. v. AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA

No. 02-361. Argued March 5, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
Two forms of federal assistance help public libraries provide patrons with Internet access: discounted rates under the E-rate program and grants under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA). Upon discovering that library patrons, including minors, regularly search the Internet for pornography and expose others to pornographic images by leaving them displayed on Internet terminals or printed at library printers, Congress enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which forbids public libraries to receive federal assistance for Internet access unless they install software to block obscene or pornographic images and to prevent minors from accessing material harmful to them. Appellees, a group of libraries, patrons, Web site publishers, and related parties, sued the Government, challenging the constitutionality of CIPA's filtering provisions. Ruling that CIPA is facially unconstitutional and enjoining the Government from withholding federal assistance for failure to comply with CIPA, the District Court held, inter alia, that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Spending Clause because any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment; that the CIPA filtering software constitutes a content-based restriction on access to a public forum that is subject to strict scrutiny; and that, although the Government has a compelling interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, the use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further that interest.
Held: The judgment is reversed. 201 F. Supp. 2d 401, reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded:
1. Because public libraries' use of Internet filtering software does not violate their patrons' First Amendment rights, CIPA does not induce libraries to violate the Constitution, and is a valid exercise of Congress' spending power. Congress has wide latitude to attach conditions to the receipt of federal assistance to further its policy objectives, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206, but may not ""induce"" the recipient ""to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,"" id., at

195
210. To determine whether libraries would violate the First Amendment by employing the CIPA filtering software, the Court must first examine their societal role. To fulfill their traditional missions of facilitating learning and cultural enrichment, public libraries must have broad discretion to decide what material to provide to their patrons. This Court has held in two analogous contexts that the Government has broad discretion to make content-based judgments in deciding what private speech to make available to the public. Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666,672-674; National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 585-586. Just as forum analysis and heightened judicial scrutiny were incompatible with the role of public television stations in the former case and the role of the National Endowment for the Arts in the latter, so are they incompatible with the broad discretion that public libraries must have to consider content in making collection decisions. Thus, the public forum principles on which the District Court relied are out of place in the context of this case. Internet access in public libraries is neither a ""traditional"" nor a ""designated"" public forum. See, e. g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802-803. Unlike the ""Student Activity Fund"" at issue in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 834, Internet terminals are not acquired by a library in order to create a public forum for Web publishers to express themselves. Rather, a library provides such access for the same reasons it offers other library resources: to facilitate research, learning, and recreational pursuits by furnishing materials of requisite and appropriate quality. The fact that a library reviews and affirmatively chooses to acquire every book in its collection, but does not review every Web site that it makes available, is not a constitutionally relevant distinction. The decisions by most libraries to exclude pornography from their print collections are not subjected to heightened scrutiny; it would make little sense to treat libraries' judgments to block online pornography any differently. Moreover, because of the vast quantity of material on the Internet and the rapid pace at which it changes, libraries cannot possibly segregate, item by item, all the Internet material that is appropriate for inclusion from all that is not. While a library could limit its Internet collection to just those sites it found worthwhile, it could do so only at the cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that it lacks the capacity to review. Given that tradeoff, it is entirely reasonable for public libraries to reject that approach and instead exclude certain categories of content, without making individualized judgments that everything made available has requisite and appropriate quality. Concerns over filtering software's tendency to erroneously ""overblock"" access to constitutionally protected speech that falls outside the catego-

GRATZ ET AL. v. BOLLINGER ET AL.
CERTIORARI BEFORE JUDGMENT TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-516. Argued April 1, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
Petitioners Gratz and Hamacher, both of whom are Michigan residents and Caucasian, applied for admission to the University of Michigan's (University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) in 1995 and 1997, respectively. Although the LSA considered Gratz to be well qualified and Hamacher to be within the qualified range, both were denied early admission and were ultimately denied admission. In order to promote consistency in the review of the many applications received, the University's Office of Undergraduate Admissions (OUA) uses written guidelines for each academic year. The guidelines have changed a number of times during the period relevant to this litigation. The OUA considers a number of factors in making admissions decisions, including high school grades, standardized test scores, high school quality, curriculum strength, geography, alumni relationships, leadership, and race. During all relevant periods, the University has considered MricanAmericans, Hispanics, and Native Americans to be ""underrepresented minorities,"" and it is undisputed that the University admits virtually every qualified applicant from these groups. The current guidelines use a selection method under which every applicant from an underrepresented racial or ethnic minority group is automatically awarded 20 points of the 100 needed to guarantee admission.
Petitioners filed this class action alleging that the University's use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S. C.  1981. They sought compensatory and punitive damages for past violations, declaratory relief finding that respondents violated their rights to nondiscriminatory treatment, an injunction prohibiting respondents from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race, and an order requiring the LSA to offer Hamacher admission as a transfer student. The District Court granted petitioners' motion to certify a class consisting of individuals who applied for and were denied admission to the LSA for academic year 1995 and forward and who are members of racial or ethnic groups that respondents treated less favorably on the basis of race. Hamacher, whose claim was found to challenge racial discrimination on a classwide basis, was designated as the class representative. On cross-motions for summary judgment, respondents relied on Justice Powell's principal opinion in Regents of
[245]
Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 317, which expressed the view that the consideration of race as a factor in admissions might in some cases serve a compelling government interest. Respondents contended that the LSA has just such an interest in the educational benefits that result from having a racially and ethnically diverse student body and that its program is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The court agreed with respondents as to the LSA's current admissions guidelines and granted them summary judgment in that respect. However, the court also found that the LSA's admissions guidelines for 1995 through 1998 operated as the functional equivalent of a quota running afoul of Justice Powell's Bakke opinion, and thus granted petitioners summary judgment with respect to respondents' admissions programs for those years. While interlocutory appeals were pending in the Sixth Circuit, that court issued an opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, p. 306, upholding the admissions program used by the University's Law School. This Court granted certiorari in both cases, even though the Sixth Circuit had not yet rendered judgment in this one.
Held:
1. Petitioners have standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief.
The Court rejects JUSTICE STEVENS' contention that, because Hamacher did not actually apply for admission as a transfer student, his future injury claim is at best conjectural or hypothetical rather than real and immediate. The ""injury in fact"" necessary to establish standing in this type of case is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666. In the face of such a barrier, to establish standing, a party need only demonstrate that it is able and ready to perform and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis. Ibid. In bringing his equal protection challenge against the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions, Hamacher alleged that the University had denied him the opportunity to compete for admission on an equal basis. Hamacher was denied admission to the University as a freshman applicant even though an underrepresented minority applicant with his qualifications would have been admitted. Mter being denied admission, Hamacher demonstrated that he was ""able and ready"" to apply as a transfer student should the University cease to use race in undergraduate admissions. He therefore has standing to seek prospective relief with respect to the University's continued use of race. Also rejected is JUSTICE STEVENS' contention that such use in undergraduate transfer admissions differs from the University's use of race in undergraduate freshman admissions, so that Hamacher lacks standing to represent absent class members challenging the latter. Each year the QUA produces a document setting forth
[246]
guidelines for those seeking admission to the LSA, including freshman and transfer applicants. The transfer applicant guidelines specifically cross-reference factors and qualifications considered in assessing freshman applicants. In fact, the criteria used to determine whether a transfer applicant will contribute to diversity are identical to those used to evaluate freshman applicants. The only difference is that all underrepresented minority freshman applicants receive 20 points and ""virtually"" all who are minimally qualified are admitted, while ""generally"" all minimally qualified minority transfer applicants are admitted outright. While this difference might be relevant to a narrow tailoring analysis, it clearly has no effect on petitioners' standing to challenge the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions and its assertion that diversity is a compelling state interest justifying its consideration of the race of its undergraduate applicants. See General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159; Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, distinguished. The District Court's carefully considered decision to certify this class action is correct. Cf. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469. Hamacher's personal stake, in view of both his past injury and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain the action. Pp. 260-268.
2. Because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted interest in diversity, the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause. For the reasons set forth in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 327-333, the Court has today rejected petitioners' argument that diversity cannot constitute a compelling state interest. However, the Court finds that the University's current policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single ""underrepresented minority"" applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve educational diversity. In Bakke, Justice Powell explained his view that it would be permissible for a university to employ an admissions program in which ""race or ethnic background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular applicant's file."" 438 U.S., at 317. He emphasized, however, the importance of considering each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability to contribute to the unique setting of higher education. The admissions program Justice Powell described did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. See id., at 315. The current LSA policy does not provide the individualized consideration Justice Powell contemplated. The only consideration that accompanies the 20-point automatic distribution to all applicants from underrepresented minorities is a factual review to determine whether an individual is a member
[247]
of one of these minority groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell's example, where the race of a ""particular black applicant"" could be considered without being decisive, see id., at 317, the LSA's 20-point distribution has the effect of making ""the factor of race ... decisive"" for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant, ibid. The fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicant's file being flagged for individualized consideration only emphasizes the flaws of the University's system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell. The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the LSA's program. Also, this individualized review is only provided after admissions counselors automatically distribute the University's version of a ""plus"" that makes race a decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant. The Court rejects respondents' contention that the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for the LSA to use the admissions system upheld today in Grutter. The fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system. See, e.g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 508. Nothing in Justice Powell's Bakke opinion signaled that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve diversity without regard to the limits imposed by strict scrutiny. Pp. 268-275.

3. Because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, it also violates Title VI and 1981. See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281; General Building Contractors Assn. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 389-390. Accordingly, the Court reverses that portion of the District Courts decision granting respondents summary judgment with respect to liability. Pp. 275-276.
Reversed in part and remanded.

See General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 159; Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, distinguished. The District Court's carefully considered decision to certify this class action is correct. Cf. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469. Hamacher's personal stake, in view of both his past injury and the potential injury he faced at the time of certification, demonstrates that he may maintain the action. Pp. 260-268.
2. Because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted interest in diversity, the policy violates the Equal Protection Clause. For the reasons set forth in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 327-333, the Court has today rejected petitioners' argument that diversity cannot constitute a compelling state interest. However, the Court finds that the University's current policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single ""underrepresented minority"" applicant solely because of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve educational diversity. In Bakke, Justice Powell explained his view that it would be permissible for a university to employ an admissions program in which ""race or ethnic background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular applicant's file."" 438 U.S., at 317. He emphasized, however, the importance of considering each particular applicant as an individual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability to contribute to the unique setting of higher education. The admissions program Justice Powell described did not contemplate that any single characteristic automatically ensured a specific and identifiable contribution to a university's diversity. See id., at 315. The current LSA policy does not provide the individualized consideration Justice Powell contemplated. The only consideration that accompanies the 20-point automatic distribution to all applicants from underrepresented minorities is a factual review to determine whether an individual is a member
[247]
of one of these minority groups. Moreover, unlike Justice Powell's example, where the race of a ""particular black applicant"" could be considered without being decisive, see id., at 317, the LSA's 20-point distribution has the effect of making ""the factor of race ... decisive"" for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant, ibid. The fact that the LSA has created the possibility of an applicant's file being flagged for individualized consideration only emphasizes the flaws of the University's system as a whole when compared to that described by Justice Powell. The record does not reveal precisely how many applications are flagged, but it is undisputed that such consideration is the exception and not the rule in the LSA's program. Also, this individualized review is only provided after admissions counselors automatically distribute the University's version of a ""plus"" that makes race a decisive factor for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant. The Court rejects respondents' contention that the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it impractical for the LSA to use the admissions system upheld today in Grutter. The fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system. See, e.g., Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 508. Nothing in Justice Powell's Bakke opinion signaled that a university may employ whatever means it desires to achieve diversity without regard to the limits imposed by strict scrutiny. Pp. 268-275.

3. Because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy violates the Equal Protection Clause, it also violates Title VI and 1981. See, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281; General Building Contractors Assn. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 389-390. Accordingly, the Court reverses that portion of the District Courts decision granting respondents summary judgment with respect to liability. Pp. 275-276.
Reversed in part and remanded.

GRUTTER v. BOLLINGER ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No.02-241. Argued April 1, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
The University of Michigan Law School (Law School), one of the Nation's top law schools, follows an official admissions policy that seeks to achieve student body diversity through compliance with Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265. Focusing on students' academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of their talents, experiences, and potential, the policy requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including a personal statement, letters of recommendation, an essay describing how the applicant will contribute to Law School life and diversity, and the applicant's undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score. Additionally, officials must look beyond grades and scores to so-called ""soft variables,"" such as recommenders' enthusiasm, the quality of the undergraduate institution and the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection. The policy does not define diversity solely in terms of racial and ethnic status and does not restrict the types of diversity contributions eligible for ""substantial weight,"" but it does reaffirm the Law School's commitment to diversity with special reference to the inclusion of African-American, Hispanic, and Native-American students, who otherwise might not be represented in the student body in meaningful numbers. By enrolling a ""critical mass"" of underrepresented minority students, the policy seeks to ensure their ability to contribute to the Law School's character and to the legal profession.
When the Law School denied admission to petitioner Grutter, a white Michigan resident with a 3.8 GPA and 161 LSAT score, she filed this suit, alleging that respondents had discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U. S. C.  1981; that she was rejected because the Law School uses race as a ""predominant"" factor, giving applicants belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups; and that respondents had no compelling interest to justify that use of race. The District Court found the Law School's use of race as an admissions factor unlawful. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing
[307]
diversity as a compelling state interest, and that the Law School's use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a ""potential 'plus' factor"" and because the Law School's program was virtually identical to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion.
Held: The Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body is not prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause, Title VI, or  1981. Pp. 322-344.
(a) In the landmark Bakke case, this Court reviewed a medical school's racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats for members of certain minority groups. The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority. Four Justices would have upheld the program on the ground that the government can use race to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice. 438 U. S., at 325. Four other Justices would have struck the program down on statutory grounds. Id., at 408. Justice Powell, announcing the Court's judgment, provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the program, but also for reversing the state court's injunction against any use of race whatsoever. In a part of his opinion that was joined by no other Justice, Justice Powell expressed his view that attaining a diverse student body was the only interest asserted by the university that survived scrutiny. Id., at 311. Grounding his analysis in the academic freedom that ""long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment,"" id., at 312, 314, Justice Powell emphasized that the ""'nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation."" Id., at 313. However, he also emphasized that ""[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,"" that can justify using race. Id., at 315. Rather, ""[t]he diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element."" Ibid. Since Bakke, Justice Powell's opinion has been the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powell's views. Courts, however, have struggled to discern whether Justice Powell's diversity rationale is binding precedent. The Court finds it unnecessary to decide this issue because the Court endorses Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest in the context of university admissions. Pp. 322-325.
[308]
(b) All government racial classifications must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U. S. 200, 227. But not all such uses are invalidated by strict scrutiny. Race-based action necessary to further a compelling governmental interest does not violate the Equal Protection Clause so long as it is narrowly tailored to further that interest. E. g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 908. Context matters when reviewing such action. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343-344. Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the government's reasons for using race in a particular context. Pp. 326-327.
(c) The Court endorses Justice Powell's view that student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in university admissions. The Court defers to the Law School's educational judgment that diversity is essential to its educational mission. The Court's scrutiny of that interest is no less strict for taking into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the university's expertise. See, e. g., Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319, n. 53 (opinion of Powell, J.). Attaining a diverse student body is at the heart of the Law School's proper institutional mission, and its ""good faith"" is ""presumed"" absent ""a showing to the contrary."" Id., at 318-319. Enrolling a ""critical mass"" of minority students simply to assure some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin would be patently unconstitutional. E.g., id., at 307. But the Law School defines its critical mass concept by reference to the substantial, important, and laudable educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce, including cross-racial understanding and the breaking down of racial stereotypes. The Law School's claim is further bolstered by numerous expert studies and reports showing that such diversity promotes learning outcomes and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse work force, for society, and for the legal profession. Major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints. High-ranking retired officers and civilian military leaders assert that a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to national security. Moreover, because universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training ground for a large number of the Nation's leaders, Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 634, the path to leadership must be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. Thus, the Law School has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body. Pp. 327-333.
[309]
(d) The Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot ""insulat[e] each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other applicants."" Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, it may consider race or ethnicity only as a ""'plus' in a particular applicant's file""; i. e., it must be ""flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight,"" id., at 317. It follows that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial or ethnic groups or put them on separate admissions tracks. See id., at 315-316. The Law School's admissions program, like the Harvard plan approved by Justice Powell, satisfies these requirements. Moreover, the program is flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes race or ethnicity the defining feature of the application. See id., at 317. The Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment. There is no policy, either de jure or de facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single ""soft"" variable. Gratz v. Bollinger, ante, p. 244, distinguished. Also, the program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race. Moreover, the Law School frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minority applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. The Court rejects the argument that the Law School should have used other race-neutral means to obtain the educational benefits of student body diversity, e.g., a lottery system or decreasing the emphasis on GPA and LSAT scores. N arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative or mandate that a university choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence or fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups. See, e. g., Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6. The Court is satisfied that the Law School adequately considered the available alternatives. The Court is also satisfied that, in the context of individualized consideration of the possible diversity contributions of each applicant, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants. Finally, race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial
[310]
preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today. Pp. 333-343.
(e) Because the Law School's use of race in admissions decisions is not prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause, petitioner's statutory claims based on Title VI and  1981 also fail. See Bakke, supra, at 287 (opinion of Powell, J.); General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389-391. Pp. 343-344.
288 F.3d 732, affirmed.
O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined, and in which SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., joined in part insofar as it is consistent with the views expressed in Part VII of the opinion of THOMAS, J.

AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION ET AL. v.
GARAMENDI, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, STATE OF CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-722. Argued April 23, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
The Nazi Government of Germany confiscated the value or proceeds of many Jewish life insurance policies issued before and during the Second World War. Mter the war, even a policy that had escaped confiscation was likely to be dishonored, whether because insurers denied its existence or claimed it had lapsed from unpaid premiums, or because the German Government would not provide heirs with documentation of the policyholder's death. Responsibility as between the government and insurance companies is disputed, but the fact is that the proceeds of many insurance policies issued to Jews before and during the war were paid to the Third Reich or never paid at all. These confiscations and frustrations of claims fell within the subject of reparations, which became a principal object of Allied diplomacy after the war. Ultimately, the western Allies placed the obligation to provide restitution to victims of Nazi persecution on the new West German Government, which enacted restitution laws and signed agreements with other countries for the compensation of their nationals. Despite a payout of more than 100 billion deutsch marks as of 2000, however, these measures left out many claimants and certain types of claims. Mter German reunification, class actions for restitution poured into United States courts against companies doing business in Germany during the Nazi era. Protests by defendant companies and their governments prompted the United States Government to take action to try to resolve the matter. Negotiations at the national level produced the German Foundation Agreement, in which Germany agreed to establish a foundation funded with 10 billion deutsch marks contributed equally by the German Government and German companies to compensate the companies' victims during the Nazi era. The President agreed that whenever a German company was sued on a Holocaust-era claim in an American court, the Government would (1) submit a statement that it would be in this country's foreign policy interests for the foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for such claims, and (2) try to get state and local governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive mechanism. As for insurance claims in particular, both countries agreed that the German

397
Foundation would work with the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC), a voluntary organization whose mission is to negotiate with European insurers to provide information about and settlement of unpaid insurance policies, and which has set up procedures to that end. The German agreement has served as a model for similar agreements with Austria and France.
Meanwhile, California began its own enquiry into the issue, prompting state legislation designed to force payment by defaulting insurers.

AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION ET AL. v.
GARAMENDI, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER, STATE OF CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-722. Argued April 23, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
The Nazi Government of Germany confiscated the value or proceeds of many Jewish life insurance policies issued before and during the Second World War. Mter the war, even a policy that had escaped confiscation was likely to be dishonored, whether because insurers denied its existence or claimed it had lapsed from unpaid premiums, or because the German Government would not provide heirs with documentation of the policyholder's death. Responsibility as between the government and insurance companies is disputed, but the fact is that the proceeds of many insurance policies issued to Jews before and during the war were paid to the Third Reich or never paid at all. These confiscations and frustrations of claims fell within the subject of reparations, which became a principal object of Allied diplomacy after the war. Ultimately, the western Allies placed the obligation to provide restitution to victims of Nazi persecution on the new West German Government, which enacted restitution laws and signed agreements with other countries for the compensation of their nationals. Despite a payout of more than 100 billion deutsch marks as of 2000, however, these measures left out many claimants and certain types of claims. Mter German reunification, class actions for restitution poured into United States courts against companies doing business in Germany during the Nazi era. Protests by defendant companies and their governments prompted the United States Government to take action to try to resolve the matter. Negotiations at the national level produced the German Foundation Agreement, in which Germany agreed to establish a foundation funded with 10 billion deutsch marks contributed equally by the German Government and German companies to compensate the companies' victims during the Nazi era. The President agreed that whenever a German company was sued on a Holocaust-era claim in an American court, the Government would (1) submit a statement that it would be in this country's foreign policy interests for the foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for such claims, and (2) try to get state and local governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive mechanism. As for insurance claims in particular, both countries agreed that the German

397
Foundation would work with the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC), a voluntary organization whose mission is to negotiate with European insurers to provide information about and settlement of unpaid insurance policies, and which has set up procedures to that end. The German agreement has served as a model for similar agreements with Austria and France.
Meanwhile, California began its own enquiry into the issue, prompting state legislation designed to force payment by defaulting insurers. Among other laws, California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act of 1999 (HVIRA) requires any insurer doing business in the State to disclose information about all policies sold in Europe between 1920 and 1945 by the company or anyone ""related"" to it upon penalty of loss of its state business license.

GREEN TREE FINANCIAL CORP., NKA CONSECO FINANCE CORP. v. BAZZLE ET AL., IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF A CLASS AND FOR ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA No. 02-634. Argued April 22, 2003-Decided June 23, 2003
The Bazzle respondents and the Lackey and Buggs respondents separately entered into contracts with petitioner Green Tree Financial Corp. that were governed by South Carolina law and included an arbitration clause governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Each set of respondents filed a state-court action, complaining that Green Tree's failure to provide them with a form that would have told them of their right to name their own lawyers and insurance agents violated South Carolina law, and seeking damages. The Bazzles moved for class certification, and Green Tree sought to stay the court proceedings and compel arbitration. Mter the court certified a class and compelled arbitration, Green Tree selected, with the Bazzles' consent, an arbitrator who later awarded the class damages and attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award, and Green Tree appealed, claiming, among other things, that class arbitration was legally impermissible. Lackey and the Buggses also sought class certification and Green Tree moved to compel arbitration. The trial court denied Green Tree's motion, finding the agreement unenforceable, but the state appeals court reversed. The parties then chose an arbitrator, the same arbitrator who was later chosen to arbitrate the Bazzles' dispute. The arbitrator certified a class and awarded it damages and attorney's fees. The trial court confirmed the award, and Green Tree appealed. The State Supreme Court withdrew both cases from the appeals court, assumed jurisdiction, and consolidated the proceedings. That court held that the contracts were silent in respect to class arbitration, that they consequently authorized class arbitration, and that arbitration had properly taken that form.
Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. 351 S. C. 244, 569 S. E. 2d 349, vacated and remanded.
JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded that an arbitrator must determine whether the contracts forbid class arbitration. Pp. 450-454.
(a) Green Tree argues that the contracts are not silent-that they forbid arbitration. If the contracts are not silent, then the state court's

445
holding is flawed on its own terms; that court neither said nor implied that it would have authorized class arbitration had the parties' arbitration agreement forbidden it. Whether Green Tree is right about the contracts presents a disputed issue of contract interpretation. The contracts say that disputes ""shall be resolved ... by one arbitrator selected by us [Green Tree] with consent of you [Green Tree's customer]."" The class arbitrator was ""selected by"" Green Tree ""with consent of"" Green Tree's customers, the named plaintiffs. And insofar as the other class members agreed to proceed in class arbitration, they consented as well. Green Tree did not independently select this arbitrator to arbitrate its dispute with the other class members, but whether the contracts contain such a requirement is not decided by the literal contract terms. Whether ""selected by [Green Tree]"" means ""selected by [Green Tree] to arbitrate this dispute and no other (even identical) dispute with another customer"" is the question at issue: Do the contracts forbid class arbitration? Given the broad authority they elsewhere bestow upon the arbitrator, the answer is not completely obvious. The parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator ""[alll disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract."" And the dispute about what the arbitration contracts mean is a dispute ""relating to this contract"" and the resulting ""relationships."" Hence the parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator, not a judge, would answer the relevant question, and any doubt about the ""'scope of arbitrable issues'"" should be resolved"" 'in favor of arbitration.''' Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 626. The question here does not fall into the limited circumstances where courts assume that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators, to decide a particular arbitration-related matter, as it concerns neither the arbitration clause's validity nor its applicability to the underlying dispute. The relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to, which does not concern a state statute or judicial procedures, cf. Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, but rather contract interpretation and arbitration procedures. Arbitrators are well situated to answer that question. Pp. 450-453.
(b) With respect to the question whether the contracts forbid class arbitration, the parties have not yet obtained the arbitration decision that their contracts foresee. Regarding Bazzle plaintiffs, the State Supreme Court wrote that the trial court issued an order granting class certification and the arbitrator subsequently administered class arbitration proceedings without the trial court's further involvement. As for Lackey plaintiffs, the arbitrator decided to certify the class after the trial court had determined that the identical contract in the Bazzle case

VIRGINIA v. HICKS
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA No.02-371. Argued April 30, 2003-Decided June 16,2003
The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA), a political subdivision of Virginia, owns and operates Whitcomb Court, a lowincome housing development. In 1997, the Richmond City Council conveyed Whitcomb Court's streets to the RRHA in an effort to combat crime and drug dealing by nonresidents. In accordance with the terms of conveyance, the RRHA enacted a policy authorizing the Richmond police to serve notice on any person lacking ""a legitimate business or social purpose"" for being on the premises and to arrest for trespassing any person who remains or returns after having been so notified. The RRHA gave respondent Hicks, a nonresident, written notice barring him from Whitcomb Court. Subsequently, he trespassed there and was arrested and convicted. At trial, he claimed that RRHA's policy was, among other things, unconstitutionally overbroad. The Virginia Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. In affirming, the Virginia Supreme Court found the policy unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because an unwritten rule that leafleting and demonstrating require advance permission vested too much discretion in Whitcomb Court's manager.
Held: The RRHA's trespass policy is not facially invalid under the First Amendment's overbreadth doctrine. Pp. 118-124.
(a) Under that doctrine, a showing that a law punishes a ""substantial"" amount of protected free speech, ""in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,"" Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 615, suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law ""until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression,"" id., at 613. Only substantial overbreadth supports such facial invalidation, since there are significant social costs in blocking a law's application to constitutionally unprotected conduct. Pp. 118-120.
(b) This Court has jurisdiction to review the First Amendment merits question here. Virginia's actual injury in fact-the inability to prosecute Hicks for trespass-is sufficiently distinct and palpable to confer Article III standing. pp. 120-121.
(c) Even assuming the invalidity of the ""unwritten"" rule for leafleters and demonstrators, Hicks has not shown that the RRHA policy prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech in relation to its many legit-

Syllabus
imate applications. Both the notice-barment rule and the ""legitimate business or social purpose"" rule apply to all persons entering Whitcomb Court's streets, not just to those seeking to engage in expression. Neither the basis for the barment sanction (a prior trespass) nor its purpose (preventing future trespasses) implicates the First Amendment. An overbreadth challenge rarely succeeds against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or conduct necessarily associated with speech. Any applications of the RRHA's policy that violate the First Amendment can be remedied through as-applied litigation. Pp. 121-124.

OVERTON, DIRECTOR, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. v. BAZZETTA ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-94. Argued March 26, 2003-Decided June 16,2003
Responding to concerns about prison security problems caused by the increasing number of visitors to Michigan's prisons and about substance abuse among inmates, the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) promulgated new regulations limiting prison visitation. An inmate may be visited by qualified clergy and attorneys on business and by persons placed on an approved list, which may include an unlimited number of immediate family members and 10 others; minor children are not permitted to visit unless they are the children, stepchildren, grandchildren, or siblings of the inmate; if the inmate's parental rights are terminated, the child may not visit; a child visitor must be accompanied by a family member of the child or inmate or the child's legal guardian; former prisoners are not permitted to visit except that a former prisoner who is an immediate family member of an inmate may visit if the warden approves. Prisoners who commit two substance-abuse violations may receive only clergy and attorneys, but may apply for reinstatement of visitation privileges after two years. Respondents-prisoners, their friends, and family members-filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 action, alleging that the regulations as they pertain to non contact visits violate the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court agreed, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1. The fact that the regulations bear a rational relation to legitimate penological interests suffices to sustain them regardless of whether respondents have a constitutional right of association that has survived incarceration. This Court accords substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining a corrections system's legitimate goals and determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them. The regulations satisfy each of four factors used to decide whether a prison regulation affecting a constitutional right that survives incarceration withstands constitutional challenge. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89-91. First, the regulations bear a rational relationship to a legitimate penological interest. The restrictions on children's visitation are related to MDOC's valid interests in maintaining internal security and

127
protecting child visitors from exposure to sexual or other misconduct or from accidental injury. They promote internal security, perhaps the most legitimate penological goal, by reducing the total number of visitors and by limiting disruption caused by children. It is also reasonable to ensure that the visiting child is accompanied and supervised by adults charged with protecting the child's best interests. Prohibiting visitation by former inmates bears a self-evident connection to the State's interest in maintaining prison security and preventing future crime. Restricting visitation for inmates with two substance-abuse violations serves the legitimate goal of deterring drug and alcohol use within prison. Second, respondents have alternative means of exercising their asserted right of association with those prohibited from visiting. They can send messages through those who are permitted to visit, and can communicate by letter and telephone. Visitation alternatives need not be ideal; they need only be available. Third, accommodating the associational right would have a considerable impact on guards, other inmates, the allocation of prison resources, and the safety of visitors by causing a significant reallocation of the prison system's financial resources and by impairing corrections officers' ability to protect all those inside a prison's walls. Finally, respondents have suggested no alternatives that fully accommodate the asserted right while not imposing more than a de minimis cost to the valid penological goals. Pp. 131-136.
2. The visitation restriction for inmates with two substance-abuse violations is not a cruel and unusual confinement condition violating the Eighth Amendment. Withdrawing visitation privileges for a limited period in order to effect prison discipline is not a dramatic departure from accepted standards for confinement conditions. Nor does the regulation create inhumane prison conditions, deprive inmates of basic necessities or fail to protect their health or safety, or involve the infliction of pain or injury or deliberate indifference to their risk. Pp. 136-137.

An inmate may be visited by qualified clergy and attorneys on business and by persons placed on an approved list, which may include an unlimited number of immediate family members and 10 others; minor children are not permitted to visit unless they are the children, stepchildren, grandchildren, or siblings of the inmate; if the inmate's parental rights are terminated, the child may not visit; a child visitor must be accompanied by a family member of the child or inmate or the child's legal guardian; former prisoners are not permitted to visit except that a former prisoner who is an immediate family member of an inmate may visit if the warden approves. Prisoners who commit two substance-abuse violations may receive only clergy and attorneys, but may apply for reinstatement of visitation privileges after two years. Respondents-prisoners, their friends, and family members-filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 action, alleging that the regulations as they pertain to non contact visits violate the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court agreed, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1. The fact that the regulations bear a rational relation to legitimate penological interests suffices to sustain them regardless of whether respondents have a constitutional right of association that has survived incarceration. This Court accords substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining a corrections system's legitimate goals and determining the most appropriate means to accomplish them. The regulations satisfy each of four factors used to decide whether a prison regulation affecting a constitutional right that survives incarceration withstands constitutional challenge. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89-91. First, the regulations bear a rational relationship to a legitimate penological interest. The restrictions on children's visitation are related to MDOC's valid interests in maintaining internal security and

127
protecting child visitors from exposure to sexual or other misconduct or from accidental injury. They promote internal security, perhaps the most legitimate penological goal, by reducing the total number of visitors and by limiting disruption caused by children. It is also reasonable to ensure that the visiting child is accompanied and supervised by adults charged with protecting the child's best interests. Prohibiting visitation by former inmates bears a self-evident connection to the State's interest in maintaining prison security and preventing future crime. Restricting visitation for inmates with two substance-abuse violations serves the legitimate goal of deterring drug and alcohol use within prison. Second, respondents have alternative means of exercising their asserted right of association with those prohibited from visiting. They can send messages through those who are permitted to visit, and can communicate by letter and telephone. Visitation alternatives need not be ideal; they need only be available. Third, accommodating the associational right would have a considerable impact on guards, other inmates, the allocation of prison resources, and the safety of visitors by causing a significant reallocation of the prison system's financial resources and by impairing corrections officers' ability to protect all those inside a prison's walls. Finally, respondents have suggested no alternatives that fully accommodate the asserted right while not imposing more than a de minimis cost to the valid penological goals. Pp. 131-136.
2. The visitation restriction for inmates with two substance-abuse violations is not a cruel and unusual confinement condition violating the Eighth Amendment. Withdrawing visitation privileges for a limited period in order to effect prison discipline is not a dramatic departure from accepted standards for confinement conditions. Nor does the regulation create inhumane prison conditions, deprive inmates of basic necessities or fail to protect their health or safety, or involve the infliction of pain or injury or deliberate indifference to their risk. Pp. 136-137.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION v. BEAUMONT ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-403. Argued March 25, 2003-Decided June 16,2003
A corporation is prohibited from making ""a contribution or expenditure in connection with"" certain federal elections, 2 U. S. C.  441b(a), but not from establishing, administering, and soliciting contributions to a separate fund to be used for political purposes, 441b(b)(2)(C). Such a PAC (so called after the political action committee that runs it) is free to make contributions and other expenditures in connection with federal elections. Respondents, a nonprofit advocacy corporation known as North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., and others (collectively NCRL), sued petitioner Federal Election Commission (FE C), challenging the constitutionality of  441b and its implementing regulations as applied to NCRL. As relevant here, the District Court granted NCRL summary judgment as to the ban on direct contributions, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held: Applying the direct contribution prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 152-163.
(a) An attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate political contributions goes against the current of a century of congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially deleterious influences on federal elections. Since 1907, federal law has barred such direct corporate contributions. Much of the subsequent congressional attention to corporate political activity has been meant to strengthen the original, core prohibition on such contributions. Federal Election Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459 U. S. 197. As in 1907, current law focuses on the corporate structure's special characteristics that threaten the integrity of the political process. Id., at 209. In barring corporate earnings from turning into political ""war chests,"" the ban was and is intended to ""preven[t] corruption or the appearance of corruption."" Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 496-497. The ban also protects individuals who have paid money into a corporation or union for other purposes from having their money used to support political candidates to whom they may be opposed, National Right to Work, supra, at 208, and hedges

147
against use of corporations as conduits for circumventing ""valid contribution limits,"" Federal Election Comm'n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431,456, and n. 18. Pp. 152-156.
(b) National Right to Work all but decided against NCRUs position that  441b's ban on direct contributions is unconstitutional as applied to nonprofit advocacy corporations. There, this Court upheld the part of  441b restricting a nonstock corporation to its membership when soliciting PAC contributions, concluding that the congressional judgment to regulate corporate political involvement warrants considerable deference and reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers that corporations pose to the electoral process. 459 U. S., at 207-211. It would be hard to read this conclusion, except on the practical understanding that the corporation's capacity to make contributions was legitimately limited to indirect donations within the scope allowed to PACs. And the Court specifically rejected the argument made here, that deference to congressional judgments about corporate contribution limits turns on details of corporate form or the affluence of particular corporations. National Right to Work has repeatedly been read as approving  441b's prohibition on direct contributions, even by nonprofit corporations without great financial resources. Equal significance must be accorded to Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, on which NCRL and the Fourth Circuit have relied. In holding  441b's prohibition on independent expenditures unconstitutional as applied to a nonprofit advocacy corporation, the Court there distinguished National Right to Work on the ground that it addressed regulation of contributions, not expenditures. Pp. 156-159.
(c) This Court could not hold for NCRL without recasting its understanding of the risks of harm posed by corporate political contributions, of the expressive significance of contributions, and of the consequent deference owed to legislative judgments on what to do about them. NCRUs efforts do not unsettle existing law on these points. Its argument that Massachusetts Citizens for Life-type corporations pose no potential threat to the political system is rejected. Concern about the corrupting potential underlying the corporate ban may be implicated by advocacy corporations, which, like their for-profit counterparts, benefit from state-created advantages and may be able to amass substantial political war chests. Also rejected is NCRUs argument that the application of the ban on direct contributions should be subject to strict scrutiny because  441b bars, rather than limits, contributions based on their source. When reviewing political financial restrictions, the level of scrutiny is based on the importance of the political activity at issue to effective speech or political association, and restrictions on political

SELL v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-5664. Argued March 3, 2003-Decided June 16,2003
A Federal Magistrate Judge (Magistrate) initially found petitioner Sell, who has a long history of mental illness, competent to stand trial for fraud and released him on bail, but later revoked bail because Sell's condition had worsened. Sell subsequently asked the Magistrate to reconsider his competence to stand trial for fraud and attempted murder. The Magistrate had him examined at a United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (Medical Center), found him mentally incompetent to stand trial, and ordered his hospitalization to determine whether he would attain the capacity to allow his trial to proceed. While there, Sell refused the staff's recommendation to take antipsychotic medication. Medical Center authorities decided to allow involuntary medication, which Sell challenged in court. The Magistrate authorized forced administration of antipsychotic drugs, finding that Sell was a danger to himself and others, that medication was the only way to render him less dangerous, that any serious side effects could be ameliorated, that the benefits to Sell outweighed the risks, and that the drugs were substantially likely to return Sell to competence. In affirming, the District Court found the Magistrate's dangerousness finding clearly erroneous but concluded that medication was the only viable hope of rendering Sell competent to stand trial and was necessary to serve the Government's interest in obtaining an adjudication of his guilt or innocence. The Eighth Circuit affirmed. Focusing solely on the fraud charges, it found that the Government had an essential interest in bringing Sell to trial, that the treatment was medically appropriate, and that the medical evidence indicated a reasonable probability that Sell would fairly be able to participate in his trial.
Held:
1. The Eighth Circuit had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The District Court's pretrial order was an appealable ""collateral order"" within the exceptions to the rule that only final judgments are appealable. The order conclusively determines the disputed question whether Sell has a legal right to avoid forced medication. Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468. It also resolves an important issue, for involuntary medical treatment raises questions of clear constitutional importance. Ibid. And the issue is effectively unreviewable on appeal

167
from a final judgment, ibid., since, by the time of trial, Sell will have undergone forced medication-the very harm that he seeks to avoid and which cannot be undone by an acquittal. Pp.175-177.
2. Under the framework of Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, and Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, the Constitution permits the Government involuntarily to administer antipsychotic drugs to render a mentally ill defendant competent to stand trial on serious criminal charges if the treatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may undermine the trial's fairness, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is necessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests. Pp. 177-183.
(a) This standard will permit forced medication solely for trial competence purposes in certain instances. But these instances may be rare, because the standard says or fairly implies the following: First, a court must find that important governmental interests are at stake. The Government's interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important. However, courts must consider each case's facts in evaluating this interest because special circumstances may lessen its importance, e. g., a defendant's refusal to take drugs may mean lengthy confinement in an institution, which would diminish the risks of freeing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime. In addition to its substantial interest in timely prosecution, the Government has a concomitant interest in assuring a defendant a fair trial. Second, the court must conclude that forced medication will significantly further those concomitant state interests. It must find that medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial and substantially unlikely to have side effects that will interfere significantly with the defendant's ability to assist counsel in conducting a defense. Third, the court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary to further those interests and find that alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results. Fourth, the court must conclude that administering the drugs is medically appropriate. Pp.177-181.
(b) The court applying these standards is trying to determine whether forced medication is necessary to further the Government's interest in rendering the defendant competent to stand trial. If a court authorizes medication on an alternative ground, such as dangerousness, the need to consider authorization on trial competence grounds will likely disappear. There are often strong reasons for a court to consider alternative grounds first. For one thing, the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render an individual nondangerous is usually more objective and manageable than the inquiry into whether medication is permissible to render a defendant competent. For another,

HILLSIDE DAIRY INC. ET AL. v. LYONS, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 01-950. Argued April 22, 2003-Decided June 9, 2003*
In most of the country, but not California, the minimum price paid to dairy farmers producing raw milk is regulated pursuant to federal marketing orders, which guarantee a uniform price for the producers, but through pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy products to pay different prices. California has adopted a similar, although more complex, program to regulate the minimum prices paid by California processors to California producers. Three state statutes create California's milk marketing structure: 1935 and 1967 Acts establish milk pricing and pooling plans, while a 1947 Act governs the composition of milk products sold in the State. Under the state scheme, California processors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes into a price equalization pool) that is higher than the prices paid to producers. During the 1990's, it became profitable for some California processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers. In 1997, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its regulations to require contributions to the price equalization pool on some out-ofstate purchases. Petitioners, out-of-state dairy farmers, brought these suits, alleging that the 1997 amendment unconstitutionally discriminates against them. Without reaching the merits, the District Court dismissed both cases. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding, inter alia, that a 1996 federal statute immunized California's milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge, and that the individual petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims failed because the 1997 amendment did not, on its face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.
Held:
1. California's milk pricing and pooling regulations are not exempted from Commerce Clause scrutiny by  144 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 7 U. S. C.  7254, which provides:
*Together with No. 01-1018, Ponderosa Dairy et al. v. Lyons, Secretary, California Department of Food and Agriculture, et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

""Nothing in this Act ... shall be construed to ... limit the authority of ... California ... to effect any law ... regarding ... the percentage of milk solids or solids not fat in fluid milk products sold ... in [that] State ... ; or ... the labeling of such fluid milk products ... "" Section 144 plainly covers California laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milk products, but does not mention pricing laws. This Court will not assume that Congress has authorized state regulations that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce unless such an intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82, 91. Because  144 does not express such an intent with respect to California's pricing and pooling laws, the Ninth Circuit erred in relying on that section to dismiss petitioners' Commerce Clause challenge. Pp. 64-66.
2. The Ninth Circuit's rejection of the individual petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claims is inconsistent with Chalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R. Co., 249 U. S. 522, 527, in which this Court held that the practical effect of a Tennessee tax-which did not on its face draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence, but did impose a higher rate on persons having their principal offices out of State-was discriminatory, given that an individual's chief office is commonly in the State of which he is a citizen. In these cases as well, the absence of an express statement in the California laws and regulations identifying out-of-state residency or citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting petitioners' claim. In so holding, this Court expresses no opinion on the merits of that claim. Pp.66-67.

In so holding, this Court expresses no opinion on the merits of that claim. Pp.66-67.

STEVENS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, Parts I and III of which were unanimous, and Part II of which was joined by REHNQUIST, C. J., and O'CONNOR, SCALIA, KENNEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ. THOMAS, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, post, p. 68.

NGUYEN v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 01-10873. Argued March 24, 2003-Decided June 9, 2003*
Petitioners were tried, convicted, and sentenced on federal narcotics charges in the District Court of Guam, a territorial court with subjectmatter jurisdiction over both federal-law and local-law causes. The Ninth Circuit panel convened to hear their appeals included two judges from that court, both of whom are life-tenured Article III judges, and the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, an Article IV territorial-court judge appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a 10-year term. Neither petitioner objected to the panel's composition before the cases were submitted for decision, and neither sought rehearing to challenge the panel's authority to decide their appeals after it affirmed their convictions. However, each filed a certiorari petition claiming that the judgment is invalid because a non-Article III judge participated on the panel.
Held: The Ninth Circuit panel did not have the authority to decide petitioners' appeals. Pp.74-83.
(a) In light of the relevant statutory provisions and historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be ""district judges"" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C.  292(a), which authorizes the assignment of ""one or more district judges within [a] circuit"" to sit on the court of appeals ""whenever the business of that court so requires."" As used throughout Title 28, ""district court"" means a ""'court of the United States'"" ""constituted by chapter 5 of this title."" 451. Among other things, Chapter 5 creates a ""United States District Court"" for each judicial district,  132(a), exhaustively enumerates the districts so constituted,  133(a), and describes ""district judges"" as holding office ""during good behavior,""  134(a). Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the enumerated courts, nor is it even mentioned in Chapter 5. See  133(a). Because that court's judges are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy  134(a)'s command for district judges to hold office during good behavior. Although the Chief

Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is literally a ""district judge"" of a court ""within the [Ninth] [C]ircuit,"" such a reading of  292(a) is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of ""district judges"" of any number of state courts ""within"" the Ninth Circuit. Moreover, historically, the term ""United States District Court"" in Title 28 has ordinarily excluded Article IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdiction is similar to that of an Article III United States District Court. E. g., Mookini v. United States, 303 U. S. 201, 205. Pp.74-76.
(b) The Government's three grounds for leaving the judgments below undisturbed are not persuasive. First, this Court's precedents concerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judges do not compel application here of the de facto officer doctrine, which confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of that person's appointment to office is deficient, Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177, 180. Typically, the Court has found a judge's actions to be valid de facto when there is a ""merely technical"" defect of statutory authority, McDowell v. United States, 159 U. S. 596, 601-602, but not when, as here, there has been a violation of a statutory provision that embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts, see, e. g., American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W R. Co., 148 U. S. 372, 387. Second, for essentially the same reasons, it is inappropriate to accept the Government's invitation to assess the merits of petitioners' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel. Third, the Government's argument that the presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the panel is sufficient to support the decision below is rejected for two reasons. The federal quorum statute, 28 U. S. C.  46(d), has been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century, yet this Court has never doubted its power to vacate a judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of judges competent to consider the appeal. See, e. g., United States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U. S. 685. Moreover, the statute authorizing courts of appeals to sit in panels,  46(b), requires the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance. Although the two Article III judges who took part below would have constituted a quorum had the original panel been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel. Thus, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration by a properly constituted panel. Pp. 77-83.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-679. Argued April 21, 2003-Decided June 9,2003
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it an ""unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual ... , because of ... sex."" 42 U. S. C.  2000e-2(a)(1). In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, this Court considered whether an employment decision is made ""because of"" sex in a ""mixed-motive"" case, i. e., where both legitimate and illegitimate reasons motivated the decision. Although the Court concluded that an employer had an affirmative defense if it could prove that it would have made the same decision had gender not played a role, it was divided on the question of when the burden of proof shifts to an employer to prove the defense. JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in the judgment, concluded that the burden would shift only where a disparate treatment plaintiff could show by ""direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision."" Id., at 276. Congress subsequently passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which provides, among other things, that (1) an unlawful employment practice is established ""when the complaining party demonstrates that ... sex ... was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice,"" 42 U. S. C.  2000e-2(m), and (2) if an individual proves a violation under  2000e-2(m), the employer can avail itself of a limited affirmative defense that restricts the available remedies if it demonstrates that it would have taken the same action absent the impermissible motivating factor,  2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Respondent, who was petitioner's only female warehouse worker and heavy equipment operator, had problems with management and her co-workers, which led to escalating disciplinary sanctions and her ultimate termination. She subsequently filed this lawsuit, asserting, inter alia, a Title VII sex discrimination claim. Based on the evidence she presented at trial, the District Court denied petitioner's motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitted the case to the jury. The District Court instructed the jury, as relevant here, that if respondent proved by a preponderance of the evidence that sex was a motivating factor in the adverse work conditions imposed on her, but petitioner's conduct was also motivated by lawful

91
reasons, she was entitled to damages unless petitioner proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have treated her similarly had gender played no role. Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to this instruction, claiming that respondent had not adduced ""direct evidence"" that sex was a motivating factor in petitioner's decision. The jury awarded respondent backpay and compensatory and punitive damages, and the District Court denied petitioner's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. A Ninth Circuit panel vacated and remanded, agreeing with petitioner that the District Court had erred in giving the mixed-motive instruction. The en banc court, however, reinstated the judgment, finding that the 1991 Act does not impose any special evidentiary requirement.
Held: Direct evidence of discrimination is not required for a plaintiff to obtain a mixed-motive jury instruction under Title VII. The starting point for this Court's analysis is the statutory text. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254. Where, as here, the statute's words are unambiguous, the judicial inquiry is complete. Id., at 254. Section 2000e-2(m) unambiguously states that a plaintiff need only demonstrate that an employer used a forbidden consideration with respect to any employment practice. On its face, it does not mention that a plaintiff must make a heightened showing through direct evidence. Moreover, Congress explicitly defined ""demonstrates"" as to ""mee[t] the burdens of production and persuasion.""  2000e-2(m). Had Congress intended to require direct evidence, it could have included language to that effect in  2000e-2(m), as it has unequivocally done when imposing heightened proof requirements in other circumstances. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C.  5851(b)(3)(D). Title VII's silence also suggests that this Court should not depart from the conventional rule of civil litigation generally applied in Title VII cases, which requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence using direct or circumstantial evidence. This Court has often acknowledged the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases and has never questioned its adequacy in criminal cases, even though proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required. Finally, the use of the term ""demonstrates"" in other Title VII provisions tends to show that  2000e-2(m) does not incorporate a direct evidence requirement. See e. g.,  2000e2(k)(1)(A)(i). Pp.98-102.

FITZGERALD, TREASURER OF IOWA v. RACING ASSOCIATION OF CENTRAL IOWA ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF IOWA No. 02-695. Argued April 29, 2003-Decided June 9,2003
An Iowa law that, among other things, authorized racetracks to operate slot machines and imposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine adjusted revenues, with a top rate that started at 20 percent and would automatically rise over time to 36 percent, left a 20 percent tax rate on riverboat slot machine adjusted revenues in place. Respondents, racetracks and a dog owners' association, filed a state-court suit challenging the law on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate difference violated the Equal Protection Clause, U. S. Const., Arndt. 14,  1. The District Court upheld the statute, but the Iowa Supreme Court reversed.
Held:
1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the state court's judgment, which does not rest independently upon state law. The state court's opinion says that Iowa courts should apply the same analysis in considering either state or federal equal protection claims. In such circumstances, this Court considers a state-court decision as resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support jurisdiction. P. 106.
2. Iowa's differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause. A law, such as Iowa's, which distinguishes for tax purposes among revenues obtained within a State by two enterprises conducting business in the State, is subject to rational-basis review. See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U. S. 1, 11-12. The Iowa law, like most laws, might predominantly serve one general objective, e. g., rescuing racetracks from economic distress, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole. And this law, seen as a whole, does what the state court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the racetracks' economic interests. A rational legislator might believe that the law's grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically-even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on revenues means less help than respondents might like-and the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help

with their tax laws and how much help those laws should provide. Once one realizes that not every provision in a single law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the difference in tax rates here. Though harmful to the racetracks, it is helpful to the riverboats, which were also facing financial peril. This is not a case where the facts preclude any plausible inference that the reason for the different tax rates is to help the riverboat industry. Cf. Nord linger, supra, at 16.

PRATO v. VALLAS ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME No. 02AI042 (02-9753). Decided June 9, 2003
Petitioner's request for an extension of time to file a certiorari petition following this Court's May 19, 2003, order denying her leave to proceed in forma pauperis is denied because there are no grounds upon which this Court would grant certiorari.
JUSTICE STEVENS, Circuit Justice.
Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis in this Court on December 20, 2002. On May 19, 2003, over my unpublished dissent, the Court issued an order denying petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis and giving petitioner until June 9, 2003, to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38(a) and to submit a petition in compliance with Rule 33.1 of the Rules of this Court. Petitioner now seeks an extension of time within which to comply with the May 19 order, explaining that she needs additional time to raise money to pay the docketing fee and printing costs. Having reviewed petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari, I am satisfied that there are no grounds upon which this Court would grant certiorari, and I therefore deny petitioner's request for an extension of time.

BENEFICIAL NATIONAL BANK ET AL. v. ANDERSON ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-306. Argued April 30, 2003-Decided June 2, 2003
Respondents, who secured loans from petitioner national bank, filed a state-court suit against the bank and two other petitioners, seeking damages on the theory, among others, that the bank's interest rates violated ""the common law usury doctrine"" and an Alabama usury statute. The complaint did not refer to any federal law. Petitioners removed the case to Federal District Court, asserting that the National Bank Act governs the interest rate that a national bank may charge, see 12 U. S. C.  85, that the rates charged to respondents complied with  85, that  86 provides the exclusive remedies available against a national bank charging excessive interest, and that respondents' action was therefore one ""arising under"" federal law that could be removed under 28 U. S. C.  1441. The District Court denied respondents' motion to remand the case to state court, but certified the question whether it had jurisdiction to the Eleventh Circuit. In reversing, the latter court held that under the ''well-pleaded complaint"" rule, removal is not permitted unless the complaint expressly alleges a federal claim, and that the narrow exception known as the complete pre-emption doctrine did not apply because there was no evidence of clear congressional intent to permit removal under 85 and 86.
Held: Respondents' cause of action arose only under federal law and could, therefore, be removed under  1441. Pp. 6-11.

Syllabus
(a) As a general rule, absent diversity jurisdiction, a case is not removable if the complaint does not affirmatively allege a federal claim. Potential defenses, including a federal statute's pre-emptive effect, Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, do not provide a basis for removal. One exception to the general rule occurs when a federal statute completely pre-empts a cause of action. Where this Court has found such preemption, the federal statutes at issue-the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, see Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, see Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58-provided the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action. Pp. 6-8.
(b) Because respondents' complaint expressly charged petitioners with usury, Metropolitan Life, Avco, and Franchise Tax Bd. provide the framework for answering the question whether the National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks. Section 85 sets substantive limits on the interest rates that national banks may charge, while  86 prescribes the remedies available to borrowers who are charged higher rates and the procedures governing such claims. If the interest charged here did not violate  85 limits, the statute pre-empts any common-law or Alabama statutory rule that would treat those rates as usurious and would, thus, provide a federal defense. That defense would not justify removal. Only if Congress intended  86 to provide the exclusive cause of action for usury claims against national banks would the statute be comparable to the provisions construed in Avco and Metropolitan Life. This Court has long construed the National Bank Act as providing the exclusive federal cause of action for usury against national banks. See, e. g., Farmers' and Mechanics' Nat. Bank v. Dearing, 91 U. S. 29. The Court has also recognized the special nature of federally chartered banks. Uniform rules limiting their liability and prescribing exclusive remedies for their overcharges are an integral part of a banking system that needed protection from possible unfriendly state legislation. The same federal interest supports the established interpretation of   85 and 86 that gives those provisions the requisite pre-emptive force to provide removal jurisdiction. Pp.9-11.

DASTAR CORP. v. TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORP. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-428. Argued April 2, 2003-Decided June 2, 2003
General Dwight D. Eisenhower's World War II book, Crusade in Europe, was published by Doubleday, which registered the work's copyright and granted exclusive television rights to an affiliate of respondent Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (Fox). Fox, in turn, arranged for Time, Inc., to produce a Crusade in Europe television series based on the book, and Time assigned its copyright in the series to Fox. The series was first broadcast in 1949. In 1975, Doubleday renewed the book's copyright, but Fox never renewed the copyright on the television series, which expired in 1977, leaving the series in the public domain. In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in the book, including the exclusive right to distribute the Crusade television series on video and to sublicense others to do so. Respondents SFM Entertainment and New Line Home Video, Inc., acquired from Fox the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute Crusade on video. In 1995, petitioner Dastar released a video set, World War II Campaigns in Europe, which it made from tapes of the original version of the Crusade television series and sold as its own product for substantially less than New Line's video set. Fox, SFM, and New Line brought this action alleging, inter alia, that Dastar's sale of Campaigns without proper credit to the Crusade television series constitutes ""reverse passing off"" in violation of  43(a) of the Lanham Act. The District Court granted respondents summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding, among other things, that because Dastar copied substantially the entire Crusade series, labeled the resulting product with a different name, and marketed it without attribution to Fox, Dastar had committed a ""bodily appropriation"" of Fox's series, which was sufficient to establish the reverse passing off.
Held: Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not prevent the unaccredited copying of an uncopyrighted work. Pp. 28-38.
(a) Respondents' claim that Dastar has made a ""false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which ... is likely to cause confusion ... as to the origin ... of [its] goods"" in violation of  43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C.  1125(a), would undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought

Syllabus
some of New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackaged them as its own. However, Dastar has instead taken a creative work in the public domain, copied it, made modifications (arguably minor), and produced its very own series of videotapes. If ""origin"" refers only to the manufacturer or producer of the physical ""good"" that is made available to the public (here, the videotapes), Dastar was the origin. If, however, ""origin"" includes the creator of the underlying work that Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product. At bottom, the Court must decide what  43(a) means by the ""origin"" of ""goods."" Pp.28-31.
(b) Because Dastar was the ""origin"" of the physical products it sold as its own, respondents cannot prevail on their Lanham Act claim. As dictionary definitions affirm, the most natural understanding of the ""origin"" of ""goods""-the source of wares-is the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace, here Dastar's Campaigns videotape. The phrase ""origin of goods"" in the Lanham Act is incapable of connoting the person or entity that originated the ideas that ""goods"" embody or contain. The consumer typically does not care about such origination, and  43(a) should not be stretched to cover matters that are of no consequence to purchasers. Although purchasers do care about ideas or communications contained or embodied in a communicative product such as a video, giving the Lanham Act special application to such products would cause it to conflict with copyright law, which is precisely directed to that subject, and which grants the public the right to copy without attribution once a copyright has expired, e. g., Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 230. Recognizing a  43(a) cause of action here would render superfluous the provisions of the Visual Artists Rights Act that grant an artistic work's author ""the right ... to claim authorship,"" 17 U. S. C.  106A(a)(1)(A), but carefully limit and focus that right,  101, 106A(b), (d)(l), and (e). It would also pose serious practical problems. Finally, reading  43(a) as creating a cause of action for, in effect, plagiarism would be hard to reconcile with, e. g., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U. S. 205, 211. Pp.31-38.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, INC. v. LOUISIANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA No. 02-299. Argued April 28, 2003-Decided June 2, 2003
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce, must ensure that wholesale rates are ""just and reasonable,"" 16 U. S. C.  824d(a). Under the filed rate doctrine, FERC-approved cost allocations between affiliated energy companies may not be subjected to reevaluation in state ratemaking proceedings. Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953; Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354 (MP&L). Petitioner Entergy Louisiana, Inc. (ELI), one of five public utilities owned by Entergy Corporation (Entergy), shares capacity with its corporate siblings in other States, which allows each company to access additional capacity when demand exceeds the supply generated by that company alone. The resulting costs are allocated among the companies; and that allocation is critical to the setting of retail rates by state regulators, such as respondent Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). Entergy allocates costs through a tariff approved by FERC called the system agreement. Service Schedule MSS-1, which is included in the system agreement, provides a formula under which those companies that use more capacity than they contribute make payments to companies that contribute more than their fair share of capacity. ELI has typically made, rather than received, MSS-1 payments. In the 1980's, the operating committee initiated the Extended Reserve Shutdown (ERS) program, which responded to systemwide overcapacity by allowing some generating units not immediately necessary for capacity needs to be effectively mothballed. Because ERS units could be reactivated if needed, they were considered available for purposes of calculating MSS-1 payments. On August 5, 1997, FERC found that Entergy had violated the system agreement in classifying ERS units as available, but determined that a refund was not due to ELI customers as a result of MSS-1 overpayments by ELI to other operating companies. FERC also approved an amendment to the system agreement allowing an ERS unit to be treated as available under MSS-1 if the operating committee determines it intends to return the unit to service at a future date. In 1997, ELI made its annual retail rate filing with the LPSC. One of the contested issues in this proceeding was whether the cost of ERS units should be

considered in setting ELI's retail rates. Confining its review to MSS-1 payments made after August 5, 1997, the LPSC concluded that it was not pre-empted from disallowing MSS-1 related costs as imprudent subsequent to that date. Thus, ELI was not permitted to charge retail rates that reflected the cost of its MSS-1 payments. The State District Court denied ELI's petition for review, and the State Supreme Court upheld the LPSC's decision.
Held: Nantahala and MP&L rest on a foundation that is broad enough to require pre-emption of the LPSC's order. Pp.47-51.
(a) The filed rate doctrine requires ""that interstate power rates filed with FERC or fixed by FERC must be given binding effect by state utility commissions determining intrastate rates,"" Nantahala, supra, at 962. In Nantahala and MP&L, this Court applied the doctrine to hold that FERC-mandated cost allocations could not be second-guessed by state regulators. The state order in Nantahala, which involved two corporate siblings, allocated more of Nantahala's purchases to low-cost power than the proportion approved by FERC. By requiring Nantahala to calculate its rates as if it needed to procure less high-cost power than under FERC's order, the state order ""trapped"" a portion of the costs incurred by N antahala in procuring its power. This ran counter to the rationale for FERC approval of cost allocations because, when costs under a FERC tariff are categorically excluded from consideration in retail rates, the regulated entity cannot fully recover its costs of purchasing at the FERC-approved rate. In MP&L, the Court concluded that, contrary to the Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling, the pre-emptive effect of FERC jurisdiction does not turn on whether a particular matter was actually determined in FERC proceedings.

The Federal Power Act specifically allows for the use of automatic adjustment clauses, and MSS-1 constitutes such a clause. The Louisiana Supreme Court's other basis for upholding the LPSC's order-that FERC had not specifically approved the MSS-1 cost allocation after August 5-revives precisely the same erroneous reasoning advanced by the Mississippi Supreme Court in MP&L.

ENTERGY LOUISIANA, INC. v. LOUISIANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA No. 02-299. Argued April 28, 2003-Decided June 2, 2003
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce, must ensure that wholesale rates are ""just and reasonable,"" 16 U. S. C.  824d(a). Under the filed rate doctrine, FERC-approved cost allocations between affiliated energy companies may not be subjected to reevaluation in state ratemaking proceedings. Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg, 476 U. S. 953; Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U. S. 354 (MP&L). Petitioner Entergy Louisiana, Inc. (ELI), one of five public utilities owned by Entergy Corporation (Entergy), shares capacity with its corporate siblings in other States, which allows each company to access additional capacity when demand exceeds the supply generated by that company alone. The resulting costs are allocated among the companies; and that allocation is critical to the setting of retail rates by state regulators, such as respondent Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC). Entergy allocates costs through a tariff approved by FERC called the system agreement. Service Schedule MSS-1, which is included in the system agreement, provides a formula under which those companies that use more capacity than they contribute make payments to companies that contribute more than their fair share of capacity. ELI has typically made, rather than received, MSS-1 payments. In the 1980's, the operating committee initiated the Extended Reserve Shutdown (ERS) program, which responded to systemwide overcapacity by allowing some generating units not immediately necessary for capacity needs to be effectively mothballed. Because ERS units could be reactivated if needed, they were considered available for purposes of calculating MSS-1 payments. On August 5, 1997, FERC found that Entergy had violated the system agreement in classifying ERS units as available, but determined that a refund was not due to ELI customers as a result of MSS-1 overpayments by ELI to other operating companies. FERC also approved an amendment to the system agreement allowing an ERS unit to be treated as available under MSS-1 if the operating committee determines it intends to return the unit to service at a future date. In 1997, ELI made its annual retail rate filing with the LPSC. One of the contested issues in this proceeding was whether the cost of ERS units should be

THE CITIZENS BANK v. ALAFABCO, INC., ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA
No. 02-1295. Decided June 2, 2003
Respondents Alafabco, Inc., and its officers filed suit in Alabama Circuit Court, alleging that Alafabco had incurred massive debt because petitioner bank had unlawfully reneged on an agreement to provide capital sufficient to complete a specific building project. The bank moved to compel arbitration as provided in the parties' debt-restructuring agreements. The court ordered respondents to submit to arbitration, but the State Supreme Court reversed, finding that, because the agreements had no substantial effect on interstate commerce, there was an insufficient nexus with such commerce to establish Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) coverage of the parties' dispute.
Held: There is sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make the arbitration provision enforceable under the FAA. By applying to a contract ""evidencing a transaction involving commerce,"" 9 U. S. C.  2, the FAA provides for ""the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the Commerce Clause,"" Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 490. It is thus perfectly clear that the FAA encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually ""in commerce."" Although the debtrestructuring agreements were executed in Alabama by Alabama residents, they nonetheless satisfy the FAA's ""involving commerce"" test. First, Alafabco engaged in business throughout the southeastern United States, using substantial loans from the bank that were renegotiated and redocumented in the debt-restructuring agreements. Second, the restructured debt was secured by all of Alafabco's business assets, including its inventory of goods assembled from out-of-state parts and raw materials. Third, commercial lending has a broad impact on the national economy. The Alabama Supreme Court's cramped view of Congress' Commerce Clause power appears to rest on a misreading of United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, which does not suggest that limits on the power to regulate commerce are breached by applying the FAA to disputes arising out of commercial loan transactions such as these.
Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.

PER CURIAM.
The question presented is whether the parties' debtrestructuring agreement is ""a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce"" within the meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 9 U. s. C.  2. As we concluded in Allied-Bruce Terminix Coso v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265 (1995), there is a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to make enforceable, pursuant to the FAA, an arbitration provision included in that agreement.

I
Petitioner The Citizens Bank-an Alabama lending institution-seeks to compel arbitration of a financial dispute with respondents Alafabco, Inc.-an Alabama fabrication and construction company-and its officers. According to a complaint filed by respondents in Alabama state court, the dispute among the parties arose out of a series of commercial loan transactions made over a decade-long course of business dealings. In 1986, the complaint alleges, the parties entered into a quasi-contractual relationship in which the bank agreed to provide operating capital necessary for Alafabco to secure and complete construction contracts. That relationship began to sour in 1998, when the bank allegedly encouraged Alafabco to bid on a large construction contract in Courtland, Alabama, but refused to provide the capital necessary to complete the project. In order to compensate for the bank's alleged breach of the parties' implied agreement, Alafabco completed the Courtland project with funds that would otherwise have been dedicated to repaying existing obligations to the bank. Alafabco in turn became delinquent in repaying those existing obligations.
On two occasions, the parties attempted to resolve the outstanding debts. On May 3, 1999, Alafabco and the bank executed ""'renewal notes'"" in which all previous loans were

NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES ET AL. v. HIBBS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 01-1368. Argued January 15, 2003-Decided May 27, 2003
Respondent Hibbs (hereinafter respondent), an employee of the Nevada Department of Human Resources (Department), sought leave to care for his ailing wife under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), which entitles an eligible employee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for the onset of a ""serious health condition"" in the employee's spouse and for other reasons, 29 U. S. C.  2612(a)(I)(C). The Department granted respondent's request for the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave, but eventually informed him that he had exhausted that leave and that he must report to work by a certain date. Respondent failed to do so and was terminated. Pursuant to FMLA provisions creating a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages ""against any employer (including a public agency),""  2617(a)(2), that ""interfere[d] with, restrain[ed], or den[ied] the exercise of"" FMLA rights,  2615(a)(I), respondent sued petitioners, the Department and two of its officers, in Federal District Court seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for, inter alia, violations of  2612(a)(I)(C). The court awarded petitioners summary judgment on the grounds that the FMLA claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated. The Ninth Circuit reversed.
Held: State employees may recover money damages in federal court in the event of the State's failure to comply with the FMLA's family-care provision. Congress may abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 363. The FMLA satisfies the clear statement rule. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73-78. Congress also acted within its authority under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave provision. In the exercise of its  5 power, Congress may enact socalled prophylactic legislation that proscribes facially constitutional con-

722
duct in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct, e. g., City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 536, but it may not attempt to substantively redefine the States' legal obligations, Kimel, supra, at 88. The test for distinguishing appropriate prophylactic legislation from substantive redefinition is that valid  5 legislation must exhibit ""congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end."" City of Boerne, supra, at 520. The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace. Statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny, see, e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197-199; i. e., they must ""serv[e] important governmental objectives,"" and ""the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"" United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533. When it enacted the FMLA, Congress had before it significant evidence of a long and extensive history of sex discrimination with respect to the administration of leave benefits by the States, which is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic  5 legislation. Cf. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456. Garrett, supra, and Kimel, supra, in which the Court reached the opposite conclusion, are distinguished on the ground that the  5 legislation there at issue responded to a purported tendency of state officials to make age- or disability-based distinctions, characteristics that are not judged under a heightened review standard, but pass equal protection muster if there is a rational basis for enacting them. See, e. g., Kimel, supra, at 86. Here, because the standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of a gender-based classification is more difficult to meet than the rational-basis test, it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations. Cf. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308-313. The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLA, which is based on mutually reinforcing stereotypes that only women are responsible for family caregiving and that men lack domestic responsibilities, is significant. Moreover, Congress' chosen remedy, the FMLA's family-care provision, is ""congruent and proportional to the targeted violation,"" Garrett, supra, at 374. Congress had already tried unsuccessfully to address this problem through Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Where previous legislative attempts have failed, see Katzenbach, supra, at 313, such problems may justify added prophylactic measures in response, Kimel, supra, at 88. By creating an across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees, Congress sought to ensure that family-care leave would no longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female

CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1444. Argued December 4, 2002-Decided May 27, 2003
While respondent Martinez was being treated for gunshot wounds received during an altercation with police, he was interrogated by petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor. Martinez admitted that he used heroin and had taken an officer's gun during the incident. At no point was Martinez given Miranda warnings. Although he was never charged with a crime, and his answers were never used against him in any criminal proceeding, Martinez filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 suit, maintaining, among other things, that Chavez's actions violated his Fifth Amendment right not to be ""compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,"" and his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to be free from coercive questioning. The District Court ruled that Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that Chavez's coercive questioning violated Martinez's Fifth Amendment rights even though his statements were not used against him in a criminal proceeding, and that a police officer violates due process when he obtains a confession by coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at trial.
Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 270 F.3d 852, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part II-A that Chavez did not deprive Martinez of his Fifth Amendment rights. Pp.766-773.
(a) An officer is entitled to qualified immunity if his alleged conduct did not violate a constitutional right. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,201. The text of the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause cannot support the Ninth Circuit's view that mere compulsive questioning violates the Constitution. A ""criminal case"" at the very least requires the initiation of legal proceedings, and police questioning does not constitute such a case. Statements compelled by police interrogation may not be used against a defendant in a criminal case, but it is not until such use that the Self-Incrimination Clause is violated, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264. Martinez was never made to be a ""witness"" against himself because his statements were never admitted as testimony against him in a criminal case. Nor was

761
he ever placed under oath and exposed to ""'the cruel trilemma of selfaccusation, perjury or contempt.''' Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 445. Pp.766-767.
(b) The Ninth Circuit's approach is also irreconcilable with this Court's case law. The government may compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not the target of the criminal case in which he testifies, see, e. g., Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 443; and this Court has long permitted the compulsion of incriminating testimony so long as the statements (or evidence derived from them) cannot be used against the speaker in a criminal case, id., at 458. Martinez was no more compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself than an immunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt. That an immunized witness knows that his statements may not be used against him, while Martinez likely did not, does not make the immunized witness' statements any less compelled and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that coercive police interrogations alone violate the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, those subjected to coercive interrogations have an automatic protection from the use of their involuntary statements in any subsequent criminal trial, e. g., Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 307-308, which is coextensive with the use and derivative use immunity mandated by Kastigar. Pp. 767-770.
(c) The fact that the Court has permitted the Fifth Amendment privilege to be asserted in noncriminal cases does not alter the conclusion in this case. Judicially created prophylactic rules-such as the rule allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreement before being compelled to give testimony in noncriminal cases, and the exclusionary rule-are designed to safeguard the core constitutional right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. They do not extend the scope of that right itself, just as violations of such rules do not violate a person's constitutional rights. Accordingly, Chavez's failure to read Miranda warnings to Martinez did not violate Martinez's constitutional rights and cannot be grounds for a  1983 action. And the absence of a ""criminal case"" in which Martinez was compelled to be a ""witness"" against himself defeats his core Fifth Amendment claim. Pp. 770-773.

CHAVEZ v. MARTINEZ
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1444. Argued December 4, 2002-Decided May 27, 2003
While respondent Martinez was being treated for gunshot wounds received during an altercation with police, he was interrogated by petitioner Chavez, a patrol supervisor. Martinez admitted that he used heroin and had taken an officer's gun during the incident. At no point was Martinez given Miranda warnings. Although he was never charged with a crime, and his answers were never used against him in any criminal proceeding, Martinez filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 suit, maintaining, among other things, that Chavez's actions violated his Fifth Amendment right not to be ""compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,"" and his Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to be free from coercive questioning. The District Court ruled that Chavez was not entitled to qualified immunity, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that Chavez's coercive questioning violated Martinez's Fifth Amendment rights even though his statements were not used against him in a criminal proceeding, and that a police officer violates due process when he obtains a confession by coercive conduct, regardless of whether the confession is subsequently used at trial.
Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 270 F.3d 852, reversed and remanded.
JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part II-A that Chavez did not deprive Martinez of his Fifth Amendment rights. Pp.766-773.
(a) An officer is entitled to qualified immunity if his alleged conduct did not violate a constitutional right. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,201. The text of the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause cannot support the Ninth Circuit's view that mere compulsive questioning violates the Constitution. A ""criminal case"" at the very least requires the initiation of legal proceedings, and police questioning does not constitute such a case. Statements compelled by police interrogation may not be used against a defendant in a criminal case, but it is not until such use that the Self-Incrimination Clause is violated, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 264. Martinez was never made to be a ""witness"" against himself because his statements were never admitted as testimony against him in a criminal case. Nor was

761
he ever placed under oath and exposed to ""'the cruel trilemma of selfaccusation, perjury or contempt.''' Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 445. Pp.766-767.
(b) The Ninth Circuit's approach is also irreconcilable with this Court's case law. The government may compel witnesses to testify at trial or before a grand jury, on pain of contempt, so long as the witness is not the target of the criminal case in which he testifies, see, e. g., Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 443; and this Court has long permitted the compulsion of incriminating testimony so long as the statements (or evidence derived from them) cannot be used against the speaker in a criminal case, id., at 458. Martinez was no more compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself than an immunized witness forced to testify on pain of contempt. That an immunized witness knows that his statements may not be used against him, while Martinez likely did not, does not make the immunized witness' statements any less compelled and lends no support to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that coercive police interrogations alone violate the Fifth Amendment. Moreover, those subjected to coercive interrogations have an automatic protection from the use of their involuntary statements in any subsequent criminal trial, e. g., Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 307-308, which is coextensive with the use and derivative use immunity mandated by Kastigar. Pp. 767-770.
(c) The fact that the Court has permitted the Fifth Amendment privilege to be asserted in noncriminal cases does not alter the conclusion in this case. Judicially created prophylactic rules-such as the rule allowing a witness to insist on an immunity agreement before being compelled to give testimony in noncriminal cases, and the exclusionary rule-are designed to safeguard the core constitutional right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause. They do not extend the scope of that right itself, just as violations of such rules do not violate a person's constitutional rights. Accordingly, Chavez's failure to read Miranda warnings to Martinez did not violate Martinez's constitutional rights and cannot be grounds for a  1983 action. And the absence of a ""criminal case"" in which Martinez was compelled to be a ""witness"" against himself defeats his core Fifth Amendment claim. Pp. 770-773.
JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Part II, concluding that the issue whether Martinez may pursue a claim of liability for a substantive due process violation should be addressed on remand. pp. 779-780.

NATIONAL PARK HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION v.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

No. 02-196. Argued March 4, 2003-Decided May 27, 2003
The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA) establishes rules governing disputes arising out of certain Government contracts. Mter Congress enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, establishing a comprehensive concession management program for national parks, the National Park Service (NPS) issued implementing regulations including 36 CFR  51.3, which purports to render the CDA inapplicable to concession contracts. Petitioner concessioners' association challenged  51.3's validity. The District Court upheld the regulation, concluding that the CDA is ambiguous on whether it applies to concession contracts and finding NPS' interpretation reasonable under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. The District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, placing no reliance on Chevron, but finding NPS' reading of the CDA consistent with both the CDA and the 1998 Act.
Held: The controversy is not yet ripe for judicial resolution. Determining whether administrative action is ripe requires evaluation of (1) the issues' fitness for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 149. Regarding the hardship inquiry, the federal respondents concede that, because NPS has no delegated rulemaking authority under the CDA,  51.3 is not a legislative regulation with the force of law. And their assertion that  51.3 is an interpretative regulation advising the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which it administers is incorrect, as NPS is not empowered to administer the CDA. That task rests with agency contracting officers and boards of contract appeals, as well as the federal courts; and any authority regarding the agency boards' proper arrangement belongs to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy. Consequently,  51.3 is nothing more than a general policy statement designed to inform the public of NPS' views on the CDA's proper application. Thus,  51.3 does not create ""adverse effects of a strictly legal kind,"" which are required for a hardship showing. Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U. S. 726, 733. Moreover,  51.3 does not affect a concessioner's primary conduct, e. g., Toilet Goods Assn., Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 158, 164,

804
as it leaves the concessioner free to conduct its business as it sees fit. Moreover, nothing in the regulation prevents concessioners from following the procedures set forth in the CDA once a dispute over a concession contract actually arises. This Court has previously found that challenges to regulations similar to  51.3 were not ripe for lack of a hardship showing. See, e. g., id., at 161-162. Petitioner's contention that delaying judicial resolution of the issue will cause real harm because the CDA's applicability vel non is a factor taken into account by a concessioner preparing its bids is unpersuasive. Mere uncertainty as to the validity of a legal rule does not constitute a hardship for purposes of the ripeness analysis. As to whether the issue here is fit for review, further factual development would ""significantly advance [this Court's] ability to deal with the legal issues presented,"" Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 82, even though the question is ""purely legal"" and  51.3 constitutes ""final agency action"" under the Administrative Procedure Act, Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149. Judicial resolution of the question presented here should await a concrete dispute about a particular concession contract. Pp. 807-812.

BLACK & DECKER DISABILITY PLAN v. NORD
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-469. Argued April 28, 2003-Decided May 27, 2003
Petitioner Black & Decker Disability Plan (Plan), an employee welfare benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), provides benefits for eligible disabled employees of Black & Decker Corporation (Black & Decker) and certain of its subsidiaries. Black & Decker is the administrator of the Plan but has delegated authority to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims. Respondent Nord, an employee of a Black & Decker subsidiary, submitted a claim for disability benefits under the Plan, which Met Life denied. At Met Life's review stage, Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation from his physician, Dr. Hartman, and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartman had referred Nord. These treating physicians stated that Nord suffered from a degenerative disc disease and chronic pain that rendered him unable to work. Black & Decker referred Nord to a neurologist for an independent examination. The neurologist concluded that, aided by pain medication, Nord could perform sedentary work. MetLife thereafter made a final recommendation to deny Nord's claim, which Black & Decker accepted. Seeking to overturn that determination, Nord filed this action under ERISA. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan, concluding that Black & Decker's denial of Nord's claim was not an abuse of the plan administrator's discretion. The Ninth Circuit reversed and itself granted summary judgment for Nord. The Court of Appeals explained that the case was controlled by a recent Ninth Circuit decision holding that, when making benefit determinations, ERISA plan administrators must follow a ""treating physician rule."" As described by the appeals court, that rule required a plan administrator who rejects the opinions of a claimant's treating physician to come forward with specific reasons for the decision, based on substantial evidence in the record. The Ninth Circuit found that, under this rule, the plan administrator had not provided adequate justification for rejecting the opinions of Nord's treating physicians.
Held: ERISA does not require plan administrators to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians. The ""treating physician rule"" imposed by the Ninth Circuit was originally developed by Courts

823
of Appeals as a means to control disability determinations by administrative law judges under the Social Security Act. In 1991, the Commissioner of Social Security adopted regulations approving and formalizing use of the rule in the Social Security disability program. Nothing in ERISA or the Secretary of Labor's ERISA regulations, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians, or imposes a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician's opinion. If the Secretary found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine that determination with appropriate deference. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. But the Secretary has not chosen that course and an amicus brief reflecting the Department of Labor's position opposes adoption of such a rule for disability determinations under plans covered by ERISA. Whether a treating physician rule would increase the accuracy of ERISA disability determinations, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would, is a question that the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address. Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter. By accepting and codifying such a rule, the Social Security Commissioner sought to serve the need for efficient administration of an obligatory nationwide benefits program. In contrast, nothing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans or mandates what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887. Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit. In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant's condition against a uniform set of federal criteria. The validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan, on the other hand, is likely to turn, in large part, on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 115. Deference is due the Labor Secretary's stated view that ERISA is best served by preserving the greatest flexibility possible for operating claims processing systems consistent with a plan's prudent administration. Plan administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant's reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician. But courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant's phy-

BUNKLEY v. FLORIDA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA
No. 02-8636. Decided May 27, 2003
Petitioner Bunkley had a pocketknife with a 21h- to 3-inch blade in his pocket when he was arrested as he left an unoccupied restaurant. He was charged with first-degree burglary because his knife was classified as a ""dangerous weapon"" under Florida law, was convicted, and was sentenced to life in prison. Had the pocketknife not been so classified, his sentence could have been no more than five years. His conviction became final in 1989. Florida has exempted the ""common pocketknife"" from its weapons statute since 1901, and the relevant language has remained unchanged. In 1997, in a separate case, the Florida Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the ""common pocketknife"" exception for the first time, including a pocketknife with a 3%-inch blade within the exception. L. B. v. State, 700 So. 2d 370, 373. Bunkley then moved for state postconviction relief, alleging that his armed robbery conviction was invalid under L. B. because his pocketknife was shorter than 3% inches and could not therefore support a conviction involving weapon possession. The Circuit Court denied his motion, and the State District Court of Appeal affirmed. The State Supreme Court rejected Bunkley's claim, holding that L. B. was an evolutionary refinement in the law that did not apply retroactively.
Held: The Florida Supreme Court erred in failing to determine whether the ""common pocketknife"" exception encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time his conviction became final. The result here is controlled by Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225, which involved a Pennsylvania criminal statute that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted for the first time after Fiore's conviction had already become final. Under that interpretation, Fiore's conduct did not violate an element of the statute. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply to this Court's certified question-that its interpretation merely clarified the statute's plain language-revealed that Fiore's conviction violated due process, because a State cannot convict a person without proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Application of Fiore's due process principles may render a retroactivity analysis unnecessary here. Fiore requires the Florida Supreme Court to answer whether, in light of L. B., Bunkley's 2Y2- to 3-inch pocketknife fit within the state statute's ""common pocketknife"" exception at the time his conviction became final.

836
Per Curiam
Because the L. B. decision cast doubt on the validity of Bunkley's conviction by interpreting the exception to cover his weapon, Fiore entitles Bunkley to a determination whether L. B. correctly stated the law as it stood at the time Bunkley was convicted. The Florida Supreme Court characterized L. B. as part of a century-long evolutionary process, but did not decide what stage the law had reached by 1989. The proper question for purposes of Fiore is not just whether the law changed, but when it changed. Unless and until the State Supreme Court clarifies the exception's content in 1989, this Court cannot know whether Bunkley's conviction violates the due process principles set forth in Fiore.
Certiorari granted; 833 So. 2d 739, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.
Clyde Timothy Bunkley petitions for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Florida Supreme Court contradicted the principles of this Court's decision in Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225 (2001) (per curiam), when it failed to determine whether the ""common pocketknife"" exception to Florida's definition of a ""'[w]eapon'"" encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time that his conviction became final in 1989. Fla. Stat.  790.001(13) (2000). We agree, and therefore grant Bunkley's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and his petition for a writ of certiorari.

S. 225, which involved a Pennsylvania criminal statute that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted for the first time after Fiore's conviction had already become final. Under that interpretation, Fiore's conduct did not violate an element of the statute. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's reply to this Court's certified question-that its interpretation merely clarified the statute's plain language-revealed that Fiore's conviction violated due process, because a State cannot convict a person without proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Application of Fiore's due process principles may render a retroactivity analysis unnecessary here. Fiore requires the Florida Supreme Court to answer whether, in light of L. B., Bunkley's 2Y2- to 3-inch pocketknife fit within the state statute's ""common pocketknife"" exception at the time his conviction became final.

836
Per Curiam
Because the L. B. decision cast doubt on the validity of Bunkley's conviction by interpreting the exception to cover his weapon, Fiore entitles Bunkley to a determination whether L. B. correctly stated the law as it stood at the time Bunkley was convicted. The Florida Supreme Court characterized L. B. as part of a century-long evolutionary process, but did not decide what stage the law had reached by 1989. The proper question for purposes of Fiore is not just whether the law changed, but when it changed. Unless and until the State Supreme Court clarifies the exception's content in 1989, this Court cannot know whether Bunkley's conviction violates the due process principles set forth in Fiore.
Certiorari granted; 833 So. 2d 739, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.
Clyde Timothy Bunkley petitions for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Florida Supreme Court contradicted the principles of this Court's decision in Fiore v. White, 531 U. S. 225 (2001) (per curiam), when it failed to determine whether the ""common pocketknife"" exception to Florida's definition of a ""'[w]eapon'"" encompassed Bunkley's pocketknife at the time that his conviction became final in 1989. Fla. Stat.  790.001(13) (2000). We agree, and therefore grant Bunkley's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and his petition for a writ of certiorari.

I
In the early morning hours of April 16, 1986, Bunkley burglarized a closed, unoccupied Western Sizzlin' Restaurant. Report and Recommendation in No. 91-113-CIV-T-99(B) (MD Fla.), p. 1. The police arrested him after he left the restaurant. At the time of his arrest, the police discovered a ""pocketknife, with a blade of 2lf2 to 3 inches in length, ... folded and in his pocket."" 768 So. 2d 510 (Fla. App. 2000) (per curiam). ""There is no evidence indicating Bunkley ever used the pocketknife during the burglary, nor that he threatened anyone with the pocketknife at any time."" Ibid.
Bunkley was charged with burglary in the first degree because he was armed with a ""dangerous weapon""-namely, the pocketknife. Fla. Stat.  810.02(2)(b) (2000). The punishment for burglary in the first degree is ""imprisonment

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-524. Argued April 21, 2003-Decided May 19,2003
At respondent's trial on an open murder charge, defense counsel moved, at the close of the prosecution's case in chief and outside the jury's hearing, for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder. The trial judge stated that second-degree murder was ""'an appropriate charge,'"" 292 F.3d 506, 508, but agreed to hear the prosecutor's statement on first-degree murder the next morning. When the prosecution made the statement, defense counsel objected, arguing that the court had granted its directed verdict motion the previous day, and that further prosecution on first-degree murder would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The judge responded that he had granted the motion but had not directed a verdict, and noted that the jury had not been told of his statement. He subsequently submitted the first-degree murder charge to the jury, which convicted respondent on that charge. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented respondent's prosecution for first-degree murder. Reversing in turn, the State Supreme Court determined that the trial judge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminate jeopardy. Respondent then notified the court of a docket sheet entry stating: ""'1 open murder to 2nd degree murder,'"" id., at 512. The Michigan Supreme Court refused to reconsider its decision. Respondent filed a federal habeas petition, and the Federal District Court granted the petition after concluding that continued prosecution for first-degree murder had violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held: Respondent did not meet the statutory requirements for habeas relief. The parties do not dispute the underlying facts, and respondent is therefore entitled to relief only if he can demonstrate that the state court's adjudication of his claim was ""contrary to"" or an ""unreasonable application of"" this Court's clearly established precedents. 28 U. S. C.  2254(d)(1). The Sixth Circuit recited this standard but then forgot to apply it, reviewing the double jeopardy question de novo. This was error. A state-court decision is ""contrary to"" this Court's clearly established law if it ""applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [the Court's] cases"" or if it ""confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court and neverthe-

Here, the Michigan Supreme Court identified, and reaffirmed the principles articulated in, the applicable precedents of United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, and Sma lis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140. Nowhere did it apply a legal standard contrary to those set forth in this Court's cases, nor did it confront a set of facts materially indistinguishable from those in any case decided by this Court. The state court's decision therefore was not ""contrary to"" this Court's precedents. Nor was the state court's decision an ""unreasonable application"" of clearly established law. That court applied both Martin Linen and Sma lis to conclude that the judge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminate jeopardy. In reaching this conclusion, in addition to reviewing the context and substance of the trial judge's comments at length, the court observed that there was no formal judgment or order entered on the record. While it noted that formal motions or rulings were not required to demonstrate finality as a matter of Michigan law, it cautioned that a judgment must bear sufficient indicia of finality and it concluded that sufficient indicia were not present here. This was not an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law. Indeed, numerous courts have refused to find double jeopardy violations under similar circumstances. Even if this Court agreed with the Sixth Circuit that the Double Jeopardy Clause should be read to prevent continued prosecution under these circumstances, it was at least reasonable for the state court to conclude otherwise.

PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA v. WALSH, ACTING COMMISSIONER, MAINE DEPARTMENT
OF HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

No. 01-188. Argued January 22, 2003-Decided May 19,2003
A State participating in Medicaid must have a medical assistance plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). In response to increasing Medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs, Congress enacted a cost-saving measure in 1990 that requires drug companies to pay rebates to States on their Medicaid purchases. States have since enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on Medicaid purchases and purchases for other needy citizens. The purpose of the ""Maine Rx"" Program is to reduce prescription drug prices for state residents. Under the program, Maine will attempt to negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers. If a company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a ""prior authorization"" procedure that requires state agency approval to qualify a doctor's prescription for reimbursement. Petitioner, an association of nonresident drug manufacturers, challenged the program before its commencement date, claiming that it is pre-empted by the Medicaid Act and violates the negative Commerce Clause. Without resolving any factual issues, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction preventing the statute's implementation, concluding, inter alia, that any obstacle, no matter how modest, to the federal program's administration is sufficient to establish pre-emption. The First Circuit reversed.
Held: The judgment is affirmed. 249 F.3d 66, affirmed.
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, and VI, concluding that petitioner has not carried its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits of its Commerce Clause claims. Its arguments-that the rebate requirement constitutes impermissible extraterritorial regulation and that it discriminates against interstate commerce in order to subsidize in-state retail sales-are unpersuasive. Unlike the price control statute invalidated in Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, and the price affirma-

645
tion statute struck down in Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, Maine Rx does not regulate the price of any out-of-state transaction by its express terms or its inevitable effect. Nor does Maine Rx impose a disparate burden on out-of-state competitors. A manufacturer cannot avoid its rebate obligation by opening production facilities in Maine and would receive no benefit from the rebates even if it did so; the payments to local pharmacists provide no special benefit to competitors of rebatepaying manufacturers. West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186, distinguished. pp. 668-670.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts IV and VII:
(a) The answer to the question before the Court-whether petitioner's showing was sufficient to support the District Court's injunctionwill not determine the validity of Maine's Rx Program since further proceedings may lead to another result. Moreover, the Secretary may view Maine Rx as an amendment to its Medicaid Plan that requires his approval before becoming effective. As the case comes to this Court, the question is whether there is a probability that Maine's program was pre-empted by the federal statute's mere existence. Therefore, there is a presumption that the state statute is valid, and the question asked is whether petitioner has shouldered the burden of overcoming that presumption. pp. 660-662.
(b) At this stage of the litigation, petitioner has not carried its burden of showing a probability of success on the merits of its claims. P.670.
JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part V that petitioner's showing is insufficient to support a finding that the Medicaid Act pre-empts Maine's Rx Program insofar as it threatens to coerce manufacturers into reducing their prices on non-Medicaid sales. Petitioner claims that the potential interference with Medicaid benefits without serving any Medicaid purpose is prohibited by the federal statute. However, petitioner must show that Maine Rx serves no such goal. In fact, Maine Rx may serve the Medicaidrelated purposes of providing benefits to needy persons and curtailing the State's Medicaid costs. While these purposes would not provide a sufficient basis for upholding the program if it severely curtailed Medicaid recipients' prescription drug access, the District Court erred in assuming that even a modest impediment to such access would invalidate the program. The Medicaid Act gives States substantial discretion to choose the proper mix of amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage as long as care and services are provided in the recipients' best interests.

BREUER v. JIM'S CONCRETE OF BREVARD, INC.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-337. Argued April 2, 2003-Decided May 19,2003
Petitioner Breuer sued respondent, his former employer, Jim's Concrete of Brevard, Inc., in a Florida state court for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney's fees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), which provides, inter alia, that ""[a]n action to recover ... may be maintained ... in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction,"" 29 U. S. C.  216(b). Jim's Concrete removed the case to the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C.  1441(a), which reads: ""Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the [federal] district courts ... have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant ... to the [appropriate federal] district court."" Breuer sought an order remanding the case to state court, arguing that removal was improper because  216(b)'s provision that an action ""may be maintained"" in state court put forward an express exception to  1441(a)'s general removal authorization. Though the District Court denied Breuer's motion, it certified the issue for interlocutory appeal. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that although Congress had expressly barred removal in direct, unequivocal language in other statutes,  216(b) was not comparably prohibitory.
Held: Section 216(b) does not bar removal of a suit from state to federal court. Breuer's case was properly removed under  1441. pp.694-700.
(a) Breuer unquestionably could have begun his action in the District Court under 216(b), as well as under 28 U. S. C.  1331 and  1337(a). Removal of FLSA actions is thus prohibited under  1441(a) only if Congress expressly provided as much. Nothing on the face of  216(b) looks like an express prohibition of removal, there being no mention of removal, let alone of prohibition. While  216(b) provides that an action ""may be maintained ... in any ... State court of competent jurisdiction,"" the word ""maintain"" enjoys a breadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal ambiguous at best. ""Maintain"" in reference to a legal action is often read as ""bring"" or ""file,"" but ""to maintain an action"" may also mean ""to continue"" to litigate, as opposed to ""commence"" an action. If an ambiguous term like ""maintain"" qualified as an express provision for  1441(a) purposes, then the requirement of an ""expres[s] provi[sion]"" would call for nothing more than a ""provision,"" pure and

692
simple, leaving the word ""expressly"" without any consequence whatever. The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is underscored by examples of indisputable prohibitions of removal in a number of other statutes, e. g.,  1445, which demonstrate that, when Congress wishes to give plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum, it is capable of doing so in unmistakable terms. Pp. 694-697.
(b) None of Breuer's refinements on his basic argument from the term ""maintain"" puts him in a stronger position. The Court rejects his argument that ""may be maintained"" shows up as sufficiently prohibitory once it is coupled with a federal policy of construing removal jurisdiction narrowly, as set forth in Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100, 108-109. Whatever apparent force this argument might have claimed when Shamrock was handed down has been qualified by the later amendment of  1441 into its present form, requiring any exception to the general removability rule to be express. Nor does it avail Breuer to emphasize the sense of ""maintain"" as implying continuation of an action to final judgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an action the statutory right under  216(b) to see it through. The right to maintain an action may indeed be a right to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeat that right; far from concluding a case before final judgment, removal just transfers it from one forum to another. Moreover, if ""an action ... may be maintained"" meant that a plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case wherever he filed it in the first place, it would seem that an FLSA case brought in a federal district court could never be transferred to a different one over the plaintiff's objection, a result that would plainly clash with the provision for change of venue,  1404(a). Finally, although Breuer may be right that many FLSA claims are for such small amounts that removal to a sometimes distant federal court, often increasing the cost of litigation, may make it difficult for many employees to vindicate their rights effectively, the implications of that assertion keep this Court from going Breuer's way. Because a number of other statutes incorporate or use the same language as 29 U. S. C.  216(b), see, e. g.,  626(b), there cannot be an FLSA removal exception without wholesale exceptions for other statutory actions, to the point that it is just too hard to believe that a right to ""maintain"" an action was ever meant to displace the right to remove. Pp. 697-699.
292 F.3d 1308, affirmed.

Nor does it avail Breuer to emphasize the sense of ""maintain"" as implying continuation of an action to final judgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an action the statutory right under  216(b) to see it through. The right to maintain an action may indeed be a right to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeat that right; far from concluding a case before final judgment, removal just transfers it from one forum to another. Moreover, if ""an action ... may be maintained"" meant that a plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case wherever he filed it in the first place, it would seem that an FLSA case brought in a federal district court could never be transferred to a different one over the plaintiff's objection, a result that would plainly clash with the provision for change of venue,  1404(a). Finally, although Breuer may be right that many FLSA claims are for such small amounts that removal to a sometimes distant federal court, often increasing the cost of litigation, may make it difficult for many employees to vindicate their rights effectively, the implications of that assertion keep this Court from going Breuer's way. Because a number of other statutes incorporate or use the same language as 29 U. S. C.  216(b), see, e. g.,  626(b), there cannot be an FLSA removal exception without wholesale exceptions for other statutory actions, to the point that it is just too hard to believe that a right to ""maintain"" an action was ever meant to displace the right to remove. Pp. 697-699.

INYO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, ET AL. v. PAIUTESHOSHONE INDIANS OF THE BISHOP COMMUNITY OF THE BISHOP COLONY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No.02-281. Argued March 31, 2003-Decided May 19,2003
The Bishop Paiute Tribe in California chartered and wholly owns the Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, which operates and manages the Paiute Palace Casino (Casino), a tribal gaming operation. When the Inyo County District Attorney asked the Casino for the employment records of three Casino employees under investigation for welfare fraud, the Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. The District Attorney, on showing probable cause, then obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees. The District Attorney subsequently asked for the records of six other Casino employees. The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee's signed welfare application. The District Attorney refused the offer. To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and its Gaming Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court against the District Attorney and the Sheriff, in their individual and official capacities, and Inyo County (County). Asserting federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4), and the federal common law of Indian affairs, the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records. The Tribe also sought relief under 42 U. S. C.  1983, including compensatory damages, alleging that the defendants violated the Tribe's and Gaming Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Tribe's right to self-government. The District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint, holding, inter alia, that tribal sovereign immunity did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that execution of a search warrant against the Tribe interfered with ""the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them."" Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 220. Acknowledging a prior

Syllabus
decision in which it held that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by  1983, the court concluded that, in this case, a  1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought protection from an unlawful search and seizure, a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within  1983's compass.
Held:
1. The Tribe may not sue under  1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Section 1983 permits ""citizen[s]"" and ""other personEs] within the jurisdiction"" of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from ""person[s]"" who, under color of state law, deprive them of federally protected rights. Although this case does not squarely present the question, the Court assumes that tribes, like States, are not subject to suit under  1983. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58. The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies as a claimant-a ""person within the jurisdiction"" of the United States-under  1983. Qualification of a sovereign as a ""person"" who may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not ""upon a bare analysis of the word 'person,'"" Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U. S. 308, 317, but on the ""legislative environment"" in which the word appears, Georgia v. Evans, 316 U. S. 159, 161. There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective. It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted ""sovereign"" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes. Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, see Will, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation. For example, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a ""person"" qualified to sue under  1983. But, like other persons, that member would have no immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. The Tribe, accordingly, may not sue under  1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. Pp. 708-712.
2. The Tribe has not explained, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided, what prescription of federal common law, if any, enables the Tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal processes. This case is therefore remanded for focused consideration and resolution of that jurisdictional question. P. 712.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES v. DAVID
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-1212. Decided May 19,2003
Respondent David paid petitioner Los Angeles $134.50 to recover his car, which had been towed from a spot where parking was prohibited, and requested a hearing to recover the money. The hearing was held 27 days after the car was towed and his claim was denied. He then filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 suit, claiming that the city violated his due process rights by failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing. The District Court granted the city summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Constitution required the city to provide an earlier hearing, perhaps within 48 hours of towing and at least within 5 days.
Held: The Due Process Clause does not prohibit an agency from imposing the kind of procedural delay experienced here when holding hearings to consider claims such as David's. The three factors that normally determine whether an individual has received the ""process"" that the Constitution finds ""due""-which were set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335, and applied in FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 242require reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision. The first factor-the ""private interest"" affected by the official action-is a monetary interest that does not work the far more serious harm caused by the temporary deprivation of a job that was at issue in Mallen. The second factorconcern for accuracy-also does not support the Ninth Circuit's conclusion. A 30-day delay in presenting evidence is unlikely to spawn significant factual errors, and the nature of the issue-whether a car is illegally parked-indicates that initial towing errors are unlikely. The third factor-the government's interest-argues strongly in the city's favor. Only five percent of the 1,000 impound hearings the city holds annually are conducted within 48 hours, and those involve persons who cannot afford the impoundment fees. The delay is substantially required by administrative needs related to organizing the hearing, e. g., arranging for the towing officer to appear. Requiring the city to hold 1,000 hearings, rather than 50, within a short time period would prove burdensome.
Certiorari granted; 307 F.3d 1143, reversed.

Per Curiam
PER CURIAM.
On August 13, 1998, an officer of the city of Los Angeles Department of Transportation ordered respondent Edwin David's automobile towed from a spot where parking was forbidden. After paying $134.50, David recovered his car. David, believing that the trees obstructed his view of the ""no parking"" sign, requested a hearing to recover the money. On September 9, 1998-27 days after the vehicle was towed-the city held the hearing and denied David's claim.
David then brought this lawsuit in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983, arguing that the city, in failing to provide a sufficiently prompt hearing, had violated his federal right to ""due process of law."" Arndt. 14,  1. The District Court granted summary judgment for the city. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a vote of 2 to 1, reversed, holding that the Constitution required the city to provide an earlier payment-recovery hearing, perhaps within 48 hours of the towing and at least within 5 days. 307 F.3d 1143, 1147 (2002). The city, seeking certiorari here, argues that the Ninth Circuit's holding runs contrary to well-settled principles of constitutional law. We agree. We grant the writ and summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit's judgment.
In Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976), the Court set forth three factors that normally determine whether an individual has received the ""process"" that the Constitution finds ""due"":

""First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.""

ILLINOIS EX REL. MADIGAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ILLINOIS v. TELEMARKETING ASSOCIATES, INC., ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS No. 01-1806. Argued March 3, 2003-Decided May 5, 2003
Respondents, Illinois for-profit fundraising corporations and their owner (collectively Telemarketers), were retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. The contracts between those parties provided, among other things, that Telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from Illinois donors, leaving 15 percent for VietNow. The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint in state court, alleging, inter alia, that Telemarketers represented to donors that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow for specifically identified charitable endeavors, and that such representations were knowingly deceptive and materially false, constituted a fraud, and were made for Telemarketers' private pecuniary benefit. The trial court granted Telemarketers' motion to dismiss the fraud claims on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts placed heavy weight on Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781. Those decisions held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a prescribed level effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the First Amendment. The state high court acknowledged that this case involved no such prophylactic proscription of high-fee charitable solicitation. Instead, the court noted, the Attorney General sought to enforce the State's generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for specific instances of deliberate deception. However, the Illinois Supreme Court said, Telemarketers' solicitation statements were alleged to be false only because Telemarketers contracted for 85 percent of the gross receipts and failed to disclose this information to donors. The court concluded that the Attorney General's complaint was, in essence, an attempt to regulate Telemarketers' ability to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentage-rate limitation-the same regulatory principle rejected in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley.

601
Held: Consistent with this Court's precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used. The Illinois Attorney General's allegations against Telemarketers therefore state a claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss. Pp. 611-624.
(a) The First Amendment protects the right to engage in charitable solicitation, see, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 632, but does not shield fraud, see, e. g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190. Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is unprotected speech. See, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164. This Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment's application to individual fraud actions of the kind at issue here. It has, however, three times held unconstitutional prophylactic laws designed to combat fraud by imposing prior restraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a specified reasonable level. Pp. 611-617.
(b) In those cases, Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court took care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard the public against false or misleading charitable solicitations. See, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637. As those decisions recognized, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraud actions trained on representations made in individual cases and statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fundraising costs run high. Simply labeling an action one for ""fraud,"" of course, will not carry the day. Had the State Attorney General's complaint charged fraud based solely on the percentage of donations the fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert donors to fee arrangements at the start of each call, Riley would support swift dismissal. Portions of the Attorney General's complaint against Telemarketers were of this genre. But the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Telemarketers failed to convey. They also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented. Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General, that pleading described misrepresentations this Court's precedent does not place under the First Amendment's cover. First, the complaint asserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow to be used for specific charitable purposes while in fact Telemarketers knew that 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available for those purposes. Second, the complaint essentially alleged that the charitable solicitation was a fa\;ade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated funds would go to VietNow's charitable purposes, the amount of funds paid over to

KAUPP v. TEXAS
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TEXAS, FOURTEENTH DISTRICT
No. 02-5636. Decided May 5, 2003
Mter petitioner Kaupp, then 17, was implicated in the murder of a 14year-old girl by the confession of the girl's half brother, detectives tried, but failed, to obtain a warrant to question Kaupp. They then went to his house at 3 a.m.; awakened and handcuffed him; led him, shoeless and dressed only in his underwear, to a patrol car; stopped at the crime scene; and took him to the sheriff's headquarters, where they removed the handcuffs and advised him of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436. Once presented with the brother's confession, Kaupp admitted to having a part in the crime. He did not acknowledge causing the fatal wound or confess to the murder, for which he was later indicted. Kaupp moved unsuccessfully to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, was convicted, and was sentenced to prison. In affirming, the Texas Court of Appeals found that the arrest occurred after Kaupp's confession; that Kaupp consented to go with the officers when he answered ""Okay"" to an officer's statement that they needed to talk; that a reasonable person would not have believed that putting on handcuffs before being removed to a patrol car was a significant restriction on his freedom of movement, since this was common practice of the sheriff's office; and that Kaupp did not resist the use of handcuffs or act in a manner consistent with anything but full cooperation. The State Court of Criminal Appeals denied discretionary review.
Held: Kaupp was arrested within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment before the detectives began to question him. A seizure of the person within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments occurs when, ""taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would 'have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.''' Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 437. This test is derived from Justice Stewart's opinion in United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 554, which includes, as examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, the threatening presence of several police officers, an officer's display of a weapon, some physical touching of the person, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled. This Court has never sustained the involuntary removal of a suspect from his home to a police

627
station and his detention there for investigative purposes absent probable cause or judicial authorization. The State does not claim to have had probable cause here, and an application of the test just mentioned shows that Kaupp was arrested, there being evidence of everyone of Mendenhall's probative circumstances. A 17-year-old boy was awakened at 3 a.m. by at least three police officers, placed in handcuffs, and taken in his underwear and without shoes in a patrol car to the crime scene and then to the sheriff's offices, where he was taken into an interrogation room and questioned. The contrary reasons mentioned by the state courts-his ""Okay"" response, that the sheriff's office routinely handcuffed individuals when transporting them, and that Kaupp did not resist the handcuffs or act uncooperatively-are no answer to the facts here. Because Kaupp was arrested before he was questioned, and because the State does not claim that the sheriff's department had probable cause to detain him at that point, his confession must be suppressed unless the State can show that it was an act of free will sufficient to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion. The only relevant consideration supporting the State is the observance of Miranda, but such warnings alone cannot always break the causal connection between the illegality and the confession, Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, 603. All other relevant considerations-the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, the presence of intervening circumstances, and the official misconduct's purpose and flagrancy-point the opposite way. Unless, on remand, the State can point to testimony undisclosed on this record, and weighty enough to carry its burden despite the clear force of the evidence here, the confession must be suppressed.
Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.
This case turns on the Fourth Amendment rule that a confession ""obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest"" may not be used against a criminal defendant. Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590, 603 (1975). After a 14-year-old girl disappeared in January 1999, the Harris County Sheriff's Department learned she had had a sexual relationship with her 19year-old half brother, who had been in the company of petitioner Robert Kaupp, then 17 years old, on the day of the girl's disappearance. On January 26th, deputy sheriffs questioned the brother and Kaupp at headquarters; Kaupp was cooperative and was permitted to leave, but the brother

DEMORE, DISTRICT DIRECTOR, SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT OF IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, ET AL. v. KIM
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1491. Argued January 15, 2003-Decided April 29, 2003
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C.  1226(c), ""[t]he Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who"" is removable from this country because he has been convicted of one of a specified set of crimes, including an ""aggravated felony."" Mter respondent, a lawful permanent resident alien, was convicted in state court of first-degree burglary and, later, of ""petty theft with priors,"" the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged him with being deportable from the United States in light of these convictions, and detained him pending his removal hearing. Without disputing the validity of his convictions or the INS' conclusion that he is deportable and therefore subject to mandatory detention under  1226(c), respondent filed a habeas corpus action challenging  1226(c) on the ground that his detention thereunder violated due process because the INS had made no determination that he posed either a danger to society or a flight risk. The District Court agreed and granted respondent's petition subject to the INS' prompt undertaking of an individualized bond hearing, after which respondent was released on bond. In affirming, the Ninth Circuit held that  1226(c) violates substantive due process as applied to respondent because he is a lawful permanent resident, the most favored category of aliens. The court rejected the Government's two principal justifications for mandatory detention under  1226(c), discounting the firstensuring the presence of criminal aliens at their removal proceedingsupon finding that not all aliens detained pursuant to  1226(c) would ultimately be deported, and discounting the second-protecting the public from dangerous criminal aliens-on the grounds that the aggravated felony classification triggering respondent's detention included crimes (such as respondent's) that the court did not consider ""egregious"" or otherwise sufficiently dangerous to the public to necessitate mandatory detention. Relying on Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, the court concluded that the INS had not provided a justification for no-bail civil detention sufficient to overcome a permanent resident alien's liberty interest.

511
Held:
1. Section 1226(e)-which states that ""[t]he Attorney General's discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review"" and that ""[n]o court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien"" -does not deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction to grant habeas relief to aliens challenging their detention under  1226(c). Respondent does not challenge a ""discretionary judgment"" by the Attorney General or a ""decision"" that the Attorney General has made regarding his detention or release. Rather, respondent challenges the statutory framework that permits his detention without bail. Where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear. E. g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603. And, where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar habeas review, the Court requires a particularly clear statement that such is Congress' intent. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 308-309, 298, 327. Section 1226(e) contains no explicit provision barring habeas review. Pp. 516-517.
2. Congress, justifiably concerned with evidence that deportable criminal aliens who are not detained continue to engage in crime and fail to appear for their removal hearings in large numbers, may require that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings. In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 79-80. Although the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process in deportation proceedings, Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 306, detention during such proceedings is a constitutionally valid aspect of the process, e. g., Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235, even where, as here, aliens challenge their detention on the grounds that there has been no finding that they are unlikely to appear for their deportation proceedings, Carlson v. Landon, 342 U. S. 524, 538. The INS detention of respondent, a criminal alien who has conceded that he is deportable, for the limited period of his removal proceedings, is governed by these cases. Respondent argues unpersuasively that the  1226(c) detention policy violates due process under Zadvydas, 533 U. S., at 699, in which the Court held that  1231(a)(6) authorizes continued detention of an alien subject to a final removal order beyond that section's 90-day removal period for only such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the removal. Zadvydas is materially different from the present case in two respects. First, the aliens there challenging their detention following final deportation orders were ones for whom removal was ""no longer practically attainable,"" such that their detention

ROELL ET AL. v. WITHROW
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 02-69. Argued February 26, 2003-Decided April 29, 2003
The Federal Magistrate Act of 1979 (Act) empowers full-time magistrate judges to conduct ""any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case,"" as long as they are ""specially designated ... by the district court"" and acting with ""the consent of the parties."" 28 U. S. C.  636(c)(1). Respondent Withrow, a state prisoner, brought an action under 42 U. S. C.  1983 against members of the prison's medical staff, petitioners Roell, Garibay, and Reagan, alleging that they had deliberately disregarded his medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. During a preliminary hearing, the Magistrate Judge told Withrow that he could choose to have her rather than the District Judge preside over the entire case. Withrow agreed orally and later in writing, but the petitioners did not at that point give their consent. Without waiting for their decision, the District Judge referred the case to the Magistrate Judge for final disposition, but with the caveat that all petitioners would have an opportunity to consent to her jurisdiction, and that the referral order would be vacated if any of them did not consent. Only Reagan gave written consent to the referral; Roell and Garibay said nothing about the referral. The case nevertheless proceeded in front of the Magistrate Judge, all the way to a jury verdict and judgment for the petitioners. Roell and Garibay voluntarily participated in the entire course of proceedings and voiced no objection when, at several points, the Magistrate Judge made it clear that she believed they had consented. When Withrow appealed, the Fifth Circuit sua sponte remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether the parties had consented to proceed before the Magistrate Judge. Only then did Roell and Garibay file a formal letter of consent stating that they consented to all of the prior proceedings before the Magistrate Judge. The District Court referred the Fifth Circuit's enquiry to that same Magistrate Judge, who reported that by their actions Roell and Garibay clearly implied their consent to her jurisdiction, but ruled that she had lacked jurisdiction because, under Circuit precedent, such consent had to be expressly given. The District Court adopted the report and recommendation. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that, under  636(c)(1), lack of consent and defects in the referral order are nonwaivable jurisdictional errors, that  636(c) consent must be ex-

581
press, and that petitioners' post judgment consent was inadequate under the Act.
Held: Consent to a magistrate judge's designation can be inferred from a party's conduct during litigation. Roell's and Garibay's general appearances before the Magistrate Judge, after they had been told of their right to be tried by a district judge, supply the consent necessary for the Magistrate Judge's ""civil jurisdiction"" under  636(c)(1). It is true that  636(c)(2) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(b), which establish the procedures for a  636(c)(1) referral, envision advance, written consent communicated to the clerk. This procedure is by no means just advisory, and district courts are bound to adhere strictly to it. But the text and structure of  636(c) as a whole indicate that a defect in the referral under  636(c)(2) does not eliminate that magistrate judge's ""civil jurisdiction"" under  636(c)(1) as long as the parties have in fact voluntarily consented. So far as concerns full-time magistrate judges,  636(c)(1), which is the font of magistrate judge authority, speaks only of ""the consent of the parties,"" without qualification as to form, and  636(c)(3) similarly provides that ""[t]he consent of the parties allows"" a full-time magistrate judge to enter a final, appealable judgment of the district court. These unadorned references to the ""consent of the parties"" contrast with the language in  636(c)(1) covering referral to certain part-time magistrate judges, which requires not only that the parties consent, but that they do so by ""specific written request."" In addition, there is a good pragmatic reason to think that Congress intended to permit implied consent. In giving magistrate judges casedispositive civil authority, Congress hoped to relieve the district courts' caseload while still preserving every litigant's right to insist on trial before an Article III district judge. Strict insistence on the express consent requirement embodied in  636(c)(2) would minimize any risk to the latter objective, but it would create an even greater risk to the former one: the risk of a full and complicated trial wasted at the option of an undeserving and possibly opportunistic litigant. Here, Withrow gave express, written consent; he thus received the protection intended by the statute and deserves no boon from the other side's failure. Had the outcome of the case been different, the shoe might be on the other foot; insistence on the bright line would let parties in Roell's and Garibay's position hedge their bets, keeping a poker face to conceal their failure to file the form, and then sandbagging the other side when the judgment turned out not to their liking. The preferable rule, which does better by the mix of congressional objectives, is to infer consent from a litigant's general appearance before the magistrate judge, after having been told of his right to be tried by a district judge. Pp. 585-591.

FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF CALIFORNIA v. HYATT ETAL.

Respondent Hyatt's (hereinafter respondent) ""part-year"" 1991 California income-tax return represented that he had ceased to be a California resident and had become a Nevada resident in October 1991, shortly before he received substantial licensing fees. Petitioner California Franchise Tax Board (CFTB) determined that he was a California resident until April 1992, and accordingly issued notices of proposed assessments for 1991 and 1992 and imposed substantial civil fraud penalties. Respondent filed suit against CFTB in a Nevada state court, alleging that CFTB had directed numerous contacts at Nevada and had committed negligence and intentional torts during the course of its audit of respondent. In its motion for summary judgment or dismissal, CFTB argued that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because full faith and credit and other legal principles required that the court apply California law immunizing CFTB from suit. Upon denial of that motion, CFTB petitioned the Nevada Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus ordering dismissal. The latter court ultimately granted the petition in part and denied it in part, holding that the lower court should have declined to exercise its jurisdiction over the underlying negligence claim under comity principles, but that the intentional tort claims could proceed to trial. Among other things, the court noted that Nevada immunizes its state agencies from suits for discretionary acts but not for intentional torts committed within the course and scope of employment and held that affording CFTB statutory immunity with respect to intentional torts would contravene Nevada's interest in protecting its citizens from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister States' government employees.
Held: The Full Faith and Credit Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV,  1, does not require Nevada to give full faith and credit to California's statutes providing its tax agency with immunity from suit. The full faith and credit command ""is exacting"" with respect to a final judgment rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U. S. 222, 233, but is less demanding with respect to choice of laws. The Clause does not compel a State to substitute the statutes of other States for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it

489
is competent to legislate. E. g., Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U. S. 717, 722. Nevada is undoubtedly competent to legislate with respect to the subject matter of the alleged intentional torts here, which, it is claimed, have injured one of its citizens within its borders. CFTB argues unpersuasively that this Court should adopt a ""new rule"" mandating that a state court extend full faith and credit to a sister State's statutorily recaptured sovereign immunity from suit when a refusal to do so would interfere with the State's capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities. The Court has, in the past, appraised and balanced state interests when invoking the Full Faith and Credit Clause to resolve conflicts between overlapping laws of coordinate States. See, e. g., Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145. However, this balancing-ofinterests approach quickly proved unsatisfactory and the Court abandoned it, Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague, 449 U. S. 302, 308, n. 10, 322, n. 6, 339, n. 6, recognizing, instead, that it is frequently the case under the Clause that a court can lawfully apply either the law of one State or the contrary law of another, Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 727. The Court has already ruled that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a forum State to apply a sister State's sovereign immunity statutes where such application would violate the forum State's own legitimate public policy. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 424. There is no constitutionally significant distinction between the degree to which the allegedly tortious acts here and in Hall are related to a core sovereign function. States' sovereignty interests are not foreign to the full faith and credit command, but the Court is not presented here with a case in which a State has exhibited a ""policy of hostility to the public Acts"" of a sister State. Carroll v. Lanza, 349 U. S. 408,413. The Nevada Supreme Court sensitively applied comity principles with a healthy regard for California's sovereign status, relying on the contours of Nevada's own sovereign immunity from suit as a benchmark for its analysis. Pp.494-499.
Mfirmed.
O'CONNOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
Felix E. Leatherwood, Deputy Attorney General of California, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Bill Lockyer, Attorney General, Manuel M. Medeiros, State Solicitor, David S. Chaney, Senior Assistant Attorney General, and William Dean Freeman, Lead Supervising Deputy Attorney General.

MASSARO v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 01-1559. Argued February 25, 2003-Decided April 23, 2003
Petitioner Massaro was indicted on federal racketeering charges in connection with a murder. The day before his trial began, prosecutors learned of a bullet allegedly recovered from the car in which the victim's body was found, but did not inform defense counsel until the trial was underway. Defense counsel more than once declined the trial court's offer of a continuance so the bullet could be examined. Massaro was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. On direct appeal his new counsel argued that the District Court had erred in admitting the bullet in evidence, but did not raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. The Second Circuit affirmed. Massaro later moved to vacate his conviction under 28 U. S. C.  2255, claiming, as relevant here, that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in failing to accept the trial court's offer of a continuance. The District Court found his claim procedurally defaulted because he could have raised it on direct appeal. In affirming, the Second Circuit adhered to its precedent that, when the defendant is represented by new counsel on appeal and the ineffective-assistance claim is based solely on the trial record, the claim must be raised on direct appeal; failure to do so results in procedural default unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice.
Held: An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under  2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal. Requiring a criminal defendant to bring ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal does not promote the procedural default rule's objectives: conserving judicial resources and respecting the law's important interest in the finality of judgments. Applying that rule to ineffective-assistance claims would create a risk that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there has been an opportunity fully to develop the claim's factual predicate, and would raise the issue for the first time in a forum not best suited to assess those facts, even if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel's performance. A  2255 motion is preferable to direct appeal for deciding an ineffective-assistance claim. When a claim is brought on direct appeal, appellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial record that is not developed precisely for, and is therefore

501
often incomplete or inadequate for, the purpose of litigating or preserving the claim. A defendant claiming ineffective counsel must show that counsel's actions were not supported by a reasonable strategy and that the error was prejudicial. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The evidence introduced at trial, however, will be devoted to guilt or innocence issues, and the resulting record may not disclose the facts necessary to decide either prong of the Strickland analysis. Under the rule announced here, ineffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial. The court may take testimony from witnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from the counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance. In addition, the  2255 motion often will be ruled upon by the district judge who presided at trial, who should have an advantageous perspective for determining the effectiveness of counsel's conduct and whether any deficiencies were prejudicial. This Court does not hold that ineffectiveassistance claims must be reserved for collateral review, as there may be cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that appellate counsel will raise the issue on direct appeal or in which obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an appellate court sua sponte. In such cases, certain questions may arise in subsequent  2255 proceedings concerning the conclusiveness of determinations made on the claims raised on direct appeal; but these implementation matters are not before the Court. pp. 504-509.

CLACKAMAS GASTROENTEROLOGY ASSOCIATES, P. C. v. WELLS
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1435. Argued February 25, 2003-Decided April 22, 2003
Respondent filed suit alleging that petitioner medical clinic violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA or Act) when it terminated her employment. Petitioner moved for summary judgment, asserting that it was not covered by the Act because it did not have 15 or more employees for the 20 weeks required by the ADA. That assertion's accuracy depends on whether the four physician-shareholders who own the professional corporation and constitute its board of directors are counted as employees. In granting the motion, the District Court concluded that the physicians were more analogous to partners in a partnership than to shareholders in a corporation and therefore were not employees under the ADA. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding no reason to permit a professional corporation to reap the tax and civil liability advantages of its corporate status and then argue that it is like a partnership so as to avoid employment discrimination liability.
Held:
1. The common-law element of control is the principal guidepost to be followed in deciding whether the four director-shareholder physicians in this case should be counted as ""employees."" Where, as here, a statute does not helpfully define the term ""employee,"" this Court's cases construing similar language give guidance in how best to fill the statutory text's gap. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 322, 323. The professional corporation is a new type of business entity with no exact common-law precedent, but the common law's definition of the master-servant relationship provides helpful guidance: the focus on the master's control over the servant. Accordingly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) argues that a court should examine whether shareholder-directors operate independently and manage the business or instead are subject to the firm's control. Specific EEOC guidelines discuss the broad question of who is an ""employee"" and the narrower one of when partners, officers, board of directors' members, and major shareholders qualify as employees. The Court is persuaded by the EEOC's focus on the common-law touchstone of control and specifically by its submission that each of six factors are relevant to the inquiry whether a shareholder-director is an employee. Pp. 444-451.

441
2. Because the District Court's findings appear to weigh in favor of concluding that the four physicians are not clinic employees, but evidence in the record may contradict those findings or support a contrary conclusion under the EEOC's standard, the case is remanded for further proceedings.

JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA No. 02-258. Argued March 5, 2003-Decided April 22, 2003
Title 28 U. S. C.  1367 determines whether a federal district court with jurisdiction over a civil action may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims forming part of the same Article III ""case or controversy."" If the court declines to exercise such jurisdiction, the claims will be dismissed and must be refiled in state court. To prevent the limitations period on those claims from expiring while they are pending in federal court,  1367(d) requires state courts to toll the period while a supplemental claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days after its dismissal unless state law provides for a longer tolling period. Petitioner filed a federal-court action claiming that Richland County (hereinafter respondent) and others violated 42 U. S. C.  1983 in connection with her husband's death. She also asserted supplemental claims for wrongful death and survival under South Carolina law. The District Court granted defendants summary judgment on the  1983 claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims. Petitioner then filed the supplemental claims in state court and won a wrongfuldeath verdict against respondent. The State Supreme Court reversed, finding the state-law claims time barred. Although they would not have been barred under  1367(d)'s tolling rule, the court held  1367(d) unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against a State's political subdivisions.
Held: Section 1367(d)'s application to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions is constitutional. Pp. 461-467.
(a) The Court rejects respondent's contention that  1367(d) is facially invalid because it exceeds Congress's enumerated powers. Rather, it is necessary and proper for executing Congress's power ""[tJo constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,"" Art. I,  8, cl. 9, and assuring that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise ""[tJhe judicial Power of the United States,"" Art. III,  1. As to ""necessity"": It suffices that  1367(d) is conducive to the administration of justice in federal court and is plainly adapted to that end. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,421. And as to propriety: Contrary to respondent's claim,  1367(d) does not violate state-sovereignty principles by regulating state-court procedures. Pp. 461-465.

457
(b) Also without merit is respondent's contention that  1367(d) should not be interpreted to apply to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions. Congress lacks Article I authority to override a State's immunity from suit in its own courts, see Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, but it may subject a municipality to suit in state court if that is done pursuant to a valid exercise of its enumerated powers, see id., at 756. This is merely the consequence of those cases, which respondent does not ask the Court to overrule, holding that municipalities do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit.

JINKS v. RICHLAND COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA No. 02-258. Argued March 5, 2003-Decided April 22, 2003
Title 28 U. S. C.  1367 determines whether a federal district court with jurisdiction over a civil action may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over other claims forming part of the same Article III ""case or controversy."" If the court declines to exercise such jurisdiction, the claims will be dismissed and must be refiled in state court. To prevent the limitations period on those claims from expiring while they are pending in federal court,  1367(d) requires state courts to toll the period while a supplemental claim is pending in federal court and for 30 days after its dismissal unless state law provides for a longer tolling period. Petitioner filed a federal-court action claiming that Richland County (hereinafter respondent) and others violated 42 U. S. C.  1983 in connection with her husband's death. She also asserted supplemental claims for wrongful death and survival under South Carolina law. The District Court granted defendants summary judgment on the  1983 claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims. Petitioner then filed the supplemental claims in state court and won a wrongfuldeath verdict against respondent. The State Supreme Court reversed, finding the state-law claims time barred. Although they would not have been barred under  1367(d)'s tolling rule, the court held  1367(d) unconstitutional as applied to claims brought in state court against a State's political subdivisions.
Held: Section 1367(d)'s application to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions is constitutional. Pp. 461-467.
(a) The Court rejects respondent's contention that  1367(d) is facially invalid because it exceeds Congress's enumerated powers. Rather, it is necessary and proper for executing Congress's power ""[tJo constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,"" Art. I,  8, cl. 9, and assuring that those tribunals may fairly and efficiently exercise ""[tJhe judicial Power of the United States,"" Art. III,  1. As to ""necessity"": It suffices that  1367(d) is conducive to the administration of justice in federal court and is plainly adapted to that end. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,421. And as to propriety: Contrary to respondent's claim,  1367(d) does not violate state-sovereignty principles by regulating state-court procedures. Pp. 461-465.

457
(b) Also without merit is respondent's contention that  1367(d) should not be interpreted to apply to claims brought against a State's political subdivisions. Congress lacks Article I authority to override a State's immunity from suit in its own courts, see Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, but it may subject a municipality to suit in state court if that is done pursuant to a valid exercise of its enumerated powers, see id., at 756. This is merely the consequence of those cases, which respondent does not ask the Court to overrule, holding that municipalities do not enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit. And any suggestion that an ""unmistakably clear"" statement is required before an Act of Congress may expose a local government to liability cannot possibly be reconciled with Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658. Pp. 465-467.

DOLE FOOD CO. ET AL. V. PATRICKSON ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-593. Argued January 22, 2003-Decided April 22, 2003*
Plaintiffs filed a state-court action against Dole Food Company and others (Dole petitioners), alleging injury from chemical exposure. The Dole petitioners impleaded petitioners Dead Sea Bromine Co. and Bromine Compounds, Ltd. (collectively, the Dead Sea Companies). The Dole petitioners removed the action to federal court under 28 U. S. C.  1441(a), arguing that the federal common law of foreign relations provided federal-question jurisdiction under  1331. The District Court agreed it had jurisdiction, but dismissed the case on other grounds. As to the Dead Sea Companies, the court rejected their claim that they are instrumentalities of a foreign state (Israel) as defined by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), and are therefore entitled to removal under  1441(d). The Ninth Circuit reversed. As to the Dole petitioners, it held removal could not rest on the federal common law of foreign relations. Regarding the Dead Sea Companies, the court noted, but declined to answer, the question whether status as an instrumentality of a foreign state is assessed at the time of the alleged wrongdoing or at the time suit is filed. It held that the Dead Sea Companies, even at the earlier date, were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did not meet the FSIA's instrumentality definition.
Held:
1. The writ of certiorari is dismissed in No. 01-593, as the Dole petitioners did not seek review in this Court of the Ninth Circuit's ruling on the federal common law of foreign relations. P. 472.
2. A foreign state must itself own a majority of a corporation's shares if the corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state under the FSIA. Israel did not have direct ownership of shares in either of the Dead Sea Companies at any time pertinent to this action. Rather, they were, at various times, separated from Israel by one or more intermediate corporate tiers. As indirect subsidiaries of Israel, the companies cannot come within the statutory language granting instrumentality status to an entity a ""majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof.""
*Together with No. 01-594, Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd., et al. v. Patrickson et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

469
 1603(b)(2). Only direct ownership satisfies the statutory requirement. In issues of corporate law structure often matters. The statutory reference to ownership of ""shares"" shows that Congress intended coverage to turn on formal corporate ownership. As a corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities, see, e. g., First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611, 625, a corporate parent which owns a subsidiary's shares does not, for that reason alone, own or have legal title to the subsidiary's assets; and, it follows with even greater force, the parent does not own or have legal title to the subsidiary's subsidiaries. The veil separating corporations and their shareholders may be pierced in certain exceptional circumstances, but the Dead Sea Companies refer to no authority for extending the doctrine so far that, as a categorical matter, all subsidiaries are deemed to be the same as the parent corporation. Various federal statutes refer to ""direct or indirect ownership."" The absence of this language in  1603(b) instructs the Court that Congress did not intend to disregard structural ownership rules here. That section's ""other ownership interest"" phrase, when following the word ""shares,"" should be interpreted to refer to a type of interest other than stock ownership. Reading the phrase to refer to a state's interest in entities further down the corporate ladder would make the specific reference to ""shares"" redundant. The fact that Israel exercised considerable control over the companies may not be substituted for an ownership interest, since control and ownership are distinct concepts, and it is majority ownership by a foreign state, not control, that is the benchmark of instrumentality status. Pp. 473-478.
3. Instrumentality status is determined at the time of the filing of the complaint. Construing  1603(b)(2) so that the present tense in the provision ""a majority of whose shares ... is owned by a foreign state"" has real significance is consistent with the longstanding principle that the Court's jurisdiction depends upon the state of things at the time the action is brought. E. g., Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 207. The Dead Sea Companies' attempt to compare foreign sovereign immunity with other immunities that are based on a government officer's status at the time of the conduct giving rise to the suit is inapt because the reason for those other immunities does not apply here. Unlike those immunities, foreign sovereign immunity is not meant to avoid chilling foreign states or their instrumentalities in the conduct of their business but to give them some protection from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity, Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486. Because any relationship recognized under the FSIA between the Dead Sea Companies and Israel had been severed before suit was commenced, the companies would not be entitled to in-

VIRGINIA v. BLACK ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA No. 01-1107. Argued December 11, 2002-Decided April 7, 2003
Respondents were convicted separately of violating a Virginia statute that makes it a felony ""for any person ..., with the intent of intimidating any person or group ... , to burn a cross on the property of another, a highway or other public place,"" and specifies that ""[a]ny such burning ... shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group."" When respondent Black objected on First Amendment grounds to his trial court's jury instruction that cross burning by itself is sufficient evidence from which the required ""intent to intimidate"" could be inferred, the prosecutor responded that the instruction was taken straight out of the Virginia Model Instructions. Respondent O'Mara pleaded guilty to charges of violating the statute, but reserved the right to challenge its constitutionality. At respondent Elliott's trial, the judge instructed the jury as to what the Commonwealth had to prove, but did not give an instruction on the meaning of the word ""intimidate,"" nor on the statute's prima facie evidence provision. Consolidating all three cases, the Virginia Supreme Court held that the crossburning statute is unconstitutional on its face; that it is analytically indistinguishable from the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377; that it discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint since it selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message; and that the prima facie evidence provision renders the statute overbroad because the enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute chills the expression of protected speech.
Held: The judgment is affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. 262 Va. 764, 553 S. E. 2d 738, affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that a State, consistent with the First Amendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate. Pp. 352-363.
(a) Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Ku Klux Klan, which, following its formation in 1866, imposed a reign of terror throughout the South, whipping, threatening, and murdering blacks, southern whites who disagreed with the Klan, and ""carpetbagger"" northern whites. The Klan has often used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending vio-
[344]
lence, although such burnings have also remained potent symbols of shared group identity and ideology, serving as a central feature of Klan gatherings. To this day, however, regardless of whether the message is a political one or is also meant to intimidate, the burning of a cross is a ""symbol of hate."" Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 771. While cross burning does not inevitably convey a message of intimidation, often the cross burner intends that the recipients of the message fear for their lives. And when a cross burning is used to intimidate, few if any messages are more powerful. Pp. 352-357.
(b) The protections the First Amendment affords speech and expressive conduct are not absolute. This Court has long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. See, e. g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571-572. For example, the First Amendment permits a State to ban ""true threats,"" e. g., Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 708 (per curiam), which encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals, see, e. g., ibid. The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and the disruption that fear engenders, as well as from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. R. A. V., supra, at 388. Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest that some cross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech, and rightly so. As the history of cross burning in this country shows, that act is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a target of violence. pp. 358-360.
(c) The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross burning's long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence. A ban on cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with this Court's holding in R. A. V. Contrary to the Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, R. A. V. did not hold that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of contentbased discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, the Court specifically stated that a particular type of content discrimination does not violate the First Amendment when the basis for it consists
[345]
entirely of the very reason its entire class of speech is proscribable. 505 U. S., at 388. For example, it is permissible to prohibit only that obscenity that is most patently offensive in its prurience-i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. Ibid. Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment insofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Unlike the statute at issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single out for opprobrium only that speech directed toward ""one of the specified disfavored topics."" Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of the victim's race, gender, or religion, or because of the victim's ""political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."" Ibid. Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. Pp. 360-363.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEVENS, and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts IV and V that the Virginia statute's prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted through the jury instruction given in respondent Black's case and as applied therein, is unconstitutional on its face. Because the instruction is the same as the Commonwealth's Model Jury Instruction, and because the Virginia Supreme Court had the opportunity to expressly disavow it, the instruction's construction of the prima facie provision is as binding on this Court as if its precise words had been written into the statute. E. g., Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4. As construed by the instruction, the prima facie provision strips away the very reason why a State may ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate. The provision permits a jury to convict in every cross burning case in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not to put on a defense. And even where a defendant like Black presents a defense, the provision makes it more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidate regardless of the particular facts of the case. It permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself. As so interpreted, it would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas. E.g., Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13. The act of burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation, or it may mean only that the person is engaged in core political speech. The prima facie evidence provision blurs the line between these meanings, ignoring all of the contextual factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut. Thus, Black's conviction cannot stand, and the judgment as
[346]
to him is affirmed. Conversely, Elliott's jury did not receive any instruction on the prima facie provision, and the provision was not an issue in O'Mara's case because he pleaded guilty. The possibility that the provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara could be retried under the statute, is left open. Also left open is the theoretical possibility that, on remand, the Virginia Supreme Court could interpret the prima facie provision in a manner that would avoid the constitutional objections described above. Pp. 363-368.
JUSTICE SCALIA agreed that this Court should vacate and remand the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court with respect to respondents Elliott and O'Mara so that that court can have an opportunity authoritatively to construe the cross-burning statute's prima-facie-evidence provision. Pp. 368, 379.
JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded that the Virginia statute is unconstitutional and cannot be saved by any exception under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, and therefore concurred in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the invalidation of respondent Black's conviction. Pp. 380-381, 387.
O'CONNOR, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and STEVENS, SCALIA, and BREYER, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts IV and V, in which REHNQUIST, C. J., and STEVENS and BREYER, JJ., joined.

(c) The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross burning's long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence. A ban on cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with this Court's holding in R. A. V. Contrary to the Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, R. A. V. did not hold that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of contentbased discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, the Court specifically stated that a particular type of content discrimination does not violate the First Amendment when the basis for it consists
[345]
entirely of the very reason its entire class of speech is proscribable. 505 U. S., at 388. For example, it is permissible to prohibit only that obscenity that is most patently offensive in its prurience-i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. Ibid. Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment insofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Unlike the statute at issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single out for opprobrium only that speech directed toward ""one of the specified disfavored topics."" Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of the victim's race, gender, or religion, or because of the victim's ""political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."" Ibid. Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. Pp. 360-363.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEVENS, and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts IV and V that the Virginia statute's prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted through the jury instruction given in respondent Black's case and as applied therein, is unconstitutional on its face. Because the instruction is the same as the Commonwealth's Model Jury Instruction, and because the Virginia Supreme Court had the opportunity to expressly disavow it, the instruction's construction of the prima facie provision is as binding on this Court as if its precise words had been written into the statute. E. g., Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4. As construed by the instruction, the prima facie provision strips away the very reason why a State may ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate. The provision permits a jury to convict in every cross burning case in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not to put on a defense. And even where a defendant like Black presents a defense, the provision makes it more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidate regardless of the particular facts of the case. It permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself. As so interpreted, it would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas. E.g., Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13. The act of burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation, or it may mean only that the person is engaged in core political speech. The prima facie evidence provision blurs the line between these meanings, ignoring all of the contextual factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut. Thus, Black's conviction cannot stand, and the judgment as
[346]
to him is affirmed. Conversely, Elliott's jury did not receive any instruction on the prima facie provision, and the provision was not an issue in O'Mara's case because he pleaded guilty. The possibility that the provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara could be retried under the statute, is left open. Also left open is the theoretical possibility that, on remand, the Virginia Supreme Court could interpret the prima facie provision in a manner that would avoid the constitutional objections described above. Pp. 363-368.
JUSTICE SCALIA agreed that this Court should vacate and remand the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court with respect to respondents Elliott and O'Mara so that that court can have an opportunity authoritatively to construe the cross-burning statute's prima-facie-evidence provision. Pp. 368, 379.
JUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded that the Virginia statute is unconstitutional and cannot be saved by any exception under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, and therefore concurred in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the invalidation of respondent Black's conviction. Pp. 380-381, 387.

No. 02-215. Argued February 24, 2003-Decided April 7, 2003
Respondent physicians filed suit alleging that managed-health-care organizations, including petitioners, violated, inter alia, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by failing to reimburse them for health-care services that they had provided to patients covered by the organizations' plans. Petitioners moved to compel arbitration. The District Court refused to compel arbitration of the RICO claims on the ground that the arbitration clauses in the parties' agreements prohibited awards of ""punitive damages,"" and hence an arbitrator lacked authority to award treble damages under RICO. Accordingly, the court deemed the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to those claims. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: It is unclear whether the agreements actually prevent an arbitrator from awarding treble damages under RICO. This Court's cases have placed different statutory treble damages provisions on different points along the spectrum between purely compensatory and strictly punitive awards. In particular, the Court has repeatedly acknowledged that RICO's treble-damages provision is remedial in nature, and it is not clear that the parties intended the term ""punitive"" to encompass claims for treble damages under RICO. Since the Court does not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreement unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract.

STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO. v. CAMPBELL ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF UTAH
No. 01-1289. Argued December 11, 2002-Decided April 7, 2003
Although investigators and witnesses concluded that Curtis Campbell caused an accident in which one person was killed and another permanently disabled, his insurer, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), contested liability, declined to settle the ensuing claims for the $50,000 policy limit, ignored its own investigators' advice, and took the case to trial, assuring Campbell and his wife that they had no liability for the accident, that State Farm would represent their interests, and that they did not need separate counsel. In fact, a Utah jury returned a judgment for over three times the policy limit, and State Farm refused to appeal. The Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's own appeal, and State Farm paid the entire judgment. The Campbells then sued State Farm for bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court's initial ruling granting State Farm summary judgment was reversed on appeal. On remand, the court denied State Farm's motion to exclude evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct. In the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the jury found unreasonable State Farm's decision not to settle. Before the second phase, this Court refused, in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, to sustain a $2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a $4,000 compensatory damages award. The trial court denied State Farm's renewed motion to exclude dissimilar out-of-state conduct evidence. In the second phase, which addressed, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages, evidence was introduced that pertained to State Farm's business practices in numerous States but bore no relation to the type of claims underlying the Campbells' complaint. The jury awarded the Campbells $2.6 million in compensatory damages and $145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $1 million and $25 million respectively. Applying Gore, the Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $145 million punitive damages award.
Held: A punitive damages award of $145 million, where full compensatory damages are $1 million, is excessive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 416-429.
(a) Compensatory damages are intended to redress a plaintiff's concrete loss, while punitive damages are aimed at the different purposes
[409]
of deterrence and retribution. The Due Process Clause prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeaser. E. g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U. S. 424, 433. Punitive damages awards serve the same purpose as criminal penalties. However, because civil defendants are not accorded the protections afforded criminal defendants, punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property, which is heightened when the decisionmaker is presented with evidence having little bearing on the amount that should be awarded. Thus, this Court has instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct, (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Gore, supra, at 575. A trial court's application of these guideposts is subject to de novo review. Cooper Industries, supra, at 424. Pp. 416-418.
(b) Under Gore's guideposts, this case is neither close nor difficult. Pp. 418-428.
(1) To determine a defendant's reprehensibility-the most important indicium of a punitive damages award's reasonableness-a court must consider whether: the harm was physical rather than economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. Gore, 517 U. S., at 576-577. It should be presumed that a plaintiff has been made whole by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should be awarded only if the defendant's culpability is so reprehensible to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence. Id., at 575. In this case, State Farm's handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise, but a more modest punishment could have satisfied the State's legitimate objectives. Instead, this case was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's operations throughout the country. However, a State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred, id., at 572. Nor does the State have a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of its jurisdiction. The Campbells argue that such evidence was used merely to demonstrate, generally, State Farm's motives against its insured. Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to
[410]
the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff. More fundamentally, in relying on such evidence, the Utah courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells' harm. Due process does not permit courts to adjudicate the merits of other parties' hypothetical claims under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis. Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct, for nonparties are not normally bound by another plaintiff's judgment. For the same reasons, the Utah Supreme Court's decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist. To justify punishment based upon recidivism, courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions. There is scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured the Campbells, and a review of the decisions below does not convince this Court that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Because the Campbells have shown no conduct similar to that which harmed them, the only relevant conduct to the reprehensibility analysis is that which harmed them. Pp. 419-424.
(2) With regard to the second Gore guidepost, the Court has been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; but, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process. See, e. g., 517 U. S., at 581. Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State's deterrence and retribution goals, than are awards with 145-to-1 ratios, as in this case. Because there are no rigid benchmarks, ratios greater than those that this Court has previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages, id., at 582, but when compensatory damages are substantial, then an even lesser ratio can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. Here, there is a presumption against an award with a 145-to-1 ratio; the $1 million compensatory award for a year and a half of emotional distress was substantial; and the distress caused by outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered is likely a component of both the compensatory and punitive damages awards. The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award based on premises bearing no relation to the award's reasonableness or proportionality to the harm. pp. 424-428.
(3) The Court need not dwell on the third guidepost. The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $10,000 fine for an act of grand fraud, which

[411]
is dwarfed by the $145 million punitive damages award. The Utah Supreme Court's references to a broad fraudulent scheme drawn from out-of-state and dissimilar conduct evidence were insufficient to justify this amount. P. 428.
(c) Applying Gore's guideposts to the facts here, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages award, likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the compensatory damages amount. The Utah courts should resolve in the first instance the proper punitive damages calculation under the principles discussed here. P. 429.
65 P. 3d 1134, reversed and remanded.

KENTUCKY ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS, INC., ET AL. v. MILLER, COMMISSIONER, KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No.00-1471. Argued January 14, 2003-Decided April 2, 2003
Petitioner health maintenance organizations (HMOs) maintain exclusive ""provider networks"" with selected doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Kentucky has enacted two ""Any Willing Provider"" (AWP) statutes, which prohibit ""[a] health insurer [from] discriminat[ing] against any provider who is ... willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation established by the ... insurer,"" and require a ""health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits [to] ... [p]ermit any licensed chiropractor who agrees to abide by the terms [and] conditions ... of the ... plan to serve as a participating primary chiropractic provider."" Petitioners filed this suit against respondent, the Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Insurance, asserting that the AWP laws are pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which pre-empts all state laws ""insofar as they ... relate to any employee benefit plan,"" 29 U. S. C.  1144(a), but saves from pre-emption state ""law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance ... ,""  1144(b)(2)(A). The District Court concluded that although both AWP statutes ""relate to"" employee benefit plans under  1144(a), each law ""regulates insurance"" and is therefore saved from pre-emption by  1144(b)(2)(A). The Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held: Kentucky's AWP statutes are ""law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance"" under  1144(b)(2)(A). Pp. 334-342.
(a) For these statutes to be ""law[s] ... which regulat[e] insurance,"" they must be ""specifically directed toward"" the insurance industry; laws of general application that have some bearing on insurers do not qualify. E. g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 50. However, not all state laws ""specifically directed toward"" the insurance industry will be covered by  1144(b)(2)(A), which saves laws that regulate insurance, not insurers. Insurers must be regulated ""with respect to their insurance practices."" Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355, 366. P.334.

(b) Petitioners argue that the AWP laws are not ""specifically directed"" toward the insurance industry. The Court disagrees. Neither of these statutes, by its terms, imposes any prohibitions or requirements on providers, who may still enter exclusive networks with insurers who conduct business outside the Commonwealth or who are otherwise not covered by the AWP laws. The statutes are transgressed only when a ""health insurer,"" or a ""health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits,"" excludes from its network a provider who is willing and able to meet its terms. Pp. 334-336.
(c) Also unavailing is petitioners' contention that Kentucky's AWP laws fall outside  1144(b)(2)(A)'s scope because they do not regulate an insurance practice but focus upon the relationship between an insurer and third-party providers. Petitioners rely on Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S. 205, 210, which held that thirdparty provider arrangements between insurers and pharmacies were not ""the 'business of insurance'"" under  2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. ERISA's saving clause, however, is not concerned (as is the McCarran- Ferguson Act provision) with how to characterize conduct undertaken by private actors, but with how to characterize state laws in regard to what they ""regulate."" Kentucky's laws ""regulate"" insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance. To come within ERISA's saving clause those conditions must also substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between insurer and insured. Kentucky's AWP statutes pass this test by altering the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds in a manner similar to the laws we upheld in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358, and Rush Prudential, supra. Pp. 337-339.
(d) The Court's prior use, to varying degrees, of its cases interpreting 2(a) and 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in the ERISA saving clause context has misdirected attention, failed to provide clear guidance to lower federal courts, and, as this case demonstrates, added little to the relevant analysis. The Court has never held that the McCarranFerguson factors are an essential component of the  1144(b)(2)(A) inquiry. Today the Court makes a clean break from the McCarranFerguson factors in interpreting ERISA's saving clause. Pp. 339-342.
227 F.3d 352, affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No.00-1471. Argued January 14, 2003-Decided April 2, 2003
Petitioner health maintenance organizations (HMOs) maintain exclusive ""provider networks"" with selected doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Kentucky has enacted two ""Any Willing Provider"" (AWP) statutes, which prohibit ""[a] health insurer [from] discriminat[ing] against any provider who is ... willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation established by the ... insurer,"" and require a ""health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits [to] ...

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI
No. 01-1437. Argued December 10, 2002-Decided March 31, 2003*
Mter the 2000 census caused Mississippi to lose one congressional seat, the state legislature failed to pass a new redistricting plan. Anticipating a state-law deadline for qualifying candidates, appellants and crossappellees (state plaintiffs) filed suit in October 2001, asking the State Chancery Court to issue a redistricting plan for the 2002 elections. In a similar action, appellees and cross-appellants (federal plaintiffs) asked the Federal District Court to enjoin the current plan and any statecourt plan, and to order at-large elections pursuant to Miss. Code Ann.  23-15-1039 and 2 U. S. C.  2a(c)(5) or, alternatively, to devise its own redistricting plan. The three-judge District Court permitted the state plaintiffs to intervene and concluded that it would assert jurisdiction if it became clear by January 7, 2002, that no state plan would be in place by March 1. On the eve of the state trial, the State Supreme Court ruled that the Chancery Court had jurisdiction to issue a redistricting plan. The Chancery Court adopted such a plan. On December 21, 2001, the state attorney general submitted that plan and the Supreme Court's decision to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for preclearance pursuant to  5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. DOJ requested additional information from the State, noting that the 60-day review period would commence once that information was received. The information was provided on February 20, 2002. Meanwhile, the Federal District Court promulgated a plan that would fix the State's congressional districts for the 2002 elections should the state-court plan not be precleared by February 25. When that date passed, the District Court enjoined the State from using the state-court plan and ordered that its own plan be used in 2002 and until the State produced a precleared, constitutional plan. The court based the injunction on the failure of the timely preclearance of the state-court plan, but found, in the alternative, that the state-court plan was unconstitutional. The State did not appeal. DOJ declined to make a determination about the preclearance submission because the District Court's injunction rendered the state-court plan incapable of administration.
*Together with No. 01-1596, Smith et al. v. Branch et al., also on appeal from the same court.

255
Held: The judgment is affirmed. 189 F. Supp. 2d 548, affirmed.
JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III-A, holding:
1. The District Court properly enjoined enforcement of the statecourt plan. Pp. 261-266.
(a) There are two critical distinctions between these cases and Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25. First, there is no suggestion here that the District Court failed to allow the state court adequate opportunity to develop a redistricting plan. Second, the state-court plan here was subject to  5 of the Voting Rights Act. The controversy over whether the state-court plan was precleared centers on  5's proviso that whenever a covered jurisdiction ""shall enact or seek to administer"" a voting change, the change may be enforced if the Attorney General does not object within 60 days. Pp. 261-263.
(b) DOJ's failure to object within 60 days of the state attorney general's original submission did not render the state-court plan enforceable on February 25. A jurisdiction seeking preclearance must provide the Attorney General with information sufficient to prove that the change is nondiscriminatory. DOJ regulations-which are ""wholly reasonable and consistent with the Act,"" Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S. 526, 541-provide that incomplete state submissions do not start the 60-day clock, and that the clock begins to run from the date that requested information is received. DOJ's request here, which was neither frivolous nor unwarranted, postponed the 60-day period. Pp. 263-264.
(c) The state-court plan was also not precleared 60 days after the state attorney general submitted the requested information. The State was ""seek[ing] to administer"" the changes within  5's meaning when its attorney general made his initial submission to DOJ and when he provided additional information. However, when the State failed to appeal the District Court's injunction, it ceased ""seek[ing] to administer"" the state-court plan. The 60-day period was no longer running, so the plan was not rendered enforceable by operation of law. Because a private party's actions are not those of a State, the state plaintiffs' appeal is insufficient to demonstrate that the State still ""seek[s] to administer"" the plan. Pp. 264-265.
(d) Since this Court affirms the injunction on the ground that the state-court plan was not precleared and could not be precleared in time for the 2002 election, the Court vacates the District Court's alternative holding that such plan was unconstitutional. pp. 265-266.

ARCHER ET ux. v. WARNER
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1418. Argued January 13, 2003-Decided March 31, 2003
A debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy ""to the extent"" it is ""for money ... obtained by ... fraud."" 11 U. S. C.  523(a)(2)(A). Petitioners, the Archers, sued respondent Warner and her former husband in state court for (among other things) fraud connected with the sale of the Warners' company to the Archers. In settling the lawsuit, the Archers executed releases discharging the Warners from all present and future claims, except for obligations under a $100,000 promissory note and related instruments. The Archers then voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. Mter the Warners failed to make the first payment on the promissory note, the Archers sued in state court. The Warners filed for bankruptcy, and the Bankruptcy Court ordered liquidation under Chapter 7. The Archers brought the present claim, asking the Bankruptcy Court to find the $100,000 debt nondischargeable, and to order the Warners to pay the sum. Respondent Warner contested nondischarge ability. The Bankruptcy Court denied the Archers' claim. The District Court and the Fourth Circuit affirmed. The latter court held that the settlement agreement, releases, and promissory note worked a kind of ""novation"" that replaced (1) an original potential debt to the Archers for money obtained by fraud with (2) a new debt for money promised in a settlement contract that was dischargeable in bankruptcy.
Held: A debt for money promised in a settlement agreement accompanied by the release of underlying tort claims can amount to a debt for money obtained by fraud, within the nondischargeability statute's terms. Pp. 318-323.
(a) The outcome here is governed by Brown v. Felsen, 442 U. S. 127, in which (1) Brown filed a state-court suit seeking money that he said Felsen had obtained through fraud; (2) the court entered a consent decree based on a stipulation providing that Felsen would pay Brown a certain amount; (3) neither the decree nor the stipulation indicated the payment was for fraud; (4) Felsen did not pay; (5) Felsen entered bankruptcy; and (6) Brown asked the Bankruptcy Court to look behind the decree and stipulation and hold that the debt was nondischargeable because it was a debt for money obtained by fraud. Id., at 128-129. This Court found that, although claim preclusion would bar Brown from making any claim"" 'based on the same cause of action' "" that he had brought

315
in state court, id., at 131, it did not prevent the Bankruptcy Court from looking beyond the state-court record and the documents terminating the state-court proceeding to decide whether the debt was a debt for money obtained by fraud, id., at 138-139. As a matter oflogic, Brown's holding means that the Fourth Circuit's novation theory cannot be right. If reducing a fraud claim to settlement definitively changed the nature of the debt for discharge ability purposes, the nature of the debt in Brown would have changed similarly, thereby rendering that debt dischargeable. This Court's instruction that the Bankruptcy Court could ""weigh all the evidence,"" id., at 138, would have been pointless, as there would have been nothing for the court to examine. Moreover, the Court's statement in Brown that ""the mere fact that a conscientious creditor has previously reduced his claim to judgment should not bar further inquiry into the true nature of the debt,"" ibid., strongly favors the Archers' position. Finally, Brown's basic reasoning applies here. The Court noted that a change in the Bankruptcy Code's nondischarge ability provision indicated that ""Congress intended the fullest possible inquiry"" to ensure that ""all debts arising out of"" fraud are ""excepted from discharge,"" no matter their form. Ibid. Congress also intended to allow the determination whether a debt arises out of fraud to take place in bankruptcy court, not to force it to occur earlier in state court when nondischargeability concerns ""are not directly in issue and neither party has a full incentive to litigate them."" Id., at 134. The only difference between Brown and this case-that the relevant debt here is embodied in a settlement, not in a stipulation and consent judgment-is not determinative, since the discharge ability provision applies to all debts that ""aris[e] out of"" fraud. Id., at 138. Pp. 318-322.
(b) The Fourth Circuit remains free, on remand, to determine whether Warner's additional arguments were properly raised or preserved, and, if so, to decide them. Pp. 322-323.

In promulgating Rules establishing Washington's program, the State Supreme Court required that: (a) all client funds be deposited in interest-bearing trust accounts, (b) funds that cannot earn net interest for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account, (c) lawyers direct banks to pay the net interest on the IOLTA accounts to the Legal Foundation of Washington (Foundation), and (d) the Foundation use all such funds for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes. It seems apparent from the court's explanation of its IOLTA Rules that a lawyer who mistakenly uses an IOLTA account for money that could earn interest for the client would violate the Rule. That court subsequently made its IOLTA Rules applicable to Limited Practice Officers (LPOs), nonlawyers who are licensed to act as escrowees in real estate closings. Petitioners, who have funds that are deposited by LPOs in IOLTA accounts, and others sought to enjoin respondent state official from continuing this requirement, alleging, among other things, that the taking of the interest earned on their funds in IOLTA accounts violates the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that the requirement that client funds be placed in such accounts is an illegal taking of the beneficial use of those funds. The record suggests that petitioners' funds generated some interest that was paid to the Foundation, but that without IOLTA they would have produced no net interest for either petitioner. The District Court granted respondents summary judgment, concluding, as a factual matter, that petitioners could not make any net returns on the interest accrued in the accounts and, if they could, the funds would not be subject to the IOLTA program; and that, as a legal matter, the constitutional issue focused on what an owner has lost, not what the taker has gained, and that petitioners had lost nothing. While the case was on appeal, this Court decided in Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156, 172, that interest generated by funds held in IOLTA accounts is the private property of the owner of the principal. Relying on that case, a Ninth Circuit panel held that Washington's program caused an unconstitutional taking of petitioners' property and remanded
[217]
the case for a determination whether they are entitled to just compensation. On reconsideration, the en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, reasoning that, under the ad hoc approach applied in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, there was no taking because petitioners had suffered neither an actual loss nor an interference with any investment-backed expectations, and that if there were such a taking, the just compensation due was zero.
Held:
1. A state law requiring that client funds that could not otherwise generate net earnings for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account is not a ""regulatory taking,"" but a law requiring that the interest on those funds be transferred to a different owner for a legitimate public use could be a per se taking requiring the payment of ""just compensation"" to the client. Pp.231-235.
(a) The Fifth Amendment imposes two conditions on the State's authority to confiscate private property: the taking must be for a ""public use"" and ""just compensation"" must be paid to the owner. In this case, the overall, dramatic success of IOLTA programs in serving the compelling interest in providing legal services to literally millions of needy Americans qualifies the Foundation's distribution of the funds as a ""public use."" Pp.231-232.
(b) The Court first addresses the type of taking that this case involves. The Court's jurisprudence concerning condemnations and physical takings involves the straightforward application of per se rules, while its regulatory takings jurisprudence is characterized by essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries designed to allow careful examination and weighing of all relevant circumstances. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U. S. 302, 322. Petitioners separately challenged (1) the requirement that their funds must be placed in an IOLTA account and (2) the later transfers of interest to the Foundation. The former is merely a transfer of principal and therefore does not effect a confiscation of any interest. Even if viewed as the first step in a regulatory taking which should be analyzed under the Penn Central factors, it is clear that there would be no taking because the transaction had no adverse economic impact on petitioners and did not interfere with any investment-backed expectation. 438 U. S., at 124. A per se approach is more consistent with the Court's reasoning in Phillips than Penn Central's ad hoc analysis. Because interest earned in IOLTA accounts ""is the 'private property' of the owner of the principal,"" Phillips, 524 U. S., at 172, the transfer of the interest to the Foundation here seems more akin to the occupation of a small amount of rooftop space in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,
[218]
458 U. S. 419, which was a physical taking subject to per se rules. The Court therefore assumes that petitioners retained the beneficial ownership of at least a portion of their escrow deposits until the funds were disbursed at closings, that those funds generated interest in the IOLTA accounts, and that their interest was taken for a public use when it was turned over to the Foundation. This does not end the inquiry, however, for the Court must now determine whether any ""just compensation"" is due. pp. 233-235.
2. Because ""just compensation"" is measured by the owner's pecuniary loss-which is zero whenever the Washington law is obeyed-there has been no violation of the Just Compensation Clause. Pp. 235-241.
(a) This Court's consistent and unambiguous holdings support the conclusion that the ""just compensation"" required by the Fifth Amendment is measured by the property owner's loss rather than the government's gain. E. g., Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U. S. 189, 195. Applying the teachings of such cases to the question here, it is clear that neither petitioner is entitled to any compensation for the nonpecuniary consequences of the taking of the interest on his deposited funds, and that any pecuniary compensation must be measured by his net losses rather than the value of the public's gain. Thus, if petitioners' net loss was zero, the compensation that is due is also zero. Pp.235-237.
(b) Although lawyers and LPOs may occasionally deposit client funds in an IOLTA account when those funds could have produced net interest for their clients, it does not follow that there is a need for further hearings to determine whether petitioners are entitled to compensation from respondents. The Washington Supreme Court's Rules unambiguously require lawyers and LPOs to deposit client funds in non-IOLTA accounts whenever those funds could generate net earnings for the client. If petitioners' money could have generated net income, the LPOs violated the court's Rules, and any net loss was the consequence of the LPOs' incorrect private decisions rather than state action. Such mistakes may give petitioners a valid claim against the LPOs, but would provide no support for a compensation claim against the State or respondents. Because Washington's IOLTA program mandates a nonIOLTA account when net interest can be generated for the client, the compensation due petitioners for any taking of their property would be nil, and there was therefore no constitutional violation when they were not compensated. Pp. 237-240.

CITY OF CUYAHOGA FALLS, OHIO, ET AL. v. BUCKEYE COMMUNITY HOPE FOUNDATION ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1269. Argued January 21, 2003-Decided March 25, 2003
Mter the City Council of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (hereinafter City), passed a site-plan ordinance authorizing construction of a low-income housing complex by respondents-a nonprofit corporation dedicated to developing affordable housing and related parties-a group of citizens filed a formal petition requesting that the ordinance be repealed or submitted to a popular vote. Pursuant to the City's charter, the referendum petition stayed the site plan's implementation until its approval by the voters. An Ohio court denied respondents an injunction against the petition, and the city engineer, on advice from the city law director, denied their request for building permits. The voters eventually passed the referendum, thus repealing the ordinance. Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid under Ohio's Constitution, the City issued the building permits, and construction commenced. While the state litigation was still pending, respondents filed a federal suit against the City and its officials, seeking an injunction ordering the City to issue the building permits, as well as declaratory and monetary relief. They claimed that by submitting the site plan to voters, the City and its officials violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act. The District Court, inter alia, denied the City's summary judgment motion. Mter the Ohio Supreme Court invalidated the referendum, thus reducing the federal action to a claim for damages for the construction delay, the District Court granted the City and its officials summary judgment. In reversing, the Sixth Circuit found that respondents had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial on the allegation that the City, by allowing the petition to stay the site plan's implementation, gave effect to the racial bias reflected in the public's opposition to the project; that respondents had stated a valid Fair Housing Act claim because the City's actions had a disparate impact based on race and family status; and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City had engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of substantive due process.

189
Held:
1. Respondents have not presented an equal protection claim that can survive summary judgment. Proof of racially discriminatory intent is required to show an Equal Protection Clause violation. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 265. Because respondents claim injury from the referendum petitioning process, not from the referendum itself-which never went into effectcases in which this Court has subjected enacted, discretionary measures to equal protection scrutiny and treated decisionmakers' statements as evidence of intent, see, e. g., Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 448, are inapposite. Neither of the official acts respondents challenge reflects the intent required to support equal protection liability. In submitting the referendum petition to the public, the City acted pursuant to the requirement of its charter, which sets out a facially neutral petitioning procedure, and the city engineer, in refusing to issue the permits, performed a nondiscretionary, ministerial act consistent with the City Charter. Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these acts were themselves motivated by racial animus. While they and the Sixth Circuit cite evidence of allegedly discriminatory voter sentiment, statements made by private individuals during a citizen-driven petition drive do not, in and of themselves, constitute state action for Fourteenth Amendment purposes. And respondents did not offer evidence that the private motives behind the referendum drive are fairly attributable to the State. See Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1004. In fact, by adhering to charter procedures, city officials enabled public debate on the referendum to take place, thus advancing significant First Amendment interests. Respondents' alternative theory-that city officials acted in concert with private citizens to prevent the complex from being built because of the race and family status of the likely residents-was not addressed below and apparently was disavowed by respondents at oral argument. Moreover, respondents never articulated a cognizable legal claim on such grounds. Pp. 194-198.
2. Subjecting the ordinance to the City's referendum process did not constitute arbitrary government conduct in violation of substantive due process. Both of respondents' due process claims lack merit. First, the city engineer's refusal to issue the building permits while the petition was pending in no sense constituted egregious or arbitrary government conduct denying respondents the benefit of the site plan. In light of the charter's provision that no challenged ordinance can go into effect until approved by the voters, the law director's instruction to the engineer represented an eminently rational directive. Indeed, the site plan, by law, could not be implemented until the voters passed on the referen-

WOODFORD, WARDEN v. GARCEAU
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1862. Argued January 21, 2003-Decided March 25, 2003
Amendments made to 28 U. S. C., ch. 153, by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) do not apply to cases pending in federal court on April 24, 1996-AEDPA's effective date. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320. Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in California state court. Mter his petition for state postconviction relief was denied, he moved for the appointment of federal habeas counsel and a stay of execution in Federal District Court on May 12, 1995, and later filed a federal habeas application on July 2, 1996. Although he filed the habeas application after AEDPA's effective date, the District Court concluded, inter alia, that it was not subject to AEDPA because his motions for counsel and a stay were filed prior to that date. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the application was not subject to AEDPA, but reversed for reasons not relevant here.
Held: For purposes of applying the Lindh rule, a case does not become ""pending"" until an actual application for habeas relief is filed in federal court. Respondent's application is subject to AEDPA's amendments because it was not filed until after AEDPA's effective date. Pp. 205-210.
(a) Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standards governing the review of a habeas application's merits, the Court interprets the Lindh rule in view of that emphasis. Thus, whether AEDPA applies to a state prisoner turns on what was before a federal court on AEDPA's effective date. If, on that date, the state prisoner had before a federal court a habeas application seeking an adjudication on the merits of the prisoner's claims, then AEDPA does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant--e. g., a request for the appointment of counselor a motion for a stay of execution-were presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA's effective date. A review of the amended chapter 153 supports this conclusion. For example, 28 U. S. C.  2254(e)(1) provides that, ""[i]n a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct."" (Emphasis added.)

203
Under the Ninth Circuit's view, that presumption would rarely apply in a capital case, as  2254(e)(I) would be applicable only to those capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not seek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indication that  2254(e)(I) was intended to have such a limited scope. Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for a capital prisoner to avoid application of  2254(e)(I)'s stringent requirements simply by filing a request for counselor a motion for a stay before filing an actual habeas application. Finally, the procedural rules governing  2254 cases reinforce the Court's view. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the habeas context to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. Because nothing in the Habeas Rules contradicts Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3-""[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint""-the logical conclusion is that a habeas suit begins with the filing of a habeas application, the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case. Pp. 205-208.
(b) As the task here is to apply Lindh to an action under chapter 153, respondent's request to look at provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite. Moreover, his reliance on McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, which involved the interpretation of  2251, not  2254, and must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right to counsel contained in 18 U. S. C. 848(q)(4)(B), and Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, which says nothing about whether a request for counselor motion for a stay suffices to create a ""case"" that is ""pending"" within the Lindh rule's meaning, is misplaced. Pp. 208-210.
275 F.3d 769, reversed and remanded.

If, on that date, the state prisoner had before a federal court a habeas application seeking an adjudication on the merits of the prisoner's claims, then AEDPA does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant--e. g., a request for the appointment of counselor a motion for a stay of execution-were presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA's effective date. A review of the amended chapter 153 supports this conclusion. For example, 28 U. S. C.  2254(e)(1) provides that, ""[i]n a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct."" (Emphasis added.)

203
Under the Ninth Circuit's view, that presumption would rarely apply in a capital case, as  2254(e)(I) would be applicable only to those capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not seek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indication that  2254(e)(I) was intended to have such a limited scope. Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for a capital prisoner to avoid application of  2254(e)(I)'s stringent requirements simply by filing a request for counselor a motion for a stay before filing an actual habeas application. Finally, the procedural rules governing  2254 cases reinforce the Court's view. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the habeas context to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. Because nothing in the Habeas Rules contradicts Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3-""[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint""-the logical conclusion is that a habeas suit begins with the filing of a habeas application, the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case. Pp. 205-208.
(b) As the task here is to apply Lindh to an action under chapter 153, respondent's request to look at provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite. Moreover, his reliance on McFarland v. Scott, 512 U. S. 849, which involved the interpretation of  2251, not  2254, and must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right to counsel contained in 18 U. S. C. 848(q)(4)(B), and Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, which says nothing about whether a request for counselor motion for a stay suffices to create a ""case"" that is ""pending"" within the Lindh rule's meaning, is misplaced. Pp. 208-210.
275 F.3d 769, reversed and remanded.

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS v. UNITED STATES EX REL. CHANDLER
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1572. Argued January 14, 2003-Decided March 10,2003
Under the False Claims Act (FCA), ""[a]ny person"" who, inter alia, ""knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government ... a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,"" 31 U. S. C.  3729(a)(1), is liable to the Government for a civil penalty, treble damages, and costs,  3729(a). Although the Attorney General may sue under the FCA, a private person, known as a relator, may also bring a qui tam action ""in the name of the Government.""  3730(b). The relator must inform the Justice Department of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal while the Government decides whether to intervene and do its own litigating.  3730(b)(2). If the claim succeeds, the relator's share may be up to 30 percent of the proceeds of the action, plus reasonable expenses, costs, and attorney's fees.  3730(d). This case involves a National Institute of Drug Abuse research grant to Cook County Hospital for a study that was later administered by a nonprofit research institute affiliated with the hospital. Respondent Chandler, who ran the study for the institute, filed this qui tam action, claiming that Cook County (hereinafter County) and the institute had submitted false statements to obtain grant funds in violation of  3729(a)(1). Mter this Court held in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, that States are not ""persons"" subject to FCA qui tam actions, the District Court granted the County's motion to dismiss the claims against it. The court held that the County, like a State, could not be subjected to treble damages, which Stevens described as ""essentially punitive,"" id., at 784. The Seventh Circuit distinguished Stevens and reversed.
Held: Local governments are ""persons"" amenable to qui tam actions under the FCA. Pp. 125-134.
(a) While  3729 does not define the term ""person,"" its meaning has remained unchanged since the original FCA was passed in 1863. Stevens, supra, at 783, n. 12. There is no doubt that the term then extended to corporations. Indeed, this Court as early as 1826 in United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392, 412, recognized the presumption that ""person"" also includes ""persons politic and incorporate."" Essentially conceding that private corporations were taken to be persons when the

Syllabus
FCA was passed in 1863, the County argues that municipal corporations were not so understood until six years later, when the Court decided Cowles v. Mercer County, 7 Wall. 118. Cowles, however, was not an extension of principle but a natural recognition of the common understanding that municipal corporations and private ones were to be treated alike in terms of their legal status as persons capable of suing and being sued. This explains how the Court in Cowles could conclude ""automatically and without discussion"" that municipal corporations, like private ones, ""should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis."" Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 687-688. Of course, the meaning of ""person"" recognized in Cowles was only a presumptive one, but neither the history nor the text of the original FCA provides contextual evidence that Congress intended to exclude municipalities from the class of ""persons"" covered by the FCA in 1863. pp. 125-129.
(b) The False Claims Amendments Act of 1986 did not repeal municipal liability. As part of an effort to modernize the FCA, the 1986 amendments raised the ceiling on damages recoverable under  3729(a) from double to treble. Relying on the common law presumption against punitive damages for municipalities, see Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 259-260, and n. 21, and on this Court's statement in Stevens, supra, at 784, 785, that the change from double to treble damages turned what had been a ""remedial"" provision into an ""essentially punitive"" one, the County argues that, even if municipalities were covered by the term ""person"" from 1863 to 1986, Congress's adoption of a ""punitive"" remedy entailed the elimination of municipal liability in 1986. It does not follow from Stevens, however, that the punitive feature of FCA damages has the force to show congressional intent to repeal implicitly the existing definition of ""person."" To begin with, the FCA's damages multiplier has a compensatory function as well as a punitive one. Most obviously, the statute's qui tam feature means that as much as 30 percent of the Government's recovery may go to a private relator who began the action. Even when there is no qui tam relator to be paid, liability beyond actual damages may be necessary for full recovery, since the FCA has no separate provision for prejudgment interest or consequential damages. The force of the treble damages remedy's ""punitive"" nature in arguing against municipal liability is not as robust as it would be if that remedy were a pure penalty in all cases. What is more, treble damages certainly does not equate with classic punitive damages, which leaves the jury with open-ended discretion over the amount, and so raises two concerns specific to municipal defendants: that local government's taxing power will make it an easy target for an unduly generous

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA
No. 01-963. Argued November 6, 2002-Decided March 10,2003
Alleging that petitioner Norfolk & Western Railway Company (Norfolk) had negligently exposed them to asbestos and thereby caused them to contract the occupational disease asbestosis, respondents, six former Norfolk employees (asbestosis claimants), brought this suit in a West Virginia state court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FE LA or Act). Section 1 of the FELA provides: ""Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in [interstate commerce], shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce ... for such injury ... resulting in whole or in part from the [carrier's] negligence."" As an element of their damages, the asbestosis claimants sought recovery for mental anguish based on their fear of developing cancer. The trial court instructed the jury that a plaintiff who demonstrated a reasonable fear of cancer related to proven physical injury from asbestos was entitled to compensation for that fear as a part of the damages awardable for pain and suffering. The court also instructed the jury not to reduce recoveries because of nonrailroad exposures to asbestos, so long as the jury found that Norfolk was negligent and that dust exposures at Norfolk contributed, however slightly, to each plaintiff's injuries. The court rejected Norfolk's proposed instructions, which would have (1) ruled out damages for fear of cancer unless the claimant proved both an actual likelihood of developing cancer and physical manifestations of the alleged fear, and (2) required the jury to apportion damages between Norfolk and other employers alleged to have contributed to an asbestosis claimant's disease. The jury returned damages awards for each claimant. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia denied discretionary review.
Held:
1. Mental anguish damages resulting from the fear of developing cancer may be recovered under the FELA by a railroad worker suffering from the actionable injury asbestosis caused by work-related exposure to asbestos. Pp. 145-159.
(a) The trial judge correctly stated the law when he charged the jury that an asbestosis claimant, upon demonstrating a reasonable fear of cancer stemming from his present disease, could recover for that fear

136
as part of asbestosis-related pain and suffering damages. In so ruling, this Court follows the path marked by its decisions in Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, and Metro-North Commuter R. Co. v. Buckley, 521 U. S. 424. Gottshall and Metro-North describe two categories of claims for emotional distress damages: Stand-alone emotional distress claims not provoked by any physical injury, for which recovery is sharply circumscribed by the common-law zone-of-danger test; and emotional distress claims brought on by a physical injury, for which pain and suffering recovery is permitted. This case is properly placed in the emotional distress stemming from a physical injury category. The parties agree that the claimants suffer from asbestosis, a cognizable injury under the FELA. As Metro-North plainly indicates, when fear of cancer ""accompanies a physical injury,"" pain and suffering damages may include compensation for that fear. E. g., 521 U. S., at 430. The Court adheres to the clear line its recent decisions delineate. Pp. 145-148.
(b) Unlike stand-alone claims for negligently inflicted emotional distress, claims for pain and suffering associated with a physical injury are traditionally compensable. By 1908, when the FELA was enacted, the common law had evolved to encompass apprehension of future harm as a component of pain and suffering. In recent years, of the many courts that have ruled on the question presented here, a clear majority sustain recovery. Arguing against this trend, Norfolk and its amici assert that the asbestosis claimants' alleged cancer fears are too remote from asbestosis to warrant inclusion in their pain and suffering awards. Amicus United States refers to the ""separate disease rule,"" under which most courts have held that the statute of limitations runs separately for each asbestos-related disease. Because the asbestosis claimants may bring a second action if cancer develops, the Government argues, cancer-related damages are unwarranted here. The question, as the Government frames it, is not whether the asbestosis claimants can recover for fear of cancer, but when. But those claimants did not seek, and the trial court did not allow, discrete damages for their increased risk of future cancer. Instead, they sought damages for their current injury, which, they allege, encompasses a present fear that the toxic exposure causative of asbestosis may later result in cancer. The Government's ""when, not whether,"" argument has a large gap; it excludes recovery for any fear experienced by an asbestosis sufferer who never gets cancer. To be compensable as pain and suffering, Norfolk further urges, a mental or emotional harm must have been ""directly brought about by a physical injury."" This argument elides over a key connection between Norfolk's conduct and the damages the asbestosis claimants allege as part of their pain and suffering: Once found liable for any bodily harm, a negligent

Among other things, Connecticut's ""Megan's Law"" requires persons convicted of sexual offenses to register with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) upon their release into the community, and requires DPS to post a sex offender registry containing registrants' names, addresses, photographs, and descriptions on an Internet Website and to make the registry available to the public in certain state offices. Respondent Doe (hereinafter respondent), a convicted sex offender who is subject to the law, filed a 42 U. S. C.  1983 action on behalf of himself and similarly situated sex offenders, claiming that the law violates, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court granted respondent summary judgment, certified a class of individuals subject to the law, and permanently enjoined the law's public disclosure provisions. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that such disclosure both deprived registered sex offenders of a ""liberty interest,"" and violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to be ""currently dangerous.""
Held: The Second Circuit's judgment must be reversed because due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State's statutory scheme. Mere injury to reputation, even if del

Cf., e. g., Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433. As the DPS Website explains, the law's requirements turn on an offender's conviction alone-a fact that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest. Unless respondent can show that the substantive rule of law is defective (by conflicting with the Constitution), any hearing on current dangerousness is a bootless exercise. Respondent expressly disavows any reliance on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's protections, and maintains that his challenge is strictly a procedural one. But States are not barred by principles of ""procedural due process"" from drawing such classifications. Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 120 (plurality opinion). Such claims ""must ultimately be analyzed"" in terms of substantive due process. Id., at 121.

EWING v. CALIFORNIA
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT
No. 01-6978. Argued November 5, 2002-Decided March 5, 2003
Under California's three strikes law, a defendant who is convicted of a felony and has previously been convicted of two or more serious or violent felonies must receive an indeterminate life imprisonment term. Such a defendant becomes eligible for parole on a date calculated by reference to a minimum term, which, in this case, is 25 years. While on parole, petitioner Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for stealing three golf clubs, worth $399 apiece. As required by the three strikes law, the prosecutor formally alleged, and the trial court found, that Ewing had been convicted previously of four serious or violent felonies. In sentencing him to 25 years to life, the court refused to exercise its discretion to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor-under a state law that permits certain offenses, known as ""wobblers,"" to be classified as either misdemeanors or felonies-or to dismiss the allegations of some or all of his prior relevant convictions. The State Court of Appeal affirmed. Relying on Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, it rejected Ewing's claim that his sentence was grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment and reasoned that enhanced sentences under the three strikes law served the State's legitimate goal of deterring and incapacitating repeat offenders. The State Supreme Court denied review.
Held: The judgment is affirmed. Affirmed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded that Ewing's sentence is not grossly disproportionate and therefore does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. Pp. 20-31.
(a) The Eighth Amendment has a ""narrow proportionality principle"" that ""applies to noncapital sentences."" Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 996-997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The Amendment's application in this context is guided by the principles distilled in JUSTICE KENNEDY'S concurrence in Harmelin: ""[T]he primacy of the legislature, the variety of legitimate penological schemes, the nature of our federal system, and the requirement that proportionality review be guided by objective factors"" inform the final principle that the ""Eighth Amendment does not require strict propor-
[12]
tionality between crime and sentence [but] forbids only extreme sentences that are 'grossly disproportionate' to the crime."" Id., at 100l. Pp. 20-24.
(b) State legislatures enacting three strikes laws made a deliberate policy choice that individuals who have repeatedly engaged in serious or violent criminal behavior, and whose conduct has not been deterred by more conventional punishment approaches, must be isolated from society to protect the public safety. Though these laws are relatively new, this Court has a longstanding tradition of deferring to state legislatures in making and implementing such important policy decisions. The Constitution ""does not mandate adoption of anyone penological theory,"" 501 U. S., at 999, and nothing in the Eighth Amendment prohibits California from choosing to incapacitate criminals who have already been convicted of at least one serious or violent crime. Recidivism has long been recognized as a legitimate basis for increased punishment and is a serious public safety concern in California and the Nation. Any criticism of the law is appropriately directed at the legislature, which is primarily responsible for making the policy choices underlying any criminal sentencing scheme. Pp. 24-28.
(c) In examining Ewing's claim that his sentence is grossly disproportionate, the gravity of the offense must be compared to the harshness of the penalty. Even standing alone, his grand theft should not be taken lightly. The California Supreme Court has noted that crime's seriousness in the context of proportionality review; that it is a ""wobbIer"" is of no moment, for it remains a felony unless the trial court imposes a misdemeanor sentence. The trial judge justifiably exercised her discretion not to extend lenient treatment given Ewing's long criminal history. In weighing the offense's gravity, both his current felony and his long history of felony recidivism must be placed on the scales. Any other approach would not accord proper deference to the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of sanctions. Ewing's sentence is justified by the State's public-safety interest in incapacitating and deterring recidivist felons, and amply supported by his own long, serious criminal record. He has been convicted of numerous offenses, served nine separate prison terms, and committed most of his crimes while on probation or parole. His prior strikes were serious felonies including robbery and residential burglary. Though long, his current sentence reflects a rational legislative judgment that is entitled to deference. Pp. 28-3l.
JUSTICE SCALIA agreed that petitioner's sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, but on the ground that that prohibition was aimed at excluding only certain modes of punishment. This case demonstrates why
[13]
a proportionality principle cannot be intelligently applied, and why Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, should not be given stare decisis effect. Pp. 31-32.

ANDRADE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1127. Argued November 5, 2002-Decided March 5, 2003
California charged respondent Andrade with two felony counts of petty theft with a prior conviction after he stole approximately $150 worth of videotapes from two different stores. Under California's three strikes law, any felony can constitute the third strike subjecting a defendant to a prison term of 25 years to life. The jury found Andrade guilty and then found that he had three prior convictions that qualified as serious or violent felonies under the three strikes regime. Because each of his petty theft convictions thus triggered a separate application of the three strikes law, the judge sentenced him to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life. In affirming, the California Court of Appeal rejected his claim that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. It found the Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, proportionality analysis questionable in light of Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957. It then compared the facts in Andrade's case to those in Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263-in which this Court rejected a claim that a life sentence was grossly disproportionate to the felonies that formed the predicate for the sentence, id., at 265-and concluded that Andrade's sentence was not disproportionate. The California Supreme Court denied discretionary review. The Federal District Court denied Andrade's subsequent habeas petition, but the Ninth Circuit granted him a certificate of appealability and reversed. Reviewing the case under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the latter court held that an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under 28 U. S. C.  2254(d)(1) occurs when there is clear error; concluded that both Solem and Rummel remain good law and are instructive in applying Harmelin; and found that the California Court of Appeal's disregard for Solem resulted in an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law and was irreconcilable with Solem, thus constituting clear error.
Held: The Ninth Circuit erred in ruling that the California Court of Appeal's decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, this Court's clearly established law within the meaning of  2254(d)(1). Pp.70-77.

Syllabus
(a) AEDPA does not require a federal habeas court to adopt any one methodology in deciding the only question that matters under  2254(d)(1)-whether a state court decision is contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. In this case, this Court does not reach the question whether the state court erred, but focuses solely on whether habeas relief is barred by  2254(d)(1). Pp. 70-71.
(b) This Court must first decide what constitutes such ""clearly established"" law. Andrade claims that Rummel, Solem, and Harmelin clearly establish a principle that his sentence is so grossly disproportionate that it violated the Eighth Amendment. Under  2254(d)(1), ""clearly established Federal law"" is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by this Court at the time a state court renders its decision. The difficulty with Andrade's position is that the Court has not established a clear or consistent path for courts to follow in determining whether a particular sentence for a term of years can violate the Eighth Amendment. Indeed, the only ""clearly established"" law emerging from the Court's jurisprudence in this area is that a gross disproportionality principle applies to such sentences. Because the Court's cases lack clarity regarding what factors may indicate gross disproportionality, the principle's precise contours are unclear, applicable only in the ""exceedingly rare"" and ""extreme"" case. Harmelin, supra, at 1001 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Pp.71-73.
(c) The California Court of Appeal's decision was not ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,"" the clearly established gross disproportionality principle. First, a decision is contrary to clearly established precedent if the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in this Court's cases or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a Court decision and nevertheless arrives at a different result. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405406. Andrade's sentence implicates factors relevant in both Rummel and Solem. Because Harmelin and Solem specifically stated that they did not overrule Rummel, it was not contrary to this Court's clearly established law for the state court to turn to Rummel in deciding whether the sentence was grossly disproportionate. See Harmelin, supra, at 998 (KENNEDY, J.). Also, the facts here fall in between Solem and Rummel but are not materially indistinguishable from either. Thus, the state court did not confront materially indistinguishable facts yet arrive at a different result. Second, under the ""unreasonable application"" clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the prisoner's case.

No. 01-729. Argued November 13, 2002-Decided March 5, 2003
Under the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), any sex offender or child kidnaper incarcerated in the State must register with the Department of Corrections within 30 days before his release, providing his name, address, and other specified information. If the individual is at liberty, he must register with local law enforcement authorities within a working day of his conviction or of entering the State. If he was convicted of a single, nonaggravated sex crime, the offender must provide annual verification of the submitted information for 15 years. If he was convicted of an aggravated sex offense or of two or more sex offenses, he must register for life and verify the information quarterly. The offender's information is forwarded to the Department of Public Safety, which maintains a central registry of sex offenders. Some of the data, such as fingerprints, driver's license number, anticipated change of address, and whether the offender has had medical treatment afterwards, are kept confidential. The offender's name, aliases, address, photograph, physical description, description, license and identification numbers of motor vehicles, place of employment, date of birth, crime, date and place of conviction, length and conditions of sentence, and a statement as to whether the offender is in compliance with the Act's update requirements or cannot be located are, however, published on the Internet. Both the Act's registration and notification requirements are retroactive.
Respondents were convicted of aggravated sex offenses. Both were released from prison and completed rehabilitative programs for sex offenders. Although convicted before the Act's passage, respondents are covered by it. Mter the initial registration, they are required to submit quarterly verifications and notify the authorities of any changes. Both respondents, along with the wife of one of them, also a respondent here, brought this action under 42 U. S. C.  1983, seeking to declare the Act void as to them under, inter alia, the Ex Post Facto Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I,  10, cl. 1. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit disagreed in relevant part, holding that, because its effects were punitive, the Act violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.

85
Held: Because the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act is nonpunitive, its retroactive application does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp.92-106.
(a) The determinative question is whether the legislature meant to establish ""civil proceedings."" Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346,361. If the intention was to impose punishment, that ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, the Court must further examine whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil. E. g., ibid. Because the Court ordinarily defers to the legislature's stated intent, ibid., only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty. See, e. g., ibid. P.92.
(b) The Alaska Legislature's intent was to create a civil, nonpunitive regime. The Court first considers the statute's text and structure, Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617, asking whether the legislature indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other, Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93, 99. Here, the statutory text states the legislature's finding that sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending, identifies protecting the public from sex offenders as the law's primary interest, and declares that release of certain information about sex offenders to public agencies and the public will assist in protecting the public safety. This Court has already determined that an imposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 363. Here, as in Hendricks, nothing on the statute's face suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other than a civil scheme designed to protect the public from harm. Id., at 361. The contrary conclusion is not required by the Alaska Constitution's inclusion of the need to protect the public as one of the purposes of criminal administration. Where a legislative restriction is an incident of the State's power to protect the public health and safety, it will be considered as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment. E. g., Flemming v. Nestor, supra, at 616. Other formal attributes of a legislative enactment, such as the manner of its codification or the enforcement procedures it establishes, are probative of the legislature's intent, see, e. g., Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 361, but are open to debate in this case. The Act's notification provisions are codified in the State's Health, Safety, and Housing Code, confirming the conclusion that the statute was intended as a nonpunitive regulatory measure. Cf. ibid. The fact that the Act's registration provisions are codified in the State's Code of Criminal Procedure is not

Here, the statutory text states the legislature's finding that sex offenders pose a high risk of reoffending, identifies protecting the public from sex offenders as the law's primary interest, and declares that release of certain information about sex offenders to public agencies and the public will assist in protecting the public safety. This Court has already determined that an imposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 363. Here, as in Hendricks, nothing on the statute's face suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other than a civil scheme designed to protect the public from harm. Id., at 361. The contrary conclusion is not required by the Alaska Constitution's inclusion of the need to protect the public as one of the purposes of criminal administration. Where a legislative restriction is an incident of the State's power to protect the public health and safety, it will be considered as evidencing an intent to exercise that regulatory power, and not a purpose to add to the punishment. E. g., Flemming v. Nestor, supra, at 616. Other formal attributes of a legislative enactment, such as the manner of its codification or the enforcement procedures it establishes, are probative of the legislature's intent, see, e. g., Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 361, but are open to debate in this case. The Act's notification provisions are codified in the State's Health, Safety, and Housing Code, confirming the conclusion that the statute was intended as a nonpunitive regulatory measure. Cf. ibid. The fact that the Act's registration provisions are codified in the State's Code of Criminal Procedure is not

MOSELEY ET AL., DBA VICTOR'S LITTLE SECRET v.
V SECRET CATALOGUE, INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1015. Argued November 12, 2002-Decided March 4, 2003
An army colonel sent a copy of an advertisement for petitioners' retail store, ""Victor's Secret,"" to respondents, affiliated corporations that own the VICTORIA'S SECRET trademarks, because he saw it as an attempt to use a reputable trademark to promote unwholesome, tawdry merchandise. Respondents asked petitioners to discontinue using the name, but petitioners responded by changing the store's name to ""Victor's Little Secret."" Respondents then filed suit, alleging, inter alia, ""the dilution of famous marks"" under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA). This 1995 amendment to the Trademark Act of 1946 describes the factors that determine whether a mark is ""distinctive and famous,"" 15 U. S. C.  1125(c)(1), and defines ""dilution"" as ""the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,""  1127. To support their claims that petitioners' conduct was likely to ""blur and erode"" their trademark's distinctiveness and ""tarnish"" its reputation, respondents presented an affidavit from a marketing expert who explained the value of respondents' mark but expressed no opinion concerning the impact of petitioners' use of ""Victor's Little Secret"" on that value. The District Court granted respondents summary judgment on the FTDA claim, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding that respondents' mark was ""distinctive"" and that the evidence established ""dilution"" even though no actual harm had been proved. It also rejected the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that the FTDA ""requires proof that (1) a defendant has [used] a junior mark sufficiently similar to the famous mark to evoke in ... consumers a mental association of the two that (2) has caused (3) actual economic harm to the famous mark's economic value by lessening its former selling power as an advertising agent for its goods or services,"" Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Dev., 170 F.3d 449, 461.
Held:
(a) Unlike traditional infringement law, the prohibitions against trademark dilution are not the product of common-law development, and are not motivated by an interest in protecting consumers. The approximately 25 state trademark dilution laws predating the FTDA refer both

419
to injury to business reputation (tarnishment) and to dilution of the distinctive quality of a trademark or trade name (blurring). The FTDA's legislative history mentions that the statute's purpose is to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the mark's distinctiveness or tarnish or disparage it, even absent a likelihood of confusion. pp. 428-431.
(b) Respondents' mark is unquestionably valuable, and petitioners have not challenged the conclusion that it is ""famous."" Nor do they contend that protection is confined to identical uses of famous marks or that the statute should be construed more narrowly in a case such as this. They do contend, however, that the statute requires proof of actual harm, rather than mere ""likelihood"" of harm. The contrast between the state statutes and the federal statute sheds light on this precise question. The former repeatedly refer to a ""likelihood"" of harm, rather than a completed harm, but the FTDA provides relief if another's commercial use of a mark or trade name ""causes dilution of the [mark's] distinctive quality,""  1125(c)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, it unambiguously requires an actual dilution showing. This conclusion is confirmed by the FTDA's ""dilution"" definition itself,  1127. That does not mean that the consequences of dilution, such as an actual loss of sales or profits, must also be proved. This Court disagrees with the Fourth Circuit's Ringling Bros. decision to the extent it suggests otherwise, but agrees with that court's conclusion that, at least where the marks at issue are not identical, the mere fact that consumers mentally associate the junior user's mark with a famous mark is not sufficient to establish actionable dilution. Such association will not necessarily reduce the famous mark's capacity to identify its owner's goods, the FTDA's dilution requirement. pp. 432-434.
2. The evidence in this case is insufficient to support summary judgment on the dilution count. There is a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark's capacity to identify and distinguish goods or services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs. The officer who saw the ad directed his offense entirely at petitioners, not respondents. And respondents' expert said nothing about the impact of petitioners' name on the strength of respondents' mark. Any difficulties of proof that may be entailed in demonstrating actual dilution are not an acceptable reason for dispensing with proof of an essential element of a statutory violation. P.434.

BOEING CO. ET AL. v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1209. Argued December 9, 2002-Decided March 4, 2003*
Under a 1971 statute providing special tax treatment for export sales made by an American manufacturer through a subsidiary that qualified as a ""domestic international sales corporation"" (DISC), no tax is payable on the DISC's retained income until it is distributed. See 26 U. S. C.  991-997. The statute thus provides an incentive to maximize the DISC's share-and to minimize the parent's share-of the parties' aggregate income from export sales. The statute provides three alternative ways for a parent to divert a limited portion of its income to the DISC. See  994(a)(1)-(3). The alternative that The Boeing Company chose limited the DISC's taxable income to a little over half of the parties ""combined taxable income"" (CTI). In 1984, the ""foreign sales corporation"" (FSC) provisions replaced the DISC provisions. As under the DISC regime, it is in the parent's interest to maximize the FSC's share of the taxable income generated by export sales. Because most of the differences between these regimes are immaterial to this suit, the Court's analysis focuses mainly on the DISC provisions. The Treasury Regulation at issue, 26 CFR  1.861-8(e)(3) (1979), governs the accounting for research and development (R&D) expenses when a taxpayer elects to take a current deduction, telling the taxpaying parent and its DISC ""what"" must be treated as a cost when calculating CTI, and ""how"" those costs should be (a) allocated among different products and (b) apportioned between the DISC and its parent. With respect to the ""what"" question, the regulation includes a list of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories (e. g., transportation equipment) and requires that R&D for any product within the same category as the exported product be taken into account. The regulations use gross receipts from sales as the basis for both ""how"" questions. Boeing organized its internal operations along product lines (e. g., aircraft model 767) for management and accounting purposes, each of which constituted a separate ""program"" within the organization; and $3.6 billion of its R&D expenses were spent on ""Company Sponsored Product Development,"" i. e., product-specific research. Boeing's accountants treated all

Syllabus
Company Sponsored costs as directly related to a single program and unrelated to any other program. Because nearly half of the Company Sponsored R&D at issue was allocated to programs that had no sales in the year in which the research was conducted, that amount was deducted by Boeing currently in calculating its taxable income for the years at issue, but never affected the calculation of the CTI derived by Boeing and its DISC from export sales. The Internal Revenue Service reallocated Boeing's Company Sponsored R&D costs for 1979 to 1987, thereby decreasing the untaxed profits of its export subsidiaries and increasing its taxable profits on export sales. Mter paying the additional taxes, Boeing filed this refund suit. In granting Boeing summary judgment, the District Court found  1.861-8(e)(3) invalid, reasoning that its categorical treatment of R&D conflicted with congressional intent that there be a direct relationship between items of gross income and expenses related thereto, and with a specific DISC regulation giving the taxpayer the right to group and allocate income and costs by product or product line. The Ninth Circuit reversed.
Held: Section 1.861-8(e)(3) is a proper exercise of the Secretary of the Treasury's rulemaking authority. Pp. 446-457.
(a) The relevant statutory text does not support Boeing's argument that the statute and certain regulations give it an unqualified right to allocate its Company Sponsored R&D expenses to the specific products to which they are factually related and to exclude such R&D from treatment as a cost of any other product. The method that Boeing chose to determine an export sale's transfer price allowed the DISC ""to derive taxable income attributable to [an export sale] in an amount which does not exceed ... 50 percent of the combined taxable income of [the DISC and the parent] which is attributable to the qualified export receipts on such property derived as the result of a sale by the DISC plus 10 percent of the export promotion expenses of such DISC attributable to such receipts .... "" 26 U. S. C.  994(a)(2) (emphasis added). The statute does not define ""combined taxable income"" or specifically mention R&D expenditures. The Secretary's regulation must be treated with deference, see Cottage Savings Assn. v. Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560561, but the statute places some limits on the Secretary's interpretive authority. First, ""does not exceed"" places an upper limit on the share of the export profits that can be assigned to a DISC and gives three methods of setting the transfer price. Second, ""combined taxable income"" makes it clear that the domestic parent's taxable income is a part of the CTI equation. Third, ""attributable"" limits the portion of the domestic parent's taxable income that can be treated as a part of the CTI.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
No. 01-1067. Argued December 2, 2002-Decided March 4, 2003
Under Pub. L. 86-392, 74 Stat. 8 (1960 Act), the ""former Fort Apache Military Reservation"" is ""held by the United States in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe, subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to use any part of the land and improvements."" The Secretary has exercised that right with respect to about 30 of the post's buildings and appurtenances. The Tribe sued the United States for the amount necessary to rehabilitate the property occupied by the Government in accordance with standards for historic preservation, alleging that the United States had breached a fiduciary duty to maintain, protect, repair, and preserve the trust property. In its motion to dismiss, the Government acknowledged that, under the Indian Tucker Act, it was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims with respect to certain Indian tribal claims, but stressed that the waiver operated only when underlying substantive law could fairly be interpreted as giving rise to a particular duty, breach of which should be compensable in money damages. The Government contended that jurisdiction was lacking here because no statute or regulation could fairly be read to impose a legal obligation on it to maintain or restore the trust property, let alone authorize compensation for breach. The Court of Federal Claims agreed and dismissed the complaint, relying primarily on United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535 (Mitchell I), and United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206 (Mitchell II). The court ruled that, like the Indian General Allotment Act at issue in Mitchell I, the 1960 Act created nothing more than a ""bare trust,"" with no predicate for finding a fiduciary obligation enforceable by monetary relief. The Federal Circuit reversed and remanded, on the understanding that the Government's property use under the 1960 Act triggered a common-law trustee's duty to act reasonably to preserve any property the Secretary chose to utilize, an obligation fairly interpreted as supporting a money damages claim. The court held that the 1960 Act's provision for the Government's exclusive control over the buildings actually occupied raised the trust to the level of Mitchell II, supra, at 225, in which this Court held that federal timber management statutes and regulations, under which

Syllabus
the United States assumed ""elaborate control"" over tribal forests, identified a specific trust relationship enforceable by a damages award.
Held: The 1960 Act gives rise to Indian Tucker Act jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over the Tribe's suit for money damages against the United States. Pp.472-479.
(a) The Indian Tucker Act gives that court jurisdiction over Indian tribal claims that ""otherwise would be cognizable ... if the claimant were not an Indian tribe,"" 28 U. S. C.  1505, but creates no substantive right enforceable against the Government by a claim for money damages, e. g., Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 216. A statute creates a right capable of grounding such a claim only if it ""can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the ... Government for the damages sustained."" E. g., id., at 217. This ""fair interpretation"" rule demands a showing demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial waiver of sovereign immunity that is necessary to authorize a suit against the Government. It is enough that a statute creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages. See id., at 218-219. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be ""lightly inferred,"" id., at 218, a fair inference will do. Pp.472-473.
(b) The two Mitchell cases give a sense of when it is fair to infer a fiduciary duty qualifying under the Indian Tucker Act and when it is not. In Mitchell I, because the Allotment Act gave the Government no functional obligations to manage timber, 445 U. S., at 542-543, and to the contrary established that the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land, ibid., the Court found that Congress did not intend to impose a duty on the Government to manage resources, id., at 542. In Mitchell II, however, because the statutes and regulations there considered gave the United States full responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the Indians' benefit, the Court held that they defined the contours of the United States' fiduciary responsibilities beyond the ""bare"" or minimal level, and thus could fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation through money damages if the Government faltered in its responsibility. 463 U. S., at 224-226. Pp. 473-474.
(c) The 1960 Act goes beyond a bare trust and permits a fair inference that the Government is subject to duties as a trustee and potentially liable in damages for breach. The statute expressly defines a fiduciary relationship in the provision that Fort Apache be held by the Government in trust for the Tribe, then proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. It is undisputed that the Government has to this day availed

In Mitchell I, because the Allotment Act gave the Government no functional obligations to manage timber, 445 U. S., at 542-543, and to the contrary established that the Indian allottee, and not a representative of the United States, is responsible for using the land, ibid., the Court found that Congress did not intend to impose a duty on the Government to manage resources, id., at 542. In Mitchell II, however, because the statutes and regulations there considered gave the United States full responsibility to manage Indian resources and land for the Indians' benefit, the Court held that they defined the contours of the United States' fiduciary responsibilities beyond the ""bare"" or minimal level, and thus could fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation through money damages if the Government faltered in its responsibility. 463 U. S., at 224-226. Pp. 473-474.
(c) The 1960 Act goes beyond a bare trust and permits a fair inference that the Government is subject to duties as a trustee and potentially liable in damages for breach. The statute expressly defines a fiduciary relationship in the provision that Fort Apache be held by the Government in trust for the Tribe, then proceeds to invest the United States with discretionary authority to make direct use of portions of the trust corpus. It is undisputed that the Government has to this day availed

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
No. 01-1375. Argued December 2, 2002-Decided March 4, 2003
The Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938 (IMLA) provides that ""[u]nallotted lands within any Indian reservation,"" or otherwise under federal jurisdiction, ""may, with the approval of the Secretary [of the Interior (Secretary)] ... , be leased for mining purposes, by authority of the tribal council or other authorized spokesmen for such Indians."" 25 U. S. C.  396a. The 1M LA aims to provide Indian tribes with a profitable source of revenue and to foster tribal self-determination by giving Indians a greater say in the use and disposition of the resources on their lands.
In 1964, the Navajo Nation (Tribe) permitted the predecessor of Peabody Coal Company (Peabody) to mine coal on the Tribe's lands pursuant to Lease 8580 (Lease or Lease 8580). The Lease established a maximum royalty rate of 37.5 cents per ton of coal, but made that figure subject to reasonable adjustment by the Secretary on the 20-year anniversary of the Lease and every ten years thereafter. As Lease 8580's 20-year anniversary approached, its 37.5 cents per ton rate yielded for the Tribe about 2 percent of gross proceeds. This return was higher than the ten cents per ton minimum established by then-applicable regulations implementing the IMLA. It was substantially lower, however, than the rate Congress established in 1977 as the minimum permissible royalty for coal mined on federal lands under the Mineral Leasing Act. In June 1984, the Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Mfairs, acting pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary and at the Tribe's request, sent Peabody an opinion letter raising the Lease 8580 rate to 20 percent of gross proceeds. While Peabody's administrative appeal was pending before Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Mfairs John Fritz, Peabody wrote to Secretary Hodel, asking him either to postpone decision on the appeal or to rule in Peabody's favor. Peabody representatives also met privately with Hodel during that period. In July 1985, Hodel sent a memorandum to Fritz ""suggest[ing]"" that he inform the parties that his decision was not imminent and urging them to continue their efforts to resolve the matter in a mutually agreeable fashion. The Tribe resumed negotiations with Peabody. In November 1985, the parties agreed to amend the Lease to provide, among other things, for a royalty rate of 12J,,2 percent of monthly gross proceeds, which was the

489
then-customary rate for coal leases on federal and Indian lands. Pursuant to 25 U. S. C.  396a, Secretary Hodel approved the amended Lease in December 1987.
In 1993, the Tribe brought this action for damages against the United States, alleging, inter alia, that the Secretary's approval of the Lease amendments constituted a breach of trust. Although granting summary judgment for the United States, the Court of Federal Claims found that the Secretary had flagrantly dishonored the Government's general fiduciary duties to the Tribe by acting in Peabody's best interests rather than those of the Tribe. The court nevertheless concluded that the Tribe had entirely failed to link that breach of duty to any statutory or regulatory obligation which could be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the Government's actions. The Federal Circuit reversed. Relying on 25 U. S. C.  399 and regulations promulgated thereunder, the appeals court determined that the measure of control the Secretary exercised over the leasing of Indian lands for mineral development sufficed to warrant a money judgment against the United States. Agreeing with the Federal Claims Court that the Secretary's actions regarding Peabody's administrative appeal violated the Government's fiduciary obligations to the Tribe, the Court of Appeals remanded for further proceedings, including a determination of damages.
Held: United States v. Mitchell, 445 U. S. 535 (Mitchell I), and United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206 (Mitchell II), control this case. The controversy here falls within Mitchell Fs domain, and the Tribe's claim for compensation from the Government fails, for it does not derive from any liability-imposing provision of the IMLA or its implementing regulations. Pp. 502-514.
(a) To state a litigable claim, a tribal plaintiff must invoke a rightscreating source of substantive law that ""can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damages sustained."" Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 218. Although the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U. S.

CLAY v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1500. Argued January 13, 2003-Decided March 4, 2003
Petitioner Clay was convicted of arson and a drug offense in Federal District Court. The Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions on November 23, 1998, and that court's mandate issued on December 15, 1998. Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The time in which he could have done so expired 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment and 69 days after issuance of its mandate. One year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate, and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired, Clay filed a motion for postconviction relief under 28 U. S. C.  2255. Such motions are subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from ""the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.""  2255, ~ 6(1). Relying on Circuit precedent, the District Court stated that when a federal prisoner does not seek certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for  2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate. Because Clay filed his  2255 motion more than one year after that date, the court denied it as time barred. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: For the purpose of starting the clock on  2255's one-year limitation period, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction. pp. 527-532.
(a) Finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning in the postconviction relief context: Finality attaches in that setting when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires. See, e. g., Gaspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390. Because the Court presumes ""that Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court's precedents,"" United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495, the Court's unvarying understanding of finality for collateral review purposes would ordinarily determine the meaning of ""becomes final"" in  2255. Pp. 527-528.
(b) Supporting the Seventh Circuit's judgment, the Court's invited amicus curiae urges a different determinant, relying on verbal differences between  2255 and  2244(d)(I), which governs petitions for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners. Where  2255, ~ 6(1), refers simply to ""the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,""

523
 2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of ""the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review."" When ""Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion."" Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23. Invoking the maxim recited in Russello, amicus asserts that ""becomes final"" in  2255, ~ 6(1), cannot mean the same thing as ""became final"" in  2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, amicus maintains, would render superfluous the words ""by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review""words found only in the latter provision. If  2255, ~ 6(1), explicitly incorporated the first of  2244(d)(1)(A)'s finality formulations, one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting  2255 implicitly to incorporate  2244(d)(1)(A)'s second trigger as well. As written, however,  2255 leaves ""becomes final"" undefined. Russello hardly warrants a decision that would hold the  2255 petitioner to a tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by  2244(d)(1)(A). An unqualified term, Russello indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than a pinpointed one. Moreover, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of ""final"" in  2244(d)(1)(A) but not in  2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to ""became final"" might have suggested that finality assessments should be made by reference to state-law rules. Those rules may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State. The qualifying words in  2244(d)(1)(A) make it clear that finality is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against. Pp. 528-531.
(c) Section 2263-which prescribes a limitation period for certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners-does not alter the Court's reading of  2255. First, amicus' reliance on  2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on  2244(d)(1)(A):
Section 2255, ~ 6(1), refers to neither of the two events that  2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period-""affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review"" and ""the expiration of the time for seeking such review."" Thus, reasoning by negative implication from  2263 does not justify the conclusion that  2255, ~ 6(1)'s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other. Second,  2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to ""affirmance of the conviction and sentence,"" while  2255, ~ 6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when ""the judgment of conviction becomes

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1118. Argued December 4, 2002-Decided February 26, 2003*
Respondents, an organization that supports the legal availability of abortion and two facilities that perform abortions, filed a class action alleging that petitioners, individuals and organizations that oppose legal abortion, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C.  1962(a), (c), and (d), by engaging in a nationwide conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through ""a pattern of racketeering activity"" that included acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act,  1951. In concluding that petitioners violated RICO's civil provisions, the jury found, among other things, that petitioners' alleged pattern of racketeering activity included violations of, or attempts or conspiracy to violate, the Hobbs Act, state extortion law, and the Travel Act,  1952. The jury awarded damages, and the District Court entered a permanent nationwide injunction against petitioners. Mfirming in relevant part, the Seventh Circuit held, inter alia, that the things respondents claimed were extorted from them-the class women's right to seek medical services from the clinics, the clinic doctors' rights to perform their jobs, and the clinics' rights to conduct their businessconstituted ""property"" for purposes of the Hobbs Act. The Court of Appeals further held that petitioners ""obtained"" that property, as  1951(b)(2) requires. The court also upheld the issuance of the nationwide injunction, finding that private plaintiffs are entitled to obtain injunctive relief under  1964(c).
Held:
1. Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed. Pp.400-410.
(a) Petitioners did not commit extortion within the Hobbs Act's meaning because they did not ""obtain"" property from respondents. Both of the sources Congress used as models in formulating the Hobbs Act-the New York Penal Code and the Field Code, a 19th-century model penal code-defined extortion as, inter alia, the ""obtaining"" of

property from another. This Court has recognized that New York's ""obtaining"" requirement entailed both a deprivation and acquisition of property, see United States v. Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 406, n. 16, and has construed the Hobbs Act provision at issue to require both features, see, e. g., id., at 400. It is undisputed that petitioners interfered with, disrupted, and in some instances completely deprived respondents of their ability to exercise their property rights. Likewise, petitioners' counsel has acknowledged that aspects of his clients' conduct were criminal. But even when their acts of interference and disruption achieved their ultimate goal of shutting down an abortion clinic, such acts did not constitute extortion because petitioners did not ""obtain"" respondents' property. Petitioners may have deprived or sought to deprive respondents of their alleged property right of exclusive control of their business assets, but they did not acquire any such property. They neither pursued nor received ""something of value from"" respondents that they could exercise, transfer, or sell. United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S. 286, 290. To conclude that their actions constituted extortion would effectively discard the statutory ""obtaining"" requirement and eliminate the recognized distinction between extortion and the separate crime of coercion. The latter crime, which more accurately describes the nature of petitioners' actions, involves the use of force or threat of force to restrict another's freedom of action. It was clearly defined in the New York Penal Code as a separate, and lesser, offense than extortion when Congress turned to New York law in drafting the Hobbs Act. Congress' decision to include extortion as a violation of the Hobbs Act and omit coercion is significant here, as is the fact that the AntiRacketeering Act, the predecessor to the Hobbs Act, contained sections explicitly prohibiting both. The Hobbs Act omission is particularly significant because a paramount congressional concern in drafting that Act was to be clear about what conduct was prohibited, United States v. Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 378, and to carefully define the Act's key terms, including ""extortion,"" id., at 373. Thus, while coercion and extortion overlap to the extent that extortion necessarily involves the use of coercive conduct to obtain property, there has been and continues to be a recognized difference between these two crimes. Because the Hobbs Act is a criminal statute, it must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of lenity. Enmons, supra, at 411. Culbert, supra, at 373, distinguished. If the distinction between extortion and coercion, which controls these cases, is to be abandoned, such a significant expansion of the law's coverage must come from Congress, not from the courts. pp.400-409.
(b) This Court's determination as to Hobbs Act extortion renders insufficient the other bases or predicate acts of racketeering supporting

1. Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed. Pp.400-410.
(a) Petitioners did not commit extortion within the Hobbs Act's meaning because they did not ""obtain"" property from respondents. Both of the sources Congress used as models in formulating the Hobbs Act-the New York Penal Code and the Field Code, a 19th-century model penal code-defined extortion as, inter alia, the ""obtaining"" of

property from another. This Court has recognized that New York's ""obtaining"" requirement entailed both a deprivation and acquisition of property, see United States v. Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 406, n. 16, and has construed the Hobbs Act provision at issue to require both features, see, e. g., id., at 400. It is undisputed that petitioners interfered with, disrupted, and in some instances completely deprived respondents of their ability to exercise their property rights. Likewise, petitioners' counsel has acknowledged that aspects of his clients' conduct were criminal. But even when their acts of interference and disruption achieved their ultimate goal of shutting down an abortion clinic, such acts did not constitute extortion because petitioners did not ""obtain"" respondents' property. Petitioners may have deprived or sought to deprive respondents of their alleged property right of exclusive control of their business assets, but they did not acquire any such property. They neither pursued nor received ""something of value from"" respondents that they could exercise, transfer, or sell. United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S. 286, 290. To conclude that their actions constituted extortion would effectively discard the statutory ""obtaining"" requirement and eliminate the recognized distinction between extortion and the separate crime of coercion. The latter crime, which more accurately describes the nature of petitioners' actions, involves the use of force or threat of force to restrict another's freedom of action. It was clearly defined in the New York Penal Code as a separate, and lesser, offense than extortion when Congress turned to New York law in drafting the Hobbs Act. Congress' decision to include extortion as a violation of the Hobbs Act and omit coercion is significant here, as is the fact that the AntiRacketeering Act, the predecessor to the Hobbs Act, contained sections explicitly prohibiting both. The Hobbs Act omission is particularly significant because a paramount congressional concern in drafting that Act was to be clear about what conduct was prohibited, United States v. Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 378, and to carefully define the Act's key terms, including ""extortion,"" id., at 373. Thus, while coercion and extortion overlap to the extent that extortion necessarily involves the use of coercive conduct to obtain property, there has been and continues to be a recognized difference between these two crimes. Because the Hobbs Act is a criminal statute, it must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of lenity. Enmons, supra, at 411. Culbert, supra, at 373, distinguished. If the distinction between extortion and coercion, which controls these cases, is to be abandoned, such a significant expansion of the law's coverage must come from Congress, not from the courts. pp.400-409.
(b) This Court's determination as to Hobbs Act extortion renders insufficient the other bases or predicate acts of racketeering supporting

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-7662. Argued October 16, 2002-Decided February 25, 2003
When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory strikes to exclude 10 of the 11 Mrican-Americans eligible to serve on the jury at petitioner's capital murder trial, he moved to strike the jury on the ground that the exclusions violated equal protection. Petitioner presented extensive evidence supporting his motion at a pretrial hearing, but the trial judge denied relief, finding no evidence indicating a systematic exclusion of blacks, as was required by the then-controlling precedent, Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202. Subsequently, the jury found petitioner guilty, and he was sentenced to death. While his appeal was pending, this Court established, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, a three-part process for evaluating equal protection claims such as petitioner's. Upon remand from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for new findings in light of Batson, the original trial court held a hearing at which it admitted all the Swain hearing evidence and took further evidence, but concluded that petitioner failed to satisfy step one of Batson because the evidence did not even raise an inference of racial motivation in the State's use of peremptory challenges. The court also determined that the State would have prevailed on steps two and three because the prosecutors had proffered credible, race-neutral explanations for the African-Americans excluded-i. e., their reluctance to assess, or reservations concerning, imposition of the death penalty-such that petitioner could not prove purposeful discrimination. Mter petitioner's direct appeal and state habeas petitions were denied, he filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U. S. C.  2254, raising a Batson claim and other issues. The Federal District Court denied relief in deference to the state courts' acceptance of the prosecutors' race-neutral justifications for striking the potential jurors, and subsequently denied petitioner's  2253 application for a certificate of appealability (COA). The Fifth Circuit noted that a COA will issue ""only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,""  2253(c)(2); reasoned that a petitioner must make such a ""substantial showing"" under the standard set forth in Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473; de-

clared that  2254(d)(2) required it to presume state-court findings correct unless it determined that the findings would result in a decision which was unreasonable in light of clear and convincing evidence; and applied this framework to deny petitioner a COA.
Petitioner's extensive evidence concerning the jury selection procedures falls into two broad categories. First, he presented, at the pretrial Swain hearing, testimony and other evidence relating to a pattern and practice of race discrimination in the voir dire by the Dallas County District Attorney's Office, including a 1976 policy by that office to exclude minorities from jury service that was available at least to one of petitioner's prosecutors. Second, two years later, petitioner presented, to the same state trial court, evidence that directly related to the prosecutors' conduct in his case, including a comparative analysis of the venire members demonstrating that Mrican-Americans were excluded from petitioner's jury in a ratio significantly higher than Caucasians; evidence that, during voir dire, the prosecution questioned venire members in a racially disparate fashion as to their death penalty views, their willingness to serve on a capital case, and their willingness to impose the minimum sentence for murder, and that responses disclosing reluctance or hesitation to impose capital punishment or a minimum sentence were cited as a justification for striking potential jurors; and the prosecution's use of a Texas criminal procedure practice known as ""jury shuffling"" to assure that white venire members were selected in preference to Mrican-Americans.
Held: The Fifth Circuit should have issued a COA to review the District Court's denial of habeas relief to petitioner. Pp. 335-348.
(a) Before a prisoner seeking postconviction relief under  2254 may appeal a district court's denial or dismissal of the petition, he must first seek and obtain a COA from a circuit justice or judge,  2253. This is a jurisdictional prerequisite. A COA will issue only if  2253's requirements have been satisfied. When a habeas applicant seeks a COA, the court of appeals should limit its examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of his claims. E. g., Slack, 529 U. S., at 481. This inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases supporting the claims. Consistent with this Court's precedent and the statutory text, the prisoner need only demonstrate ""a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.""  2253(c)(2). He satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his case or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed furthe~ E. g., id., at 484.

No. 01-1420. Argued December 3, 2002-Decided February 25, 2003
Although Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C.  401 et seq., and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits under Title XVI,  1381 et seq., are generally paid directly to the beneficiary, the Social Security Administration may distribute them to another individual or entity as the beneficiary's '''representative payee,'""  405(j)(1)(A), 1383(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I). Regulations provide, inter alia, that social service agencies and custodial institutions may serve as representative payees, but follow a parent, legal guardian, or relative in the order of preference for appointment to that position. E. g., 20 CFR  404.2021(b)(7), 416.621(b)(7). Such a payee may expend funds ""only for the use and benefit of the beneficiary,"" in a way the payee determines ""to be in the [beneficiary's] best interests.""  404.2035(a), 416.635(a). Payments made for ""current maintenance"" are ""for the use and benefit of the beneficiary,"" and ""current maintenance"" includes ""cost[s] incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items,""  404.2040(a), 416.640(a). A representative payee ""may not be required to use benefit payments to satisfy a [beneficiary's] debt"" that arose before the period the benefit payments are certified to cover, but a payee may discharge such a debt if the beneficiary's ""current and reasonably foreseeable needs"" are met and it is in the beneficiary's interest to do so,  404.2040(d), 416.640(d).
Washington State, through petitioner Department of Social and Health Services, provides foster care to certain children removed from their parents' custody, and it also receives and manages Social Security benefits as representative payee for many of those children. Pursuant to its regulation requiring that public benefits for a child, including SSI or OASDI benefits, be used on behalf of the child to help pay for the child's foster care costs, the department generally credits the Social Security benefits it receives to a special account for the beneficiary child, and debits the account to pay foster care providers. Respondents, who include such beneficiary children, filed this class action in state court, alleging, among other things, that the department's use of their OASDI or SSI benefits to reimburse itself for the foster care costs violated 42

u. S. C.  407(a) and 1383(d)(1). Section 407(a), the Act's ""antiattachment"" provision, protects Title II benefits from ""execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process."" Section 1383(d)(1) applies  407(a) to Title XVI. In granting respondents summary judgment, the trial court enjoined the department from continuing to charge its foster care costs against Social Security benefits, ordered restitution of previous reimbursement transfers, and awarded attorney's fees. The State Court of Appeals certified the case to the Washington Supreme Court, which ultimately affirmed the trial court's holding that the department's practices violated the antiattachment provisions.
Held: The State's use of respondents' Social Security benefits to reimburse itself does not violate 42 U. S. C.  407(a). Pp. 382-392.
(a) Neither the department's effort to become a representative payee, nor its use of respondents' Social Security benefits when it acts in that capacity, amounts to employing an ""execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process"" under  407(a). Because the department's activities do not involve any of the specified formal procedures, the case boils down to whether those activities are ""other legal process."" The statute uses that term restrictively, for under the established interpretative canons of noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis, where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar to those enumerated by the specific words. E. g., Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 114-115. Thus, ""other legal process"" should be understood to be process much like the processes of execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment, and at a minimum, would seem to require utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, though not necessarily an elaborate one, by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge or secure discharge of an allegedly existing or anticipated liability. This conclusion is confirmed by the definition of ""legal process"" in the Social Security Administration's Program Operations Manual System (POMS). On this restrictive understanding, it is apparent that the department's activities do not involve ""legal process."" Whereas the object of the specifically named processes is to discharge, or secure discharge of, some enforceable obligation, the State has no enforceable claim against its foster children. And while execution, levy, attachment, and garnishment typically involve the exercise of some sort of judicial or quasi-judicial authority to gain control over another's property, the department's reimbursement scheme operates on funds already in the department's possession and control, held on terms that allow the reimbursement. Additionally, although the State uses a reimbursement method of accounting, there is no question that the funds were spent for items of

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION v.
NEXTWAVE PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS INC. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 01-653. Argued October 8, 2002-Decided January 27, 2003*
Pursuant to provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to award spectrum licenses to small businesses through competitive bidding, and to allow them to pay for the licenses in installments, the FCC auctioned off certain broadband personal communications services licenses to respondents (hereinafter NextWave). NextWave made a down payment on the purchase price, signed promissory notes for the balance, and executed agreements giving the FCC a first lien on, and security interest in, NextWave's rights and interest in the licenses, which recited that they were conditioned upon the full and timely payment of all monies due the FCC, and that failure to comply with this condition would result in their automatic cancellation. NextWave eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and suspended payments to all creditors, including the FCC, pending confirmation of its reorganization plan. The FCC objected to the plan, asserting that NextWave's licenses had been canceled automatically when the company missed its first payment deadline, and announced that NextWave's licenses were available for auction. The Bankruptcy Court invalidated the cancellation of the licenses as a violation of various Bankruptcy Code provisions, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that exclusive jurisdiction to review the FCC's regulatory action lay in the courts of appeals. Mter the FCC denied NextWave's petition for reconsideration of the license cancellation, the District of Columbia Circuit held that the cancellation violated 11 U. S. C.  525(a), which provides: ""[A] governmental unit may not ... revoke ... a license ... to ... a debtor ... solely because such ... debtor ... has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case.""
Held: Section 525 prohibits the FCC from revoking licenses held by a bankruptcy debtor upon the debtor's failure to make timely payments to the FCC for purchase of the licenses. It is undisputed that the FCC

is a ""governmental unit"" that has ""revoke[d]"" a ""license,"" and that NextWave is a ""debtor"" under the Bankruptcy Act. Pp. 301-308.
(a) The Court rejects petitioners' argument that the FCC did not revoke NextWave's licenses ""solely because"" of nonpayment under  525(a). The fact that the FCC had a valid regulatory motive for its action is irrelevant. Section 525 means nothing more or less than that the failure to pay a dischargeable debt must alone be the proximate cause of the cancellation, whatever the agency's ultimate motive may be. Pp. 301-302.
(b) The FCC's contention that regulatory conditions like full and timely payment are not properly classified as ""debts"" under  525(a) fails. Under the Bankruptcy Code, ""debt"" means ""liability on a claim,""  101(12), and ""claim,"" in turn, includes any ""right to payment,""  101(5)(A). The plain meaning of a ""right to payment"" is nothing more nor less than an enforceable obligation, regardless of the Government's objectives in imposing the obligation. E. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 559. Also rejected is petitioners' argument that NextWave's obligations are not ""dischargeable"" under  525(a) because it is beyond the bankruptcy courts' jurisdictional authority to alter or modify regulatory obligations. Dischargeability is not tied to the existence of such authority. The Bankruptcy Code states that confirmation of a reorganization plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the confirmation date, 11 U. S. C.  1141(d)(1)(A), and the only debts it excepts from that prescription are those described in  523, see  1141(d)(2). Ohio v. Kovacs, 469 U. S. 274, 278. Petitioners' contention that the D. C. Circuit has no power to modify or discharge a debt is irrelevant to whether that court can set aside agency action that violates  525, which is all that it did when it prevented the FCC from canceling licenses because of failure to pay debts dischargeable by bankruptcy courts. Pp. 302-304.
(c) Finally, this Court's interpretation of  525 does not, as petitioners contend, create a conflict with the Communications Act by obstructing the functioning of that Act's auction provisions. Nothing in those provisions demands that cancellation be the sanction for failure to make agreed-upon periodic payments or even requires the FCC to permit payment to be made over time. What petitioners describe as a conflict boils down to nothing more than a policy preference on the FCC's part for (1) selling licenses on credit and (2) canceling licenses rather than asserting security interests when there is a default. Such administrative preferences cannot be the basis for denying NextWave rights provided by a law's plain terms. P. 304.
254 F.3d 130, affirmed.

Held: Section 525 prohibits the FCC from revoking licenses held by a bankruptcy debtor upon the debtor's failure to make timely payments to the FCC for purchase of the licenses. It is undisputed that the FCC

is a ""governmental unit"" that has ""revoke[d]"" a ""license,"" and that NextWave is a ""debtor"" under the Bankruptcy Act. Pp. 301-308.
(a) The Court rejects petitioners' argument that the FCC did not revoke NextWave's licenses ""solely because"" of nonpayment under  525(a). The fact that the FCC had a valid regulatory motive for its action is irrelevant. Section 525 means nothing more or less than that the failure to pay a dischargeable debt must alone be the proximate cause of the cancellation, whatever the agency's ultimate motive may be. Pp. 301-302.
(b) The FCC's contention that regulatory conditions like full and timely payment are not properly classified as ""debts"" under  525(a) fails. Under the Bankruptcy Code, ""debt"" means ""liability on a claim,""  101(12), and ""claim,"" in turn, includes any ""right to payment,""  101(5)(A). The plain meaning of a ""right to payment"" is nothing more nor less than an enforceable obligation, regardless of the Government's objectives in imposing the obligation. E. g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 559. Also rejected is petitioners' argument that NextWave's obligations are not ""dischargeable"" under  525(a) because it is beyond the bankruptcy courts' jurisdictional authority to alter or modify regulatory obligations. Dischargeability is not tied to the existence of such authority. The Bankruptcy Code states that confirmation of a reorganization plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the confirmation date, 11 U. S. C.  1141(d)(1)(A), and the only debts it excepts from that prescription are those described in  523, see  1141(d)(2). Ohio v. Kovacs, 469 U. S. 274, 278. Petitioners' contention that the D. C. Circuit has no power to modify or discharge a debt is irrelevant to whether that court can set aside agency action that violates  525, which is all that it did when it prevented the FCC from canceling licenses because of failure to pay debts dischargeable by bankruptcy courts. Pp. 302-304.
(c) Finally, this Court's interpretation of  525 does not, as petitioners contend, create a conflict with the Communications Act by obstructing the functioning of that Act's auction provisions. Nothing in those provisions demands that cancellation be the sanction for failure to make agreed-upon periodic payments or even requires the FCC to permit payment to be made over time. What petitioners describe as a conflict boils down to nothing more than a policy preference on the FCC's part for (1) selling licenses on credit and (2) canceling licenses rather than asserting security interests when there is a default. Such administrative preferences cannot be the basis for denying NextWave rights provided by a law's plain terms. P. 304.
254 F.3d 130, affirmed.

MEYER v. HOLLEY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1120. Argued December 3, 2002-Decided January 22, 2003
The Fair Housing Act forbids racial discrimination in respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling. 42 U. S. C.  3604(b), 3605(a). Respondent Holleys, an interracial couple, tried to buy a house listed for sale by Triad, a real estate corporation. A Triad salesman is alleged to have prevented the Holleys from buying the house for racially discriminatory reasons. Mter filing suit in federal court against the salesman and Triad, the Holleys filed a separate suit against petitioner Meyer, Triad's president, sole shareholder, and licensed ""officer/broker,"" claiming that he was vicariously liable in one or more of these capacities for the salesman's unlawful actions. The District Court consolidated the lawsuits and dismissed the claims against Meyer because (1) it considered them vicarious liability assertions, and (2) it believed that the Fair Housing Act did not impose personal vicarious liability upon a corporate officer or a ""designated officer/broker."" In reversing, the Ninth Circuit in effect held that the Act imposes strict liability principles beyond those traditionally associated with agent/principal or employee/employer relationships.
Held: The Act imposes liability without fault upon the employer in accordance with traditional agency principles, i. e., it normally imposes vicarious liability upon the corporation but not upon its officers or owners. Pp. 285-292.
(a) Although the Act says nothing about vicarious liability, it is nonetheless well established that it provides for such liability. The Court has assumed that, when Congress creates a tort action, it legislates against a legal background of ordinary tort-related vicarious liability rules and consequently intends its legislation to incorporate those rules. Traditional vicarious liability rules ordinarily make principals or employers vicariously liable for the acts of their agents or employees in the scope of their authority or employment. E. g., Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742,756. Absent special circumstances, it is the corporation, not its owner or officer, who is the principal or employer subject to vicarious liability for the torts of its employees or agents. The Ninth Circuit's holding that the Act made corporate owners and officers liable for an employee's unlawful acts simply because they controlled (or had the right to control) that employee's actions is

281
rejected. For one thing, Congress said nothing in the Act or in the legislative history about extending vicarious liability in this manner. And such silence, while permitting an inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary background tort principles, cannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modification of those rules. This Court has applied unusually strict rules only where Congress has specified that such was its intent. See, e. g., United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 280-281. For another thing, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the agency primarily charged with the Act's implementation and administration, has specified that ordinary vicarious liability rules apply in this area, and the Court ordinarily defers to an administering agency's reasonable statutory interpretation, e. g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845; Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140. Finally, no convincing argument supports the Ninth Circuit's decision to apply nontraditional vicarious liability principles. It erred in relying on language in a then-applicable HUD regulation, which, taken as a whole, says that ordinary, not unusual, liability rules apply. And the holdings in cases from other Circuits that the Ninth Circuit cited do not support the kind of nontraditional liability that it applied, nor does the language of those cases provide a convincing rationale for the Ninth Circuit's conclusions. Pp. 285-289.
(b) Nothing in the Act's language or legislative history supports the existence of a corporate owner's or officer's ""nondelegable duty"" not to discriminate. Such a duty imposed on a principal would ""go further"" than the vicarious liability principles discussed thus far to create liability although the principal has done everything that could reasonably be required of him, and irrespective of whether the agent was acting with or without authority. In the absence of legal support, the Court cannot conclude that Congress intended, through silence, to impose a special duty of protection upon individual officers or owners of corporationswho are not principals (or contracting parties) in respect to the corporation's unlawfully acting employee. Neither does it help to characterize the Act's objective as an overriding societal priority. The complex question of which one of two innocent people must suffer, and when, should be answered in accordance with traditional principles of vicarious liability-unless Congress has instructed the courts differently. Pp.289-291.
(c) The Court does not address respondents' remaining contentions because they were not considered by the Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit remains free on remand to consider any such arguments that were properly raised. Pp.291-292.

UNITED STATES v. JIMENEZ RECIO ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-1184. Argued November 12, 2002-Decided January 21, 2003
Ninth Circuit precedent states that a conspiracy terminates when ""'there is affirmative evidence of ... defeat of the object of the conspiracy.''' United States v. Cruz, 127 F.3d 791, 795 (emphasis added). Here, police stopped a truck carrying illegal drugs, seized the drugs, and, with the help of the truck's drivers, set up a sting. The drivers paged a contact who said he would call someone to get the truck. Respondents Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza appeared in a car, and the former drove away in the truck, the latter in the car. Mter a jury convicted them of conspiring to possess and to distribute unlawful drugs, the judge ordered a new trial because, under Cruz, the jury could not convict respondents unless it believed they had joined the conspiracy before the police seized the drugs, and it had not been so instructed. The new jury convicted respondents, who appealed. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the evidence presented at the second trial was insufficient to show that respondents had joined the conspiracy before the drug seizure.
Held: A conspiracy does not automatically terminate simply because the Government has defeated its object. Thus, the Ninth Circuit is incorrect in its view that a conspiracy ends through ""defeat"" when the Government intervenes, making the conspiracy's goals impossible to achieve, even if the conspirators do not know that the Government has intervened and are totally unaware that the conspiracy is bound to fail. First, the Ninth Circuit's rule is inconsistent with basic conspiracy law. The agreement to commit an unlawful act is ""a distinct evil,"" which ""may exist and be punished whether or not the substantive crime ensues."" Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 65. The conspiracy poses a ""threat to the public"" over and above the threat of the substantive crime's commission-both because the ""[c]ombination in crime makes more likely the commission of [other] crimes"" and because it ""decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of criminality."" E. g., Callanan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 593-594. Where police have frustrated a conspiracy's specific objective but conspirators (unaware of that fact) have neither abandoned the conspiracy nor withdrawn, these special conspiracy-related dangers remain, as does the conspiracy's essence-the agreement to commit the

271
crime. Second, this Court's view is that of almost all courts and commentators but for the Ninth Circuit. No other Federal Court of Appeals has adopted the Ninth Circuit's rule, and three have explicitly rejected it. The Cruz majority argued that the traditional rule threatened ""endless"" potential liability. But the majority's example illustrating that point-a sting in which police instructed an arrested conspirator to call all of his acquaintances to come and help him, with the Government obtaining convictions of those who did so-draws its persuasive force from the fact that it bears certain resemblances to entrapment, which the law independently forbids. At the same time, the Cruz rule would reach well beyond arguable police misbehavior, potentially threatening the use of properly run law enforcement sting operations. See Lewis v. United States, 385 U. S. 206,208-209. Ninth Circuit precedent, whereby the language"" 'the defendant ... defeated its purpose'"" in United States v. Krasn, 614 F.2d 1229, 1236, was changed to ""a conspiracy is presumed to continue until there is ... defeat of the [conspiracy's purpose]"" in United States v. Bloch, 696 F.2d 1213, 1215 (emphasis added), may help to explain the Cruz rule's origin. But, since the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases nowhere give any reason for the critical language change, they cannot help to justify it. Pp.274-277.

BARNHART, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY v. PEABODY COAL CO. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 01-705. Argued October 8, 2002-Decided January 15,2003*
Under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act or Act), the Commissioner of Social Security ""shall, before October 1, 1993,"" assign each coal industry retiree eligible for benefits under the Act to an extant operating company-a ""signatory operator"" --or a related entity, which shall then be responsible for funding the beneficiary's benefits, 26 U. S. C.  9706(a). Assignment to a signatory operator binds the operator to pay an annual premium to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund (Combined Fund), which administers the benefits. The premium has up to three components, a health benefit premium, a death benefit premium, and a premium for retirees who are not assigned to a particular operator, but whose benefits are paid from the Combined Fund as if they were assigned. An important object of the Coal Act was providing stable funding for the health benefits of such ""orphan retirees."" Although signatory operators will only be required to pay an unassigned beneficiaries premium if funding from the United Mine Workers of America 1950 Pension Plan (UMWA Pension Plan) and the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund (AML Fund) runs out, each signatory operator's unassigned beneficiaries premium is based on the number of its assigned beneficiaries, such that the signatory with the most assigned retirees would be required to cover the greatest share of the benefits payable to unassigned beneficiaries. In two separate actions before different District Courts, respondent companies challenged initial assignments made to them after the October 1, 1993, deadline, claiming that the date set a time limit on the Commissioner's assignment power, so that a beneficiary not assigned on that date must be left unassigned for life. If the challenged assignments are void, the corresponding benefits must be financed by transfers from the UMWA Pension Plan, the AML Fund, and, if necessary, unassigned beneficiaries premiums paid by signatory operators to whom

timely assignments were made. The companies obtained summary judgments, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.
Held: Initial assignments made after October 1, 1993, are valid despite their untimeliness. Pp. 157-172.
(a) The companies' contention that the Commissioner's failure is ""jurisdictional,"" so that affected beneficiaries may never be assigned and their former employers may go scot free, is as unsupportable as it is counterintuitive. pp. 157-171.
(1) This Court has rejected an argument comparable to the companies' position that couching the duty in terms of the mandatory ""shall"" together with a specific deadline leaves the Commissioner with no authority to make an initial assignment on or after October 1, 1993. In Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, the Court found that the Secretary of Labor's 120-day deadline to issue a final determination on a complaint of federal grant fund misuse was meant to spur him to action, not limit the scope of his authority, so that his untimely action was valid. Nor, since Brock, has this Court ever construed a provision that the Government ""shall"" act within a specified time, without more, as a jurisdictional limit precluding action later. If a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, federal courts will not ordinarily impose their own coercive sanction. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63. Hence the oddity of a claim at this date that late official action should shift financial burdens from otherwise responsible private purses to the public fisc, let alone siphon money from funds set aside for a different public purpose, like the AML Fund for land reclamation. The point would be the same even if Brock were the only case on the subject. The Coal Act was passed six years after Brock, when Congress was presumably aware that the Court does not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agency's power to finish a mandatory job merely from a specification to act by a certain time. Nothing more limiting than ""shall"" is to be found in the Coal Act: no express language supports the companies, while structure, purpose, and legislative history go against them. Structural clues support the Commissioner in the Act's other instances of combining ""shall"" with a specific date that could not possibly be read to prohibit action outside the statutory period. See  9705(a)(I), 9702(a)(I), 9704(h). In each of these instances, a conclusion is based on plausibility grounds: had Congress meant to set a counterintuitive limit on authority to act, it would have said more than it did, and would surely not have couched its intent in language Brock had already held to lack any clear jurisdictional significance. Pp. 157-163.

(1) This Court has rejected an argument comparable to the companies' position that couching the duty in terms of the mandatory ""shall"" together with a specific deadline leaves the Commissioner with no authority to make an initial assignment on or after October 1, 1993. In Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, the Court found that the Secretary of Labor's 120-day deadline to issue a final determination on a complaint of federal grant fund misuse was meant to spur him to action, not limit the scope of his authority, so that his untimely action was valid. Nor, since Brock, has this Court ever construed a provision that the Government ""shall"" act within a specified time, without more, as a jurisdictional limit precluding action later. If a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, federal courts will not ordinarily impose their own coercive sanction. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63. Hence the oddity of a claim at this date that late official action should shift financial burdens from otherwise responsible private purses to the public fisc, let alone siphon money from funds set aside for a different public purpose, like the AML Fund for land reclamation. The point would be the same even if Brock were the only case on the subject. The Coal Act was passed six years after Brock, when Congress was presumably aware that the Court does not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agency's power to finish a mandatory job merely from a specification to act by a certain time. Nothing more limiting than ""shall"" is to be found in the Coal Act: no express language supports the companies, while structure, purpose, and legislative history go against them. Structural clues support the Commissioner in the Act's other instances of combining ""shall"" with a specific date that could not possibly be read to prohibit action outside the statutory period. See  9705(a)(I), 9702(a)(I), 9704(h). In each of these instances, a conclusion is based on plausibility grounds: had Congress meant to set a counterintuitive limit on authority to act, it would have said more than it did, and would surely not have couched its intent in language Brock had already held to lack any clear jurisdictional significance. Pp. 157-163.

ELDRED ET AL. v. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 01-618. Argued October 9, 2002-Decided January 15,2003
The Copyright and Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I,  8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: ""Congress shall have Power ... [t]o promote the Progress of Science ... by securing [to Authors] for limited Times ... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings."" In the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years: Under the 1976 Copyright Act (1976 Act), copyright protection generally lasted from a work's creation until 50 years after the author's death; under the CTEA, most copyrights now run from creation until 70 years after the author's death, 17 U. S. C.  302(a). As in the case of prior copyright extensions, principally in 1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of the enlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.
Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted works that have gone into the public domain, brought this suit seeking a determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the Copyright Clause's ""limited Times"" prescription and the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. Petitioners do not challenge the CTEA's ""life-plus-70-years"" timespan itself. They maintain that Congress went awry not with respect to newly created works, but in enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights. The ""limited Tim[e]"" in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners urge, becomes the constitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the power of Congress to extend. As to the First Amendment, petitioners contend that the CTEA is a content-neutral regulation of speech that fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for such regulations. The District Court entered judgment on the pleadings for the Attorney General (respondent here), holding that the CTEA does not violate the Copyright Clause's ""limited Times"" restriction because the CTEA's terms, though longer than the 1976 Act's terms, are still limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit within Congress' discretion. The court also held that there are no First Amendment rights to use the copyrighted works of others. The District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. In that court's unanimous view, Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539, foreclosed petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the CTEA. The appeals court reasoned that copyright does not impermis-

187
sibly restrict free speech, for it grants the author an exclusive right only to the specific form of expression; it does not shield any idea or fact contained in the copyrighted work, and it allows for ""fair use"" even of the expression itself. A majority of the court also rejected petitioners' Copyright Clause claim. The court ruled that Circuit precedent precluded petitioners' plea for interpretation of the ""limited Times"" prescription with a view to the Clause's preambular statement of purpose:
""To promote the Progress of Science."" The court found nothing in the constitutional text or history to suggest that a term of years for a copyright is not a ""limited Tim[e]"" if it may later be extended for another ""limited Tim[e]."" Recounting that the First Congress made the 1790 Copyright Act applicable to existing copyrights arising under state copyright laws, the court held that that construction by contemporaries of the Constitution's formation merited almost conclusive weight under Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U. S. 53, 57. As early as McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202, the Court of Appeals recognized, this Court made it plain that the Copyright Clause permits Congress to amplify an existing patent's terms. The court added that this Court has been similarly deferential to Congress' judgment regarding copyright. E. g., Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417. Concerning petitioners' assertion that Congress could evade the limitation on its authority by stringing together an unlimited number of ""limited Times,"" the court stated that such legislative misbehavior clearly was not before it. Rather, the court emphasized, the CTEA matched the baseline term for United States copyrights with the European Union term in order to meet contemporary circumstances.
Held: In placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutionallimitations. Pp. 199-222.
1. The CTEA's extension of existing copyrights does not exceed Congress' power under the Copyright Clause. Pp. 199-218.
(a) Guided by text, history, and precedent, this Court cannot agree with petitioners that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress' Copyright Clause authority. Although conceding that the CTEA's baseline term of life plus 70 years qualifies as a ""limited Tim[e]"" as applied to future copyrights, petitioners contend that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not ""limited."" In petitioners' view, a time prescription, once set, becomes forever ""fixed"" or ""inalterable."" The word ""limited,"" however, does not convey a meaning so constricted. At the time of the Framing, ""limited"" meant what it means today: confined within certain bounds, restrained, or circumscribed. Thus understood, a timespan appropriately ""limited""

SATTAZAHN v. PENNSYLVANIA
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA
No. 01-7574. Argued November 4, 2002-Decided January 14,2003
Under Pennsylvania law, (1) the verdict in the penalty phase of capital proceedings must be death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance or one or more aggravating circumstances outweighing any mitigating circumstances, but it must be life imprisonment in all other instances; and (2) the court may discharge a jury if it determines that the jury will not unanimously agree on the sentence, but the court must then enter a life sentence. When petitioner's penalty-phase jury reported to the trial judge that it was hopelessly deadlocked 9-to-3 for life imprisonment, the court discharged the jury and entered a life sentence. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court reversed petitioner's first-degree murder conviction and remanded for a new trial. At the second trial, Pennsylvania again sought the death penalty and the jury again convicted petitioner, but this time the jury imposed a death sentence. In affirming, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that neither the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause barred Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty at the retrial.
Held:
1. There was no double-jeopardy bar to Pennsylvania's seeking the death penalty on retrial. Pp. 106-110, 113-115.
(a) Where, as here, a defendant who is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment succeeds in having the conviction set aside on appeal, jeopardy has not terminated, so that a life sentence imposed in connection with the initial conviction raises no doublejeopardy bar to a death sentence on retrial. Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15. While, in the line of cases commencing with Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430, this Court has found that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to capital-sentencing proceedings that ""have the hallmarks of the trial on guilt or innocence,"" id., at 439, the relevant inquiry in that context is not whether the defendant received a life sentence the first time around, but whether a first life sentence was an ""acquittal"" based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence-i. e., findings that the government failed to prove one or more aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203,211. Pp. 106-109.

102
Syllabus
(b) Double-jeopardy protections were not triggered when the jury deadlocked at petitioner's first sentencing proceeding and the court prescribed a life sentence pursuant to Pennsylvania law. The jury in that first proceeding was deadlocked and made no findings with respect to the alleged aggravating circumstance. That result, or nonresult, cannot fairly be called an acquittal, based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to a life sentence. Neither was the entry of a life sentence by the judge an ""acquittal."" Under Pennsylvania's scheme, a judge has no discretion to fashion a sentence once he finds the jury is deadlocked, and he makes no findings and resolves no factual matters. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also made no finding that the Pennsylvania Legislature intended the statutorily required entry of a life sentence to create an ""entitlement"" even without an ""acquittal."" Pp. 109-110.
(c) Dictum in United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 92, does not support the proposition that double jeopardy bars retrial when a defendant's case has been fully tried and the court on its own motion enters a life sentence. The mere prospect of a second capital-sentencing proceeding does not implicate the perils against which the Double Jeopardy Clause seeks to protect. Pp. 113-115.
2. The Due Process Clause also did not bar Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty at the retrial. Nothing in  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment indicates that any ""life"" or ""liberty"" interest that Pennsylvania law may have given petitioner in the first proceeding's life sentence was somehow immutable, and he was ""deprived"" of any such interest only by operation of the ""process"" he invoked to invalidate the underlying first-degree murder conviction. This Court declines to hold that the Due Process Clause provides greater double-jeopardy protection than does the Double Jeopardy Clause. pp. 115-116.

PIERCE COUNTY, WASHINGTON v. GUILLEN, LEGAL GUARDIAN OF GUILLEN ET AL., MINORS, ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON
No. 01-1229. Argued November 4, 2002-Decided January 14,2003
As part of its effort to improve the safety of the Nation's highways, Congress adopted the Hazard Elimination Program (Program), 23 U. S. C.  152, which provides state and local governments with funding to improve the most dangerous sections of their roads. To be eligible for such funding, a government must undertake a thorough evaluation of its public roads. Because of States' concerns that the absence of confidentiality with respect to  152's compliance measures would increase the liability risk for accidents that took place at hazardous locations before improvements could be made and Department of Transportation's concerns that the States' reluctance to be forthcoming in their data collection efforts undermined the Program's effectiveness, Congress, in 1987, adopted 409, which provided that materials ""compiled"" for  152 purposes ""shall not be admitted into evidence in Federal or State court."" Responding to subsequent court decisions holding that  409 did not apply to pretrial discovery and protected only materials that an agency actually generated for  152 purposes, not documents that the agency collected to prepare its  152 application, Congress expressly made the statute applicable to pretrial discovery in 1991 and added the phrase ""or collected"" after the word ""compiled"" in 1995. Several months before respondent Ignacio Guillen's wife died in an automobile accident at an intersection in petitioner county, petitioner's  152 funding request for the intersection was denied. Its second request was approved three weeks after the accident. Petitioner declined to provide respondents' counsel with information about accidents at the intersection, asserting that any relevant information was protected by  409. Respondents then filed an action in Washington state court, alleging that petitioner's refusal to disclose violated the State's Public Disclosure Act (PDA). The trial court granted respondents summary judgment, ordering petitioner to disclose five documents and pay respondents' attorney's fees. While petitioner's appeal was pending, respondents filed another state-court action, alleging that petitioner had been negligent in failing to install proper traffic controls at the intersection. Petitioner refused to comply with their discovery request for information regarding accidents at the intersection, and respondents

successfully sought an order to compel. The State Court of Appeals granted petitioner's motion for discretionary appellate review of the interlocutory order, consolidated this and the PDA appeals, and in large part affirmed, concluding that four of the documents requested in the PDA action were not protected. On further appeal, the Washington Supreme Court determined that disclosure under the relevant state laws would be appropriate only if the requested materials were not protected by  409; that protection under  409, as amended in 1995, turned on whether the documents were collected for  152 purposes, without regard to the identity of the documents' custodian; and that the 1995 amendment's adoption exceeded Congress' powers under the Spending, Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses. It therefore vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded the case.
Held:
1. This Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the tort portion of the case but has jurisdiction to hear the PDA portion. Certain state-court judgments can be treated as final for jurisdictional purposes even though further proceedings are to take place in the state courts. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 477-483 (outlining four exceptions to the finality rule). In the tort action, the Washington Supreme Court resolved only a discovery dispute; it did not determine the litigation's final outcome. And the Cox exceptions do not apply to that action. Accordingly, this Court dismisses the writ of certiorari with respect to that action for want of jurisdiction. However, the PDA action falls squarely under the first Cox exception. The State Supreme Court's ruling that the 1995 amendment to  409 was invalid, which left four documents subject to disclosure under the PDA and only the amount of attorney's fees remaining to be decided on remand, is ""conclusive"" as to the federal issue and ""the outcome of further proceedings preordained,"" id., at 479. Pp. 140-143.
2. Both the original  409 and the 1995 amendment fall within Congress' Commerce Clause power. Pp. 143-148.
(a) Before addressing the constitutional question, this Court must determine  409's scope. Evidentiary privileges, such as  409, must be construed narrowly because they impede the search for the truth. See Baldrige v. Shapiro, 455 U. S. 345, 360. This Court agrees with the United States that  409 protects only information compiled or collected for  152 purposes, but does not protect information that was compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to  152, as held by agencies that compiled or collected that information, even if the information was at some point ""collected"" by another agency for  152 purposes. Although respondents offer the narrowest interpretation of  409-that  409 protects only materials actually created by the agency responsible for seeking  152 funding-their reading leaves the 1995 amendment (changing

1. This Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the tort portion of the case but has jurisdiction to hear the PDA portion. Certain state-court judgments can be treated as final for jurisdictional purposes even though further proceedings are to take place in the state courts. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 477-483 (outlining four exceptions to the finality rule). In the tort action, the Washington Supreme Court resolved only a discovery dispute; it did not determine the litigation's final outcome. And the Cox exceptions do not apply to that action. Accordingly, this Court dismisses the writ of certiorari with respect to that action for want of jurisdiction. However, the PDA action falls squarely under the first Cox exception. The State Supreme Court's ruling that the 1995 amendment to  409 was invalid, which left four documents subject to disclosure under the PDA and only the amount of attorney's fees remaining to be decided on remand, is ""conclusive"" as to the federal issue and ""the outcome of further proceedings preordained,"" id., at 479. Pp. 140-143.

(a) Before addressing the constitutional question, this Court must determine  409's scope.

This Court agrees with the United States that  409 protects only information compiled or collected for  152 purposes, but does not protect information that was compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to  152, as held by agencies that compiled or collected that information, even if the information was at some point ""collected"" by another agency for  152 purposes. Although respondents offer the narrowest interpretation of  409-that  409 protects only materials actually created by the agency responsible for seeking  152 funding-their reading leaves the 1995 amendment (changing
