|543 u.s. 157|"COOPER INDUSTRIES, INC. v. AVIALL SERVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 021192.Argued October 6, 2004Decided December 13, 2004
The enabling clause of 113(f)(1) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as added by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), provides that any person may seek contribution from any other person liable or potentially liable under CERCLA 107(a) during or following any civil action under CERCLA 106 (which authorizes the Federal Government to compel responsible parties to clean up contaminated areas, see Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U. S. 809, 814), or CERCLA 107(a) (which empowers the Government to recover its response costs from potentially responsible persons (PRPs)).  Section 113(f)(1)s saving clause provides: Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under 106 or 107.  SARA also created a separate express right of contribution, 113(f)(3)(B), for [a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement.


Cooper Industries, Inc., owned four Texas properties until 1981, when it sold them to Aviall Services, Inc.  After operating those sites for several years, Aviall discovered that both it and Cooper had contaminated them when hazardous substances leaked into the ground and ground water.  Aviall notified the State of the contamination, but neither the State nor the Federal Government took judicial or administrative measures to compel cleanup.  Aviall cleaned up the properties under the States supervision and sold them to a third party, but remains contractually responsible for $5 million or more in cleanup costs.  Aviall filed this action against Cooper to recover such costs.  The original complaint asserted, inter alia, a claim for cost recovery under 107(a) and a separate claim for contribution under 113(f)(1).  Aviall later amended the complaint to, among other things, combine its two CERCLA claims into a single, joint claim that, pursuant to 113(f)(1), sought contribution from Cooper as a PRP under 107(a).  Granting Cooper summary judgment, the District Court held that Aviall had abandoned its freestanding 107 claim, and that contribution under 113(f)(1) was unavailable because Aviall had not been sued under 106 or 107.  The Fifth Circuit ultimately reversed, holding that 113(f)(1) allows a PRP to obtain contribution from other PRPs regardless of whether the PRP has been sued under 106 or 107.  The court reasoned in part that may in 113(f)(1)s enabling clause did not mean may only.
Held:A private party who has not been sued under CERCLA 106 or 107(a) may not obtain contribution under 113(f)(1) from other liable parties.  Pp.612.
(a)Section 113(f)(1) does not authorize Avialls suit.  This Court disagrees with Avialls argument that the word may in 113(f)(1)s enabling clause should be read permissively, such that during or following a civil action is one, but not the exclusive, instance in which a person may seek contribution.  First, the natural meaning of may in this context is that it authorizes certain contribution actions that satisfy the subsequent specified conditioni.e., those that occur during or following a specified civil actionand no others.  Second, reading 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions at any time, regardless of the existence of a 106 or 107(a) civil action, would render entirely superfluous the sections explicit during or following condition, as well as 113(f)(3)(B), which permits contribution actions after settlement.  This Court is loath to allow such a reading.  See, e.g., Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. ___, ___.  Congress would not have bothered to specify conditions under which a person may bring a contribution claim, and at the same time allowed contribution actions absent those conditions.  Section 113(f)(1)s saving clause does not change the Courts conclusion.  That clauses sole function is to clarify that 113(f)(1) does nothing to diminish any cause(s) of action for contribution that may exist independently of 113(f)(1), thereby rebutting any presumption that the express right of contribution provided by the enabling clause is the exclusive contribution cause of action available to a PRP.  The saving clause, however, does not itself establish a cause of action, nor expand 113(f)(1) to authorize contribution actions not brought during or following a 106 or 107(a) civil action, nor specify what causes of action for contribution, if any, exist outside 113(f)(1).  Reading the clause to authorize 113(f)(1) contribution actions not just during or following a civil action, but also before such an action, would again violate the settled rule that the Court must, if possible, construe a statute to give every word some operative effect.  In light of provisions specifying two 3-year limitations periods for contribution actions beginning at the date of judgment, 113(g)(3)(A), and at the date of settlement, 113(g)(3)(B), the absence of any such provision for cases in which a judgment or settlement never occurs also supports the conclusion that, to assert a contribution claim under 113(f), a party must satisfy the conditions of either 113(f)(1) or 113(f)(3)(B).  Given the clear meaning of CERCLAs text, there is no need to resolve the parties dispute about CERCLAs purpose or to consult that purpose at all.  See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79.  Because Aviall has never been subject to a civil action under 106 or 107(a), it has no 113(f)(1) claim.  Pp.69.


(b)The Court declines to address in the first instance Avialls claim that it may recover costs under 107(a)(4)(B) even though it is a PRP.  In view of the importance of the 107 issue, the question whether Aviall waived a freestanding 107 claim, and the absence of briefing and decisions by the courts below, this Court is not prepared to resolve the 107 question solely on the basis of dictum in Key Tronic.  Pp.911.


(c)In addition, the Court declines to decide whether Aviall has an implied right to contribution under 107.  To the extent that Aviall chooses to frame its 107 claim on remand as an implied right of contribution (as opposed to a right of cost recovery), the Court notes that it has visited the subject before, see, e.g., Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 638647, and that, in enacting 113(f)(1), Congress explicitly recognized a particular set (claims during or following the specified civil actions) of the contribution rights previously implied by courts from provisions of CERCLA and the common law, cf. Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 19.  Pp.1112.
312 F.3d 677, reversed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and OConnor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined.

|543 u.s. 194|"ROCHELLE BROSSEAU v. KENNETH J. HAUGEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031261.Decided December 13, 2004
Per Curiam.

Officer Rochelle Brosseau, a member of the Puyallup, Washington, Police Department, shot Kenneth Haugen in the back as he attempted to flee from law enforcement authorities in his vehicle.  Haugen subsequently filed this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington pursuant to Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S.C. 1983.  He alleged that the shot fired by Brosseau constituted excessive force and violated his federal constitutional rights.[Footnote 1]  The District Court granted summary judgment to Brosseau after finding she was entitled to qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  339 F.3d 857 (2003).  Following the two-step process set out in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194 (2001), the Court of Appeals found, first, that Brosseau had violated Haugens Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force and, second, that the right violated was clearly established and thus Brosseau was not entitled to qualified immunity.  Brosseau then petitioned for writ of certiorari, requesting that we review both of the Court of Appeals determinations.  We grant the petition on the second, qualified immunity question and reverse.


The material facts, construed in a light most favorable to Haugen, are as follows.[Footnote 2]  On the day before the fracas, Glen Tamburello went to the police station and reported to Brosseau that Haugen, a former crime partner of his, had stolen tools from his shop.  Brosseau later learned that there was a felony no-bail warrant out for Haugens arrest on drug and other offenses.  The next morning, Haugen was spray-painting his Jeep Cherokee in his mothers driveway.  Tamburello learned of Haugens whereabouts, and he and cohort Matt Atwood drove a pickup truck to Haugens mothers house to pay Haugen a visit.  A fight ensued, which was witnessed by a neighbor who called 911.


Brosseau heard a report that the men were fighting in Haugens mothers yard and responded.  When she arrived, Tamburello and Atwood were attempting to get Haugen into Tamburellos pickup.  Brosseaus arrival created a distraction, which provided Haugen the opportunity to get away.  Haugen ran through his mothers yard and hid in the neighborhood.  Brosseau requested assistance, and, shortly thereafter, two officers arrived with a K9 to help track Haugen down.  During the search, which lasted about 30 to 45 minutes, officers instructed Tamburello and Atwood to remain in Tamburellos pickup.  They instructed Deanna Nocera, Haugens girlfriend who was also present with her 3-year-old daughter, to remain in her small car with her daughter.  Tamburellos pickup was parked in the street in front of the driveway; Noceras small car was parked in the driveway in front of and facing the Jeep; and the Jeep was in the driveway facing Noceras car and angled somewhat to the left.  The Jeep was parked about 4 feet away from Noceras car and 20 to 30 feet away from Tamburellos pickup.


An officer radioed from down the street that a neighbor had seen a man in her backyard.  Brosseau ran in that direction, and Haugen appeared.  He ran past the front of his mothers house and then turned and ran into the driveway.  With Brosseau still in pursuit, he jumped into the drivers side of the Jeep and closed and locked the door.  Brosseau believed that he was running to the Jeep to retrieve a weapon.


Brosseau arrived at the Jeep, pointed her gun at Haugen, and ordered him to get out of the vehicle.  Haugen ignored her command and continued to look for the keys so he could get the Jeep started.  Brosseau repeated her commands and hit the drivers side window several times with her handgun, which failed to deter Haugen.  On the third or fourth try, the window shattered.  Brosseau unsuccessfully attempted to grab the keys and struck Haugen on the head with the barrel and butt of her gun.  Haugen, still undeterred, succeeded in starting the Jeep.  As the Jeep started or shortly after it began to move, Brosseau jumped back and to the left.  She fired one shot through the rear drivers side window at a forward angle, hitting Haugen in the back.  She later explained that she shot Haugen because she was fearful for the other officers on foot who [she] believed were in the immediate area, [and] for the occupied vehicles in [Haugens] path and for any other citizens who might be in the area.  339 F.3d, at 865.


Despite being hit, Haugen, in his words, st[ood] on the gas; navigated the small, tight space to avoid the other vehicles; swerved across the neighbors lawn; and continued down the street.  Id., at 882.  After about a half block, Haugen realized that he had been shot and brought the Jeep to a halt.  He suffered a collapsed lung and was airlifted to a hospital.  He survived the shooting and subsequently pleaded guilty to the felony of eluding.  Wash. Rev. Code 46.61.024 (1994).  By so pleading, he admitted that he drove his Jeep in a manner indicating a wanton or wilful disregard for the lives . . . of others.  Ibid.  He subsequently brought this 1983 action against Brosseau.
***
When confronted with a claim of qualified immunity, a court must ask first the following question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officers conduct violated a constitutional right?  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 201.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the constitutional question in this case is governed by the principles enunciated in Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989).  These cases establish that claims of excessive force are to be judged under the Fourth Amendments objective reasonableness standard.  Id., at 388.  Specifically with regard to deadly force, we explained in Garner that it is unreasonable for an officer to seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead.  471 U. S., at 11.  But [w]here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.  Ibid.


We express no view as to the correctness of the Court of Appeals decision on the constitutional question itself.  We believe that, however that question is decided, the Court of Appeals was wrong on the issue of qualified immunity.[Footnote 3]


Qualified immunity shields an officer from suit when she makes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 206 (qualified immunity operates to protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force).  Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.  If the law at that time did not clearly establish that the officers conduct would violate the Constitution, the officer should not be subject to liability or, indeed, even the burdens of litigation.


It is important to emphasize that this inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.  Id., at 201.  As we previously said in this very context:
[T]here is no doubt that Graham v. Connor, supra, clearly establishes the general proposition that use of force is contrary to the Fourth Amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness.  Yet that is not enough.  Rather, we emphasized in Anderson [v. Creighton,] that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  483 U. S. [635,] 640 [(1987)].  The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.  Id., at 201202.

The Court of Appeals acknowledged this statement of law, but then proceeded to find fair warning in the general tests set out in Graham and Garner.  339 F.3d, at 873874.  In so doing, it was mistaken.  Graham and Garner, following the lead of the Fourth Amendments text, are cast at a high level of generality.  See Graham v. Connor, supra, at 396 ([T]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application).  Of course, in an obvious case, these standards can clearly establish the answer, even without a body of relevant case law.  See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 738 (2002) (noting in a case where the Eighth Amendment violation was obvious that there need not be a materially similar case for the right to be clearly established).  See also Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 1283 (CA11 2002) (explaining in a Fourth Amendment case involving an officer shooting a fleeing suspect in a vehicle that, when we look at decisions such as Garner and Graham, we see some tests to guide us in determining the law in many different kinds of circumstances; but we do not see the kind of clear law (clear answers) that would apply to the situation at hand).  The present case is far from the obvious one where Graham and Garner alone offer a basis for decision.


We therefore turn to ask whether, at the time of Brosseaus actions, it was clearly established in this more particularized sense that she was violating Haugens Fourth Amendment right.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 202.  The parties point us to only a handful of cases relevant to the situation [Brosseau] confronted: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.[Footnote 4]  Ibid.  Specifically, Brosseau points us to Cole v. Bone, 993 F.2d 1328 (CA8 1993), and Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d 343 (CA6 1992).


In these cases, the courts found no Fourth Amendment violation when an officer shot a fleeing suspect who presented a risk to others.  Cole v. Bone, supra, at 1333 (holding the officer had probable cause to believe that the truck posed an imminent threat of serious physical harm to innocent motorists as well as to the officers themselves); Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d, at 347 (noting a car can be a deadly weapon and holding the officers decision to stop the car from possibly injuring others was reasonable).  Smith is closer to this case.  There, the officer and suspect engaged in a car chase, which appeared to be at an end when the officer cornered the suspect at the back of a dead-end residential street.  The suspect, however, freed his car and began speeding down the street.  At this point, the officer fired a shot, which killed the suspect.  The court held the officers decision was reasonable and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  It noted that the suspect, like Haugen here, had proven he would do almost anything to avoid capture and that he posed a major threat to, among others, the officers at the end of the street.  Ibid.


Haugen points us to Estate of Starks v. Enyart, 5 F.3d 230 (CA7 1993), where the court found summary judgment inappropriate on a Fourth Amendment claim involving a fleeing suspect.  There, the court concluded that the threat created by the fleeing suspects failure to brake when an officer suddenly stepped in front of his just-started car was not a sufficiently grave threat to justify the use of deadly force.  Id., at 234.


These three cases taken together undoubtedly show that this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case.  None of them squarely governs the case here; they do suggest that Brosseaus actions fell in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.  Saucier v. Katz, supra, at 206.  The cases by no means clearly establish that Brosseaus conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.


The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Haugen also asserted pendent state-law claims and claims against the city and police department.  These claims are not presently before us.
Because this case arises in the posture of a motion for summary judgment, we are required to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, Haugen.  See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001).
We have no occasion in this case to reconsider our instruction in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001), that lower courts decide the constitutional question prior to deciding the qualified immunity question.  We exercise our summary reversal procedure here simply to correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity standard.
The parties point us to a number of other cases in this vein that postdate the conduct in question, i.e., Brosseaus February 21, 1999, shooting of Haugen.  See Cowan ex rel. Estate of Cooper v. Breen, 352 F.3d 756, 763 (CA2 2003); Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 12811282 (CA11 2002); Scott v. Clay County, Tennessee, 205 F.3d 867, 877 (CA6 2000); McCaslin v. Wilkins, 183 F.3d 775, 778779 (CA8 1999); Abraham v. Raso, 183 F.3d 279, 288296 (CA3 1999).  These decisions, of course, could not have given fair notice to Brosseau and are of no use in the clearly established inquiry.

Brosseau requested assistance, and, shortly thereafter, two officers arrived with a K9 to help track Haugen down.  During the search, which lasted about 30 to 45 minutes, officers instructed Tamburello and Atwood to remain in Tamburellos pickup.  They instructed Deanna Nocera, Haugens girlfriend who was also present with her 3-year-old daughter, to remain in her small car with her daughter.  Tamburellos pickup was parked in the street in front of the driveway; Noceras small car was parked in the driveway in front of and facing the Jeep; and the Jeep was in the driveway facing Noceras car and angled somewhat to the left.  The Jeep was parked about 4 feet away from Noceras car and 20 to 30 feet away from Tamburellos pickup.


An officer radioed from down the street that a neighbor had seen a man in her backyard.  Brosseau ran in that direction, and Haugen appeared.  He ran past the front of his mothers house and then turned and ran into the driveway.  With Brosseau still in pursuit, he jumped into the drivers side of the Jeep and closed and locked the door.  Brosseau believed that he was running to the Jeep to retrieve a weapon.


Brosseau arrived at the Jeep, pointed her gun at Haugen, and ordered him to get out of the vehicle.  Haugen ignored her command and continued to look for the keys so he could get the Jeep started.  Brosseau repeated her commands and hit the drivers side window several times with her handgun, which failed to deter Haugen.  On the third or fourth try, the window shattered.  Brosseau unsuccessfully attempted to grab the keys and struck Haugen on the head with the barrel and butt of her gun.  Haugen, still undeterred, succeeded in starting the Jeep.  As the Jeep started or shortly after it began to move, Brosseau jumped back and to the left.  She fired one shot through the rear drivers side window at a forward angle, hitting Haugen in the back.  She later explained that she shot Haugen because she was fearful for the other officers on foot who [she] believed were in the immediate area, [and] for the occupied vehicles in [Haugens] path and for any other citizens who might be in the area.  339 F.3d, at 865.


Despite being hit, Haugen, in his words, st[ood] on the gas; navigated the small, tight space to avoid the other vehicles; swerved across the neighbors lawn; and continued down the street.  Id., at 882.  After about a half block, Haugen realized that he had been shot and brought the Jeep to a halt.  He suffered a collapsed lung and was airlifted to a hospital.  He survived the shooting and subsequently pleaded guilty to the felony of eluding.  Wash. Rev. Code 46.61.024 (1994).  By so pleading, he admitted that he drove his Jeep in a manner indicating a wanton or wilful disregard for the lives . . . of others.  Ibid.  He subsequently brought this 1983 action against Brosseau.
***
When confronted with a claim of qualified immunity, a court must ask first the following question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officers conduct violated a constitutional right?  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 201.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the constitutional question in this case is governed by the principles enunciated in Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 (1989).  These cases establish that claims of excessive force are to be judged under the Fourth Amendments objective reasonableness standard.  Id., at 388.  Specifically with regard to deadly force, we explained in Garner that it is unreasonable for an officer to seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead.  471 U. S., at 11.  But [w]here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.  Ibid.


We express no view as to the correctness of the Court of Appeals decision on the constitutional question itself.  We believe that, however that question is decided, the Court of Appeals was wrong on the issue of qualified immunity.[Footnote 3]


Qualified immunity shields an officer from suit when she makes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 206 (qualified immunity operates to protect officers from the sometimes hazy border between excessive and acceptable force).  Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.  If the law at that time did not clearly establish that the officers conduct would violate the Constitution, the officer should not be subject to liability or, indeed, even the burdens of litigation.


It is important to emphasize that this inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.  Id., at 201.  As we previously said in this very context:
[T]here is no doubt that Graham v. Connor, supra, clearly establishes the general proposition that use of force is contrary to the Fourth Amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness.  Yet that is not enough.  Rather, we emphasized in Anderson [v. Creighton,] that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.  483 U. S. [635,] 640 [(1987)].  The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.  Id., at 201202.

The Court of Appeals acknowledged this statement of law, but then proceeded to find fair warning in the general tests set out in Graham and Garner.  339 F.3d, at 873874.  In so doing, it was mistaken.  Graham and Garner, following the lead of the Fourth Amendments text, are cast at a high level of generality.  See Graham v. Connor, supra, at 396 ([T]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application).  Of course, in an obvious case, these standards can clearly establish the answer, even without a body of relevant case law.  See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 738 (2002) (noting in a case where the Eighth Amendment violation was obvious that there need not be a materially similar case for the right to be clearly established).  See also Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 1283 (CA11 2002) (explaining in a Fourth Amendment case involving an officer shooting a fleeing suspect in a vehicle that, when we look at decisions such as Garner and Graham, we see some tests to guide us in determining the law in many different kinds of circumstances; but we do not see the kind of clear law (clear answers) that would apply to the situation at hand).  The present case is far from the obvious one where Graham and Garner alone offer a basis for decision.


We therefore turn to ask whether, at the time of Brosseaus actions, it was clearly established in this more particularized sense that she was violating Haugens Fourth Amendment right.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 202.  The parties point us to only a handful of cases relevant to the situation [Brosseau] confronted: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.[Footnote 4]  Ibid.  Specifically, Brosseau points us to Cole v. Bone, 993 F.2d 1328 (CA8 1993), and Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d 343 (CA6 1992).


In these cases, the courts found no Fourth Amendment violation when an officer shot a fleeing suspect who presented a risk to others.  Cole v. Bone, supra, at 1333 (holding the officer had probable cause to believe that the truck posed an imminent threat of serious physical harm to innocent motorists as well as to the officers themselves); Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d, at 347 (noting a car can be a deadly weapon and holding the officers decision to stop the car from possibly injuring others was reasonable).  Smith is closer to this case.  There, the officer and suspect engaged in a car chase, which appeared to be at an end when the officer cornered the suspect at the back of a dead-end residential street.  The suspect, however, freed his car and began speeding down the street.  At this point, the officer fired a shot, which killed the suspect.  The court held the officers decision was reasonable and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  It noted that the suspect, like Haugen here, had proven he would do almost anything to avoid capture and that he posed a major threat to, among others, the officers at the end of the street.  Ibid.


Haugen points us to Estate of Starks v. Enyart, 5 F.3d 230 (CA7 1993), where the court found summary judgment inappropriate on a Fourth Amendment claim involving a fleeing suspect.  There, the court concluded that the threat created by the fleeing suspects failure to brake when an officer suddenly stepped in front of his just-started car was not a sufficiently grave threat to justify the use of deadly force.  Id., at 234.


These three cases taken together undoubtedly show that this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case.  None of them squarely governs the case here; they do suggest that Brosseaus actions fell in the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.  Saucier v. Katz, supra, at 206.  The cases by no means clearly establish that Brosseaus conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.


The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Haugen also asserted pendent state-law claims and claims against the city and police department.  These claims are not presently before us.
Because this case arises in the posture of a motion for summary judgment, we are required to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, Haugen.  See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001).
We have no occasion in this case to reconsider our instruction in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001), that lower courts decide the constitutional question prior to deciding the qualified immunity question.  We exercise our summary reversal procedure here simply to correct a clear misapprehension of the qualified immunity standard.
The parties point us to a number of other cases in this vein that postdate the conduct in question, i.e., Brosseaus February 21, 1999, shooting of Haugen.  See Cowan ex rel. Estate of Cooper v. Breen, 352 F.3d 756, 763 (CA2 2003); Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 12811282 (CA11 2002); Scott v. Clay County, Tennessee, 205 F.3d 867, 877 (CA6 2000); McCaslin v. Wilkins, 183 F.3d 775, 778779 (CA8 1999); Abraham v. Raso, 183 F.3d 279, 288296 (CA3 1999).  These decisions, of course, could not have given fair notice to Brosseau and are of no use in the clearly established inquiry."|

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 03407.Argued October 4, 2004Decided December 13, 2004
After Michigans Constitution was amended to require that an appeal by an accused pleading guilty or nolo contendere be by leave of the court, several state judges denied appointed appellate counsel to indigents pleading guilty, and the Michigan Legislature subsequently codified this practice.  The two attorney respondents joined three indigent criminal defendants in filing suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the practice denies indigents their federal due process and equal protection rights.  The District Court held the practice and statute unconstitutional, but a Sixth Circuit panel reversed, holding that Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, abstention barred the indigents suit, but that the attorneys had third-party standing to assert the indigents rights; and that the statute was constitutional.  On rehearing, the en banc Sixth Circuit agreed on standing but found the statute unconstitutional.
Held:The attorneys lack third-party standing to assert the rights of Michigan indigent defendants denied appellate counsel.  The Court assumes that the attorneys have satisfied Article IIIs standing requirement and thus addresses only whether they have standing to raise the rights of others.  In deciding whether to grant third-party standing, this Court asks whether the party asserting the right has a close relationship with the person who possesses the right, and whether there is a hindrance to the possessors ability to protect his own interests.  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 411.  The attorneys here claim standing based on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants who will request, but be denied, appellate counsel under the statute.  In two cases in which this Court found an attorney-client relationship sufficient to confer third-party standingCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, and Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U. S. 715the attorneys invoked known clients rights, not those of the hypothetical clients asserted here.  And Department of Labor v. Triplettin which an attorney disciplined by his state bar for accepting a fee prohibited by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 was held to have third-party standing to invoke claimants due process rights to challenge the fee restriction that resulted in his punishmentfalls within the class of cases allowing standing to litigate the rights of third parties when enforc[ing] the challenged restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties rights,  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 510.  The attorneys here do not have a close relationship with their alleged clients; indeed, they have no relationship at all.   Nor have they demonstrated any hindrance to the indigents advancing their own constitutional rights against the Michigan scheme.  An indigent may seek leave to challenge the denial of appellate counsel in state court and then may seek a writ of certiorari in this Court; and both state and federal collateral review exist beyond that.  The attorneys hypothesis that, without counsel, such avenues are effectively foreclosed was disproved in the Michigan courts and this Court, where pro se indigents have pursued them.  On a more fundamental level, if an attorney is all that the indigents need to perfect their challenge in state court and beyond, one wonders why these attorneys did not attend state court and assist them.  The fair inference is that they did not want the state process to take its course, but wanted a federal court to short-circuit the States adjudication of the constitutional question.  Here, the indigents were appropriately dismissed under Younger because they had ample opportunities to raise their constitutional challenge in their ongoing state proceedings.  An unwillingness to allow the Younger principle to be thus circumvented is an additional reason to deny the attorneys third-party standing.  Pp.28.

No. 03710.Argued November 8, 2004Decided December 13, 2004
Believing that respondent was impersonating a police officer, petitioner Haner, a Washington State Patrol officer, pursued and pulled over respondents vehicle.  While questioning respondent at the scene, petitioner Devenpeck, Haners supervisor, discovered that respondent was taping their conversation and arrested him for violating the States Privacy Act.  The state trial court subsequently dismissed the charge.  Respondent then filed this suit in federal court, claiming, among other things, that his arrest violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied petitioners qualified immunity, and the case went to trial.  The jury was instructed, inter alia, that respondent had to establish lack of probable cause to arrest, and that taping police at a traffic stop was not a crime in Washington.  The jury found for petitioners.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, based in part on its conclusion that petitioners could not have had probable cause to arrest.  It rejected petitioners claim that there was probable cause to arrest for impersonating and for obstructing a law enforcement officer, because those offenses were not closely related to the offense invoked by Devenpeck at the time of arrest.
Held: 
1.A warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment if, given the facts known to the officer, there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is being committed.  The Ninth Circuits additional limitationthat the offense establishing probable cause must be closely related to, and based on the same conduct as, the offense the arresting officer identifies at the time of arrestis inconsistent with this Courts precedent, which holds that an arresting officers state of mind (except for facts that he knows) is irrelevant to probable cause, see Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 812815.  The closely related offense rule is also condemned by its perverse consequences: it will not eliminate sham arrests but will cause officers to cease providing reasons for arrest, or to cite every class of offense for which probable cause could conceivably exist.

|543 u.s. 175|"FLORIDA v. NIXON
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 03931.Argued November 2, 2004Decided December 13, 2004
Respondent Nixon was arrested for a brutal murder.  Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped and killed his victim.  After gathering overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the State indicted Nixon for first-degree murder and related crimes.  Assistant public defender Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, filed a plea of not guilty and deposed all of the States potential witnesses.  Satisfied that Nixons guilt was not subject to reasonable dispute, Corin commenced plea negotiations, but the prosecutors refused to recommend a sentence other than death.  Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, and a strong case for the prosecution, Corin concluded that his best course would be to concede Nixons guilt, thereby preserving credibility for penalty phase evidence of Nixon's mental instability, and for defense pleas to spare Nixons life.  Corin several times attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon, but Nixon remained unresponsive, never verbally approving or protesting the proposed strategy.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case.


When trial began, Nixon engaged in disruptive behavior and absented himself from most of the proceedings.  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixons guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.  During the States case in chief, Corin objected to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, cross-examined witnesses for clarification, and contested several aspects of the jury instructions.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, declaring that he hoped to persuade the jury during the penalty phase that Nixon should not be sentenced to death.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.  At the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Nixon was not an intact human being and had committed the murder while afflicted with multiple mental disabilities.  Corin called as witnesses relatives and friends who described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior preceding the murder.  Corin also presented expert testimony concerning Nixons antisocial personality, history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, low IQ, and possible brain damage.  In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixons youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jurys discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances; urged that, if not sentenced to death, Nixon would never be released; maintained that the death penalty was not appropriate for a person with Nixons impairments; and asked the jury to spare Nixons life.  The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, the death penalty.  


The Florida Supreme Court ultimately reversed, holding that a defense attorneys concession that his client committed murder, made without the defendants express consent, automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial under the standard announced in United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.648.  Corins concession, according to that court, was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea in that it allowed the prosecutions guilt-phase case to proceed essentially without opposition.  Under Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242243, consent to a guilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; similarly, the Florida court stated, a concession of guilt at trial requires a defendants affirmative, explicit acceptance, without which counsels performance is presumably inadequate.  While acknowledging that Nixon was very disruptive and uncooperative at trial and that Corins strategy may have been in Nixons best interest, the court nevertheless declared that silent acquiescence is not enough: Counsel conceding a defendants guilt is inevitably ineffective if the defendant does not expressly approve counsels course.
Held:Counsels failure to obtain the defendants express consent to a strategy of conceding guilt in a capital trial does not automatically render counsels performance deficient.  Pp.1016.
(a)The Florida Supreme Court erred in requiring Nixons affirmative, explicit acceptance of Corins strategy because it mistakenly deemed Corins statements to the jury the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  Despite Corins concession of Nixons guilt, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. id., at 242243, and n.4.  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  Futhermore, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.  Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.  Pp.1012.


(b)Counsels effectiveness should not be evaluated under the Cronic standard, but under the standard prescribed in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 688: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that Cronic reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the clients advocate, 466 U. S., at 659.  Corins concession of Nixons guilt does not rank as such a failure.  Id., at 666.  Although a concession of guilt in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies:Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  Mounting a defendant did not commit the crime defense risks destroying counsels penalty phase credibility and may incline the jury against leniency for the defendant.  In a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.  Pp.1216.

			"|"FLORIDA v. NIXON
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 03931.Argued November 2, 2004Decided December 13, 2004
Respondent Nixon was arrested for a brutal murder.  Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped and killed his victim.  After gathering overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the State indicted Nixon for first-degree murder and related crimes.  Assistant public defender Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, filed a plea of not guilty and deposed all of the States potential witnesses.  Satisfied that Nixons guilt was not subject to reasonable dispute, Corin commenced plea negotiations, but the prosecutors refused to recommend a sentence other than death.  Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, and a strong case for the prosecution, Corin concluded that his best course would be to concede Nixons guilt, thereby preserving credibility for penalty phase evidence of Nixon's mental instability, and for defense pleas to spare Nixons life.  Corin several times attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon, but Nixon remained unresponsive, never verbally approving or protesting the proposed strategy.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case.


When trial began, Nixon engaged in disruptive behavior and absented himself from most of the proceedings.  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixons guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.  During the States case in chief, Corin objected to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, cross-examined witnesses for clarification, and contested several aspects of the jury instructions.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixons guilt, declaring that he hoped to persuade the jury during the penalty phase that Nixon should not be sentenced to death.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.  At the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Nixon was not an intact human being and had committed the murder while afflicted with multiple mental disabilities.  Corin called as witnesses relatives and friends who described Nixons childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior preceding the murder.  Corin also presented expert testimony concerning Nixons antisocial personality, history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, low IQ, and possible brain damage.  In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixons youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jurys discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances; urged that, if not sentenced to death, Nixon would never be released; maintained that the death penalty was not appropriate for a person with Nixons impairments; and asked the jury to spare Nixons life.  The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, the death penalty.  


The Florida Supreme Court ultimately reversed, holding that a defense attorneys concession that his client committed murder, made without the defendants express consent, automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial under the standard announced in United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.648.  Corins concession, according to that court, was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea in that it allowed the prosecutions guilt-phase case to proceed essentially without opposition.  Under Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242243, consent to a guilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; similarly, the Florida court stated, a concession of guilt at trial requires a defendants affirmative, explicit acceptance, without which counsels performance is presumably inadequate.  While acknowledging that Nixon was very disruptive and uncooperative at trial and that Corins strategy may have been in Nixons best interest, the court nevertheless declared that silent acquiescence is not enough: Counsel conceding a defendants guilt is inevitably ineffective if the defendant does not expressly approve counsels course.
Held:Counsels failure to obtain the defendants express consent to a strategy of conceding guilt in a capital trial does not automatically render counsels performance deficient.  Pp.1016.
(a)The Florida Supreme Court erred in requiring Nixons affirmative, explicit acceptance of Corins strategy because it mistakenly deemed Corins statements to the jury the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  Despite Corins concession of Nixons guilt, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. id., at 242243, and n.4.  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  Futhermore, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendants right to appeal.  Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  Nixons characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him did not suffice to render unreasonable Corins decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.  Pp.1012.


(b)Counsels effectiveness should not be evaluated under the Cronic standard, but under the standard prescribed in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 688: Did counsels representation f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness?  The Florida Supreme Courts erroneous equation of Corins concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that Cronic reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the clients advocate, 466 U. S., at 659.  Corins concession of Nixons guilt does not rank as such a failure.  Id., at 666.  Although a concession of guilt in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceedings two-phase structure vitally affect counsels strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies:Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trials penalty phase, at which time counsels mission is to persuade the trier that his clients life should be spared.  Defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  Mounting a defendant did not commit the crime defense risks destroying counsels penalty phase credibility and may incline the jury against leniency for the defendant.  In a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendants best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsels strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendants explicit consent.  Instead, if counsels strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendants guilt, satisfies the Strickland standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

|543 u.s. 111|"KP PERMANENT MAKE-UP, INC. v. LASTING 
IMPRESSION I, INC., et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03409.Argued October 5, 2004Decided December 8, 2004
Petitioner KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc., and respondents (collectively Lasting) all use the term micro color (as one word or two, singular or plural) in marketing permanent cosmetic makeup.  The Court accepts KPs claim that it has used the single-word version since 1990 or 1991.  In 1992, Lasting registered a trademark that included the words Micro Colors under 15 U. S.C. 1051,  and, in 1999, the registration became incontestable, 1065.  When Lasting demanded that KP stop using the word microcolor, KP sued for declaratory relief.  Lasting counterclaimed, alleging, inter alia, that KP had infringed Lastings trademark.  KP responded by asserting the statutory affirmative defense of fair use, 1115(b)(4).  Finding that Lasting conceded that KP used microcolor only to describe its goods and not as a mark, the District Court held that KP was acting fairly and in good faith because KP undisputedly had employed the term continuously from before Lasting adopted its mark.  Without enquiring whether the practice was likely to cause consumer confusion, the court concluded that KP had made out its affirmative defense under 1115(b)(4) and entered summary judgment for KP on Lastings infringement claim.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court erred in addressing the fair use defense without delving into the matter of possible consumer confusion about the origin of KPs goods.  The court did not pointedly address the burden of proof, but appears to have placed it on KP to show the absence of such confusion. 
Held:A party raising the statutory affirmative defense of fair use to a claim of trademark infringement does not have a burden to negate any likelihood that the practice complained of will confuse consumers about the origin of the goods or services affected.  Pp.412.
(a)Although 1115(b) makes an incontestable registration conclusive evidence  of the registrants exclusive right to use the  mark, it also subjects a plaintiffs success to proof of infringement as defined in section 1114.  Section 1114(1) in turn requires a showing that the defendants actual practice is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question, see, e.g., Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 780.  Thus, a plaintiff claiming infringement of an incontestable mark must show likelihood of consumer confusion as part of the prima facie case.  This plaintiffs burden must be kept in mind when reading 1115(b)(4), which provides the fair use defense to a party whose use of the  term  charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark,  of a term  which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services.  It is evident (1) that 1115(b) places a burden of proving likelihood of confusion (that is, infringement) on the party charging infringement even when relying on an incontestable registration, and (2) that Congress said nothing about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements of the fair use defense in 1115(b)(4).  It therefore takes a long stretch to claim that a fair use defense entails any burden to negate confusion.  It is not plausible that Congress would have used 1114s phrase likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive to describe the requirement that a markholder show likelihood of consumer confusion, but would have relied on 1115(b)(4)s phrase used fairly to give a defendant the burden to negate confusion.  See, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23.  Congresss failure to say anything about a defendants burden on this point was almost certainly not an oversight, since the House Trademarks Subcommittee refused to forward a proposal expressly providing likelihood to deceive the public as an element of the fair use defense.  Lasting argues unpersuasively that used fairly in 1115(b)(4) is an oblique incorporation of a likelihood-of-confusion test developed in the common law of unfair competition.  While cases such as Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 221 U. S. 580, are consistent with taking account of the likelihood of consumer confusion as one consideration in deciding whether a use is fair, they cannot be read to make an assessment of confusion alone dispositive or provide that the defense has a burden to negate it entirely.  Finally, a look at the typical course of litigation in an infringement action points up the incoherence of placing a burden to show nonconfusion on a defendant.  If a plaintiff succeeds in making out a prima facie case, including the element of likelihood of confusion, the defendant may offer rebutting evidence to undercut the force of the plaintiffs evidence on this element, or raise an affirmative defense to bar relief even if the prima facie case is sound, or do both.  It would make no sense to give the defendant a defense of showing affirmatively that the plaintiff cannot succeed in proving some element (like confusion); all the defendant needs to do is to leave the factfinder unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point.  Nor would it make sense to provide an affirmative defense of no confusion plus good faith, when merely rebutting the plaintiffs case on confusion would entitle the defendant to judgment, good faith or not.  Pp.49.


(b)Since the burden of proving likelihood of confusion rests with the plaintiff, and the fair use defendant has no free-standing need to show confusion unlikely, the Court recognizes (contrary to the Ninth Circuits view) that some possibility of consumer confusion is compatible with fair use.  It would be improvident to go further here, for deciding anything more would take the Court beyond the Ninth Circuits consideration of the subject.  Because the Court does not rule out the pertinence of the degree of consumer confusion under the fair use defense, it does not pass upon the Governments position that 1115(b)(4)s used fairly requirement demands only that the descriptive term describe the goods accurately.  Accuracy has to be a consideration in assessing fair use, but the proceedings below have raised no occasion to evaluate other concerns that courts might pick as relevante.g., commercial justification and the strength of the plaintiffs markas to which the door is not closed.  Pp.911.


(c)This Court reads the Ninth Circuit as erroneously requiring KP to shoulder a burden on the confusion issue.  P.11.

|543 u.s. 77|"CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA etal. 
v. JOHN ROE
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031669.Decided December 6, 2004
Per Curiam.

The city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer, respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity.  The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts.  Respondent brought suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of California granted summary judgment to the City.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.


The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
I

Respondent John Roe, a San Diego police officer, made a video showing himself stripping off a police uniform and masturbating.  He sold the video on the adults-only section of eBay, the popular online auction site.  His user name was Codestud3@aol.com, a word play on a high priority police radio call.  356 F.3d 1108, 1110 (CA9 2004).  The uniform apparently was not the specific uniform worn by the San Diego police, but it was clearly identifiable as a police uniform.  Roe also sold custom videos, as well as police equipment, including official uniforms of the San Diego Police Department (SDPD), and various other items such as mens underwear.  Roes eBay user profile identified him as employed in the field of law enforcement.
Roes supervisor, a police sergeant, discovered Roes activities when, while on eBay, he came across an official SDPD police uniform for sale offered by an individual with the username Codestud3@aol.com.  He searched for other items Codestud3 offered and discovered listings for Roes videos depicting the objectionable material.  Recognizing Roes picture, the sergeant printed images of certain of Roes offerings and shared them with others in Roes chain of command, including a police captain.  The captain notified the SDPDs internal affairs department, which began an investigation.  In response to a request by an undercover officer, Roe produced a custom video.  It showed Roe, again in police uniform, issuing a traffic citation but revoking it after undoing the uniform and masturbating.


The investigation revealed that Roes conduct violated specific SDPD policies, including conduct unbecoming of an officer, outside employment, and immoral conduct.  When confronted, Roe admitted to selling the videos and police paraphernalia.  The SDPD ordered Roe to cease displaying, manufacturing, distributing or selling any sexually explicit materials or engaging in any similar behaviors, via the internet, U. S. Mail, commercial vendors or distributors, or any other medium available to the public.  356 F.3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although Roe removed some of the items he had offered for sale, he did not change his sellers profile, which described the first two videos he had produced and listed their prices as well as the prices for custom videos.  After discovering Roes failure to follow its orders, the SDPDciting Roe for the added violation of disobedience of lawful ordersbegan termination proceedings.  The proceedings resulted in Roes dismissal from the police force.


Roe brought suit in the District Court pursuant to Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the employment termination violated his First Amendment right to free speech.  In granting summary judgment to the City, the District Court decided that Roe had not demonstrated that selling official police uniforms and producing, marketing, and selling sexually explicit videos for profit qualified as expression relating to a matter of public concern under this Courts decision in Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983).


In reversing, the Court of Appeals held Roes conduct fell within the protected category of citizen commentary on matters of public concern.  Central to the Court of Appeals conclusion was that Roes expression was not an internal workplace grievance, took place while he was off-duty and away from his employers premises, and was unrelated to his employment.  356 F.3d, at 1110, 11131114.
II

A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment.  See, e.g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605606 (1967).  On the other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public.  The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment.  See Connick, supra; Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968). Outside of this category, the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent some governmental justification far stronger than mere speculation in regulating it.  United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 465, 475 (1995) (NTEU).  We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases.
A

In concluding that Roes activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Courts decision in NTEU.  356 F.3d, at 1117.  In NTEU it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer.  The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees.  The Court held that, within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations.  The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities.  The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art, NTEU, supra, at 465, and observed that none of the speech at issue even arguably [had] any adverse impact on the employer.  Ibid.
The Court of Appeals reliance on NTEU was seriously misplaced.  Although Roes activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech.  Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a way injurious to his employer.  The use of the uniform, the law enforcement reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as in the field of law enforcement, and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute.  356 F.3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).


The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roes activities were unrelated to his employment.  Id., at 1112, n. 4.  In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper interpretation of the Citys statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roes speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD.  It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD.  On that score the Citys consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force. The present case falls outside the protection afforded in NTEU.  The authorities that instead control, and which are considered below, are this Courts decisions in Pickering, supra, Connick, supra, and the decisions which follow them.
B

To reconcile the employees right to engage in speech and the government employers right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission, the Pickering Court adopted a balancing test.  It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employees speech to balance the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.  391 U. S., at 568; see also Connick, supra, at 142.
Underlying the decision in Pickering is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public.  Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues.  See 391 U. S., at 572.  The interest at stake is as much the publics interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employees own right to disseminate it.


Pickering did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing.  To require Pickering balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could compromise the proper functioning of government offices.  See Connick, 461 U. S., at 143. This concern prompted the Court in Connick to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in Pickering itself) that in order to merit Pickering balancing, a public employees speech must touch on a matter of public concern.  461 U. S., at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).


In Connick, an assistant district attorney, unhappy with her supervisors decision to transfer her to another division, circulated an intraoffice questionnaire.  The document solicited her co-workers views on, inter alia, office transfer policy, office morale, the need for grievance committees, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns.  See id., at 141.


Finding thatwith the exception of the final questionthe questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances, the Court held no Pickering balancing was required.  461 U. S., at 141. To conclude otherwise would ignore the common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.  Id., at 143.  Connick held that a public employees speech is entitled to Pickering balancing only when the employee speaks as a citizen upon matters of public concern rather than as an employee upon matters only of personal interest.  461 U. S., at 147.


Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well-defined, Connick provides some guidance.  It directs courts to examine the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record in assessing whether an employees speech addresses a matter of public concern.  Id., at 146147.  In addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present.  Id., at 143, n. 5.  That standard is established by our decisions in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975), and Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 387388 (1967).  These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication.  The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to Pickering balancing.  See Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378 (1987).


Applying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding that Roes expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test.  He fails the threshold test and Pickering balancing does not come into play.


Connick is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in Connick from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern.  The dissent in Connick would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee discussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which . . . an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his responsibilities.  461 U. S., at 163 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  No similar purpose could be attributed to the employees speech in the present case.  Roes activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPDs functioning or operation.  Nor were Roes activities anything like the private remarks at issue in Rankin, where one co-worker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news.  Roes expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employers image.


The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer.  There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Courts cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees.


The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

|543 u.s. 50|"KOONS BUICK PONTIAC GMC, INC. v. NIGH
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 03377.Argued October 5, 2004Decided November 30, 2004
As enacted in 1968, the Truth in Lending Acts (TILA) civil-liability provision, 15 U. S.C. 1640, authorized statutory damages for violations of TILA prescriptions governing consumer loans as follows:(a) [A]ny creditor who fails in connection with any consumer credit transaction to disclose to any person any information required  is liable to that person in an amount  of  (1) twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000.  In 1974, Congress added a new paragraph (1) to 1640(a) to allow for the recovery of actual damages and to provide separate statutory damages for class actions.  Congress simultaneously amended the original statutory damages provision to limit it to individual actions, moved that provision from 1640(a)(1) to 1640(a)(2)(A), and retained the $100/$1,000 minimum and maximum recoveries.  Congress accounted for the statutes restructuring by changing the phrase under this paragraph to under this subparagraph.  A 1976 amendment redesignated 1640(a)(2)(A)s statutory damages provision as 1640(a)(2)(A)(i), inserted a new clause (ii) setting statutory damages for individual actions relating to consumer leases, and retained the $100/$1,000 brackets on recovery.  Following the latter amendment, the lower federal courts consistently held that the $100/$1,000 brackets remained applicable to all consumer financing transactions, whether lease or loan.  Finally, in 1995, Congress added a new clause (iii) at the end of 1640(a)(2)(A), so that the statute now authorizes statutory damages equal to (i) in the case of an individual action twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with the transaction, (ii) in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease  25 per centum of the total amount of monthly payments under the lease, except that the liability under this subparagraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000, or (iii) in the case of an individual action relating to a credit transaction not under an open end credit plan that is secured by real property or a dwelling, not less than $200 or greater than $2,000.


Respondent Nigh attempted to purchase a used truck from petitioner Koons Buick Pontiac GMC.  Unable to find a lender to complete the financing, Koons Buick twice revised the retail installment sales contract presented to Nigh.  After signing the third contract, Nigh discovered that the second contract had contained an improperly documented charge for a car alarm that Nigh never requested, agreed to accept, or received.  Nigh made no payments on the truck and returned it to Koons Buick.  He then filed suit against Koons Buick alleging, among other things, a TILA violation and seeking uncapped recovery of twice the finance charge, $24,192.80, under clause (i) of 1640(a)(2)(A).  The District Court held that damages were not capped at $1,000, and the jury awarded Nigh the full uncapped amount.  In affirming, the Fourth Circuit held that the 1995 amendment not only raised the statutory damages recoverable for TILA violations involving real-property-secured closed-end loans, it also removed the $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by personal property.  The Court of Appeals held that its previous view that the $1,000 cap applied to both clauses (i) and (ii) of 1640(a)(2)(A) was rendered defunct when Congress struck the or preceding clause (ii) and inserted clause (iii) after the under this subparagraph phrase.  According to the court, the inclusion of the new $200/$2,000 brackets in clause (iii) shows that the clause (ii) $100/$1,000 brackets can no longer be interpreted to apply to all of subparagraph (A), but must now apply solely to clause (ii), so as not to render meaningless the new minimum and maximum recoveries articulated in clause (iii).  The court therefore allowed Nigh to recover the full uncapped amount of $24,192.80.
Held:The 1995 amendment left unaltered the $100/$1,000 limits prescribed from the start for TILA violations involving personal-property loans.  Both the conventional meaning of subparagraph and standard interpretive guides point to the same conclusion:The $1,000 cap applies to recoveries under clause (i).  Congress ordinarily adheres to a hierarchical scheme in subdividing statutory sections.  Under that scheme, the word subparagraph is used to refer to a subdivision preceded by a capital letter and the word clause to a subdivision preceded by a lower case Roman numeral.  Congress followed this scheme in drafting TILA.  For example, 1640(a)(2)(B), which covers statutory damages in TILA class actions, states: [T]he total recovery under this subparagraph  shall not be more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the creditor .  (Emphasis added.)  Had Congress meant to repeal the longstanding $100/$1,000 limitation on 1640(a)(2)(A)(i), thereby confining the $100/$1,000 limitation solely to clause (ii), Congress likely would have stated in clause (ii): liability under this clause.  The statutory history resolves any ambiguity whether the $100/$1,000 brackets apply to recoveries under clause (i).  Before 1995, clauses (i) and (ii) set statutory damages for the entire realm of TILA-regulated consumer credit transactions.  Closed-end mortgages were encompassed by clause (i).  The addition of clause (iii) makes closed-end mortgages subject to a higher floor and ceiling, but clause (iii) contains no other measure of damages.  Clause (i)s specification of statutory damages of twice the finance charge continues to apply to loans secured by real property as it does to loans secured by personal property.  Clause (iii) removes closed-end mortgages from clause (i)s governance only to the extent that clause (iii) prescribes higher brackets.  There is scant indication that Congress meant to alter the meaning of clause (i) when it added clause (iii).  Cf. Church of Scientology of Cal. v. IRS, 484 U. S. 9, 1718.  The history demonstrates that, by adding clause (iii), Congress sought to provide increased recovery when a TILA violation occurs in the context of a loan secured by real property.  It would be passing strange to read the statute to cap recovery in connection with a closed-end, real-property-secured loan at an amount substantially lower than the recovery available when a violation occurs in the context of a personal-property-secured loan or an open-end, real-property-secured loan.  The text does not dictate this result; the statutory history suggests otherwise; and there is scant indication Congress meant to change the well-established meaning of clause (i).  Pp.813.

|543 u.s. 37|"LaROYCE LATHAIR SMITH v. TEXAS
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas
No. 045323.Decided November 15, 2004
Per Curiam.

Petitioner LaRoyce Lathair Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death by a jury in Dallas County, Texas.  Before the jury reached its sentence, the trial judge issued a supplemental nullification instruction.  Ex parte Smith, 132 S.W. 3d 407, 409 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  That instruction directed the jury to give effect to mitigation evidence, but allowed the jury to do so only by negating what would otherwise be affirmative responses to two special issues relating to deliberateness and future dangerousness.  In Penry v. Johnson, 532 U. S. 782 (2001) (Penry II), we held a similar nullification instruction constitutionally inadequate because it did not allow the jury to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances in choosing the defendants appropriate sentence.  Id., at 797 (quoting Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 381 (1993) (OConnor, J., dissenting)).  Despite our holding in Penry II, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected petitioners request for postconviction relief.  The court reasoned that the instruction either was irrelevant because petitioner did not proffer constitutionally significant mitigation evidence, or was sufficiently distinguishable from the instruction in Penry II to survive constitutional scrutiny.  132 S.W. 3d, at 413, n. 21.  We grant the petition for certiorari and petitioners motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.
I

In 1991, petitioner was convicted of brutally murdering one of his former co-workers at a Taco Bell in Dallas County.  The victim and one of her co-workers were closing down the restaurant when petitioner and several friends asked to be let in to use the telephone.  The two employees recognized petitioner and let him in.  Petitioner then told his former co-workers to leave because he wanted to rob the restaurant.  When they did not leave, petitioner killed one co-worker by pistol-whipping her and shooting her in the back.  Petitioner also threatened, but did not harm, his other former co-worker before exiting with his friends.  The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
At the punishment phase, the jury was instructed on two special issues: first, whether the killing was deliberate; and second, whether the defendant posed a continuing danger to others.[Footnote 1]  Approximately two years prior to the trial, we had held that presenting only these two special issues, without additional instructions regarding the jurys duty to consider mitigation evidence, violated the Eighth Amendment.  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 328 (1989) (Penry I).  Shortly after petitioners trial, the Texas Legislature amended its capital sentencing scheme to require juries to take into consideration all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendants character and background, and the personal moral culpability of the defendant in deciding whether there are sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence.  Penry II, supra, at 803 (citing Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071(2)(e)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2001)).  Petitioner, however, did not receive the benefit of the new statutory instruction at his trial.  Instead, just as in Penry II, petitioner was sentenced pursuant to a supplemental instruction provided to the jury by the trial judge.[Footnote 2]  That instruction read:
You are instructed that you shall consider any evidence which, in your opinion, is mitigating.  Mitigating evidence is evidence that reduces the Defendants personal or moral culpability or blameworthiness, and may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the Defendants character, record, background, or circumstances of the offense for which you have found him guilty.  Our law does not specify what may or may not be considered as mitigating evidence.  Neither does our law provide a formula for determining how much weight, if any, a mitigating circumstance deserves.  You may hear evidence which, in your judgment, has no relationship to any of the Special Issues, but if you find such evidence is mitigating under these instructions, you shall consider it in the following instructions of the Court.  You, and each of you, are the sole judges of what evidence, if any, is mitigating and how much weight, if any, the mitigating circumstances, if any, including those which have no relationship to any of the Special Issues, deserves.


In answering the Special Issues submitted to you herein, if you believe that the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the answers to the Special Issues are Yes, and you also believe from the mitigating evidence, if any, that the Defendant should not be sentenced to death, then you shall answer at least one of the Special Issues No in order to give effect to your belief that the death penalty should not be imposed due to the mitigating evidence presented to you.  In this regard, you are further instructed that the State of Texas must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the death sentence should be imposed despite the mitigating evidence, if any, admitted before you.


You are instructed that you may deliberate as a body about mitigating circumstances, but you are not required to reach a unanimous verdict as to their existence or weight.  When you vote about the Special Issues, each of you must decide for yourself whether mitigating circumstances exist and, if so, how much weight they deserve.  132 S.W. 3d, at 409.

Employing the framework of special issues modified by the supplemental nullification instruction, the jury considered a variety of mitigation evidence.  Petitioner presented evidence that (1) he had been diagnosed with potentially organic learning disabilities and speech handicaps at an early age; (2) he had a verbal IQ score of 75 and a full IQ of 78 and, as a result, had been in special education classes throughout most of his time in school; (3) despite his low IQ and learning disabilities, his behavior at school was often exemplary; (4) his father was a drug addict who was involved with gang violence and other criminal activities, and regularly stole money from family members to support a drug addiction; and (5) he was only 19 when he committed the crime.


In response, the prosecution submitted evidence demonstrating that petitioner acted deliberately and cruelly.  The prosecution emphasized that petitioner knew his victim, yet stabbed her repeatedly in numerous places on her body.  With respect to petitioners future dangerousness, the prosecution stressed that petitioner had previously been convicted of misdemeanor assault and proffered evidence suggesting that he had violated several drug laws.


During closing arguments at the punishment phase, the prosecution reminded the jury of its duty to answer truthfully the two special issues of deliberateness and future dangerousness.
Now, when we talked to you on voir dire, we talked to you aboutand we spent a lot of time talking to you to determine whether or not you could follow the law.  You told us two very important things when we talked to you.  First of all, you told us that in the appropriate case that you could give the death penalty.  Second, you said, Mr. Nancarrow, Ms. McDaniel, if you prove to me that the answers to those special issues should be yes, then I can answer them yes.  If you wavered, if you hesitated one minute on that, then I guarantee you, you werent going to be on this jury.  We believed you then, and we believe you now.  Pet. for Cert. 6.

The jury verdict form tracked the final reminders the prosecution gave the jury.  The form made no mention of nullification.  Nor did it say anything about mitigation evidence.  Instead, the verdict form asked whether petitioner committed the act deliberately and whether there was a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  The jury was allowed to give Yes or No answers only.  The jury answered both questions Yes and sentenced petitioner to death.  App. 4 to Pet. for Cert.


On direct appeal, petitioner argued that our holding in Penry I rendered his jury instructions unconstitutional because the special issues did not allow the jury to give effect to his mitigation evidence.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed petitioners sentence, reasoning that the nullification instruction provided an adequate vehicle through which the jury could consider petitioners evidence.  We denied certiorari on May 15, 1995.  Smith v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1112.


Petitioner filed an original writ of habeas corpus in the trial court in 1998.  That suit was dismissed as untimely, but the Texas Legislature amended its criminal code in such a way as to allow petitioner to file a timely writ.  Petitioner did so, claiming that his jury was instructed in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, petitioner argued that the jury instructions in his case ran afoul of our holding in Penry II.  The court denied petitioners application on the merits.  132 S.W. 3d 407 (2004).[Footnote 3]
II

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued its opinion just prior to our decision in Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U. S. ___ (2004).  In Tennard, we reversed the Fifth Circuits refusal to grant a certificate of appealability (COA) to a defendant who was sentenced under the Texas capital sentencing scheme prior to the legislative revisions which took place in the aftermath of Penry I.  Tennard, relying upon Penry I, argued that Texas two special issuesdeliberateness and future dangerousnessdid not allow the jury to give effect to his mitigation evidence and that the trial courts failure to issue a supplemental mitigation instruction that would allow the jury to give full effect to his evidence rendered his death sentence unconstitutional.  The state court and the Fifth Circuit both held that the lack of an adequate mitigation instruction was irrelevant.  The courts both determined that Tennard had failed to satisfy the Fifth Circuits threshold standard for constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence, that is, evidence of a uniquely severe permanent handicap with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own, and evidence that the criminal act was attributable to this severe permanent condition.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (some internal quotation marks omitted).
Our rejection of that threshold test was central to our decision to reverse in Tennard.  We held that [t]he Fifth Circuits test has no foundation in the decisions of this Court.  Neither Penry I nor its progeny screened mitigating evidence for constitutional relevance before considering whether the jury instructions comported with the Eighth Amendment.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Rather, we held that the jury must be given an effective vehicle with which to weigh mitigating evidence so long as the defendant has met a low threshold for relevance, which is satisfied by evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a fact-finder could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 440 (1990)).


The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals relied on precisely the same screening test weheld constitutionally inadequate in Tennard.  132 S.W. 3d, at 413 (holding that mitigation evidence requires a special instruction only when that evidence passes the threshold test of whether the defendants criminal act was due to the uniquely severe permanent handicaps with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own (quoting Robertson v. Cockrell, 325 F.3d 243, 251 (CA5 2003) (en banc)).  Employing this test, the court concluded that petitioners low IQ and placement in special-education classes were irrelevant because they did not demonstrate that he suffered from a severe disability.  132 S.W. 3d, at 414.  But, as we explained in Tennard, [e]vidence of significantly impaired intellectual functioning is obviously evidence that might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.  542 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5 (1986)).  There is no question that a jury might well have considered petitioners IQ scores and history of participation in special-education classes as a reason to impose a sentence more lenient than death.  Indeed, we have held that a defendants IQ score of 79, a score slightly higher than petitioners, constitutes relevant mitigation evidence.  See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535 (2003); see also Tennard, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1415).


The state court also held that petitioner had offered no evidence of any link or nexus between his troubled childhood or his limited mental abilities and this capital murder.  132 S.W. 3d, at 414. We rejected the Fifth Circuits nexus requirement in Tennard, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1213) (noting that none of our prior opinions suggested that a mentally retarded individual must establish a nexus between her mental capacity and her crime before the Eighth Amendment prohibition on executing her is triggered and holding that the jury must be allowed the opportunity to consider Penry evidence even if the defendant cannot establish a nexus to the crime).


That petitioners evidence was relevant for mitigation purposes is plain under our precedents, even those predating Tennard.  See, e.g., Penry I, 492 U. S., at 319322; Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 822 (1991); Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377378 (1990); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 114 (1982).  The state court, however, erroneously relied on a test we never countenanced and now have unequivocally rejected.  We therefore hold that the state court assessed [petitioners legal] claim under an improper legal standard.  Tennard, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Because petitioners proffered evidence was relevant, the Eighth Amendment required the trial court to empower the jury with a vehicle capable of giving effect to that evidence.  Whether the nullification instruction satisfied that charge is the question to which we now turn.
III

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that even if petitioner did proffer relevant mitigation evidence, the supplemental nullification instruction provided to the jury adequately allowed the jury to give effect to that evidence.  The court found it significant that the supplemental instruction in this case told the jury that it shall consider all mitigating evidence, even evidence unrelated to the special issues, [and] it also told the jury how to answer the special issues to give effect to that mitigation evidence.  132 S.W. 3d, at 416.  The court also concluded that the nullification instruction made it clear to the jury that a No answer was required if it believed that the death penalty was not warranted because of the mitigating circumstances.  Ibid.
In Penry II, we held that the key under Penry I is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to [a defendants mitigation] evidence in imposing sentence.  532 U. S., at 797 (quoting Penry I, supra, at 319); see 532 U. S., at 797 (citing Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S., at 381 (OConnor, J., dissenting) ([A] sentencer [must] be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances (emphasis in Johnson))).  We explained at length why the supplemental instruction employed by the Texas courts did not provide the jury with an adequate vehicle for expressing a reasoned moral response to all of the evidence relevant to the defendants culpability.  532 U. S., at 796.  Although there are some distinctions between the Penry II supplemental instruction and the instruction petitioners jury received, those distinctions are constitutionally insignificant.


Penry II identified a broad and intractable problema problem that the state court ignored hereinherent in any requirement that the jury nullify special issues contained within a verdict form.
We generally presume that jurors follow their instructions. Here, however, it would have been both logically and ethically impossible for a juror to follow both sets of instructions.  Because Penrys mitigating evidence did not fit within the scope of the special issues, answering those issues in the manner prescribed on the verdict form necessarily meant ignoring the command of the supplemental instruction.  And answering the special issues in the mode prescribed by the supplemental instruction necessarily meant ignoring the verdict form instructions.  Indeed, jurors who wanted to answer one of the special issues falsely to give effect to the mitigating evidence would have had to violate their oath to render a true verdict.


The mechanism created by the supplemental instruction thus inserted an element of capriciousness into the sentencing decision, making the jurors power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions.  There is, at the very least, a reasonable likelihood that the jury  applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevent[ed] the consideration of Penrys mental retardation and childhood abuse.  The supplemental instruction therefore provided an inadequate vehicle for the jury to make a reasoned moral response to Penrys mitigating evidence.  Id., at 799800 (citations omitted).

It is certainly true that the mandatory aspect of the nullification instruction made petitioners instruction distinct from Penrys.  Indeed, the shall command in the nullification instruction resolved the ambiguity inherent in the Penry II instruction, which we held was either a nullification instruction or an instruction that shackled and confined Penrys mitigating evidence within the scope of the impermissibly narrow special issues.  Id., at 798.  That being said, the clearer instruction given to petitioners jury did not resolve the ethical problem described supra, at 1011.[Footnote 4]  To the contrary, the mandatory language in the charge could possibly have intensified the dilemma faced by ethical jurors.  Just as in Penry II, petitioners jury was required by law to answer a verdict form that made no mention whatsoever of mitigation evidence.  And just as in Penry II, the burden of proof on the State was tied by law to findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness that had little, if anything, to do with the mitigation evidence petitioner presented.[Footnote 5]  Even if we were to assume that the jurors could easily and effectively have comprehended an orally delivered instruction directing them to disregard, in certain limited circumstances, a mandatory written instruction given at a later occasion, that would not change the fact that the jury was essentially instructed to return a false answer to a special issue in order to avoid a death sentence.  Penry II, supra, at 801.


There is no principled distinction, for Eighth Amendment purposes, between the instruction given to petitioners jury and the instruction in Penry II.  Petitioners evidence was relevant mitigation evidence for the jury under Tennard and Penry I.  We therefore hold that the nullification instruction was constitutionally inadequate under Penry II.  The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
The text of the special issues given to the jury was as follows: (1) Was the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased committed deliberately, and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result?  (2) Is there a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?  Pet. for Cert. 5.
The supplemental instruction in Penry II stated: You are instructed that when you deliberate on the questions posed in the special issues, you are to consider mitigating circumstances, if any, supported by the evidence presented in both phases of the trial, whether presented by the state or the defendant.  A mitigating circumstance may include, but is not limited to, any aspect of the defendants character and record or circumstances of the crime which you believe could make a death sentence inappropriate in this case.  If you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case, you must decide how much weight they deserve, if any, and therefore, give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendants personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue.  If you determine, when giving effect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life sentence, as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration, rather than a death sentence, is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.  532 U. S., at 789790 (emphasis added).
Four judges would have found petitioners claim procedurally defaulted.  See 132 S.W. 3d, at 417 (Hervey, J., concurring); id., at 428 (Holcomb, J., concurring).  The majority of the court, however, declined to adopt this holding and reached petitioners claims on the merits.
The concurring opinions below straightforwardly recognized this problem.  See 132 S.W. 3d 407, 427 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (Hervey, J., concurring) (concluding that the nullification instruction would, as a matter of federal constitutional law, suffer from the same defect as the one in Penry II had applicant presented any mitigating evidence that was beyond the effective reach of the sentencer and conceding that the instruction given to petitioner may have been inadequate as a matter of federal constitutional law); id., at 428 (Holcomb, J., concurring) (The nullification instruction provided to Smiths jury contained the same defects the Supreme Court identified in Penry II.  Therefore, the jury was unconstitutionally precluded from considering and giving effect to Smiths mitigating evidence).
There is another similarity between this case and Penry II.  In Penry II, we found it significant that the prosecutor admonished the jury to follow your oath, the evidence and the law prior to the deliberations in which the jury was required to fill out the verdict form.  We held that this statement sent the jury mixed signals and only reminded the jurors that they had to answer the special issues dishonestly in order to give effect to Penrys mitigating evidence.  532 U. S., at 802.  The prosecutor here similarly reminded the jury that each and every one of them had promised to follow the law and return a Yes answer to the special issues so long as the State met its burden of proof.  Pet. for Cert. 6.  Thus, the nullification instruction presented the same ethical dilemma here and, what is more, it seems that despite the inclusion of the mandatory shall language, the nullification instruction may have been more confusing for the jury to implement in practice than the state court assumed.

|543 u.s. 14|"NORFOLK SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO. v. JAMES N. KIRBY, PTY LTD., dba KIRBY ENGINEERING, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 021028.Argued October 6, 2004Decided November 9, 2004
Respondent James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., an Australian manufacturer, hired International Cargo Control (ICC) to arrange for delivery of machinery from Australia to Huntsville, Ala., by through (i.e., end-to-end) transportation.  The bill of lading (essentially, contract) that ICC issued to Kirby (ICC bill) designated Savannah, Ga., as the discharge port and Huntsville as the ultimate destination, and set ICCs liability limitation lower than the cargos true value, using the default liability rule in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) ($500 per package) for the sea leg and a higher amount for the land leg.  The bill also contained what is known as a Himalaya Clause, which extends liability limitations to downstream parties, including, here, any servant, agent, or other person (including any independent contractor).  Kirby separately insured the cargo for its true value with co-respondent, Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd.  When ICC hired a German shipping company (hereinafter Hamburg Sd) to transport the containers, Hamburg Sd issued its own bill of lading to ICC (Hamburg Sd bill), designating Savannah as the discharge port and Huntsville as the ultimate destination.  That bill also adopted COGSAs default rule, extended it to any land damages, and extended it in a Himalaya Clause to all agents  (including inland) carriers  and all independent contractors.  Hamburg Sd hired petitioner Norfolk Southern Railway (Norfolk) to transport the machinery from Savannah to Huntsville.  The train derailed, causing an alleged $1.5 million in damages.  Allianz reimbursed Kirby for the loss and then joined Kirby in suing Norfolk in a Georgia Federal District Court, asserting diversity jurisdiction and alleging tort and contract claims.  Norfolk responded that, among other things, Kirbys potential recovery could not exceed the liability limitations in the two bills of lading.  The District Court granted Norfolk partial summary judgment, limiting Norfolks liability to $500 per container, and certified the decision for interlocutory review.  In reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that Norfolk could not claim protection under the ICC bills Himalaya Clause because it had not been in privity with ICC when that bill was issued and because linguistic specificity was required to extend the clauses benefits to an inland carrier.  It also held that Kirby was not bound by the Hamburg Sd bills liability limitation because ICC was not acting as Kirbys agent when it received that bill.
Held:
1.Federal law governs the interpretation of the ICC and Hamburg Sd bills.  Pp.513.


(a)When a contract is a maritime one, and the dispute is not inherently local, federal law controls the contract interpretation.  Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U. S. 731, 735.  Applying Kossicks two-step analysis, federal law governs this dispute.  Pp.56.


(b)The bills at issue are maritime contracts.  This Court has recognized that [t]he boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction over contractsas opposed to torts or crimesbeing conceptual rather than spatial, have always been difficult to draw.  365 U. S., at 735.  To ascertain a contracts maritime nature, this Court looks not to whether a ship or vessel was involved in the dispute, or to the place of the contracts formation or performance, but to the nature and character of the contract.  North Pacific S.S. Co. v. Hall Brothers Marine Railway & Shipbuilding Co., 249 U. S. 119, 125.  Here, the bills are maritime contracts because their primary objective is to accomplish the transportation of goods by sea from Australia to the United States eastern coast.  Under a conceptual rather than spatial approach, the fact that the bills call for the journeys final leg to be by land does not alter the contracts essentially maritime nature.  The fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is the protection of maritime commerce.   Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc., 500 U. S. 603, 608 (emphasis added).  The conceptual approach vindicates that interest by focusing the Courts inquiry on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.  While it may once have seemed natural to think that only contracts embodying commercial obligations between the tackles (i.e., from port to port) have maritime objectives, the shore is now an artificial place to draw a line.  Maritime commerce has evolved along with the nature of transportation and is often inseparable from some land-based obligations.  The international transportation industry has moved into a new era, in which cargo owners can contract for transportation across oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.  The popularity of an efficient choice, to assimilate land legs into international ocean bills of lading, should not render bills for ocean carriage nonmaritime contracts.  Lower court cases that appear to have depended solely on geography in fashioning a rule for identifying maritime contracts are inconsistent with the conceptual approach required by this Courts precedent.  Pp.  610.


(c)The case is not inherently local.  A maritime contracts interpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.  See Kossick, 365 U. S., at 735.  Though some state interests are surely implicated in this case, those interests cannot be accommodated without defeating a federal interest; thus, federal law governs.  See id., at 739.  The touchstone here is a concern for the uniform meaning of maritime contracts.  Applying state law to cases such as this one would undermine the uniformity of general maritime law.  The same liability limitation in a single bill of lading for international intermodal transportation often applies both to sea and to land, as is true of the Hamburg Sd bill.  Likewise, a single Himalaya Clause can cover both sea and land carriers downstream, as in the ICC bill.   Confusion and inefficiency will inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a given contracts meaning.  In protecting the uniformity of federal maritime law, this Court also reinforces the liability regime Congress established in COGSA.  Pp.1013.


2.Norfolk is entitled to the protection of the liability limitations in both bills of lading.  Pp.1319.


(a)The ICC bills broadly written Himalaya Clause limits Norfolks liability.  This simple question of contract interpretation turns on whether the Eleventh Circuit correctly applied Robert C. Herd & Co. v. Krawill Machinery Corp., 359 U. S. 297.  Deriving a principle of narrow construction from Herd, the Court of Appeals concluded that the language of the ICC bills Himalaya Clause is too vague to clearly include Norfolk.  Moreover, it interpreted Herd to require privity between the carrier and the party seeking shelter under a Himalaya Clause.  Nothing in Herd requires such linguistic specificity or privity rules.  It simply says that contracts for carriage of goods by sea must be construed like any other contracts: by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.  The Eleventh Circuits ruling is not true to the contract language or the parties intent.  The plain language of the Himalaya Clause indicates an intent to extend the liability limitation broadly and corresponds to the fact that various modes of transportation would be involved in performing the contract.  Since Huntsville is some 366 miles inland from the discharge port, the parties must have anticipated using a land carriers services for the contracts performance.  Because it is clear that a railroad was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bills broadly written clause, Norfolks liability is limited by the clauses terms.  Pp.1315.


(b)Norfolk also enjoys the benefits of the Hamburg Sd bills liability limitation.  The question arising from this bill requires the Court to set an efficient default rule for certain shipping contracts.   To interpret the bill, the Court draws a rule from the common carriage decision of Great Northern R. Co. v. OConnor, 232 U. S. 508: When an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport goods, the cargo owners recovery against the carrier is limited by the liability limitation to which the intermediary and carrier agreed.  The intermediary is not the cargo owners agent in every sense, but it can negotiate reliable and enforceable liability limitations with carriers it engages.  Respondents contention that traditional agency law rather than the Great Northern rule should govern here is rejected.  It is of no moment that the traditional indicia of agency did not exist between Kirby and ICC, for the Great Northern principle only requires treating ICC as Kirbys agent for a single, limited purpose: when ICC contracts with subsequent carriers for liability limitations.  Nor will a decision binding Kirby to the Hamburg Sd bills liability limitation be disastrous for the international shipping industry.  First, a limited agency rule tracks industry practices.  Second, if liability limitations negotiated with cargo owners were reliable while those negotiated with intermediaries were not, carriers would likely want to charge the latter higher rates, resulting in discrimination in common carriage.  Finally, this decision produces an equitable result, since Kirby retains the right to sue ICC, the carrier, for any loss exceeding the liability limitation to which they agreed.  See id., at 515.  Pp. 1619.  
300 F.3d 1300, reversed and remanded.
OConnor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 03583.Argued October 12, 2004Decided November 9, 2004
Petitioner, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, pleaded guilty to two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and causing serious bodily injury in an accident, in violation of Florida law.  While he was serving his prison sentence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings pursuant to 237(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which permits deportation of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.  INA 101(a)(43)(F) defines aggravated felony to include, inter alia, a crime of violence [as defined in 18 U. S.C. 16] for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.  Title 18 U. S.C. 16(a), in turn, defines crime of violence as an offense that has as an element the use  of physical force against the person or property of another, and 16(b) defines it as any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.  An Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ordered petitioners deportation, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed his petition for review, relying on its precedent that a conviction under Floridas DUI statute is a crime of violence under 18 U. S.C. 16.
Held:State DUI offenses such as Floridas, which either do not have a mens rea component or require only a showing of negligence in the operation of a vehicle, are not crimes of violence under 18 U. S.C. 16.  Pp.411.
(a)Section 16 requires this Court to look to the elements and nature of the offense of conviction in determining whether petitioners conviction falls within its ambit.  Floridas DUI statute, like similar statutes in many States, requires proof of causation but not of any mental state; and some other States appear to require only proof that a person acted negligently in operating the vehicle.  This Courts analysis begins with 16s language.  See Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144.  Particularly when interpreting a statute featuring as elastic a word as use, the Court construes language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it.  See Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 229.  Section 16(a)s critical aspect is that a crime of violence involves the use  of physical force against anothers person or property.  That requires active employment.  See Bailey, supra, at 145.  While one may, in theory, actively employ something in an accidental manner, it is much less natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another by accident.  When interpreting a statute, words must be given their ordinary or natural meaning, Smith, supra, at 228, and 16(a)s key phrase most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.  Petitioners DUI offense therefore is not a crime of violence under 16(a).  Pp.48.


(b)Nor is it a crime of violence under 16(b), which sweeps more broadly than 16(a), but does not thereby encompass all negligent conduct, such as negligent operation of a vehicle.  It simply covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.  The classic example is burglary, which, by nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.  Thus, 16(b) contains the same formulation found to be determinative in 16(a): the use of physical force against anothers person or property.  Accordingly, 16(b)s language must be given an identical construction, requiring a higher mens rea than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a DUI offense.  Pp.89.


(c)The ordinary meaning of the term crime of violence, which is what this Court is ultimately determining, combined with 16s emphasis on the use of physical force against another (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses.  This construction is reinforced by INA 101(h), which includes as alternative definitions of serious criminal offense a crime of violence, as defined in [16], 101(h)(2), and a DUI-causing-injury offense, 101(h)(3).  Interpreting 16 to include DUI offenses would leave 101(h)(3) practically void of significance, in contravention of the rule that effect should be given to every word of a statute whenever possible, see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174.  Pp.911.


(d)This case does not present the question whether an offense requiring proof of the reckless use of force against anothers person or property qualifies as a crime of violence under 16.  P.11.
Reversed and remanded.

Petitioners DUI offense therefore is not a crime of violence under 16(a).  Pp.48.


(b)Nor is it a crime of violence under 16(b), which sweeps more broadly than 16(a), but does not thereby encompass all negligent conduct, such as negligent operation of a vehicle.  It simply covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.  The classic example is burglary, which, by nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.  Thus, 16(b) contains the same formulation found to be determinative in 16(a): the use of physical force against anothers person or property.  Accordingly, 16(b)s language must be given an identical construction, requiring a higher mens rea than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a DUI offense.  Pp.89.


(c)The ordinary meaning of the term crime of violence, which is what this Court is ultimately determining, combined with 16s emphasis on the use of physical force against another (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses.  This construction is reinforced by INA 101(h), which includes as alternative definitions of serious criminal offense a crime of violence, as defined in [16], 101(h)(2), and a DUI-causing-injury offense, 101(h)(3).  Interpreting 16 to include DUI offenses would leave 101(h)(3) practically void of significance, in contravention of the rule that effect should be given to every word of a statute whenever possible, see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174.  Pp.911.


(d)This case does not present the question whether an offense requiring proof of the reckless use of force against anothers person or property qualifies as a crime of violence under 16.  P.11.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021624. Argued March 24, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
Petitioner school district requires each elementary school class to recite daily the Pledge of Allegiance.  Respondent Newdows daughter participates in this exercise.  Newdow, an atheist, filed suit alleging that, because the Pledge contains the words under God, it constitutes religious indoctrination of his child in violation of the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.  He also alleged that he had standing to sue on his own behalf and on behalf of his daughter as next friend.  The Magistrate Judge concluded that the Pledge is constitutional, and the District Court agreed and dismissed the complaint.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Newdow has standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct his daughters religious education, and that the school districts policy violates the Establishment Clause.  Sandra Banning, the childs mother, then filed a motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring, inter alia, that she had exclusive legal custody under a state-court order and that, as her daughters sole legal custodian, she felt it was not in the childs interest to be a party to Newdows suit.  Concluding that Bannings sole legal custody did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of Article III standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child, the Ninth Circuit held that, under California law, Newdow retains the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if they contradict her mothers, as well as the right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.
Held:Because California law deprives Newdow of the right to sue as next friend, he lacks prudential standing to challenge the school districts policy in federal court.  The standing requirement derives from the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected, unrepresentative judiciary.  E.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750.  The Courts prudential standing jurisprudence encompasses, inter alia, the general prohibition on a litigants raising another persons legal rights, e.g., id., at 751, and the Court generally declines to intervene in domestic relations, a traditional subject of state law, e.g., In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593594.  The extent of the standing problem raised by the domestic relations issues in this case was not apparent until Banning filed her motion to intervene or dismiss, declaring that the family court order gave her sole legal custody and authorized her to exercise legal control over her daughter.  Newdows argument that he nevertheless retains an unrestricted right to inculcate in his daughter his beliefs fails because his rights cannot be viewed in isolation.  This case also concerns Bannings rights under the custody orders and, most important, their daughters interests upon finding herself at the center of a highly public debate.  Newdows standing derives entirely from his relationship with his daughter, but he lacks the right to litigate as her next friend.  Their interests are not parallel and, indeed, are potentially in conflict.  Newdows parental status is defined by state law, and this Court customarily defers to the state-law interpretations of the regional federal court, see Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346347.  Here, the Ninth Circuit relied on intermediate state appellate cases recognizing the right of each parent, whether custodial or noncustodial, to impart to the child his or her religious perspective.  Nothing that either Banning or the school board has done, however, impairs Newdows right to instruct his daughter in his religious views.  Instead, he requests the more ambitious relief of forestalling his daughters exposure to religious ideas endorsed by her mother, who wields a form of veto power, and to use his parental status to challenge the influences to which his daughter may be exposed in school when he and Banning disagree.  The California cases simply do not stand for the proposition that Newdow has a right to reach outside the private parent-child sphere to dictate to others what they may and may not say to his child respecting religion.  A next friend surely could exercise such a right, but the family courts order has deprived Newdow of that status.  Pp.714.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 03724. Argued April 26, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA) provides that the Sherman Act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce  with foreign nations, 15 U. S.C. 6a, but creates exceptions for conduct that significantly harms imports, domestic commerce, or American exporters.  In this case, vitamin purchasers filed a class action alleging that vitamin manufacturers and distributors had engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy, raising vitamin prices in the United States and foreign countries, in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.  As relevant here, defendants (petitioners) moved to dismiss the suit as to the foreign purchasers (respondents), foreign companies located abroad, who had purchased vitamins only outside United States commerce.  In dismissing respondents claims, the District Court applied the FTAIA and found none of its exceptions applicable.  The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the FTAIAs exclusionary rule applied, but so did its exception for conduct that has a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce that gives rise to a [Sherman Act] claim, 6a(1)(A), (2).  Assuming that the foreign effect, i.e., higher foreign prices, was independent of the domestic effect, i.e., higher domestic prices, the court nonetheless concluded that the Acts text, legislative history, and policy goal of deterring harmful price-fixing activity made the lack of connection between the two effects inconsequential.
Held:Where the price-fixing conduct significantly and adversely affects both customers outside and within the United States, but the adverse foreign effect is independent of any adverse domestic effect, the FTAIA exception does not apply, and thus, neither does the Sherman Act, to a claim based solely on the foreign effect.  Pp.419.
(a)Respondents threshold argument that the transactions fall outside the FTAIA because its general exclusionary rule applies only to conduct involving exports is rejected.  The House Judiciary Committee changed the bills original language from export trade or export commerce, H.R. 5235, to trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) deliberately to include commerce that did not involve American exports but was wholly foreign.  Pp.56.


(b)The FTAIA exception does not apply here for two reasons.  First, this Court ordinarily construes ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with other nations sovereign authority.  This rule of construction reflects customary international law principles and cautions courts to assume that legislators take account of other nations legitimate sovereign interests when writing American laws.  It thereby helps the potentially conflicting laws of different nations work together in harmony.  While applying Americas antitrust laws to foreign conduct can interfere with a foreign nations ability to regulate its own commercial affairs, courts have long held such application nonetheless reasonable, and hence consistent with prescriptive comity principles, insofar as the laws reflect a legislative effort to redress domestic antitrust injury caused by foreign anticompetitive conduct.  However, it is not reasonable to apply American laws to foreign conduct insofar as that conduct causes independent foreign harm that alone gives rise to a plaintiffs claim.  The risk of interference is the same, but the justification for the interference seems insubstantial.  While some of the anticompetitive conduct alleged here took place in America, the higher foreign prices are not the consequence of any domestic anticompetitive conduct sought to be forbidden by Congress, which rather wanted to release domestic (and foreign) anticompetitive conduct from Sherman Act constraint when that conduct causes foreign harm.  Contrary to respondents claim, the comity concerns remain real as other nations have not in all areas adopted antitrust laws similar to this countrys and, in any event, disagree dramatically about appropriate remedies.  Respondents alternative argument that case-by-case comity analysis is preferable to an across the board exclusion of foreign injury cases is too complex to prove workable.  Second, the FTAIAs language and history suggest that Congress designed the Act to clarify, perhaps to limit, but not to expand, the Sherman Acts scope as applied to foreign commerce.  There is no significant indication that at the time Congress wrote the FTAIA courts would have thought the Sherman Act applicable in these circumstances, nor do the six cases on which respondents rely warrant a different conclusion.  Pp.616.


(c)Respondents additional linguistic arguments might show a natural reading of the statute, but the comity and history considerations previously discussed make clear that respondents reading is not consistent with the FTAIAs basic intent.  Their deterrence-based policy argument is also unavailing in light of the contrary arguments by the antitrust enforcement agencies.  Pp.1618.


(d)On remand, the Court of Appeals may consider whether respondents properly preserved their alternative argument that the foreign injury here was not in fact independent of the domestic effects; and, if so, it may consider and decide the related claim.  Pp.1819.

No. 02628. Argued October 7, 2003Decided January 14, 2004
As a participant in the Medicaid program, Texas must meet certain federal requirements, including that it have an Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program for children.  The petitioners, mothers of children eligible for EPSDT services in Texas, sought injunctive relief against state agencies and various state officials, claiming that the Texas program did not meet federal requirements.  The claims against the state agencies were dismissed on Eleventh Amendment grounds, but the state officials remained in the suit and entered into a consent decree approved by the Federal District Court.  In contrast with the federal statutes brief and general mandate, the decree required state officials to implement many specific proposals.  Two years later, when the petitioners filed an enforcement action, the District Court rejected the state officials argument that the Eleventh Amendment rendered the decree unenforceable, found violations of the decree, and directed the parties to submit proposals outlining possible remedies.  On interlocutory appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Eleventh Amendment prevented enforcement of the decree because the violations of the decree did not also constitute violations of the Medicaid Act.
Held:Enforcement of the consent decree does not violate the Eleventh Amendment.  Pp.410.
(a)This case involves the intersection of two areas of federal law:the Eleventh Amendment and the rules governing consent decrees.  The state officials argue that a federal court should not enforce a consent decree arising under Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, unless it first identifies, at the enforcement stage, a violation of federal law such as the EPSDT statute itself.  This Court disagrees.  The decree here is a federal court order that springs from a federal dispute and furthers the objectives of federal law.  Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 525.  The petitioners enforcement motion sought a remedy consistent with Ex parte Young and Firefighters and accepted by the state officials when they asked the court to approve the consent decree.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, in which this Court found Ex parte Youngs rationale inapplicable to suits brought against state officials alleging state-law violations, is distinguishable from this case, which involves a federal decree entered to implement a federal statute.  Enforcing the decree vindicates an agreement that the state officials reached to comply with federal law.  Federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance.  Once entered, that decree may be enforced.  See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678.  Pp.49.


(b)The state officials and amici state attorneys general express legitimate concerns that enforcement of consent decrees can undermine sovereign interests and accountability of state governments.  However, when a consent decree is entered under Ex parte Young, the response to their concerns has its source not in the Eleventh Amendment but in the courts equitable powers and in the direction given by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), which encompasses an equity courts traditional power to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances.  See, e.g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367.  If a detailed order is required to ensure compliance with a decree for prospective relief that in effect mandates the State to administer a significant federal program, federalism principles require that state officials with front-line responsibility for the program be given latitude and substantial discretion.  The federal court must ensure that when the decrees objects have been attained, responsibility for discharging the States obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.  The basic obligations of federal law may remain the same, but the precise manner of their discharge may not.  If the State establishes reason to modify the decree, the court should make the necessary changes; otherwise, the decree should be enforced according to its terms.  Pp.910.

02-473||"UNITED STATES v. BANKS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02473. Argued October 15, 2003Decided December 2, 2003
When federal and local law enforcement officers went to respondent Bankss apartment to execute a warrant to search for cocaine, they called out police search warrant and rapped on the front door hard enough to be heard by officers at the back door, waited for 15 to 20 seconds with no response, and then broke open the door.  Banks was in the shower and testified that he heard nothing until the crash of the door.  The District Court denied his motion to suppress the drugs and weapons found during the search, rejecting his argument that the officers waited an unreasonably short time before forcing entry in violation of both the Fourth Amendment and 18 U. S.C. 3109.  Banks pleaded guilty, but reserved his right to challenge the search on appeal.  In reversing and ordering the evidence suppressed, the Ninth Circuit found, using a four-part scheme for vetting knock-and-announce entries, that the instant entry had no exigent circumstances, making forced entry by destruction of property permissible only if there was an explicit refusal of admittance or a time lapse greater than the one here.
Held: 
1.The officers 15-to-20-second wait before forcible entry satisfied the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.411.


(a)The standards bearing on whether officers can legitimately enter after knocking are the same as those for requiring or dispensing with knock and announce altogether.  This Court has fleshed out the notion of reasonable execution on a case-by-case basis, but has pointed out factual considerations of unusual, albeit not dispositive, significance.  The obligation to knock and announce before entering gives way when officers have reasonable grounds to expect futility or to suspect that an exigency, such as evidence destruction, will arise instantly upon knocking.  Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 394.  Since most people keep their doors locked, a no-knock entry will normally do some damage, a fact too common to require a heightened justification when a reasonable suspicion of exigency already justifies an unwarned entry.  United States v. Ramirez, 523 U. S. 65, 7071.  Pp.46.

			"|"UNITED STATES v. BANKS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02473. Argued October 15, 2003Decided December 2, 2003
When federal and local law enforcement officers went to respondent Bankss apartment to execute a warrant to search for cocaine, they called out police search warrant and rapped on the front door hard enough to be heard by officers at the back door, waited for 15 to 20 seconds with no response, and then broke open the door.  Banks was in the shower and testified that he heard nothing until the crash of the door.  The District Court denied his motion to suppress the drugs and weapons found during the search, rejecting his argument that the officers waited an unreasonably short time before forcing entry in violation of both the Fourth Amendment and 18 U. S.C. 3109.  Banks pleaded guilty, but reserved his right to challenge the search on appeal.  In reversing and ordering the evidence suppressed, the Ninth Circuit found, using a four-part scheme for vetting knock-and-announce entries, that the instant entry had no exigent circumstances, making forced entry by destruction of property permissible only if there was an explicit refusal of admittance or a time lapse greater than the one here.
Held: 
1.The officers 15-to-20-second wait before forcible entry satisfied the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.411.


(a)The standards bearing on whether officers can legitimately enter after knocking are the same as those for requiring or dispensing with knock and announce altogether.  This Court has fleshed out the notion of reasonable execution on a case-by-case basis, but has pointed out factual considerations of unusual, albeit not dispositive, significance.  The obligation to knock and announce before entering gives way when officers have reasonable grounds to expect futility or to suspect that an exigency, such as evidence destruction, will arise instantly upon knocking.  Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 394.  Since most people keep their doors locked, a no-knock entry will normally do some damage, a fact too common to require a heightened justification when a reasonable suspicion of exigency already justifies an unwarned entry.  United States v. Ramirez, 523 U. S. 65, 7071.  Pp.46.


(b)This case turns on the exigency revealed by the circumstances known to the officers after they knocked and announced, which the Government contends was the risk of losing easily disposable evidence.  After 15 to 20 seconds without a response, officers could fairly have suspected that Banks would flush away the cocaine if they remained reticent.  Each of Bankss counterargumentsthat he was in the shower and did not hear the officers, and that it might have taken him longer than 20 seconds to reach the doorrests on a mistake about the relevant enquiry.  As to the first argument, the facts known to the police are what count in judging a reasonable waiting time, and there is no indication that they knew that Banks was in the shower and thus unaware of an impending search.  As to the second, the crucial fact is not the time it would take Banks to reach the door but the time it would take him to destroy the cocaine.  It is not unreasonable to think that someone could get in a position to destroy the drugs within 15 to 20 seconds.  Once the exigency had matured, the officers were not bound to learn anything more or wait any longer before entering, even though the entry entailed some harm to the building.  Pp.69.


(c)This Courts emphasis on totality analysis leads it to reject the Governments position that the need to damage property should not be part of the analysis of whether the entry itself was reasonable and to disapprove of the Ninth Circuits four-part vetting scheme.  Pp.1011.


2.The entry here also satisfied 18 U. S.C. 3109, which permits entry by force if, after notice of his authority and purpose, [an officer] is refused admittance.  Because 3109 implicates the exceptions to the common law knock-and-announce requirement that inform the Fourth Amendment itself, 3109 is also subject to an exigent circumstances exception, which qualifies the requirement of refusal after notice, just as it qualifies the obligation to announce in the first place.

CONSERVATION v. ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02658. Argued October 8, 2003Decided January 21, 2004
The Clean Air Acts (CAA or Act) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, 42 U. S. C. 7477, was designed to ensure that the air quality in attainment areas, i.e., areas that are already clean, will not degrade, see 7470(1).  The program bars construction of any major air pollutant emitting facility not equipped with the best available control technology (BACT).  7475(a)(4).  The Act defines BACT as an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction  which the [state] permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [the] facility.  7479(3).  Two provisions of the Act vest enforcement authority in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Section 113(a)(5) generally authorizes the EPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAA requirement governing construction of a pollutant source, to pursue remedial action, including issuance of an order prohibiting construction.  42 U. S.C. 7413(a).  Directed specifically to the PSD program, CAA 167 instructs EPA to take such measures, including issuance of an order,  as necessary to prevent the construction of a major pollutant emitting facility that does not conform to the requirements of the program.  Because EPA has classified northwest Alaska, the region here at issue, as an attainment area for nitrogen dioxide, the PSD program applies to emissions of that pollutant in the region.  No major emitting facility, including any source emitting more than 250 tons of nitrogen oxides per year, 7479(1), may be constructed or modified unless a PSD permit has been issued for the facility, 7475(a)(1).  A PSD permit may not issue unless the proposed facility is subject to BACT for each CAA-regulated pollutant emitted from the facility.  7475(a)(4).


In this case, the permitting authority under 7479(3) is Alaska, acting through petitioner, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  In 1988, Teck Cominco Alaska, Inc. (Cominco), obtained authorization to operate a zinc concentrate mine in northwest Alaska.  The mine is a major emitting facility under 7475.  Its initial PSD permit authorized five diesel electric generators, MG1 through MG5, subject to operating restrictions.  Under a second PSD permit issued in 1994, Cominco added a sixth generator, MG6.  In 1996, Cominco initiated a project to expand zinc production by 40% and applied to ADEC for a PSD permit to allow, inter alia, increased electricity generation by MG5.  ADEC preliminarily proposed as BACT for MG5 an emission control technology known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 90%.  Amending its application, Cominco added a seventh generator, MG17, and proposed, as BACT, an alternative control technologyLow NOxthat achieves a 30% reduction in nitrogen oxide pollutants.  In May 1999, ADEC issued a first draft PSD permit and preliminary technical analysis report, concluding that Low NOx was BACT for MG5 and MG17.  ADEC identified SCR as the most stringent technology then technically and economically feasible.  ADEC nevertheless endorsed Comincos proffered emissions-offsetting alternative of fitting MG17 and all six existing generators with Low NOx, rather than fitting MG5 and MG17 with SCR.  This proposal, ADEC submitted, would achieve a maximum NOx reduction similar to the reduction SCR could achieve, and was logistically and economically less onerous for Cominco.  In July 1999, EPA objected that ADEC had identified SCR as the best control technology, but failed to require it as BACT.  ADEC responded with a second draft PSD permit and technical analysis report in September 1999, again finding Low NOx to be BACT for MG17.  ADECs second draft abandoned that agencys May 1999 emissions-offsetting justification.  ADEC further conceded that, lacking data from Cominco, it could make no judgment as to SCRs impact on the mines operation, profitability, and competitiveness.  It nonetheless concluded, contradicting its earlier finding that SCR was technically and economically feasible, that SCR imposed a disproportionate cost on the mine.  In support of this conclusion, ADEC analogized the mine to a rural utility that would have to increase prices were it required to use SCR.  Protesting that Cominco had not adequately demonstrated site-specific factors supporting the assertion of SCRs economical infeasibility, EPA suggested that ADEC include an analysis of SCRs adverse economic impacts on Cominco.  Expressing confidentiality concerns, Cominco declined to submit financial data.  In December 1999, ADEC issued a final permit and technical analysis report approving Low NOx as BACT for MG17.  Again conceding that it made no judgment as to SCRs impact on the mines operation, profitability, and competitiveness, ADEC advanced, as cause for its decision, SCRs adverse effect on the mines unique and continuing impact on the regions economic diversity and the ventures world competitiveness.  ADEC reiterated its rural Alaska utility analogy, and compared SCRs cost to the costs of other, less stringent, control technologies.


EPA then issued three orders to ADEC under 113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act.  Those orders prohibited ADEC from issuing a PSD permit to Cominco without satisfactorily documenting why SCR was not BACT for MG17.  In addition, EPA prohibited Cominco from beginning construction or modification activities at the mine, with limited exceptions.  Ruling on ADECs and Comincos challenges to these orders, the Ninth Circuit held that EPA had authority under 113(a)(5) and 167 to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the States justification for its BACT decision.  The Court of Appeals  emphasized that provision of a reasoned justification for a BACT determination by a permitting authority is undeniably a CAA requirement.  EPA had properly exercised its discretion in issuing the three orders, the Ninth Circuit held, because (1) Cominco failed to demonstrate SCRs economical infeasibility, and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.
Held:CAA authorizes EPA to stop construction of a major pollutant emitting facility permitted by a state authority when EPA finds that an authoritys BACT determination is unreasonable in light of 42 U. S.C. 7479(3)s prescribed guides.  Pp.1637.
(a)In holding that the EPA orders constituted reviewable final action under 7607(b)(1), the Ninth Circuit correctly applied Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154: To be final, agency action must mark the consummation of the agencys decisionmaking process, and must either determine rights or obligations or occasion legal consequences, id., at 177178.  As the Ninth Circuit noted, EPA had asserted its final position on the factual circumstances underpinning the orders.  If the orders survived judicial review, Cominco could not escape the practical and legal consequences of any ADEC-permitted construction Cominco endeavored.  Pp.1617.


(b)EPA may issue a stop construction order, under CAA 113(a)(5) and 167, if a state permitting authoritys BACT selection is not reasonable.  Pp.1730.  


(1)EPA has rationally construed CAAs BACT definition, 42 U. S.C. 7479(3), and the statutes listing of BACT as a [p]reconstruction requiremen[t] for the PSD program, 7475(a)(1) and (4), to mandate a determination of BACT faithful to the statutes definition.  EPA urges that state permitting authorities statutory discretion is constrained by 7479(3)s strong, normative terms maximum and achievable.  EPA accordingly reads 113(a)(5) and 167 to empower the federal Agency to check a state agencys unreasonably lax BACT designation.  In support of this reading, EPA notes that Congress intended the PSD program to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in clean-air areas.  Without a federal Agency surveillance role that extends to BACT determinations, EPA maintains, this goal is unlikely to be realized.  The Acts legislative history suggests that, absent national guidelines, a State deciding to set and enforce strict clean-air standards may lose existing industrial plants to more permissive States.  The legislative history further suggests that without a federal check, new plants will play one State off against another with threats to locate in whichever State adopts the most permissive pollution controls.  The Court agrees with EPAs reading of the statutory provisions.  EPAs CAA construction is reflected in interpretive guides EPA has several times published.  Although an interpretation presented in internal guidance memoranda does not qualify for dispositive force under Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 865866, a cogent administrative interpretation nevertheless warrants respect, Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 385.  Pp.1722.


(2)ADECs several arguments do not persuade the Court to reject as impermissible EPAs longstanding, consistently maintained interpretation.  ADEC argues that CAAs BACT definition, 7479(3), unambiguously assigns to the permitting authority alone the decision of the control technology qualifying as best available.  In ADECs view, EPAs enforcement role is restricted to assuring that the permit contain a BACT limitation.  CAA entrusts state authorities with initial responsibility to make BACT determinations because they are best positioned to adjust for local circumstances that might make a technology unavailable in a particular area.  According state authorities initial responsibility, however, does not signify that there can be no unreasonable state agency BACT determinations.  Congress vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA requirements relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT.  Having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, Congress would not have implicitly precluded EPA from verifying a state authoritys substantive compliance with the BACT requirement.  Nor would Congress have limited EPA to determining whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words BACT.  The fact that 7475(a)(8) expressly requires EPA approval of a States BACT determination in a limited category of cases does not mean EPA lacks supervisory authority in all other cases.  Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations.  Those provisions simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.  Also unavailing is ADECs argument that any reasoned justification requirement for a BACT determination may be enforced only through state administrative and judicial processes in order to allow development of an adequate factual record, to ensure EPA carries the burdens of proof, and to promote certainty.  The Court declines to read into CAAs silence the unusual requirement that a federal agencys decisions enforcing federal law must be remitted solely to state court.  EPA has rationally interpreted the BACT provisions and its own 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facilitys construction.  Nor is the Court persuaded by ADECs practical concerns.  There is no reason to conclude that an appropriate record cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decisions reasonableness.  In this very case, the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record.  After EPA did so, all the parties agreed to the records adequacy.  As to the burdens of production and persuasion, the Court holds that EPA bears both burdens in a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order as well as in an EPA-initiated civil action.  The underlying question a reviewing court must answer is the same in either case:Was the BACT determination unreasonable given the statutory guides and the state administrative record.  Nor does the Court find compelling the suggestion that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA will be free to invalidate a BACT determination months or years after a permit issues.  This case involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, not postconstruction federal directives.  EPA itself regards it as imperative to act on a timely basis.  Courts are also less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the further planning and construction have progressed.  Pp.2230.


(c)In this case, EPA properly exercised its statutory authority under 113(a)(5) and 167 in finding that ADECs acceptance of Low NOx as BACT for MG17 lacked evidentiary support.  EPAs orders, therefore, were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Pp.3036.


(1)The Court considers whether EPAs finding was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the applicable review standard set forth in the APA, 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  While EPAs three skeletal orders were not composed with ideal clarity, they properly ground EPAs BACT determination when read together with EPAs accompanying explanatory correspondence.  See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas&nbhyph;Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286.  As the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADECs BACT designation did not qualify as reasonable in light of statutory guides.  In the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both technically and economically feasible.  That technology should have been designated BACT absent considerations justifying a conclusion that SCR was not achievable in this case.  ADEC, however, selected Low NOx as BACT based on Comincos emissions-offsetting suggestion.  In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on that suggestion.  Rather, ADEC candidly stated that it aimed to support Comincos project and its contributions to the region.  ADECs selection of Low NOx thus rested squarely and solely on SCRs disproportionate cost.  EPA rightly concluded that ADECs switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record.  ADEC forthrightly conceded it was disarmed from reaching a judgment on SCRs economic impact on the mine by Comincos refusal to provide relevant financial data.  No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR, would be obliged to cut personnel or raise zinc prices.  Having acknowledged that it lacked information needed to judge SCRs impact on the mines operation, profitability, or competitiveness, ADEC could not simultaneously proffer threats to the mines operation and competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible.  Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice.  To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked cost figures discussed in four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production.  ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCRs per-ton cost to be well within what ADEC and EPA consider economically feasible.  No reasoned explanation for ADECs retreat from this position appears in the permit ADEC issued.  ADECs basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness to support Comincos project and its contributions to the region.  This justification, however, hardly meets ADECs own standard of a source-specific economic impact that demonstrates SCR to be inappropriate as BACT.  ADECs justification that lower aggregate emissions would result from Comincos agreement to install Low NOx on all its generators is also unpersuasive.  The final PSD permit did not offset MG17s emissions against those of the mines six existing generators.  As ADEC recognized in September and December 1999, a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one bubble for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is part of the permit action.  In December 1999, however, only MG17 figured in the permit action.  Pp.3035.


(2)This decision does not impede ADEC from revisiting its BACT determination.  In letters and orders throughout the permitting process and at oral argument, EPA repeatedly acknowledged that ADEC may yet prepare an appropriate record supporting its selection of Low NOx as BACT.  There is no reason not to take EPA at its word.  Pp.3536.
298 F.3d 814, affirmed.

The fact that 7475(a)(8) expressly requires EPA approval of a States BACT determination in a limited category of cases does not mean EPA lacks supervisory authority in all other cases.  Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations.  Those provisions simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.  Also unavailing is ADECs argument that any reasoned justification requirement for a BACT determination may be enforced only through state administrative and judicial processes in order to allow development of an adequate factual record, to ensure EPA carries the burdens of proof, and to promote certainty.  The Court declines to read into CAAs silence the unusual requirement that a federal agencys decisions enforcing federal law must be remitted solely to state court.  EPA has rationally interpreted the BACT provisions and its own 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facilitys construction.  Nor is the Court persuaded by ADECs practical concerns.  There is no reason to conclude that an appropriate record cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decisions reasonableness.  In this very case, the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record.  After EPA did so, all the parties agreed to the records adequacy.  As to the burdens of production and persuasion, the Court holds that EPA bears both burdens in a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order as well as in an EPA-initiated civil action.  The underlying question a reviewing court must answer is the same in either case:Was the BACT determination unreasonable given the statutory guides and the state administrative record.  Nor does the Court find compelling the suggestion that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA will be free to invalidate a BACT determination months or years after a permit issues.  This case involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, not postconstruction federal directives.  EPA itself regards it as imperative to act on a timely basis.  Courts are also less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the further planning and construction have progressed.  Pp.2230.


(c)In this case, EPA properly exercised its statutory authority under 113(a)(5) and 167 in finding that ADECs acceptance of Low NOx as BACT for MG17 lacked evidentiary support.  EPAs orders, therefore, were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  Pp.3036.


(1)The Court considers whether EPAs finding was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the applicable review standard set forth in the APA, 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  While EPAs three skeletal orders were not composed with ideal clarity, they properly ground EPAs BACT determination when read together with EPAs accompanying explanatory correspondence.  See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas&nbhyph;Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286.  As the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADECs BACT designation did not qualify as reasonable in light of statutory guides.  In the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both technically and economically feasible.  That technology should have been designated BACT absent considerations justifying a conclusion that SCR was not achievable in this case.  ADEC, however, selected Low NOx as BACT based on Comincos emissions-offsetting suggestion.  In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on that suggestion.  Rather, ADEC candidly stated that it aimed to support Comincos project and its contributions to the region.  ADECs selection of Low NOx thus rested squarely and solely on SCRs disproportionate cost.  EPA rightly concluded that ADECs switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record.  ADEC forthrightly conceded it was disarmed from reaching a judgment on SCRs economic impact on the mine by Comincos refusal to provide relevant financial data.  No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR, would be obliged to cut personnel or raise zinc prices.  Having acknowledged that it lacked information needed to judge SCRs impact on the mines operation, profitability, or competitiveness, ADEC could not simultaneously proffer threats to the mines operation and competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible.  Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice.  To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked cost figures discussed in four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production.  ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCRs per-ton cost to be well within what ADEC and EPA consider economically feasible.  No reasoned explanation for ADECs retreat from this position appears in the permit ADEC issued.  ADECs basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness to support Comincos project and its contributions to the region.  This justification, however, hardly meets ADECs own standard of a source-specific economic impact that demonstrates SCR to be inappropriate as BACT.  ADECs justification that lower aggregate emissions would result from Comincos agreement to install Low NOx on all its generators is also unpersuasive.  The final PSD permit did not offset MG17s emissions against those of the mines six existing generators.  As ADEC recognized in September and December 1999, a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one bubble for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is part of the permit action.  In December 1999, however, only MG17 figured in the permit action.  Pp.3035.


(2)This decision does not impede ADEC from revisiting its BACT determination.  In letters and orders throughout the permitting process and at oral argument, EPA repeatedly acknowledged that ADEC may yet prepare an appropriate record supporting its selection of Low NOx as BACT.  There is no reason not to take EPA at its word.  Pp.3536.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 03218. Argued March 2, 2004Decided June 29, 2004
To protect minors from exposure to sexually explicit materials on the Internet, Congress enacted the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U. S. C. 231, which, among other things, imposes a $50,000 fine and 6 months in prison for the knowing posting, for commercial purposes, of World Wide Web content that is harmful to minors, but provides an affirmative defense to commercial Web speakers who restrict access to prohibited materials by requiring use of a credit card or any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology, 231(c)(1).  COPA was enacted in response to Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, in which this Court held that the Communications Decency Act of 1996, Congress first attempt to make the Internet safe for minors by criminalizing certain Internet speech, was unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest and because less restrictive alternatives were available.  Respondents, Web speakers and others concerned with protecting the freedom of speech, filed suit for a preliminary injunction against COPAs enforcement.  After considering testimony presented by both respondents and the Government, the District Court granted the preliminary injunction, concluding that respondents were likely to prevail on their argument that there were less restrictive alternatives to COPA, particularly blocking or filtering technology.  The Third Circuit affirmed on different grounds, but this Court reversed, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535 U. S. 564.  On remand, the Third Circuit again affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that COPA was not the least restrictive means available for the Government to serve the interest of preventing minors from using the Internet to gain access to harmful materials.
Held:The Third Circuit was correct to affirm the District Courts ruling that enforcement of COPA should be enjoined because the statute likely violates the First Amendment.  Pp.615.
(a)The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it entered the preliminary injunction.  The abuse-of-discretion standard applies on review of such an injunction.  Because 28 U. S. C. 1254(1)s grant of appellate jurisdiction does not give this Court license to depart from an established review standard, Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 336, the injunction must be upheld and the case remanded for trial on the merits if the underlying constitutional question is close.  There is therefore no need to consider the broader constructions of the statute adopted by the Court of Appeals.  The District Court concentrated primarily on the argument that there are plausible, less restrictive alternatives to COPA.  See Reno, 521 U. S., at 874.  When plaintiffs challenge a content-based speech restriction, the Government has the burden to prove that the proposed alternatives will not be as effective as the challenged statute.  Ibid.  The purpose of the test is to ensure that speech is restricted no further than is necessary to accomplish Congress goal.  The District Courts conclusion that respondents were likely to prevail was not an abuse of discretion, because, on the record, the Government has not met its burden.  Most importantly, respondents propose that blocking and filtering software is a less restrictive alternative, and the Government had not shown it would be likely to disprove that contention at trial.  Filters impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source.  Under a filtering regime, childless adults may gain access to speech they have a right to see without having to identify themselves or provide their credit card information.  Even adults with children may obtain access to the same speech on the same terms simply by turning off the filter on their home computers.  Promoting filter use does not condemn as criminal any category of speech, and so the potential chilling effect is eliminated, or at least much diminished.  Filters, moreover, may well be more effective than COPA.  First, the record demonstrates that a filter can prevent minors from seeing all pornography, not just pornography posted to the Web from America.  That COPA does not prevent minors from accessing foreign harmful materials alone makes it possible that filtering software might be more effective in serving Congress goals.  COPAs effectiveness is likely to diminish even further if it is upheld, because providers of the materials covered by the statute simply can move their operations overseas.  In addition, the District Court found that verification systems may be subject to evasion and circumvention, e.g., by minors who have their own credit cards.  Finally, filters also may be more effective because they can be applied to all forms of Internet communication, including e-mail, not just the World Wide Web.  Filterings superiority to COPA is confirmed by the explicit findings of the Commission on Child Online Protection, which Congress created to evaluate the relative merits of different means of restricting minors ability to gain access to harmful materials on the Internet.  231, note.  Although filtering software is not a perfect solution because it may block some materials not harmful to minors and fail to catch some that are, the Government has not satisfied its burden to introduce specific evidence proving that filters are less effective.  The argument that filtering software is not an available alternative because Congress may not require its use carries little weight, since Congress may act to encourage such use by giving strong incentives to schools and libraries, United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S.194, and by promoting the development of filters by industry and their use by parents.  The closest precedent is United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, which, like this case, involved a content-based restriction designed to protect minors from viewing harmful materials.  The Court there concluded that, absent a showing that a less restrictive technological alternative already available to parents would not be as effective as a blanket speech restriction, the more restrictive option preferred by Congress could not survive strict scrutiny.  Id., at 826.  The reasoning of Playboy Entertainment Group, and the holdings and force of this Courts precedents, compel the Court to affirm the preliminary injunction here.  To do otherwise would be to do less than the First Amendment commands.  Id., at 830.  Pp.612.


(b)Important practical reasons also support letting the injunction stand pending a full trial on the merits.  First, the potential harms from reversal outweigh those of leaving the injunction in place by mistake.  Extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech may result where, as here, a prosecution is a likely possibility but only an affirmative defense is available, so that speakers may self-censor rather than risk the perils of trial.  Cf. Playboy Entertainment Group, supra, at 817.  The harm done from letting the injunction stand pending a trial on the merits, in contrast, will not be extensive.  Second, there are substantial factual disputes remaining in the case, including a serious gap in the evidence as to the filtering softwares effectiveness.  By allowing the preliminary injunction to stand and remanding for trial, the Court requires the Government to shoulder its full constitutional burden of proof respecting the less restrictive alternative argument, rather than excuse it from doing so.  Third, the factual record does not reflect current technological realitya serious flaw in any case involving the Internet, which evolves at a rapid pace.  It is reasonable to assume that technological developments important to the First Amendment analysis have occurred in the five years since the District Court made its factfindings.  By affirming the preliminary injunction and remanding for trial, the Court allows the parties to update and supplement the factual record to reflect current technology.  Remand will also permit the District Court to take account of a changed legal landscape: Since that court made its factfindings, Congress has passed at least two further statutes that might qualify as less restrictive alternatives to COPAa prohibition on misleading domain names, and a statute creating a minors-safe dot-Kids domain.  Pp.1215.

|542 u.s. 692|"SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03339. Argued March 30, 2004Decided June 29, 2004
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved using petitioner Sosa and other Mexican nationals to abduct respondent Alvarez-Machain (Alvarez), also a Mexican national, from Mexico to stand trial in the United States for a DEA agents torture and murder.  As relevant here, after his acquittal, Alvarez sued the United States for false arrest under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which waives sovereign immunity in suits for  personal injury  caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any [Government] employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment, 28 U. S.C. 1346(b)(1); and sued Sosa for violating the law of nations under the Alien Tort statute (ATS), a 1789 law giving district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations , 1350.  The District Court dismissed the FTCA claim, but awarded Alvarez summary judgment and damages on the ATS claim.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the ATS judgment, but reversed the FTCA claims dismissal.
Held:
1.The FTCAs exception to waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising in a foreign country, 28 U. S.C. 2680(k), bars claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.  Pp.417.


(a)The exception on its face seems plainly applicable to the facts of this case.  Alvarezs arrest was said to be false, and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.  Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit allowed the action to proceed under what is known as the headquarters doctrine, concluding that, because Alvarezs abduction was the direct result of wrongful planning and direction by DEA agents in California, his claim did not aris[e] in a foreign country.  Because it will virtually always be possible to assert negligent activity occurring in the United States, such analysis must be viewed with skepticism.  Two considerations confirm this Courts skepticism and lead it to reject the headquarters doctrine.  Pp.47.


(b)The first consideration applies to cases like this one, where harm was arguably caused both by action in the foreign country and planning in the United States.  Proximate cause is necessary to connect the domestic breach of duty with the action in the foreign country, for the headquarters behavior must be sufficiently close to the ultimate injury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it reasonable to follow liability back to that behavior.  A proximate cause connection is not itself sufficient to bar the foreign country exceptions application, since a given proximate cause may not be the harms exclusive proximate cause.  Here, for example, assuming the DEA officials direction was a proximate cause of the abduction, so were the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico.  Thus, at most, recognition of additional domestic causation leaves an open question whether the exception applies to Alvarezs claim.  Pp.89.


(c)The second consideration is rooted in the fact that the harm occurred on foreign soil.  There is good reason to think that Congress understood a claim arising in a foreign country to be a claim for injury or harm occurring in that country.  This was the common usage of arising under in contemporary state borrowing statutes used to determine which States limitations statute applied in cases with transjurisdictional facts.  And such language was interpreted in tort cases in just the same way that the Court reads the FTCA today.  Moreover, there is specific reason to believe that using arising in to refer to place of harm was central to the foreign country exceptions object.  When the FTCA was passed, courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred in tort cases, which would have been foreign law for a plaintiff injured in a foreign country.  However, application of foreign substantive law was what Congress intended to avoid by the foreign country exception.  Applying the headquarters doctrine would thus have thwarted the exceptions object by recasting foreign injury claims as claims not arising in a foreign country because of some domestic planning or negligence.  Nor has the headquarters doctrine outgrown its tension with the exception.  The traditional approach to choice of substantive tort law has lost favor, but many States still use that analysis.  And, in at least some cases the Ninth Circuits approach would treat as arising at headquarters, even the later methodologies of choice point to the application of foreign law.  There is also no merit to an argument that the headquarters doctrine should be permitted when a States choice of law approach would not apply the foreign law of the place of injury.  Congress did not write the exception to apply when foreign law would be applied.  Rather, the exception was written at a time when arising in meant where the harm occurred; and the odds are that Congress meant simply that when it used the phrase.  Pp.917.


2.Alvarez is not entitled to recover damages from Sosa under the ATS.  Pp.1745.


(a)The limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum common law claims understood in 1789 is not authority to recognize the ATS right of action Alvarez asserts here.  Contrary to Alvarezs claim, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.  This does not mean, as Sosa contends, that the ATS was stillborn because any claim for relief required a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.  Rather, the reasonable inference from history and practice is that the ATS was intended to have practical effect the moment it became law, on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations thought to carry personal liability at the time: offenses against ambassadors, violation of safe conducts, and piracy.  Sosas objections to this view are unpersuasive.  Pp.1730.


(b)While it is correct to assume that the First Congress understood that district courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations and that no development of law in the last two centuries has categorically precluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering such a new cause of action.  In deriving a standard for assessing Alvarezs particular claim, it suffices to look to the historical antecedents, which persuade this Court that federal courts should not recognize claims under federal common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the 18th-century paradigms familiar when 1350 was enacted.  Pp. 3045.


(i)Several reasons argue for great caution in adapting the law of nations to private rights.  First, the prevailing conception of the common law has changed since 1790.  When 1350 was enacted, the accepted conception was that the common law was found or discovered, but now it is understood, in most cases where a court is asked to state or formulate a common law principle in a new context, as made or created.  Hence, a judge deciding in reliance on an international norm will find a substantial element of discretionary judgment in the decision.  Second, along with, and in part driven by, this conceptual development has come an equally significant rethinking of the federal courts role in making common law.  In Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, this Court denied the existence of any federal general common law, which largely withdrew to havens of specialty, with the general practice being to look for legislative guidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive law.  Third, a decision to create a private right of action is better left to legislative judgment in most cases.  E.g., Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68.  Fourth, the potential implications for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing private causes of action for violating international law should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.  Fifth, this Court has no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations, and modern indications of congressional understanding of the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encouraged greater judicial creativity.  Pp. 3037.


(ii)The limit on judicial recognition adopted here is fatal to Alvarezs claim.  Alvarez contends that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law and that his arrest was arbitrary because no applicable law authorized it.  He thus invokes a general prohibition of arbitrary detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law of some government.  However, he cites little authority that a rule so broad has the status of a binding customary norm today.  He certainly cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications would be breathtaking.  It would create a cause of action for any seizure of an alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting the actions under 42 U. S.C. 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, that now provide damages for such violations.  And it would create a federal action for arrests by state officers who simply exceed their authority under state law.  Alvarezs failure to marshal support for his rule is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, which refers to prolonged arbitrary detention, not relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority.  Whatever may be said for his broad principle, it expresses an aspiration exceeding any binding customary rule with the specificity this Court requires.  Pp. 3845.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved using petitioner Sosa and other Mexican nationals to abduct respondent Alvarez-Machain (Alvarez), also a Mexican national, from Mexico to stand trial in the United States for a DEA agents torture and murder.  As relevant here, after his acquittal, Alvarez sued the United States for false arrest under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which waives sovereign immunity in suits for  personal injury  caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any [Government] employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment, 28 U. S.C. 1346(b)(1); and sued Sosa for violating the law of nations under the Alien Tort statute (ATS), a 1789 law giving district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations , 1350.  The District Court dismissed the FTCA claim, but awarded Alvarez summary judgment and damages on the ATS claim.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the ATS judgment, but reversed the FTCA claims dismissal.
Held:
1.The FTCAs exception to waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising in a foreign country, 28 U. S.C. 2680(k), bars claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.  Pp.417.


(a)The exception on its face seems plainly applicable to the facts of this case.  Alvarezs arrest was said to be false, and thus tortious, only because, and only to the extent that, it took place and endured in Mexico.  Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit allowed the action to proceed under what is known as the headquarters doctrine, concluding that, because Alvarezs abduction was the direct result of wrongful planning and direction by DEA agents in California, his claim did not aris[e] in a foreign country.  Because it will virtually always be possible to assert negligent activity occurring in the United States, such analysis must be viewed with skepticism.  Two considerations confirm this Courts skepticism and lead it to reject the headquarters doctrine.  Pp.47.


(b)The first consideration applies to cases like this one, where harm was arguably caused both by action in the foreign country and planning in the United States.  Proximate cause is necessary to connect the domestic breach of duty with the action in the foreign country, for the headquarters behavior must be sufficiently close to the ultimate injury, and sufficiently important in producing it, to make it reasonable to follow liability back to that behavior.  A proximate cause connection is not itself sufficient to bar the foreign country exceptions application, since a given proximate cause may not be the harms exclusive proximate cause.  Here, for example, assuming the DEA officials direction was a proximate cause of the abduction, so were the actions of Sosa and others in Mexico.  Thus, at most, recognition of additional domestic causation leaves an open question whether the exception applies to Alvarezs claim.  Pp.89.


(c)The second consideration is rooted in the fact that the harm occurred on foreign soil.  There is good reason to think that Congress understood a claim arising in a foreign country to be a claim for injury or harm occurring in that country.  This was the common usage of arising under in contemporary state borrowing statutes used to determine which States limitations statute applied in cases with transjurisdictional facts.  And such language was interpreted in tort cases in just the same way that the Court reads the FTCA today.  Moreover, there is specific reason to believe that using arising in to refer to place of harm was central to the foreign country exceptions object.  When the FTCA was passed, courts generally applied the law of the place where the injury occurred in tort cases, which would have been foreign law for a plaintiff injured in a foreign country.  However, application of foreign substantive law was what Congress intended to avoid by the foreign country exception.  Applying the headquarters doctrine would thus have thwarted the exceptions object by recasting foreign injury claims as claims not arising in a foreign country because of some domestic planning or negligence.  Nor has the headquarters doctrine outgrown its tension with the exception.  The traditional approach to choice of substantive tort law has lost favor, but many States still use that analysis.  And, in at least some cases the Ninth Circuits approach would treat as arising at headquarters, even the later methodologies of choice point to the application of foreign law.  There is also no merit to an argument that the headquarters doctrine should be permitted when a States choice of law approach would not apply the foreign law of the place of injury.  Congress did not write the exception to apply when foreign law would be applied.  Rather, the exception was written at a time when arising in meant where the harm occurred; and the odds are that Congress meant simply that when it used the phrase.  Pp.917.


2.Alvarez is not entitled to recover damages from Sosa under the ATS.  Pp.1745.


(a)The limited, implicit sanction to entertain the handful of international law cum common law claims understood in 1789 is not authority to recognize the ATS right of action Alvarez asserts here.  Contrary to Alvarezs claim, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.  This does not mean, as Sosa contends, that the ATS was stillborn because any claim for relief required a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.  Rather, the reasonable inference from history and practice is that the ATS was intended to have practical effect the moment it became law, on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations thought to carry personal liability at the time: offenses against ambassadors, violation of safe conducts, and piracy.  Sosas objections to this view are unpersuasive.  Pp.1730.


(b)While it is correct to assume that the First Congress understood that district courts would recognize private causes of action for certain torts in violation of the law of nations and that no development of law in the last two centuries has categorically precluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law, there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering such a new cause of action.  In deriving a standard for assessing Alvarezs particular claim, it suffices to look to the historical antecedents, which persuade this Court that federal courts should not recognize claims under federal common law for violations of any international law norm with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations than the 18th-century paradigms familiar when 1350 was enacted.  Pp. 3045.


(i)Several reasons argue for great caution in adapting the law of nations to private rights.  First, the prevailing conception of the common law has changed since 1790.  When 1350 was enacted, the accepted conception was that the common law was found or discovered, but now it is understood, in most cases where a court is asked to state or formulate a common law principle in a new context, as made or created.  Hence, a judge deciding in reliance on an international norm will find a substantial element of discretionary judgment in the decision.  Second, along with, and in part driven by, this conceptual development has come an equally significant rethinking of the federal courts role in making common law.  In Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78, this Court denied the existence of any federal general common law, which largely withdrew to havens of specialty, with the general practice being to look for legislative guidance before exercising innovative authority over substantive law.  Third, a decision to create a private right of action is better left to legislative judgment in most cases.  E.g., Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 68.  Fourth, the potential implications for the foreign relations of the United States of recognizing private causes of action for violating international law should make courts particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.  Fifth, this Court has no congressional mandate to seek out and define new and debatable violations of the law of nations, and modern indications of congressional understanding of the judicial role in the field have not affirmatively encouraged greater judicial creativity.  Pp. 3037.


(ii)The limit on judicial recognition adopted here is fatal to Alvarezs claim.  Alvarez contends that prohibition of arbitrary arrest has attained the status of binding customary international law and that his arrest was arbitrary because no applicable law authorized it.  He thus invokes a general prohibition of arbitrary detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law of some government.  However, he cites little authority that a rule so broad has the status of a binding customary norm today.  He certainly cites nothing to justify the federal courts in taking his rule as the predicate for a federal lawsuit, for its implications would be breathtaking.  It would create a cause of action for any seizure of an alien in violation of the Fourth Amendment, supplanting the actions under 42 U. S.C. 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, that now provide damages for such violations.  And it would create a federal action for arrests by state officers who simply exceed their authority under state law.  Alvarezs failure to marshal support for his rule is underscored by the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, which refers to prolonged arbitrary detention, not relatively brief detention in excess of positive authority.  Whatever may be said for his broad principle, it expresses an aspiration exceeding any binding customary rule with the specificity this Court requires.  Pp. 3845.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 031027. Argued April 28, 2004Decided June 28, 2004
Respondent Padilla, a United States citizen, was brought to New York for detention in federal criminal custody after federal agents apprehended him while executing a material witness warrant issued by the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks.  While his motion to vacate the warrant was pending, the President issued an order to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld designating Padilla an enemy combatant and directing that he be detained in military custody.  Padilla was later moved to a Navy brig in Charleston, S.C., where he has been held ever since.  His counsel then filed in the Southern District a habeas petition under 28 U. S.C. 2241, which, as amended, alleged that Padillas military detention violates the Constitution, and named as respondents the President, the Secretary, and Melanie Marr, the brigs commander.  The Government moved to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, that Commander Marr, as Padillas immediate custodian, was the only proper respondent, and that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over her because she is located outside the Southern District.  That court held that the Secretarys personal involvement in Padillas military custody rendered him a proper respondent, and that it could assert jurisdiction over the Secretary under New Yorks long-arm statute, notwithstanding his absence from the District.  On the merits, the court accepted the Governments contention that the President has authority as Commander in Chief to detain as enemy combatants citizens captured on American soil during a time of war.  The Second Circuit agreed that the Secretary was a proper respondent and that the Southern District had jurisdiction over the Secretary under New Yorks long-arm statute.  The appeals court reversed on the merits, however, holding that the President lacks authority to detain Padilla militarily.  
Held: 
1.Because this Court answers the jurisdictional question in the negative, it does not reach the question whether the President has authority to detain Padilla militarily.  P.1.


2.The Southern District lacks jurisdiction over Padillas habeas petition.  Pp. 523.


(a)Commander Marr is the only proper respondent to Padillas petition because she, not Secretary Rumsfeld, is Padillas custodian.  The federal habeas statute straightforwardly provides that the proper respondent is the person having custody over the petitioner.  2242, 2243.  Its consistent use of the definite article indicates that there is generally only one proper respondent, and the custodian is the person with the ability to produce the prisoners body before the habeas court, see Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574.  In accord with the statutory language and Wales immediate custodian rule, longstanding federal-court practice confirms that, in core habeas challenges to present physical confinement, the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, not the Attorney General or some other remote supervisory official.  No exceptions to this rule, either recognized or proposed, apply here.  Padilla does not deny the immediate custodian rules general applicability, but argues that the rule is flexible and should not apply on the unique facts of this case.  The Court disagrees.  That the Courts understanding of custody has broadened over the years to include restraints short of physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of the Wales rule where, in core proceedings such as the present, physical custody is at issue.  Indeed, that rule has consistently been applied in this core context.  The Second Circuit erred in taking the view that this Court has relaxed the immediate custodian rule with respect to prisoners detained for other than federal criminal violations, and in holding that the proper respondent is the person exercising the legal reality of control over the petitioner.  The statute itself makes no such distinction, nor does the Courts case law support a deviation from the immediate custodian rule here.  Rather, the cases Padilla cites stand for the simple proposition that the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms, does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges something other than his present physical confinement.  See, e.g., Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484; Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341.  That is not the case here:Marr exercises day-to-day control over Padillas physical custody.  The petitioner cannot name someone else just because Padillas physical confinement stems from a military order by the President.  Identification of the party exercising legal control over the detainee only comes into play when there is no immediate physical custodian.  Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283, 304305, distinguished.  Although Padillas detention is unique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challenge to physical custody imposed by the Executive.  His detention is thus not unique in any way that would provide arguable basis for a departure from the immediate custodian rule.  Pp.513.  


(b)The Southern District does not have jurisdiction over Commander Marr.  Section 2241(a)s language limiting district courts to granting habeas relief within their respective jurisdictions requires that the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian, Braden, supra, at 495.  Because Congress added the respective jurisdictions clause to prevent judges anywhere from issuing the Great Writ on behalf of applicants far distantly removed, Carbo v. United States, 364 U. S. 611, 617, the traditional rule has always been that habeas relief is issuable only in the district of confinement, id., at 618.  This commonsense reading is supported by other portions of the habeas statute, e.g., 2242, and by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(a).  Congress has also legislated against the background of the district of confinement rule by fashioning explicit exceptions: E.g., when a petitioner is serving a state criminal sentence in a State containing more than one federal district, the district . . . wherein [he] is in custody and the district . . . within which the State court was held which convicted and sentenced him have concurrent jurisdiction, 2241(d).  Such exceptions would have been unnecessary if, as the Second Circuit believed, 2241 permits a prisoner to file outside the district of confinement.  Despite this ample statutory and historical pedigree, Padilla urges that, under Braden and Strait, jurisdiction lies in any district in which the respondent is amenable to service of process.  The Court disagrees, distinguishing those two cases.  Padilla seeks to challenge his present physical custody in South Carolina.  Because the immediate-custodian rule applies, the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is present in South Carolina.  There is thus no occasion to designate a nominal custodian and determine whether he or she is present in the same district as petitioner.  The habeas statutes respective jurisdictions proviso forms an important corollary to the immediate custodian rule in challenges to present physical custody under 2241.  Together they compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in the lower courts, including in the context of military detentions: Whenever a 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge his present physical custody within the United States, he should name his warden as respondent and file the petition in the district of confinement.  This rule serves the important purpose of preventing forum shopping by habeas petitioners.  The District of South Carolina, not the Southern District of New York, was where Padilla should have brought his habeas petition.  Pp.1319.


(c)The Court rejects additional arguments made by the dissent in support of the mistaken view that exceptions exist to the immediate custodian and district of confinement rules whenever exceptional, special, or unusual cases arise.  Pp.1923.

||"RASUL et al. v. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columiba circuit
No. 03334. Argued April 20, 2004Decided June 28, 2004
Pursuant to Congress joint resolution authorizing the use of necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons that planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks, the President sent Armed Forces into Afghanistan to wage a military campaign against al Qaeda and the Taliban regime that had supported it.  Petitioners, 2 Australians and 12 Kuwaitis captured abroad during the hostilities, are being held in military custody at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cubas ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas.  Petitioners filed suits under federal law challenging the legality of their detention, alleging that they had never been combatants against the United States or engaged in terrorist acts, and that they have never been charged with wrongdoing, permitted to consult counsel, or provided access to courts or other tribunals.  The District Court construed the suits as habeas petitions and dismissed them for want of jurisdiction, holding that, under Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, aliens detained outside United States sovereign territory may not invoke habeas relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  
Held:United States courts have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay.  Pp.417.
(a)The District Court has jurisdiction to hear petitioners habeas challenges under 28 U. S. C. 2241, which authorizes district courts, within their respective jurisdictions, to entertain habeas applications by persons claiming to be held in custody in violation of the  laws  of the United States, 2241(a), (c)(3).  Such jurisdiction extends to aliens held in a territory over which the United States exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction, but not ultimate sovereignty.  Pp.416.


(1)The Court rejects respondents primary submission that these cases are controlled by Eisentragers holding that a District Court lacked authority to grant habeas relief to German citizens captured by U. S. forces in China, tried and convicted of war crimes by an American military commission headquartered in Nanking, and incarcerated in occupied Germany.  Reversing a Court of Appeals judgment finding jurisdiction, the Eisentrager Court found six critical facts: The German prisoners were (a) enemy aliens who (b) had never been or resided in the United States, (c) were captured outside U. S. territory and there held in military custody, (d) were there tried and convicted by the military (e) for offenses committed there, and (f) were imprisoned there at all times.  339 U. S., at 777.  Petitioners here differ from the Eisentrager detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against this country; they have never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.  The Eisentrager Court also made clear that all six of the noted critical facts were relevant only to the question of the prisoners constitutional entitlement to habeas review.  Ibid.  The Courts only statement on their statutory entitlement was a passing reference to its absence.  Id., at 768.  This cursory treatment is explained by the Courts then-recent decision in Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, in which it held that the District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction to entertain the habeas claims of aliens detained at Ellis Island because the habeas statutes phrase within their respective jurisdictions required the petitioners presence within the courts territorial jurisdiction, id., at 192.  However, the Court later held, in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 494495, that such presence is not an invariable prerequisite to the exercise of 2241 jurisdiction because habeas acts upon the person holding the prisoner, not the prisoner himself, so that the court acts within [its] respective jurisdiction if the custodian can be reached by service of process.  Because Braden overruled the statutory predicate to Eisentragers holding, Eisentrager does not preclude the exercise of 2241 jurisdiction over petitioners claims.  Pp.611.


(2)Also rejected is respondents contention that 2241 is limited by the principle that legislation is presumed not to have extraterritorial application unless Congress clearly manifests such an intent, EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248.  That presumption has no application to the operation of the habeas statute with respect to persons detained within the [United States] territorial jurisdiction.  Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285.  By the express terms of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over the Guantanamo Base, and may continue to do so permanently if it chooses.  Respondents concede that the habeas statute would create federal-court jurisdiction over the claims of an American citizen held at the base.  Considering that 2241 draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there is little reason to think that Congress intended the statutes geographical coverage to vary depending on the detainees citizenship.  Aliens held at the base, like American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federal courts 2241 authority.  Pp.1215.


(3)Petitioners contend that they are being held in federal custody in violation of United States laws, and the District Courts jurisdiction over petitioners custodians is unquestioned, cf. Braden, 410 U. S., at 495.  Section 2241 requires nothing more and therefore confers jurisdiction on the District Court.  Pp.1516.


(b)The District Court also has jurisdiction to hear the Al Odah petitioners complaint invoking 28 U. S. C. 1331, the federal question statute, and 1350, the Alien Tort Statute.  The Court of Appeals, again relying on Eisentrager, held that the District Court correctly dismissed these claims for want of jurisdiction because the petitioners lacked the privilege of litigation in U. S. courts.  Nothing in Eisentrager or any other of the Courts cases categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the United States from that privilege.  United States courts have traditionally been open to nonresident aliens.  Cf. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, 208 U. S. 570, 578.  And indeed, 1350 explicitly confers the privilege of suing for an actionable tort  committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States on aliens alone.  The fact that petitioners are being held in military custody is immaterial.  Pp.1617.


(c)Whether and what further proceedings may become necessary after respondents respond to the merits of petitioners claims are not here addressed.  P.17.
321 F.3d 1134, reversed and remanded.

			"|"RASUL et al. v. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columiba circuit
No. 03334. Argued April 20, 2004Decided June 28, 2004
Pursuant to Congress joint resolution authorizing the use of necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons that planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks, the President sent Armed Forces into Afghanistan to wage a military campaign against al Qaeda and the Taliban regime that had supported it.  Petitioners, 2 Australians and 12 Kuwaitis captured abroad during the hostilities, are being held in military custody at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cubas ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas.  Petitioners filed suits under federal law challenging the legality of their detention, alleging that they had never been combatants against the United States or engaged in terrorist acts, and that they have never been charged with wrongdoing, permitted to consult counsel, or provided access to courts or other tribunals.  The District Court construed the suits as habeas petitions and dismissed them for want of jurisdiction, holding that, under Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, aliens detained outside United States sovereign territory may not invoke habeas relief.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  
Held:United States courts have jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay.  Pp.417.
(a)The District Court has jurisdiction to hear petitioners habeas challenges under 28 U. S. C. 2241, which authorizes district courts, within their respective jurisdictions, to entertain habeas applications by persons claiming to be held in custody in violation of the  laws  of the United States, 2241(a), (c)(3).  Such jurisdiction extends to aliens held in a territory over which the United States exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction, but not ultimate sovereignty.  Pp.416.


(1)The Court rejects respondents primary submission that these cases are controlled by Eisentragers holding that a District Court lacked authority to grant habeas relief to German citizens captured by U. S. forces in China, tried and convicted of war crimes by an American military commission headquartered in Nanking, and incarcerated in occupied Germany.  Reversing a Court of Appeals judgment finding jurisdiction, the Eisentrager Court found six critical facts: The German prisoners were (a) enemy aliens who (b) had never been or resided in the United States, (c) were captured outside U. S. territory and there held in military custody, (d) were there tried and convicted by the military (e) for offenses committed there, and (f) were imprisoned there at all times.  339 U. S., at 777.  Petitioners here differ from the Eisentrager detainees in important respects: They are not nationals of countries at war with the United States, and they deny that they have engaged in or plotted acts of aggression against this country; they have never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted of wrongdoing; and for more than two years they have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.  The Eisentrager Court also made clear that all six of the noted critical facts were relevant only to the question of the prisoners constitutional entitlement to habeas review.  Ibid.  The Courts only statement on their statutory entitlement was a passing reference to its absence.  Id., at 768.  This cursory treatment is explained by the Courts then-recent decision in Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, in which it held that the District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction to entertain the habeas claims of aliens detained at Ellis Island because the habeas statutes phrase within their respective jurisdictions required the petitioners presence within the courts territorial jurisdiction, id., at 192.  However, the Court later held, in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 494495, that such presence is not an invariable prerequisite to the exercise of 2241 jurisdiction because habeas acts upon the person holding the prisoner, not the prisoner himself, so that the court acts within [its] respective jurisdiction if the custodian can be reached by service of process.  Because Braden overruled the statutory predicate to Eisentragers holding, Eisentrager does not preclude the exercise of 2241 jurisdiction over petitioners claims.  Pp.611.


(2)Also rejected is respondents contention that 2241 is limited by the principle that legislation is presumed not to have extraterritorial application unless Congress clearly manifests such an intent, EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248.  That presumption has no application to the operation of the habeas statute with respect to persons detained within the [United States] territorial jurisdiction.  Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285.  By the express terms of its agreements with Cuba, the United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over the Guantanamo Base, and may continue to do so permanently if it chooses.  Respondents concede that the habeas statute would create federal-court jurisdiction over the claims of an American citizen held at the base.  Considering that 2241 draws no distinction between Americans and aliens held in federal custody, there is little reason to think that Congress intended the statutes geographical coverage to vary depending on the detainees citizenship.  Aliens held at the base, like American citizens, are entitled to invoke the federal courts 2241 authority.  Pp.1215.


(3)Petitioners contend that they are being held in federal custody in violation of United States laws, and the District Courts jurisdiction over petitioners custodians is unquestioned, cf. Braden, 410 U. S., at 495.  Section 2241 requires nothing more and therefore confers jurisdiction on the District Court.  Pp.1516.


(b)The District Court also has jurisdiction to hear the Al Odah petitioners complaint invoking 28 U. S. C. 1331, the federal question statute, and 1350, the Alien Tort Statute.  The Court of Appeals, again relying on Eisentrager, held that the District Court correctly dismissed these claims for want of jurisdiction because the petitioners lacked the privilege of litigation in U. S. courts.  Nothing in Eisentrager or any other of the Courts cases categorically excludes aliens detained in military custody outside the United States from that privilege.  United States courts have traditionally been open to nonresident aliens.  Cf. Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, 208 U. S. 570, 578.  And indeed, 1350 explicitly confers the privilege of suing for an actionable tort  committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States on aliens alone.  The fact that petitioners are being held in military custody is immaterial.  Pp.1617.


(c)Whether and what further proceedings may become necessary after respondents respond to the merits of petitioners claims are not here addressed.  P.17.
321 F.3d 1134, reversed and remanded.

DEFENSE, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 036696. Argued April 28, 2004Decided June 28, 2004
After Congress passed a resolutionthe Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)empowering the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against nations, organizations, or persons that he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided in the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks, the President ordered the Armed Forces to Afghanistan to subdue al Qaeda and quell the supporting Taliban regime.  Petitioner Hamdi, an American citizen whom the Government has classified as an enemy combatant for allegedly taking up arms with the Taliban during the conflict, was captured in Afghanistan and presently is detained at a naval brig in Charleston, S.C.  Hamdis father filed this habeas petition on his behalf under 28 U. S.C. 2241, alleging, among other things, that the Government holds his son in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Although the petition did not elaborate on the factual circumstances of Hamdis capture and detention, his father has asserted in other documents in the record that Hamdi went to Afghanistan to do relief work less than two months before September 11 and could not have received military training.  The Government attached to its response to the petition a declaration from Michael Mobbs (Mobbs Declaration), a Defense Department official.  The Mobbs Declaration alleges various details regarding Hamdis trip to Afghanistan, his affiliation there with a Taliban unit during a time when the Taliban was battling U. S.allies, and his subsequent surrender of an assault rifle.  The District Court found that the Mobbs Declaration, standing alone, did not support Hamdis detention and ordered the Government to turn over numerous materials for in camera review.  The Fourth Circuit reversed, stressing that, because it was undisputed that Hamdi was captured in an active combat zone, no factual inquiry or evidentiary hearing allowing Hamdi to be heard or to rebut the Governments assertions was necessary or proper.  Concluding that the factual averments in the Mobbs Declaration, if accurate, provided a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that the President had constitutionally detained Hamdi, the court ordered the habeas petition dismissed.  The appeals court held that, assuming that express congressional authorization of the detention was required by 18 U. S.C. 4001(a)which provides that [n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress the AUMFs necessary and appropriate force language provided the authorization for Hamdis detention.  It also concluded that Hamdi is entitled only to a limited judicial inquiry into his detentions legality under the war powers of the political branches, and not to a searching review of the factual determinations underlying his seizure.  
Held:The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
Justice OConnor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer, concluded that although Congress authorized the detention of combatants in the narrow circumstances alleged in this case, due process demands that a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral decisionmaker.  Pp.1415.


Justice Souter, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concluded that Hamdis detention is unauthorized, but joined with the plurality to conclude that on remand Hamdi should have a meaningful opportunity to offer evidence that he is not an enemy combatant.  Pp.23, 15.
OConnor, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and Kennedy and Breyer, JJ., joined.

|542 u.s. 600|"MISSOURI v. SEIBERT
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
No. 021371. Argued December 9, 2003Decided June 28, 2004
Respondent Seibert feared charges of neglect when her son, afflicted with cerebral palsy, died in his sleep.  She was present when two of her sons and their friends discussed burning her familys mobile home to conceal the circumstances of her sons death.  Donald, an unrelated mentally ill 18-year-old living with the family, was left to die in the fire, in order to avoid the appearance that Seiberts son had been unattended.  Five days later, the police arrested Seibert, but did not read her her rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436.  At the police station, Officer Hanrahan questioned her for 30 to 40 minutes, obtaining a confession that the plan was for Donald to die in the fire.  He then gave her a 20-minute break, returned to give her Miranda warnings, and obtained a signed waiver.  He resumed questioning, confronting Seibert with her prewarning statements and getting her to repeat the information.  Seibert moved to suppress both her prewarning and postwarning statements.  Hanrahan testified that he made a conscious decision to withhold Miranda warnings, question first, then give the warnings, and then repeat the question until he got the answer previously given.  The District Court suppressed the prewarning statement but admitted the postwarning one, and Seibert was convicted of second-degree murder.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, finding the case indistinguishable from Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, in which this Court held that a suspects unwarned inculpatory statement made during a brief exchange at his house did not make a later, fully warned inculpatory statement inadmissible.  In reversing, the State Supreme Court held that, because the interrogation was nearly continuous, the second statement, which was clearly the product of the invalid first statement, should be suppressed; and distinguished Elstad on the ground that the warnings had not intentionally been withheld there.
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
93 S.W. 3d 700, affirmed.
Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded that, because the midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession in this case could not comply with Mirandas constitutional warning requirement, Seiberts postwarning statements are inadmissible.  Pp.415.


(a)Failure to give Miranda warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.  Conversely, giving the warnings and getting a waiver generally produces a virtual ticket of admissibility, with most litigation over voluntariness ending with valid waiver finding.  This common consequence would not be at all common unless Miranda warnings were customarily given under circumstances that reasonably suggest a real choice between talking and not talking.  Pp.46.


(b)Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, reaffirmed Miranda, holding that Mirandas constitutional character prevailed against a federal statute that sought to restore the old regime of giving no warnings and litigating most statements voluntariness.  The technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases raises a new challenge to Miranda.  Pp.69.


(c)When a confession so obtained is offered and challenged, attention must be paid to the conflicting objects of Miranda and the question-first strategy.  Miranda addressed interrogation practices  likely  to disable [an individual] from making a free and rational choice about speaking, 384 U. S., at 464465, and held that a suspect must be adequately and effectively advised of the choice the Constitution guarantees, id., at 467.  Question-firsts object, however, is to render Miranda warnings ineffective by waiting to give them until after the suspect has already confessed.  The threshold question in this situation is whether it would be reasonable to find that the warnings could function effectively as Miranda requires.  There is no doubt about the answer.  By any objective measure, it is likely that warnings withheld until after interrogation and confession will be ineffective in preparing a suspect for successive interrogation, close in time and similar in content.  The manifest purpose of question-first is to get a confession the suspect would not make if he understood his rights at the outset.  When the warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and deprive a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 424.  And it would be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated and proximately conducted questioning as independent interrogations subject to independent evaluation simply because Miranda warnings formally punctuate them in the middle.  Pp.912.


(d)Elstad does not authorize admission of a confession repeated under the question-first strategy.  The contrast between Elstad and this case reveals relevant facts bearing on whether midstream Miranda warnings could be effective to accomplish their object: the completeness and detail of the questions and answers to the first round of questioning, the two statements overlapping content, the timing and setting of the first and second rounds, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogators questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.  In Elstad, the station house questioning could sensibly be seen as a distinct experience from a short conversation at home, and thus the Miranda warnings could have made sense as presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up on the earlier admission.  Here, however, the unwarned interrogation was conducted in the station house, and the questioning was systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill.  The warned phase proceeded after only a 15-to-20 minute pause, in the same place and with the same officer, who did not advise Seibert that her prior statement could not be used against her.  These circumstances challenge the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspects shoes could not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.  Pp.1215.


Justice Kennedy concluded that when a two-step interrogation technique is used, postwarning statements related to prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.  Not every violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, requires suppression of the evidence obtained.  Admission may be proper when it would further important objectives without compromising Mirandas central concerns.  See, e.g., Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222.  Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, reflects a balanced and pragmatic approach to enforcing the Miranda warning.  An officer may not realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are required, and may not plan to question the suspect or may be waiting for a more appropriate time.  Suppressing postwarning statements under such circumstances would serve neither the general goal of deterring improper police conduct nor the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence.  Elstad, supra, at 308.  In contrast, the technique used in this case distorts Mirandas meaning and furthers no legitimate countervailing interest.  The warning was withheld to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the admonition when finally given.  That the interrogating officer relied on respondents prewarning statement to obtain the postwarning one used at trial shows the temptations for abuse inherent in the two-step technique.  Reference to the prewarning statement was an implicit, and false, suggestion that the mere repetition of the earlier statement was not independently incriminating.  The Miranda rule would be frustrated were the police permitted to undermine its meaning and effect.  However, the pluralitys testthat whenever a two-stage interview occurs, the postwarning statements admissibility depends on whether the midstream warnings could have been effective enough to accomplish their object given the cases specific factscuts too broadly.  The admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by Elstads principles unless the deliberate two-step strategy is employed.  Then, the postwarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before they were made.  Such measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspects situation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and waiver.  For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the warning may suffice in most instances, as may an additional warning explaining the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning statement.  Because no curative steps were taken in this case, the postwarning statements are inadmissible and the conviction cannot stand.  Pp.15.

|542 u.s. 630|"UNITED STATES v. PATANE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 021183. Argued December 9, 2003Decided June 28, 2004
After Officer Fox began to investigate respondents apparent violation of a temporary restraining order, a federal agent told Foxs colleague, Detective Benner, that respondent, a convicted felon, illegally possessed a pistol.  Officer Fox and Detective Benner proceeded to respondents home, where Fox arrested him for violating the restraining order.  Benner attempted to advise respondent of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, but respondent interrupted, asserting that he knew his rights.  Benner then asked about the pistol and retrieved and seized it.  Respondent was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1).  The District Court granted his motion to suppress the pistol, reasoning that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him, and declining to rule on his alternative argument that the gun should be suppressed as the fruit of an unwarned statement.  The Tenth Circuit reversed the probable-cause ruling, but affirmed the suppression order on respondents alternative theory.  Rejecting the Governments argument that Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, and Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, foreclosed application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 488, to the present context, the appeals court reasoned that Oregon and Tucker, which were based on the view that Miranda announced a prophylactic rule, were incompatible with Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 444, in which this Court held that Miranda announced a constitutional rule.  The appeals court thus equated Dickersons ruling with the proposition that a failure to warn pursuant to Miranda is itself a violation of the suspects Fifth Amendment rights.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
304 F.3d 1013, reversed and remanded. 
Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, concluded that a failure to give a suspect Miranda warnings does not require suppression of the physical fruits of the suspects unwarned but voluntary statements.  Pp. 412.


(a)The Miranda rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, U. S.Const., Amdt. 5.  That Clauses core protection is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial.  See, e.g., Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U. S. 760, 764768.   It cannot be violated by the introduction of nontestimonial evidence obtained as a result of voluntary statements.  See, e.g., United States v.  Hubbell, 530 U. S. 27, 34.  The Court has recognized and applied several prophylactic rules designed to protect the core privilege against self-incrimination.  For example, the Miranda rule creates a presumption of coercion in custodial interrogations, in the absence of specific warnings, that is generally irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecutions case in chief.  E.g., 384 U. S., at 467.  But because such prophylactic rules necessarily sweep beyond the Self-Incrimination Clauses actual protections, see, e.g., Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 690691, any further extension of one of them must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-incrimination, e.g., Chavez, supra, at 778.  Thus, uncompelled statements taken without Miranda warnings can be used to impeach a defendants testimony at trial, see Elstad, supra, at 307308, though the fruits of actually compelled testimony cannot, see New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450, 458459.  A blanket rule requiring suppression of statements noncompliant with the Miranda rule could not be justified by reference to the Fifth Amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence or by any deterrence rationale, e.g., Elstad, 470 U. S., at 308, and would therefore fail the Courts requirement that the closest possible fit be maintained between the Self-Incrimination Clause and any rule designed to protect it.  Furthermore, the Clause contains its own exclusionary rule that automatically protects those subjected to coercive police interrogations from the use of their involuntary statements (or evidence derived from their statements) in any subsequent criminal trial.  E.g., id., at 307308.  This explicit textual protection supports a strong presumption against expanding the Miranda rule any further.  Cf. Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386.  Finally, nothing in Dickerson calls into question the Courts continued insistence on its close-fit requirement.  Pp. 58.


(b)That a mere failure to give Miranda warnings does not, by itself, violate a suspects constitutional rights or even the Miranda rule was evident in many of the Courts pre-Dickerson cases, see, e.g., Elstad, supra, at 308, and the Court has adhered to that view since Dickerson, see Chavez, supra, at 772773.    This follows from the nature of the fundamental trial right protected by the Self-Incrimination Clause, e.g., Withrow, supra, at 691, which the Miranda rule, in turn, protects.  Thus, the police do not violate a suspects constitutional rights (or the Miranda rule) by negligent or even deliberate failures to provide full Miranda warnings.  Potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the admission of unwarned statements into evidence.  And, at that point, the exclusion of such statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived Miranda violation.  Chavez, supra, at 790.  Unlike actual violations of the Self-Incrimination Clause, there is, with respect to mere failures to warn, nothing to deter and therefore no reason to apply Wong Suns fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.  It is not for this Court to impose its preferred police practices on either federal or state officials.  Pp. 810.


(c)The Tenth Circuit erred in ruling that the taking of unwarned statements violates a suspects constitutional rights.  Dickersons characterization of Miranda as a constitutional rule does not lessen the need to maintain the close-fit requirement.  There is no such fit here.  Introduction of the nontestimonial fruit of a voluntary statement, such as respondents pistol, does not implicate the Clause.  It presents no risk that a defendants coerced statements (however defined) will be used against him at a criminal trial.  In any case, the exclusion of unwarned statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived Miranda violation.  E.g., Chavez, supra, at 790.  Similarly, because police cannot violate the Clause by taking unwarned though voluntary statements, an exclusionary rule cannot be justified by reference to a deterrence effect on law enforcement, as the court below believed.  The word witness in the constitutional text limits the Self-Incrimination Clauses scope to testimonial evidence.  Hubbell, supra, at 3435.  And although the Court requires the exclusion of the physical fruit of actually coerced statements, statements taken without sufficient Miranda warnings are presumed to have been coerced only for certain purposes and then only when necessary to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.  This Court declines to extend that presumption further.  Pp. 1012.


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice OConnor, concluded that it is unnecessary to decide whether the detectives failure to give Patane full Miranda warnings should be characterized as a violation of the Miranda rule itself, or whether there is anything to deter so long as the unwarned statements are not later introduced at trial.  In Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, and Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222, evidence obtained following unwarned interrogations was held admissible based in large part on the Courts recognition that the concerns underlying the Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, rule must be accommodated to other objectives of the criminal justice system.  Here, it is sufficient to note that the Government presents an even stronger case for admitting the evidence obtained as the result of Patanes unwarned statement than was presented in Elstad and Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433.  Admission of nontestimonial physical fruits (the pistol here) does not run the risk of admitting into trial an accuseds coerced incriminating statements against himself.  In light of reliable physical evidences important probative value, it is doubtful that exclusion can be justified by a deterrence rationale sensitive to both law enforcement interests and a suspects rights during an in-custody interrogation.

|542 u.s. 649|"FLORA HOLLAND, WARDEN v. JESSIE L. JACKSON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 031200. Decided June 28, 2004
Per Curiam.
I

Respondent Jessie Jackson was tried in 1987 by the State of Tennessee for the murder of James Crawley.  The State asserted that he had shot Crawley after an argument over drugs.  Its principal evidence at trial was the eyewitness testimony of Jonathan Hughes, who claimed to have been at the scene with his girlfriend Melissa Gooch when the shooting occurred.  Gooch did not testify.  The jury convicted, and respondent was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, respondent sought state postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation.  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984).  The state court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied the petition, finding that counsels performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent suffered no prejudice.  Respondent then filed a Motion for Hearing in Nature of Motion for New Trial, alleging newly discovered evidence.  He claimed for the first timeseven years after his convictionthat Gooch would now testify that, contrary to Hughes trial testimony, she was not with Hughes on the night of the shooting.  The state court denied this motion, and respondent appealed both rulings to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.


That court affirmed.  It upheld the denial of new trial, observing that respondent had already filed an earlier such motion, that there was no satisfactory reason given for the defendants failure to locate this witness during the seven years that had elapsed, and that the proposed testimony would serve merely to impeach Hughes memory about having seen [Gooch] that night.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 88.  It also affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, noting that there had never been any showing on the record of favorable testimony that would have been elicited from Gooch had counsel interviewed her, and that even crediting respondents unsubstantiated pleading, it in no way rises to the level of contradicting what Hughes claims to have seen respecting the shooting itself.  Id., at 9697 (emphasis added).


Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, and the District Court granted the States motion for summary judgment.  It found that there had been ineffective assistance of counsel, noting several shortcomings and opining that there was a reasonable probability of prejudice.  It observed, however, that it could grant relief only if the state courts adjudication of respondents claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  It concluded that the state courts application of Strickland, while erroneous, was not unreasonable.


The Sixth Circuit reversed.  Although it found a number of flaws in counsels performance, its grant of relief under 2254(d)(1) was based on only two specific grounds: first, that the state court had unreasonably applied Strickland, given that Goochs statement undermined the credibility of Hughes testimony; and second, that the state courts opinion was contrary to Strickland because it assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard rather than a reasonable-probability standard.


We now grant the States petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.
II
A

The Sixth Circuit erred in finding the state courts application of Strickland unreasonable on the basis of evidence not properly before the state court.  Although the state court had ventured that it would deny relief on the merits even taking Goochs statement into account, its judgment also rested on the holding that the statement was not properly before it.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 8689, 9598.  Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decision was error.
The unreasonable application clause of 2254(d)(1) applies when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Courts decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoners case.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000).  In this and related contexts we have made clear that whether a state courts decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.  See Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, ___ (2003) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5) (denying relief where state courts application of federal law was supported by the record); Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 348 (2003) (reasonableness of state courts factual finding assessed in light of the record before the court); cf. Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 697, n.4 (2002) (declining to consider evidence not presented to state court in determining whether its decision was contrary to federal law).


Under the habeas statute, Goochs statement could have been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to develop that evidence in state court, or (if he was at fault) if the conditions prescribed by 2254(e)(2) were met.  See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431437 (2000).  Those same restrictions apply a fortiori when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence without an evidentiary hearing.  See, e.g., Cargle v. Mullin, 317 F.3d 1196, 1209 (CA10 2003), and cases cited.  Where new evidence is admitted, some Courts of Appeals have conducted de novo review on the theory that there is no relevant state-court determination to which one could defer.  See, e.g., Monroe v. Angelone, 323 F.3d 286, 297299, and n.19 (CA4 2003).  Assuming, arguendo, that this analysis is correct and that it applies where, as here, the evidence does not support a new claim but merely buttresses a previously rejected one, it cannot support the Sixth Circuits action.


The District Court made no finding that respondent had been diligent in pursuing Goochs testimony (and thus that 2254(e)(2) was inapplicable) or that the limitations set forth in 2254(e)(2) were met.  Nor did the Sixth Circuit independently inquire into these matters; it simply ignored entirely the state courts independent ground for its decision, that Goochs statement was not properly before it.  It is difficult to see, moreover, how respondent could claim due diligence given the 7-year delay.  He complains that his state postconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 65.  Attorney negligence, however, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless the conditions of 2254(e)(2) are satisfied.  See Williams, supra, at 439440; cf. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753754 (1991).  


The Sixth Circuit therefore erred in finding the state courts decision an unreasonable application of
Strickland.[Footnote 1]
B

The Sixth Circuit also erred in holding that the state court acted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a reasonable probability.  The state court began by reciting the correct Strickland standard:
[T]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 95 (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694).

The Sixth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the state court had actually applied a preponderance standard, based on three subsequent passages from its opinion.


First was the statement that [i]n a post-conviction proceeding, the defendant has the burden of proving his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 95.  In context, however, this statement is reasonably read as addressing the general burden of proof in postconviction proceedings with regard to factual contentionsfor example, those relating to whether defense counsels performance was deficient.  Although it is possible to read it as referring also to the question whether the deficiency was prejudicial, thereby supplanting Strickland, such a reading would needlessly create internal inconsistency in the opinion.


Second was the statement that it is asking too much that we draw the inference that the jury would not have believed Hughes at all had Melissa Gooch testified.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 96.  Although the Court of Appeals evidently thought that this passage intimated a preponderance standard, it is difficult to see why.  The quoted language does not imply any particular standard of probability.


Last was the statement that respondent had failed to carry his burden of proving that the outcome of the trial would probably have been different but for those errors.  Id., at 98.  We have held that such use of the unadorned word probably is permissible shorthand when the complete Strickland standard is elsewhere recited.  See Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 2324 (2002) (per curiam).


As we explained in Visciotti, 2254(d) requires that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.  Id., at 24.  [R]eadiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and fol-
low the law.  Ibid.  The Sixth Circuit ignored those
prescriptions.
*  *  *

The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.
We reject respondents contention that the State failed adequately to preserve this error.  See, e.g., Final Brief for Appellee in No. 015720 (CA6), p.18, and n.3.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 02-10038. Argued March 22, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004
During his capital murder trial's penalty phase, petitioner Tennard presented evidence that he had an IQ of 67. The jury was instructed to determine the appropriate punishment by considering two ""special issues,"" which inquired into whether the crime was committed deliberately and whether the defendant posed a risk of future dangerousness. These were materially identical to two special issues found insufficient, in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, for the jury to give effect to Penry's mitigating mental retardation and childhood abuse evidence. Tennard's jury answered both special issues affirmatively and Tennard was sentenced to death. The Federal District Court denied Tennard's federal habeas petition in which he claimed that his death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Penry, and denied a certificate of appealability (COA). The Fifth Circuit agreed that Tennard was not entitled to a COA. It applied a threshold test to Tennard's mitigating evidence, asking whether it met the Fifth Circuit's standard of ""constitutional relevance"" in Penry cases--that is, whether it was evidence of a ""uniquely severe permanent handicap"" that bore a ""nexus"" to the crime. The court concluded that (1) low IQ evidence alone does not constitute a uniquely severe condition, and no evidence tied Tennard's IQ to retardation, and (2) even if his low IQ amounted to mental retardation evidence, Tennard did not show that his crime was attributable to it. After this Court vacated the judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, the Fifth Circuit reinstated its prior opinion.
Held: Because ""reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,"" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484, a COA should have issued. Pp. 7-15.

|542 u.s. 296|"BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON
certiorari to the court of appeals of washington
No. 021632. Argued March 23, 2004Decided June 24, 2004
Petitioner pleaded guilty to kidnaping his estranged wife.  The facts admitted in his plea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53 months, but the judge imposed a 90-month sentence after finding that petitioner had acted with deliberate cruelty, a statutorily enumerated ground for departing from the standard range.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners argument that the sentencing procedure deprived him of his federal constitutional right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts legally essential to his sentence.
Held:Because the facts supporting petitioners exceptional sentence were neither admitted by petitioner nor found by a jury, the sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.  Pp.518.
(a)This case requires the Court to apply the rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, that, [o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The relevant statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum a judge may impose based solely on the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.  Here, the judge could not have imposed the 90-month sentence based solely on the facts admitted in the guilty plea, because Washington law requires an exceptional sentence to be based on factors other than those used in computing the standard-range sentence.  Petitioners sentence is not analogous to those upheld in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, and Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, which were not greater than what state law authorized based on the verdict alone.  Regardless of whether the judges authority to impose the enhanced sentence depends on a judges finding a specified fact, one of several specified facts, or any aggravating fact, it remains the case that the jurys verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.  Pp.59.


(b)This Courts commitment to Apprendi in this context reflects not just respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content to the fundamental constitutional right of jury trial.  Pp.912.


(c)This case is not about the constitutionality of determinate sentencing, but only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment.  The Framers paradigm for criminal justice is the common-law ideal of limited state power accomplished by strict division of authority between judge and jury.  That can be preserved without abandoning determinate sentencing and at no sacrifice of fairness to the defendant.  Pp.1217.

certiorari to the court of appeals of washington
No. 021632. Argued March 23, 2004Decided June 24, 2004
Petitioner pleaded guilty to kidnaping his estranged wife.  The facts admitted in his plea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53 months, but the judge imposed a 90-month sentence after finding that petitioner had acted with deliberate cruelty, a statutorily enumerated ground for departing from the standard range.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners argument that the sentencing procedure deprived him of his federal constitutional right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt all facts legally essential to his sentence.
Held:Because the facts supporting petitioners exceptional sentence were neither admitted by petitioner nor found by a jury, the sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.  Pp.518.
(a)This case requires the Court to apply the rule of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, that, [o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The relevant statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum a judge may impose based solely on the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.  Here, the judge could not have imposed the 90-month sentence based solely on the facts admitted in the guilty plea, because Washington law requires an exceptional sentence to be based on factors other than those used in computing the standard-range sentence.  Petitioners sentence is not analogous to those upheld in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, and Williams v. New York, 337 U.

|542 u.s. 367|"CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, et al. v. UNITED STATES DISTRICT 
COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 03475. Argued April 27, 2004Decided June 24, 2004
The President established the National Energy Policy Development Group (Group) to give him advice and make recommendations on energy policy, assigning a number of federal agency heads and assistants to serve as Group members and authorizing the Vice President, as Group chairman, to include other federal officers as appropriate.  After the Group issued a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations, respondents filed these separate actions, later consolidated in the District Court, alleging that the Group had not complied with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which, inter alia, imposes a variety of open-meeting and disclosure requirements on entities meeting the definition of advisory committee.  As relevant here, such a committee is an entity or subgroup  , which is  established or utilized by the President,  exclud[ing]  any committee  composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, [federal] officers or employees.  5 U. S.C. App. 2(B)(i).  The complaint alleged that, because nonfederal employees and private lobbyists regularly attended and fully participated in the Groups nonpublic meetings as de facto Group members, the Group could not benefit from the 2(B) exemption and was therefore subject to FACAs requirements.  The suit sought declaratory relief and an injunction requiring the defendantsincluding the Vice President and the Government officials serving on the Groupto produce all materials allegedly subject to FACAs requirements.


Among its rulings, the District Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss as to some of them, but denied it as to others.  The Court held that FACAs substantive requirements could be enforced against the Vice President and the other Government participants under the Mandamus Act, 28 U. S. C. 1361, and against the agency defendants under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S.C. 706.  It deferred ruling on whether the FACA disclosure duty was sufficiently clear and nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue.  It also deferred ruling on the Governments contention that to disregard the 2(B) exemption and apply FACA to the Group would violate separation-of-powers principles and interfere with the Presidents and Vice Presidents constitutional prerogatives.  Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a tightly-reined discovery to ascertain the Groups structure and membership, and thus to determine whether the de facto membership doctrine applied.  While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise serious constitutional questions, the court explained that the Government could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials from disclosure.  The court noted that if, after discovery, respondents had no evidentiary support for their allegations about de facto members in the Group, the Government could prevail on statutory grounds.  Even were it appropriate to address constitutional issues, the court explained, its discovery orders would provide the factual development necessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion into the Executives constitutional authority.  The court then ordered respondents to submit a discovery plan, approved that plan in due course, entered orders allowing discovery to proceed, and denied the Governments motion for certification under 28 U. S. C. 1292(b) with respect to the discovery orders.


Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to vacate the discovery orders and for other relief, but the court dismissed the mandamus petition on the ground that alternative avenues of relief remained available.  Citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, the court held that petitioners, in order to guard against intrusion into the Presidents prerogatives, must first assert executive privilege with particularity in the District Court.  If the lower court sustained the privilege, the appeals court observed, petitioners would be able to obtain all the relief they sought; but if the District Court rejected the claim, mandamus might well be appropriate.  So long as the separation-of-powers conflict remained hypothetical, the court held, it had no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.  Although acknowledging that the scope of respondents discovery requests was overly broad, the appeals court nonetheless agreed with the District Court that petitioners should bear the burden of invoking executive privilege and of objecting to the discovery orders with detailed precision.
Held:
1.Respondents preliminary argument that the mandamus petition was jurisdictionally out of time is rejected.  Respondents assert that, because the Governments basic argument was one of discovery immunityi.e., it need not invoke executive privilege or make particular objections to the discovery requeststhe mandamus petition should have been filed within 60 days after the District Court denied the motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B).  On this theory, the last day for any filing in the appeals court was September 9, 2002, whereas the mandamus petition and notice of appeal were not filed until November 7.  However, Rule 4(a), by its plain terms, applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.  It is inapplicable to the mandamus petition under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S.nbsp;C. 1651.  Respondents alternative argument that the mandamus petition was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches also fails.  Laches might be a bar where the petitioner slept on his rights and especially if the delay was prejudicial.  Chapman v. County of Douglas, 107 U. S. 348, 355.  Here, however, the flurry of motions the Government filed after the District Court denied the dismissal motion overcomes respondents argument.  Nor does the Court accept their argument that laches should apply because those Government motions amounted to little more than dilatory tactics.  Given the drastic nature of mandamus and this Courts holdings that the writ may not issue while alternative avenues of relief remain available, the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to resolve the dispute through less drastic means.  Pp.79. 


2.The Court of Appeals erred in concluding it lacked authority to issue mandamus because the Government could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege in the District Court.  Pp.921.


(a)Mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really extraordinary causes.  Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S. 258, 259260.  While the conditions for obtaining it may be demanding, they are not insuperable.  This Court has issued mandamus to, inter alia, restrain a lower court whose actions would threaten the separation of powers by embarrassing the Executive Branch.  Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 588.  Were the Vice President not a party, the argument that the Court of Appeals should have entertained a mandamus action might present different considerations.  Here, however, the Vice President and his Group comembers are the subjects of the discovery orders.  The mandamus petition alleges that the orders threaten substantial intrusions on the process by which those closest to the President advise him.  These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable, through mandamus or otherwise.  A Presidents communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any ordinary individual.  Nixon, 418 U. S., at 715.  While the President is not above the law, the Judiciary must afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest possible protection, ibid., recognizing the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties.  These separation-of-powers considerations should inform a court of appeals evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President.  Accepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branchs ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities.  See Ex parte Peru, supra, at 587.  Pp.912.


(b)The Court of Appeals labored under the mistaken assumption that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition to the Governments separation-of-powers objections.  In its view, the requirement that the Vice President and his Group colleagues bear the burden of invoking executive privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with detailed precision was mandated by Nixons rejection of an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances, 418 U. S., at 706.  The appeals courts analysis overlooks fundamental differences between this case and Nixon, which cannot bear the weight the court put on it.  Unlike this case, which concerns requests for information for use in a civil suit, Nixon involved the proper balance between the Executives interest in the confidentiality of its communications and the constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding.  Id., at 713.  The distinction between criminal and civil proceedings is not just a matter of formalism in this context.  The right to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have the same constitutional dimensions as it does in the criminal context.  Id., at 711.  Withholding necessary materials in an ongoing criminal case constitutes an impermissible impairment of another branchs essential functions.  Id., at 711.  Withholding the information in this case does not hamper such essential functions in quite the same way.  The District Court ordered discovery here, not to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain whether FACAs disclosure requirements apply to the Group at all.  This situation cannot, in fairness, be compared to Nixon, where a courts ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to resolve cases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinged on the availability of certain indispensable information.  Another important factor here is the burden imposed by the discovery orders.  This is not a routine discovery dispute.  The discovery requests are directed to the Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the Group to give advice and make recommendations to the President.  Special considerations control when the Executives interests in maintaining its autonomy and safeguarding its communications confidentiality are implicated.  See, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 707.  Even when compared against Nixons criminal subpoenas involving the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents position.  There are no checks in civil discovery analogous to the constraints imposed in the criminal justice system to filter out insubstantial legal claims.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions and private attorneys obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive Branch.  Finally, the narrowly tailored subpoena orders in Nixon, which precisely identified and specific[ally]  enumerated  the relevant materials, 418 U. S., at 688, and n.5, stand in marked contrast to the overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court.  Given that disparity, this Courts precedents provide no support for the appeals courts requirement that the Executive Branch bear the burden of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections.  Indeed, those precedents suggest just the opposite.  See, e.g., Clinton, supra, at 705.  Contrary to their conclusions, Nixon did not leave the lower courts the sole option of inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege.  Rather, they could have narrowed the scope of the discovery orders on their own.  In deciding whether to issue mandamus, the Court of Appeals must not only determine whether there are exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power, Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, or a clear abuse of discretion, Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U. S. 379, 383, but must also ask whether the District Courts actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.  Pp.1220.


(c)Absent overriding concerns such as the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, see Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 111, the Court declines to direct the Court of Appeals to issue mandamus against the District Court.  This is not a case where, having considered the issues, the appeals court abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ.  Instead, it relied on its mistaken reading of Nixon and prematurely terminated its inquiry without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case or exercising its discretion to determine whether mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.  Because issuance of the writ is vested in the discretion of the court to which to petition is made, this Court leaves it to the Court of Appeals to address the parties arguments and other matters bearing on whether mandamus should issue, bearing in mind the burdens imposed on the Executive Branch in any future proceedings.  Special considerations applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the lower courts should be sensitive to Government requests for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, e.g., whether the statute embodies the de facto membership doctrine.  Pp.2021.

Special considerations control when the Executives interests in maintaining its autonomy and safeguarding its communications confidentiality are implicated.  See, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 707.  Even when compared against Nixons criminal subpoenas involving the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents position.  There are no checks in civil discovery analogous to the constraints imposed in the criminal justice system to filter out insubstantial legal claims.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions and private attorneys obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the Executive Branch.  Finally, the narrowly tailored subpoena orders in Nixon, which precisely identified and specific[ally]  enumerated  the relevant materials, 418 U. S., at 688, and n.5, stand in marked contrast to the overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court.  Given that disparity, this Courts precedents provide no support for the appeals courts requirement that the Executive Branch bear the burden of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections.  Indeed, those precedents suggest just the opposite.  See, e.g., Clinton, supra, at 705.  Contrary to their conclusions, Nixon did not leave the lower courts the sole option of inviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege.  Rather, they could have narrowed the scope of the discovery orders on their own.  In deciding whether to issue mandamus, the Court of Appeals must not only determine whether there are exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power, Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, or a clear abuse of discretion, Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U. S. 379, 383, but must also ask whether the District Courts actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties.  Pp.1220.


(c)Absent overriding concerns such as the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, see Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 111, the Court declines to direct the Court of Appeals to issue mandamus against the District Court.  This is not a case where, having considered the issues, the appeals court abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ.  Instead, it relied on its mistaken reading of Nixon and prematurely terminated its inquiry without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case or exercising its discretion to determine whether mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.  Because issuance of the writ is vested in the discretion of the court to which to petition is made, this Court leaves it to the Court of Appeals to address the parties arguments and other matters bearing on whether mandamus should issue, bearing in mind the burdens imposed on the Executive Branch in any future proceedings.  Special considerations applicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that the lower courts should be sensitive to Government requests for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, e.g., whether the statute embodies the de facto membership doctrine.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 021603. Argued February 24, 2004Decided June 24, 2004
After respondents murder conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, this Court decided Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, in which it held invalid capital sentencing schemes requiring juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously.  After respondents state postconviction Mills claim was rejected by the State Supreme Court on the merits, he turned to the federal courts.  Ultimately, the Third Circuit applied the analytical framework set forth in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, under which federal habeas petitioners may not avail themselves of new rules of constitutional criminal procedure outside two narrow exceptions; concluded that Mills did not announce a new rule and therefore could be applied retroactively; and granted respondent relief.
Held:Because Mills announced a new rule of constitutional criminal procedure that does not fall within either Teague exception, its rule cannot be applied retroactively.  Pp.414.
(a)Teague analysis involves a three-step process requiring a court to determine when a defendants conviction became final; whether, given the legal landscape at the time the conviction became final, the rule sought to be applied is actually new; and, if so, whether it falls within either of two exceptions to nonretroactivity.  P.4.


(b)Respondents conviction became final before Mills was decided.  The normal rule for determining a state convictions finality for retroactivity reviewwhen the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a certiorari petition has elapsed or a timely petition has been finally deniedapplies here.  That the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the merits of respondents Mills claim on collateral review does change his convictions finality to a date subsequent to Mills.  Pp.46.


(c)Mills announced a new rule.  In reaching its conclusion in Mills and McKoy, this Court relied on a line of cases beginning with Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586.  Locketts general rule that the sentencer must be allowed to consider any mitigating evidence could be thought to support the conclusion in Mills and McKoy that capital sentencing schemes cannot require juries to disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously, but it did not mandate the Mills rule.  Each of the cases relied on by Mills (and McKoy) considered only obstructions to the sentencers ability to consider mitigating evidence.  Mills innovation rests with its shift in focus to individual jurors.  Moreover, there is no need to guess whether reasonable jurists could have differed as to whether the Lockett line of cases compelled Mills.  Four dissenting Justices in Mills reasoned that because nothing prevented the jury from hearing the mitigating evidence, Lockett did not control; and three dissenting Justices in McKoy concluded that Lockett did not remotely support the new focus on individual jurors.  Because the Mills rule broke new ground, it applies to respondent on collateral review only if it falls under a Teague exception.  Pp.610.


(d)The Mills rule does not fall within either exception.  There is no argument that the first exception applies here.  And this Court has repeatedly emphasized the limited scope of the second exceptionfor watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding, ODell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 157which is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that  are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, ibid.  This Court has yet to find a new rule that falls under this exception.  In providing guidance as to what might do so, the Court has repeatedly, and only, referred to the right-to-counsel rule of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, which altered [the Courts] understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding, Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242.  The Court has not hesitated to hold less sweeping and fundamental rules outside the exception.  See, e.g., ODell v. Netherland, supra.  While Mills and McKoy were decided to avoid potentially arbitrary impositions of the death sentence, the Mills rule has none of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon, Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495.  It applies narrowly and works no fundamental shift in the Courts understanding of the bedrock procedural elementsessential to fundamental fairness, ODell, supra, at 167.

NEVADA, HUMBOLDT COUNTY, et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 035554. Argued March 22, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
Petitioner Hiibel was arrested and convicted in a Nevada court for refusing to identify himself to a police officer during an investigative stop involving a reported assault.  Nevadas stop and identify statute requires a person detained by an officer under suspicious circumstances to identify himself.  The state intermediate appellate court affirmed, rejecting Hiibels argument that the state laws application to his case violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:Petitioners conviction does not violate his Fourth Amendment rights or the Fifth Amendments prohibition on self-incrimination.  Pp.313.
(a)State stop and identify statutes often combine elements of traditional vagrancy laws with provisions intended to regulate police behavior in the course of investigatory stops.  They vary from State to State, but all permit an officer to ask or require a suspect to disclose his identity.  In Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 167171, this Court invalidated a traditional vagrancy law for vagueness because of its broad scope and imprecise terms.  The Court recognized similar constitutional limitations in Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 52, where it invalidated a conviction for violating a Texas stop and identify statute on Fourth Amendment grounds, and in Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, where it invalidated on vagueness grounds Californias modified stop and identify statute that required a suspect to give an officer credible and reliable identification when asked to identify himself, id., at 360.  This case begins where those cases left off.  Here, the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in Brown.  Further, Hiibel has not alleged that the Nevada statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender.  This statute is narrower and more precise.  In contrast to the credible and reliable identification requirement in Kolender, the Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted the instant statute to require only that a suspect disclose his name.  It apparently does not require him to produce a drivers license or any other document.  If he chooses either to state his name or communicate it to the officer by other means, the statute is satisfied and no violation occurs.  Pp.36.


(b)The officers conduct did not violate Hiibels Fourth Amendment rights.  Ordinarily, an investigating officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Amendment.  INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 216.  Beginning with Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, the Court has recognized that an officers reasonable suspicion that a person may be involved in criminal activity permits the officer to stop the person for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further.  Although it is well established that an officer may ask a suspect to identify himself during a Terry stop, see, e.g., United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S. 221, 229, it has been an open question whether the suspect can be arrested and prosecuted for refusal to answer, see Brown, supra, at 53, n.3.  The Court is now of the view that Terry principles permit a State to require a suspect to disclose his name in the course of a Terry stop.  Terry, supra, at 34.  The Nevada statute is consistent with Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures because it properly balances the intrusion on the individuals interests against the promotion of legitimate government interests.  See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 654.  An identity request has an immediate relation to the Terry stops purpose, rationale, and practical demands, and the threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request does not become a legal nullity.  On the other hand, the statute does not alter the nature of the stop itself, changing neither its duration nor its location.  Hiibel argues unpersuasively that the statute circumvents the probable-cause requirement by allowing an officer to arrest a person for being suspicious, thereby creating an impermissible risk of arbitrary police conduct.  These familiar concerns underlay Kolender, Brown, and Papachristou.  They are met by the requirement that a Terry stop be justified at its inception and be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the initial stop.  Terry, 392 U. S., at 20.  Under those principles, an officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the identification request is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.  Cf. Hayes v. Florida, 470 U. S. 811, 817.  The request in this case was a commonsense inquiry, not an effort to obtain an arrest for failure to identify after a Terry stop yielded insufficient evidence.  The stop, the request, and the States requirement of a response did not contravene the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.610.


(c)Hiibels contention that his conviction violates the Fifth Amendments prohibition on self-incrimination fails because disclosure of his name and identity presented no reasonable danger of incrimination.  The Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelled testimony that is incriminating, see Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 598, and protects only against disclosures that the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used, Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 445.  Hiibels refusal to disclose was not based on any articulated real and appreciable fear that his name would be used to incriminate him, or that it would furnish evidence needed to prosecute him.  Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486.  It appears he refused to identify himself only because he thought his name was none of the officers business.  While the Court recognizes his strong belief that he should not have to disclose his identity, the Fifth Amendment does not override the Nevada Legislatures judgment to the contrary absent a reasonable belief that the disclosure would tend to incriminate him.  Answering a request to disclose a name is likely to be so insignificant as to be incriminating only in unusual circumstances.  See, e.g., Baltimore City Dept. of Social Servs. v. Bouknight, 493 U. S. 549, 555.  If a case arises where there is a substantial allegation that furnishing identity at the time of a stop would have given the police a link in the chain of evidence needed to convict the individual of a separate offense, the court can then consider whether the Fifth Amendment privilege applies, whether it has been violated, and what remedy must follow.  Those questions need not be resolved here.  1013.

|542 u.s. 200|"AETNA HEALTH INC., fka AETNA U. S. HEALTHCARE INC.et al. v. DAVILA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 021845. Argued March 23, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
Respondents brought separate Texas state-court suits, alleging that petitioners, their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), had refused to cover certain medical services in violation of an HMOs duty to exercise ordinary care under the Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA), and that those refusals proximately caused respondents injuries.  Petitioners removed the cases to federal courts, claiming that the actions fit within the scope of, and were thus completely pre-empted by, 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Courts agreed, declined to remand the cases to state court, and dismissed the complaints with prejudice after respondents refused to amend them to bring explicit ERISA claims.  Consolidating these and other cases, the Fifth Circuit reversed.  It found that respondents claims did not fall under ERISA 502(a)(2), which allows suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty to the plan, because petitioners were being sued for mixed eligibility and treatment decisions that were not fiduciary in nature, see Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211; and did not fall within the scope of 502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits, because THCLA did not duplicate that cause of action, see Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355.
Held:Respondents state causes of action fall within ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), and are therefore completely pre-empted by ERISA 502 and removable to federal court.  Pp.420.
(a)When a federal statute completely pre-empts a state-law cause of action, the state claim can be removed.  See Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8.  ERISA is such a statute.  Because its purpose is to provide a uniform regulatory regime, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, such an ERISA 502(a)s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is exclusively a federal concern, Alessi v. Raybestos&nbhyph;Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523.  Any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants ERISAs civil enforcement remedy conflicts with clear congressional intent to make that remedy exclusive, and is therefore pre-empted.  ERISA 502(a)s pre-emptive force is still stronger.  Since ERISA 502(a)(1)(B)s pre-emptive force mirrors that of 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 6566, and since 301 converts state causes of actions into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety of removal, so too does ERISA 502(a)(1)(B).  Pp.47.


(b)If an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), and where no other independent legal duty is implicated by a defendants actions, then the individuals cause of action is completely pre-empted by ERISA 502(a)(1)(B).  Respondents brought suit only to rectify wrongful benefits denials, and their only relationship with petitioners is petitioners partial administration of their ERISA-regulated benefit plans; respondents therefore could have brought 502(a)(1)(B) claims to recover the allegedly wrongfully denied benefits.  Both respondents allege violations of the THCLAs duty of ordinary care, which they claim is entirely independent of any ERISA duty or the employee benefits plans at issue.  However, respondents claims do not arise independently of ERISA or the plan terms.  If a managed care entity correctly concluded that, under the relevant plans terms, a particular treatment was not covered, the plans failure to cover the requested treatment would be the proximate cause of any injury arising from the denial.  More significantly, the THCLA provides that a managed care entity is not subject to THCLA liability if it denies coverage for a treatment not covered by the plan it administers.  Pp. 712.


(c)The Fifth Circuits reasons for reaching its contrary conclusion are all erroneous.  First, it found significant that respondents asserted tort, rather than contract, claims and that they were not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied.  However, distinguishing between pre-empted and non-pre-empted claims based on the particular label affixed to them would allow parties to evade ERISAs pre-emptive scope simply by relabeling contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contracts.  And the fact that a state cause of action attempts to authorize remedies beyond those that ERISA 502(a) authorizes does not put it outside the scope of ERISAs civil enforcement mechanism.  See, e.g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 43.  Second, the court believed the plans wording immaterial because the claims invoked an external ordinary care duty, but the wording is material to the state causes of action and the THCLA creates a duty that is not external to respondents rights under their respective plans.  Finally, nowhere in Rush Prudential did this Court suggest that ERISA 502(a)s pre-emptive force is limited to state causes of action that precisely duplicate an ERISA 502(a) cause.  Nor would it be consistent with this Courts precedent to do so.  Pp. 1214.


(d)Also unavailing is respondents argument that the THCLA is a law regulating insurance that is saved from pre-emption by ERISA 514(b)(2)(A).  This Courts understanding of 514(b)(2)(A) is informed by the overpowering federal policy embodied in ERISA 502(a), which is intended to create an exclusive federal remedy, Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 52.  Allowing respondents to proceed with their state-law suits would pose an obstacle to that objective.  Ibid.  Pp.1416.


(e)Pegrams holding that an HMO is not intended to be treated as a fiduciary to the extent that it makes mixed eligibility decisions acting through its physicians is not implicated here because petitioners coverage decisions are pure eligibility decisions.  A benefit determination under ERISA is part and parcel of the ordinary fiduciary responsibilities connected to the administration of a plan.  That it is infused with medical judgments does not alter this result.  Pegram itself recognized this principle, see 530 U. S., at 231232.  And ERISA and its implementing regulations confirm this interpretation.  Here, petitioners are neither respondents treating physicians nor those physicians employees.  Pp.1619.

			"|"AETNA HEALTH INC., fka AETNA U. S. HEALTHCARE INC.et al. v. DAVILA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 021845. Argued March 23, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
Respondents brought separate Texas state-court suits, alleging that petitioners, their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), had refused to cover certain medical services in violation of an HMOs duty to exercise ordinary care under the Texas Health Care Liability Act (THCLA), and that those refusals proximately caused respondents injuries.  Petitioners removed the cases to federal courts, claiming that the actions fit within the scope of, and were thus completely pre-empted by, 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Courts agreed, declined to remand the cases to state court, and dismissed the complaints with prejudice after respondents refused to amend them to bring explicit ERISA claims.  Consolidating these and other cases, the Fifth Circuit reversed.  It found that respondents claims did not fall under ERISA 502(a)(2), which allows suit against a plan fiduciary for breaches of fiduciary duty to the plan, because petitioners were being sued for mixed eligibility and treatment decisions that were not fiduciary in nature, see Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211; and did not fall within the scope of 502(a)(1)(B), which provides a cause of action for the recovery of wrongfully denied benefits, because THCLA did not duplicate that cause of action, see Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U. S. 355.
Held:Respondents state causes of action fall within ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), and are therefore completely pre-empted by ERISA 502 and removable to federal court.  Pp.420.
(a)When a federal statute completely pre-empts a state-law cause of action, the state claim can be removed.  See Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8.  ERISA is such a statute.  Because its purpose is to provide a uniform regulatory regime, ERISA includes expansive pre-emption provisions, such an ERISA 502(a)s integrated enforcement mechanism, which are intended to ensure that employee benefit plan regulation is exclusively a federal concern, Alessi v. Raybestos&nbhyph;Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523.  Any state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants ERISAs civil enforcement remedy conflicts with clear congressional intent to make that remedy exclusive, and is therefore pre-empted.  ERISA 502(a)s pre-emptive force is still stronger.  Since ERISA 502(a)(1)(B)s pre-emptive force mirrors that of 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S. 58, 6566, and since 301 converts state causes of actions into federal ones for purposes of determining the propriety of removal, so too does ERISA 502(a)(1)(B).  Pp.47.


(b)If an individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA 502(a)(1)(B), and where no other independent legal duty is implicated by a defendants actions, then the individuals cause of action is completely pre-empted by ERISA 502(a)(1)(B).  Respondents brought suit only to rectify wrongful benefits denials, and their only relationship with petitioners is petitioners partial administration of their ERISA-regulated benefit plans; respondents therefore could have brought 502(a)(1)(B) claims to recover the allegedly wrongfully denied benefits.  Both respondents allege violations of the THCLAs duty of ordinary care, which they claim is entirely independent of any ERISA duty or the employee benefits plans at issue.  However, respondents claims do not arise independently of ERISA or the plan terms.  If a managed care entity correctly concluded that, under the relevant plans terms, a particular treatment was not covered, the plans failure to cover the requested treatment would be the proximate cause of any injury arising from the denial.  More significantly, the THCLA provides that a managed care entity is not subject to THCLA liability if it denies coverage for a treatment not covered by the plan it administers.  Pp. 712.


(c)The Fifth Circuits reasons for reaching its contrary conclusion are all erroneous.  First, it found significant that respondents asserted tort, rather than contract, claims and that they were not seeking reimbursement for benefits denied.  However, distinguishing between pre-empted and non-pre-empted claims based on the particular label affixed to them would allow parties to evade ERISAs pre-emptive scope simply by relabeling contract claims as claims for tortious breach of contracts.  And the fact that a state cause of action attempts to authorize remedies beyond those that ERISA 502(a) authorizes does not put it outside the scope of ERISAs civil enforcement mechanism.  See, e.g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 43.  Second, the court believed the plans wording immaterial because the claims invoked an external ordinary care duty, but the wording is material to the state causes of action and the THCLA creates a duty that is not external to respondents rights under their respective plans.  Finally, nowhere in Rush Prudential did this Court suggest that ERISA 502(a)s pre-emptive force is limited to state causes of action that precisely duplicate an ERISA 502(a) cause.  Nor would it be consistent with this Courts precedent to do so.  Pp. 1214.


(d)Also unavailing is respondents argument that the THCLA is a law regulating insurance that is saved from pre-emption by ERISA 514(b)(2)(A).  This Courts understanding of 514(b)(2)(A) is informed by the overpowering federal policy embodied in ERISA 502(a), which is intended to create an exclusive federal remedy, Pilot Life, 481 U.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03221. Argued April 26, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
Five days before the 1-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) would have run, respondent filed two pro se mixed federal habeas petitionsthose containing both unexhausted and exhausted claimsand motions to stay the petitions while he returned to state court to exhaust the unexhausted claims.  The Magistrate Judge gave him three options:(1) The petitions could be dismissed without prejudice and respondent could refile after exhausting the unexhausted claims; (2) the unexhausted claims could be dismissed and he could proceed with only the exhausted claims; or (3) he could contest the Magistrate Judges finding that some claims were unexhausted.  He chose the first option with respect to one petition and failed to respond with respect to the other.  The Federal District Court dismissed his petitions without prejudice.  He then filed habeas petitions in the California Supreme Court, which were both denied.  The federal court dismissed his subsequently refiled pro se habeas petitions with prejudice as untimely under AEDPA, see 28 U. S.C. 2254(d), and denied him a certificate of appealability (COA).  The Ninth Circuit granted a COA, concluding that his initial petitions were timely under 2254(d) and that his later petitions related back to the initial ones.  The Ninth Circuit determined that although the District Court correctly concluded that it did not have discretion to stay respondents mixed petitions, it could have acted on his stay motions had he chosen the Magistrate Judges second option and then renewed the prematurely filed stay motions.  It also held that the District Court had to give respondent two specific warnings: first, that it could not consider his motions to stay the mixed petitions unless he chose to amend them and dismiss the then-unexhausted claims; and second, if applicable, that his federal claims would be time barred, absent cause for equitable tolling, upon his return to federal court if he opted to dismiss the petitions without prejudice and return to state court to exhaust all his claims.
Held:The District Court was not required to provide the warnings directed by the Ninth Circuit.  Pp.49.
(a)Federal district courts must dismiss mixed habeas petitions.  Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 522.  The combined effect of Rose and AEDPAs limitations period is that if a petitioner comes to federal court with a mixed petition toward the end of the limitations period, a dismissal of his mixed petition could result in the loss of all his claimsincluding those already exhaustedbecause the limitations period could expire during the time he returns to state court to exhaust his unexhausted claims.  To address this, the Ninth Circuit allows a district court to employ a stay-and-abeyance procedure, which involves (1) dismissal of any unexhausted claims from the original mixed habeas petition; (2) a stay of the remaining claims, pending exhaustion of the dismissed unexhausted claims in state court; and (3) amendment of the original petition to add the newly exhausted claims that then relate back to the original petition.  Here, the Ninth Circuit held that if a pro se prisoner files a mixed petition, the district court must give two specific warnings regarding the stay-and-abeyance procedure.  But federal district judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se litigants.  See, e.g., McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 183184.  Explaining the details of federal habeas procedure and calculating statutes of limitations are tasks normally and properly performed by trained counsel.  Requiring district courts to advise pro se litigants in such a manner would undermine district judges role as impartial decisionmakers.  And the warnings run the risk of being misleading.  The first could encourage the use of stay-and-abeyance when it is not in the petitioners best interest.  The second would force upon judges the potentially burdensome task of making a case-specific calculation of whether the AEDPA limitations period has already run or will have run by the time the petitioner returns to federal court.  Because such calculations depend upon information contained in documents that do not necessarily accompany the petition, a district judges calculation could be in error and thereby misinform a pro se petitioner.  Respondents argument that Rose requires that a prisoner be given the choice of returning to state court to exhaust his claims or amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court, 455 U. S., at 510, is unavailing.  Rose requires only that a district court dismiss mixed petitions, which, as a practical matter, means that the prisoner must follow one of these two paths if he wants to proceed with his federal petition.  Nothing in Rose requires that both options be equally attractive, or that district judges give specific advisements as to the availability and wisdom of these options.  Respondents reliance on Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. ___, is misplaced, because Castro dealt with a district courts sU. S.onte recharacterization of a prisoners pleading and did not address whether a district court is required to explain a pro se litigants options before a voluntary dismissal.  Pp.48.

|542 u.s. 241|"INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02572. Argued April 20, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
In 1964, pursuant to a recommendation by the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission), and as part of an endeavor to improve judicial assistance between the United States and foreign countries, Congress completely revised 28 U. S.C. 1782(a).  In its current form, 1782(a) provides that a federal district court may order a person residing or found in the district to give testimony or produce documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal  upon the application of any interested person.  The 1964 overhaul of 1782(a) deleted the prior laws words, in any judicial proceeding pending in any court in a foreign country.  (Emphasis added.)


Respondent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with the Directorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) of the Commission of the European Communities (Commission), alleging that Intel had violated European competition law.  After the DG-Competition declined AMDs recommendation to seek documents Intel had produced in a private antitrust suit in an Alabama federal court, AMD petitioned the District Court for the Northern District of California under 1782(a) for an order directing Intel to produce those documents.  The District Court concluded that 1782(a) did not authorize such discovery.  The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to rule on the applications merits.  The appeals court observed that 1782(a) includes matters before bodies of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature, and, since 1964, has contained no limitation to foreign proceedings that are pending.  A proceeding judicial in character, the Ninth Circuit noted, was a likely sequel to the Commission investigation.  The Court of Appeals rejected Intels argument that 1782(a) called for a threshold showing that the documents AMD sought, if located in the European Union, would have been discoverable in the Commission investigation.  Nothing in 1782(a)s language or legislative history, the Ninth Circuit said, required a foreign-discoverability rule of that order.
Held:Section 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, the District Court to provide discovery aid to AMD.  Pp.923.
1.To provide context, the Court summarizes how the Commission, acting through the DG-Competition, enforces European competition laws.  Upon receiving a complaint, or sU. S.onte, the DG-Competition conducts a preliminary investigation into alleged violations of those laws.  The DG-Competition may consider information provided by a complainant, and it may seek information from a complaints target.  The DG-Competitions investigation results in a formal written decision whether to pursue the complaint.  If the DG-Competition decides not to proceed, its decision may be reviewed by the Court of First Instance and, ultimately, the Court of Justice for the European Communities (European Court of Justice).  When the DG-Competition pursues a complaint, it typically serves the investigations target with a formal statement of objections and advises the target of its intention to recommend a decision finding an antitrust violation.  The target is entitled to a hearing before an independent officer, who provides a report to the DG-Competition.  Once the DG-Competition makes its recommendation, the Commission may dismiss the complaint or issue a decision holding the target liable and imposing penalties.  The Commissions final action is subject to review in the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice.  Lacking formal litigant status in Commission proceedings, a complainant nonetheless has significant procedural rights.  Important here, a complainant may submit relevant information to the DG-Competition and seek judicial review of the Commissions disposition.  Pp.911.


2.Section 1782(a)s language, confirmed by its context, warrants the conclusion that the provision authorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a Commission proceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling.  The Court therefore rejects the categorical limitations Intel would place on the statutes reach.  Pp.1120.


(a)A complainant before the Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an interested person within 1782(a)s compass.  The Court rejects Intels contention that interested person[s] does not include complainants, but encompasses only litigants, foreign sovereigns, and a sovereigns designated agents.  To support its reading, Intel highlights 1782s caption, [a]ssistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals (emphasis added).  A statutes caption, however, cannot undo or limit its texts plain meaning.  Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529.  Section 1782(a) plainly reaches beyond the universe of persons designated litigant.  With significant participation rights in Commission proceedings, the complainant qualifies as an interested person within any fair construction of that term.  Pp.1113.


(b)The assistance AMD seeks meets 1782(a)s specification for use in a foreign or international tribunal.  The Commission qualifies as a tribunal when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker.  Both the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice are tribunals, but not proof-takers.  Their review is limited to the record before the Commission.  Hence, AMD could use evidence in those reviewing courts only by submitting it to the Commission in the current, investigative stage.  In adopting the Rules Commissions recommended replacement of the term any judicial proceeding with the words a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, Congress opened the way for judicial assistance in foreign administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.  This Court has no warrant to exclude the Commission, to the extent that it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker, from 1782(a)s ambit.  Pp.1314.


(c)The proceeding for which discovery is sought under 1782(a) must be within reasonable contemplation, but need not be pending or imminent.  The Court rejects Intels argument that the Commission investigation launched by AMDs complaint does not qualify for 1782(a) assistance.  Since the 1964 revision, which deleted the prior laws reference to pending, Congress has not limited judicial assistance under 1782(a) to pending adjudicative proceedings.  This Court presumes that Congress intends its statutory amendments to have real and substantial effect.  Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397.  The 1964 revisions legislative history corroborates Congress recognition that judicial assistance would be available for both foreign proceedings and investigations.  A 1996 amendment clarifies that 1782(a) covers criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.  Nothing in that amendment, however, suggests that Congress meant to rein in, rather than to confirm, by way of example, the range of discovery 1782(a) authorizes.  Pp.1415. 


(d)Section 1782(a) does not impose a foreign-discoverability requirement.  Although 1782(a) expressly shields from discovery matters protected by legally applicable privileges, nothing in 1782(a)s text limits a district courts production-order authority to materials discoverable in the foreign jurisdiction if located there.  Nor does the legislative history suggest that Congress intended to impose a blanket foreign-discoverability rule on 1782(a) assistance.  The Court rejects two policy concerns raised by Intel in support of a foreign-discoverability limitation on 1782(a) aidavoiding offense to foreign governments, and maintaining parity between litigants.  While comity and parity concerns may be legitimate touchstones for a district courts exercise of discretion in particular cases, they do not warrant construction of 1782(a)s text to include a generally applicable foreign-discoverability rule.  Moreover, the Court questions whether foreign governments would be offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but not requiring, judicial assistance.  A foreign nation may limit discovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its own legal practices, culture, or traditions; such reasons do not necessarily signal objection to aid from United States federal courts.  A foreign tribunals reluctance to order production of materials present in the United States similarly may signal no resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to 1782(a). When the foreign tribunal would readily accept relevant information discovered in the United States, application of a categorical foreign-discoverability rule would be senseless.  Concerns about parity among adversaries in litigation likewise provide no sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule.  When information is sought by an interested person, a district court can condition relief upon reciprocal information exchange.  Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on its acceptance of information, thereby maintaining whatever measure of parity it deems appropriate.  The Court also rejects Intels suggestion that a 1782(a) applicant must show that United States law would allow discovery in domestic litigation analogous to the foreign proceeding.  Section 1782 is a provision for assistance to tribunals abroad.  It does not direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.  Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.  For example, the United States has no close analogue to the Commission regime, under which AMD lacks party status and can participate only as a complainant.  Pp.1520.


3.Whether 1782(a) assistance is appropriate in this case is yet unresolved.  To guide the District Court on remand, the Court notes factors relevant to that question.  First, when the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding, as Intel is here, the need for 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad.  A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.  In contrast, nonparticipants in foreign proceedings may be outside the foreign tribunals jurisdictional reach; thus, their evidence, available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent 1782(a) aid.  Second, a court presented with a 1782(a) request may consider the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government, court, or agency to federal-court judicial assistance.  Further, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on 1782(a)s scope may be relevant in determining whether a discovery order should be granted in a particular case.  Specifically, a district court could consider whether the 1782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering limits or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.  Also, unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed.  The Court declines, at this juncture, Intels suggestion that it exercise its supervisory authority to adopt rules barring 1782(a) discovery here.  Any such endeavor should await further experience with 1782(a) applications in the lower courts.  Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.  While Intel and its amici are concerned that granting AMDs application in any part may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage fishing expeditions, and undermine the Commissions program offering prosecutorial leniency for admissions of wrongdoing, no one has suggested that AMDs complaint to the Commission is pretextual.  Nor has it been shown that 1782(a)s preservation of legally applicable privileges and the controls on discovery available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2) and (c) would be ineffective to prevent discovery of Intels confidential information.  The Court leaves it to the courts below, applying closer scrutiny, to assure an airing adequate to determine what, if any, assistance is appropriate.  Pp.2023.

			"|"INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02572. Argued April 20, 2004Decided June 21, 2004
In 1964, pursuant to a recommendation by the Commission on International Rules of Judicial Procedure (Rules Commission), and as part of an endeavor to improve judicial assistance between the United States and foreign countries, Congress completely revised 28 U. S.C. 1782(a).  In its current form, 1782(a) provides that a federal district court may order a person residing or found in the district to give testimony or produce documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal  upon the application of any interested person.  The 1964 overhaul of 1782(a) deleted the prior laws words, in any judicial proceeding pending in any court in a foreign country.  (Emphasis added.)


Respondent Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), filed an antitrust complaint against petitioner Intel Corporation (Intel) with the Directorate-General for Competition (DG-Competition) of the Commission of the European Communities (Commission), alleging that Intel had violated European competition law.  After the DG-Competition declined AMDs recommendation to seek documents Intel had produced in a private antitrust suit in an Alabama federal court, AMD petitioned the District Court for the Northern District of California under 1782(a) for an order directing Intel to produce those documents.  The District Court concluded that 1782(a) did not authorize such discovery.  The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded with instructions to rule on the applications merits.  The appeals court observed that 1782(a) includes matters before bodies of a quasi-judicial or administrative nature, and, since 1964, has contained no limitation to foreign proceedings that are pending.  A proceeding judicial in character, the Ninth Circuit noted, was a likely sequel to the Commission investigation.  The Court of Appeals rejected Intels argument that 1782(a) called for a threshold showing that the documents AMD sought, if located in the European Union, would have been discoverable in the Commission investigation.  Nothing in 1782(a)s language or legislative history, the Ninth Circuit said, required a foreign-discoverability rule of that order.
Held:Section 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require, the District Court to provide discovery aid to AMD.  Pp.923.
1.To provide context, the Court summarizes how the Commission, acting through the DG-Competition, enforces European competition laws.  Upon receiving a complaint, or sU. S.onte, the DG-Competition conducts a preliminary investigation into alleged violations of those laws.  The DG-Competition may consider information provided by a complainant, and it may seek information from a complaints target.  The DG-Competitions investigation results in a formal written decision whether to pursue the complaint.  If the DG-Competition decides not to proceed, its decision may be reviewed by the Court of First Instance and, ultimately, the Court of Justice for the European Communities (European Court of Justice).  When the DG-Competition pursues a complaint, it typically serves the investigations target with a formal statement of objections and advises the target of its intention to recommend a decision finding an antitrust violation.  The target is entitled to a hearing before an independent officer, who provides a report to the DG-Competition.  Once the DG-Competition makes its recommendation, the Commission may dismiss the complaint or issue a decision holding the target liable and imposing penalties.  The Commissions final action is subject to review in the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice.  Lacking formal litigant status in Commission proceedings, a complainant nonetheless has significant procedural rights.  Important here, a complainant may submit relevant information to the DG-Competition and seek judicial review of the Commissions disposition.  Pp.911.


2.Section 1782(a)s language, confirmed by its context, warrants the conclusion that the provision authorizes, but does not require, a federal district court to provide assistance to a complainant in a Commission proceeding that leads to a dispositive ruling.  The Court therefore rejects the categorical limitations Intel would place on the statutes reach.  Pp.1120.


(a)A complainant before the Commission, such as AMD, qualifies as an interested person within 1782(a)s compass.  The Court rejects Intels contention that interested person[s] does not include complainants, but encompasses only litigants, foreign sovereigns, and a sovereigns designated agents.  To support its reading, Intel highlights 1782s caption, [a]ssistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals (emphasis added).  A statutes caption, however, cannot undo or limit its texts plain meaning.  Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 529.  Section 1782(a) plainly reaches beyond the universe of persons designated litigant.  With significant participation rights in Commission proceedings, the complainant qualifies as an interested person within any fair construction of that term.  Pp.1113.


(b)The assistance AMD seeks meets 1782(a)s specification for use in a foreign or international tribunal.  The Commission qualifies as a tribunal when it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker.  Both the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Justice are tribunals, but not proof-takers.  Their review is limited to the record before the Commission.  Hence, AMD could use evidence in those reviewing courts only by submitting it to the Commission in the current, investigative stage.  In adopting the Rules Commissions recommended replacement of the term any judicial proceeding with the words a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, Congress opened the way for judicial assistance in foreign administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings.  This Court has no warrant to exclude the Commission, to the extent that it acts as a first-instance decisionmaker, from 1782(a)s ambit.  Pp.1314.


(c)The proceeding for which discovery is sought under 1782(a) must be within reasonable contemplation, but need not be pending or imminent.  The Court rejects Intels argument that the Commission investigation launched by AMDs complaint does not qualify for 1782(a) assistance.  Since the 1964 revision, which deleted the prior laws reference to pending, Congress has not limited judicial assistance under 1782(a) to pending adjudicative proceedings.  This Court presumes that Congress intends its statutory amendments to have real and substantial effect.  Stone v. INS, 514 U. S. 386, 397.  The 1964 revisions legislative history corroborates Congress recognition that judicial assistance would be available for both foreign proceedings and investigations.  A 1996 amendment clarifies that 1782(a) covers criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.  Nothing in that amendment, however, suggests that Congress meant to rein in, rather than to confirm, by way of example, the range of discovery 1782(a) authorizes.  Pp.1415. 


(d)Section 1782(a) does not impose a foreign-discoverability requirement.  Although 1782(a) expressly shields from discovery matters protected by legally applicable privileges, nothing in 1782(a)s text limits a district courts production-order authority to materials discoverable in the foreign jurisdiction if located there.  Nor does the legislative history suggest that Congress intended to impose a blanket foreign-discoverability rule on 1782(a) assistance.  The Court rejects two policy concerns raised by Intel in support of a foreign-discoverability limitation on 1782(a) aidavoiding offense to foreign governments, and maintaining parity between litigants.  While comity and parity concerns may be legitimate touchstones for a district courts exercise of discretion in particular cases, they do not warrant construction of 1782(a)s text to include a generally applicable foreign-discoverability rule.  Moreover, the Court questions whether foreign governments would be offended by a domestic prescription permitting, but not requiring, judicial assistance.  A foreign nation may limit discovery within its domain for reasons peculiar to its own legal practices, culture, or traditions; such reasons do not necessarily signal objection to aid from United States federal courts.  A foreign tribunals reluctance to order production of materials present in the United States similarly may signal no resistance to the receipt of evidence gathered pursuant to 1782(a). When the foreign tribunal would readily accept relevant information discovered in the United States, application of a categorical foreign-discoverability rule would be senseless.  Concerns about parity among adversaries in litigation likewise provide no sound basis for a cross-the-board foreign-discoverability rule.  When information is sought by an interested person, a district court can condition relief upon reciprocal information exchange.  Moreover, the foreign tribunal can place conditions on its acceptance of information, thereby maintaining whatever measure of parity it deems appropriate.  The Court also rejects Intels suggestion that a 1782(a) applicant must show that United States law would allow discovery in domestic litigation analogous to the foreign proceeding.  Section 1782 is a provision for assistance to tribunals abroad.  It does not direct United States courts to engage in comparative analysis to determine whether analogous proceedings exist here.  Comparisons of that order can be fraught with danger.  For example, the United States has no close analogue to the Commission regime, under which AMD lacks party status and can participate only as a complainant.  Pp.1520.


3.Whether 1782(a) assistance is appropriate in this case is yet unresolved.  To guide the District Court on remand, the Court notes factors relevant to that question.  First, when the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding, as Intel is here, the need for 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad.  A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.  In contrast, nonparticipants in foreign proceedings may be outside the foreign tribunals jurisdictional reach; thus, their evidence, available in the United States, may be unobtainable absent 1782(a) aid.  Second, a court presented with a 1782(a) request may consider the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government, court, or agency to federal-court judicial assistance.  Further, the grounds Intel urged for categorical limitations on 1782(a)s scope may be relevant in determining whether a discovery order should be granted in a particular case.  Specifically, a district court could consider whether the 1782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering limits or other policies of a foreign country or the United States.  Also, unduly intrusive or burdensome requests may be rejected or trimmed.  The Court declines, at this juncture, Intels suggestion that it exercise its supervisory authority to adopt rules barring 1782(a) discovery here.  Any such endeavor should await further experience with 1782(a) applications in the lower courts.  Several facets of this case remain largely unexplored.  While Intel and its amici are concerned that granting AMDs application in any part may yield disclosure of confidential information, encourage fishing expeditions, and undermine the Commissions program offering prosecutorial leniency for admissions of wrongdoing, no one has suggested that AMDs complaint to the Commission is pretextual.  Nor has it been shown that 1782(a)s preservation of legally applicable privileges and the controls on discovery available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2) and (c) would be ineffective to prevent discovery of Intels confidential information.  The Court leaves it to the courts below, applying closer scrutiny, to assure an airing adequate to determine what, if any, assistance is appropriate.  Pp.2023.

|542 u.s. 55|"NORTON, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, et al. v. SOUTHERN UTAH WILDERNESS ALLIANCE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 03101. Argued March 29, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an Interior Department agency, manages the Utah land at issue here under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA).  Pursuant to 43 U. S.C. 1782, the Secretary of the Interior has identified certain federal lands as wilderness study areas (WSAs) and recommended some of these as suitable for wilderness designation.  Land designated as wilderness by Act of Congress enjoys special protection; until Congress acts, the Secretary must manage [WSAs]  so as not to impair the[ir] suitability for preservation as wilderness. 1782(c).  In addition, each WSA or other area is managed in accordance with a land use plan, 1732(a), a BLM document which generally describes, for a particular area, allowable uses, goals for the lands future condition, and next steps.  43 CFR 1601.05(k).  Respondents Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and others (collectively SUWA) sought declaratory and injunctive relief for BLMs failure to act to protect Utah public lands from environmental damage caused by off-road vehicles (ORVs), asserting three claims relevant here, and contending that they could sue under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed, 5 U. S.C. 706(1).  The Tenth Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the claims.
Held:BLMs alleged failures to act are not remediable under the APA.  Pp.517.
(a)A 706(1) claim can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.  The discrete-action limitation precludes a broad programmatic attack such as that rejected in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, and the required-action limitation rules out judicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law.  Pp.59.


(b)SUWA first claims that BLM violated 1782(c)s nonimpairment mandate by permitting ORV use in certain WSAs.  While 1782(c) is mandatory as to the object to be achieved, it leaves BLM discretion to decide how to achieve that object.  SUWA argues that the nonimpairment mandate will support an APA suit, but a general deficiency in compliance lacks the requisite specificity.  The principal purpose of this limitation is to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack the expertise and information to resolve.  If courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they would necessarily be empowered to decide whether compliance was achieved.  The APA does not contemplate such pervasive federal-court oversight.  Pp.911.


(c)SUWA also claims that BLMs failure to comply with provisions of its land use plans contravenes the requirement that the Secretary manage public lands in accordance with such plans, 43 U. S.C. 1732(a).  A land use plan, however, is a tool to project present and future use.  Unlike a specific statutory command requiring an agency to promulgate regulations by a certain date, a land use plan is generally a statement of priorities; it guides and restrains actions, but does not prescribe them.  A statement about what BLM plans to do, if it has funds and there are not more pressing priorities, cannot be plucked out of context and made a basis for a 706(1) suit.  The land use plan statements at issue here are not a legally binding commitment enforceable under 706(1).  Pp.1116.


(d)SUWA finally contends that BLM did not fulfill its obligation under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to take a hard look at whether to supplement its environmental impact statement (EIS) to take increased ORV use into account.  Because the applicable regulation requires an EIS to be supplemented where there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts, 40 CFR 1502.9(c)(1)(ii), an agency must take a hard look at new information to assess the need for supplementation, Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 385.  However, supplementation is required only if there remains major Federal actio[n] to occur, id., at 374.  Since the BLMs approval of its land use plan was the action that required the EIS; and since that plan has already been approved; there is no ongoing major Federal action that could require supplementation.  Pp.1617. 
301 F.3d 1217, reversed and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

|542 u.s. 74|"UNITED STATES v. DOMINGUEZ BENITEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03167. Argued April 21, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
After respondent Dominguez Benitez (hereinafter Dominguez) confessed to selling drugs to an informant, he was indicted on drug possession and conspiracy counts.  On the conspiracy count, he faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.  His plea agreement with the Government provided that Dominguez would plead guilty to conspiracy and the Government would dismiss the possession charge; that he would receive a safety-valve reduction of two levels, which would allow the court to authorize a sentence below the otherwise mandatory 10-year minimum; that the agreement did not bind the sentencing court; and that he could not withdraw his plea if the court rejected the Governments stipulations or recommendations.  He pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, but, in the plea colloquy, the court failed to mention (though the written plea agreement did say) that Dominguez could not withdraw his plea if the court did not accept the Governments recommendations.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(B).  The Probation Office subsequently found that Dominguez had three prior convictions, making him ineligible for the safety valve, so the District Court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum.  On appeal, Dominguez argued, for the first time, that the District Courts failure to warn him, as Rule 11(c)(3)(B) instructs, that he could not withdraw his plea if the court did not accept the Governments recommendations required reversal.  The Ninth Circuit agreed, citing United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, in applying Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52s plain-error standard.
Held:To obtain relief for an unpreserved Rule 11 failing, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have pleaded guilty.  Pp.511.
(a)When a defendant is dilatory in raising Rule 11 error, reversal is unwarranted unless the error is plain.  United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 63.  Except for certain structural errors undermining the criminal proceedings fairness as a whole, relief for error is tied to prejudicial effect, and the standard phrased as error that affects substantial rights, as used in Rule 52, means error with a prejudicial effect on a judicial proceedings outcome.  See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750.  Kotteakos held that to affect substantial rights, an error must have substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the  verdict.  Id., at 776.  Where the burden of demonstrating prejudice (or materiality) is on the defendant seeking relief, this Court has invoked a similar standard, which requires a reasonable probability that, but for [the error claimed], the result of the proceeding would have been different is required.  United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  For defendants such as Dominguez, the burden of establishing entitlement to plain-error relief should not be too easy: First, the standard should enforce the policies underpinning Rule 52(b) generally, to encourage timely objections and reduce wasteful reversals by demanding strenuous exertion to get relief for unpreserved error, see Vonn, supra, at 73; and second, it should respect the particular importance of the finality of guilty pleas, which usually rest on a defendants profession of guilt in open court, and are indispensable in the modern criminal justice systems operation, see United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784.  Pp.58.


(b)The Ninth Circuits test in this case fell short.  Its first element (whether the error was minor or technical) requires no examination of the omitted warnings effect on a defendants decision, a failing repeated to a significant extent by the tests second element (whether the defendant understood the rights at issue when he pleaded guilty).  That courts standard does not allow consideration of evidence tending to show that a misunderstanding was inconsequential to a defendants decision, or evidence indicating the relative significance of other facts that may have borne on his choice regardless of any Rule 11 error.  Nor does it consider the overall strength of the Governments case.  When, as here, the record shows both a controlled drug sale to an informant and a confession, one can fairly ask what a defendant seeking to withdraw his plea thought he could gain by going to trial.  The point is not to second-guess the defendants actual decision, but to enquire whether the omitted warning would have made the difference required by the standard of reasonable probability; it is hard to see here how the warning could have affected Dominguezs assessment of his strategic position.  Also, the plea agreement, read to Dominguez in his native Spanish, specifically warned that he could not withdraw his plea if the court refused to accept the Governments recommendations; this fact, uncontested by Dominguez, tends to show that the Rule 11 error made no difference to the outcome here.  Pp.911.

Plaintiffs-respondents, Arizona taxpayers, filed suit in federal court against the Director of Arizonas Department of Revenue (Director) seeking to enjoin the operation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 431089 on Establishment Clause grounds.  Arizonas law authorizes an income-tax credit for payments to nonprofit school tuition organizations (STOs) that award scholarships to students in private elementary or secondary schools.  Section 431089 provides that STOs may not designate schools that discriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status or national origin, 431089(F), but does not preclude STOs from designating schools that provide religious instruction or give religion-based admissions preferences.  The District Court granted the Directors motion to dismiss on the ground that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U. S.C. 1341, barred the suit.  The TIA prohibits lower federal courts from restraining the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the TIA does not bar federal-court actions challenging state tax credits.  
Held: 
1. The Court rejects respondents contention that the Directors certiorari petition was jurisdictionally untimely under 28 U. S.C. 2101(c) and this Courts Rule 13(3).  Section 2101(c) instructs that a petition must be filed within ninety days after the entry of  judgment, and this Courts Rule 13(3) elaborates on that statutes instruction.  More than 90 days elapsed between the date the Ninth Circuit first entered judgment and the date the Directors petition was filed.  That time lapse, respondents assert, made the filing untimely under Rule 13(3)s first sentence: [T]he time to file  runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed.  Moreover, respondents submit, because no party petitioned for rehearing, the extended filing periods prescribed by the Rules second sentence never came into play.  This case, however, did not follow the typical course.  The Ninth Circuit, on its own initiative, had recalled its mandate and ordered the parties to brief the question whether the case should be reheard en banc.  That order, this Court holds, suspended the judgments finality under 2101(c), just as a timely filed rehearing petition would or a courts appropriate decision to consider a late-filed rehearing petition, see Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 49.  The Court of Appeals order raised the question whether that court would modify the judgment and alter the parties rights; thus, while the court-initiated briefing order was pending, there was no judgment to be reviewed.  See, e.g., id., at 46.  The Directors certiorari petition was timely under the statute because it was filed within 90 days of the date the Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  Were this Court to read Rule 13 as the sole guide, so that only a partys rehearing petition could reset the statutes 90-day count, the Court would lose sight of the congressional objective underpinning 2101(c): An appellate courts final adjudication, Congress indicated, marks the time from which the filing period begins to run.  The statute takes priority over the procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business.  Schacht v. United States, 398 U. S. 58, 64.  Because the petition was timely under 2101(c), the Court has jurisdiction.  Pp.58.


2.The TIA does not bar respondents suit.  Pp. 822.


(a)To determine whether the TIA bars this litigation, it is appropriate, first, to identify the relief sought.  Respondents seek prospective relief only: injunctive relief prohibiting the Director from allowing taxpayers to utilize the 431089 tax credit for payments to STOs that make religion-based tuition grants; a declaration that 431089, on its face and as applied, violates the Establishment Clause; and an order that the Director inform such STOs that all funds in their possession as of the orders date must be paid into the state general fund.  Taking account of the prospective nature of the relief requested, the Court reaches the dispositive question whether respondents suit seeks to enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law, 1341.  The answer turns on the meaning of the term assessment as employed in the TIA.  For Internal Revenue Code (IRC) purposes, an assessment involves a recording of the amount the taxpayer owes the Government.  26 U. S.C. 6203.  The Court does not focus on the word assessment in isolation, however, but follows the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context.  General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. ___, ___.  In the TIA and tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax, i.e., the assessment is the official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts.  Complementing the cardinal rule just stated, the rule against superfluities instructs courts to interpret a statute to effectuate all its provisions, so that no part is rendered superfluous.  If, as the Director asserts, the term assessment, by itself, signified the entire taxing plan, the TIA would not need the words levy or collection; the term assessment, alone, would do all the necessary work.  In briefing United States v. Galletti, 541 U. S. ___, the Government made clear that, under the IRC definition, an assessment serves as the trigger for levy and collection efforts.  The Government did not describe assessment as synonymous with the entire taxation plan, nor disassociate the word from the company (levy or collection) it keeps.  Instead, and in accord with this Courts understanding, the Government related assessment to the terms collection-propelling function.  Pp.811.


(b)Congress modeled 1341 on earlier federal statutes of similar import, which in turn paralleled state provisions proscribing state-court actions to enjoin the collection of state and local taxes.  Congress drew particularly on the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA), which bars any court from entertaining a suit brought for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any [federal] tax.  26 U. S.C. 7421(a).  This Court has recognized, from the AIAs text, that the measure serves twin purposes: It responds to the Governments need to assess and collect taxes expeditiously with a minimum of preenforcement judicial interference; and it requires that the legal right to disputed sums be determined in a refund suit.  E.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U. S. 725, 736.  Lower federal courts have similarly comprehended 7421(a).  Just as the AIA shields federal tax collections from federal-court injunctions, so the TIA shields state tax collections from federal-court restraints.  In both 26 U. S.C. 7421(a) and 28 U. S.C. 1341, Congress directed taxpayers to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain collections.  Third-party suits not seeking to stop the collection (or contest the validity) of a tax imposed on plaintiffs were outside Congress purview.  The TIAs legislative history shows that, in enacting the statute, Congress focused on taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their state tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the taxing authority.   Nowhere does the history announce a sweeping congressional direction to prevent federal-court interference with all aspects of state tax administration.  The foregoing understanding of the TIAs purposes and legislative history underpins this Courts previous applications of that statute.  See, e.g., California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 408409.  Id., at 410, distinguished.  Contrary to the Directors assertion, Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., 520 U. S. 821; National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Commn, 515 U. S. 582; Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100; and Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat. Bank, 450 U. S. 503, do not hold that state tax administration matters must be kept entirely free from lower federal-court interference.  Like Grace Brethren Church, all of those cases fall within 1341s undisputed compass: All involved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).  Federal-court relief, therefore, would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.  Those decisions are not fairly portrayed cut loose from their secure, state-revenue-protective moorings.  See, e.g., Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S., at 410.  This Court has interpreted and applied the TIA only in cases Congress wrote the statute to address, i.e., cases in which state taxpayers seek federal-court orders enabling them to avoid paying state taxes.  The Court has read harmoniously the 1341 instruction conditioning the jurisdictional bar on the availability of a plain, speedy and efficient remedy in state court.  The remedy inspected in the Courts decisions was not designed for the universe of plaintiffs who sue the State, but was tailor-made for taxpayers.  See, e.g., id., at 411.  Pp.1117.


(c)In other federal courts as well, 1341 has been read to restrain taxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their liability for state taxes, but not to stop third parties from pursuing constitutional challenges to state tax benefits in a federal forum.  Further, numerous federal-court decisionsincluding decisions of this Court reviewing lower federal-court judgmentshave reached the merits of third-party constitutional challenges to tax benefits without mentioning the TIA.  See, e.g., Byrne v. Public Funds for Public Schools of New Jersey, 442 U. S. 907; Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 377 U. S. 218.  Consistent with the decades-long understanding prevailing on this issue, respondents suit may proceed without any TIA impediment.  Pp.1721.
307 F.3d 1011, affirmed.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, OConnor, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Kennedy, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined.

|542 u.s. 129|"PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 0395. Argued March 31, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
In March 1998, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) hired plaintiff-respondent Suders to work as a police communications operator for the McConnellsburg barracks, where her male supervisors subjected her to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment.  In June 1998, Suders told the PSPs Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, Virginia Smith-Elliott, that she might need help, but neither woman followed up on the conversation.  Two months later, Suders contacted Smith-Elliott again, this time reporting that she was being harassed and was afraid.  Smith-Elliott told Suders to file a complaint, but did not tell her how to obtain the necessary form.  Two days later, Suders supervisors arrested her for theft of her own computer-skills exam papers.  Suders had removed the papers after concluding that the supervisors had falsely reported that she had repeatedly failed, when in fact, the exams were never forwarded for grading.  Suders then resigned from the force and sued the PSP, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.


The District Court granted the PSPs motion for summary judgment.  Although recognizing that Suders testimony would permit a fact trier to conclude that her supervisors had created a hostile work environment, the court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors conduct.  In support of its decision, the District Court referred to Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 808.  In that case, and in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, decided the same day, this Court held that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.  524 U. S., at 765.  But when no such tangible action is taken, both decisions also hold, the employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability.  To prevail on the basis of the defense, the employer must prove that (a) [it] exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that (b) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.  Ibid.  Suders hostile work environment claim was untenable as a matter of law, the District Court stated, because she unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSPs internal antiharassment procedures.  The court did not address Suders constructive discharge claim.


The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for trial.  The appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two key respects: First, even if the PSP could assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, genuine issues of material fact existed about the effectiveness of the PSPs program to address sexual harassment claims; second, Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to hostile work environment.  The appeals court ruled that a constructive discharge, if proved, constitutes a tangible employment action that renders an employer strictly liable and precludes recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense.
Held:To establish constructive discharge, a plaintiff alleging sexual harassment must show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response.  An employer may assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense to such a claim unless the plaintiff quit in reasonable response to an adverse action officially changing her employment status or situation, e.g., a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which she would face unbearable working conditions.  Pp.921.
(a)Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employees reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.  The inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employees position would have felt compelled to resign?  This doctrine was developed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the 1930s, and was solidly established in the lower federal courts by 1964, when Title VII was enacted.  The Court agrees that Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.  Pp.911.


(b)This case concerns employer liability for one subset of constructive discharge claims: those resulting from sexual harassment, or hostile work environment, attributable to a supervisor.  The Courts starting point is the Ellerth/Faragher framework.  Those decisions delineate two categories of sexual harassment claims: (1) those alleging a tangible employment action, for which employers may be held strictly liable; and (2) those asserting no tangible employment action, in which case employers may assert the affirmative defense.  Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765.  The key issues here are: Into which Ellerth/Faragher category hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall, and what proof burdens the parties bear in such cases.  In Ellerth and Faragher, the Court invoked the principle drawn from agency law that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent is aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.  Id., at 758.  When a supervisor engaged in harassing conduct takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate, the Court reasoned, it is beyond question that the supervisor is aided by the agency relation.  A tangible employment action, the Court stated, is an official act of the enterprise and fall[s] within the special province of the supervisor.  Id., at 762.  In contrast, when supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, Ellerth and Faragher explained, it is less obvious that the agency relation is the driving force.  The Court also recognized that a liability limitation linked to an employers effort to install effective grievance procedures and an employees effort to report harassing behavior would advance Title VIIs conciliation and deterrence purposes.  Id., at 764.  Accordingly, the Court held that when no tangible employment action is taken, an employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing the two-part affirmative defense.  That defense, the Court observed, accommodates the avoidable consequences doctrine Title VII borrows from tort law, ibid., by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm.  Ellerth and Faragher clarify, however, that the defending employer bears the burden to prove that the plaintiff-employee unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm.  Faragher, at 807.  Pp.1115.


(1)The constructive discharge at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment.   For an atmosphere of harassment or hostility to be actionable, the offending behavior must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the victims employment conditions and create an abusive working environment.  Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67.  A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.  Suders claim is of the same genre as the claims analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher.  Essentially, Suders presents a worse case harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point.  Like the harassment considered in Ellerth and Faragher, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts.  Unlike an actual termination, which is always effected through an official company act, a constructive discharge may or may not involve official action.  When it does not, the extent to which the agency relationship aided the supervisors misconduct is less certain, and that uncertainty justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.  The Third Circuit erred in drawing the line differently.  Pp.1519.


(2)The Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself constitutes a tangible employment action under Ellerth and Faragher: The affirmative defense delineated in those cases, the court noted, might be imported into the anterior issue whether the employees decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances.  However, the appeals court left open when and how the Ellerth/Faragher considerations would be brought home to the fact trier.  The Court of Appeals did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens, but simply relied on the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers antiharassment programs and to employees exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial.  325 F.3d, at 463.  There is no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided.  Following Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard.  Pp.1921.


(c)Although the Third Circuit correctly ruled that the case, in its current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims, that court erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases.  P.21.  
325 F.3d 432, vacated and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and Stevens, OConnor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 0395. Argued March 31, 2004Decided June 14, 2004
In March 1998, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) hired plaintiff-respondent Suders to work as a police communications operator for the McConnellsburg barracks, where her male supervisors subjected her to a continuous barrage of sexual harassment.

Suders then resigned from the force and sued the PSP, alleging, inter alia, that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and constructively discharged, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.


The District Court granted the PSPs motion for summary judgment.  Although recognizing that Suders testimony would permit a fact trier to conclude that her supervisors had created a hostile work environment, the court nevertheless held that the PSP was not vicariously liable for the supervisors conduct.  In support of its decision, the District Court referred to Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 808.  In that case, and in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, decided the same day, this Court held that an employer is strictly liable for supervisor harassment that culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.  524 U.

To prevail on the basis of the defense, the employer must prove that (a) [it] exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that (b) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.  Ibid.  Suders hostile work environment claim was untenable as a matter of law, the District Court stated, because she unreasonably failed to avail herself of the PSPs internal antiharassment procedures.  The court did not address Suders constructive discharge claim.


The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the case for trial.  The appeals court disagreed with the District Court in two key respects: First, even if the PSP could assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, genuine issues of material fact existed about the effectiveness of the PSPs program to address sexual harassment claims; second, Suders had stated a claim of constructive discharge due to hostile work environment.  The appeals court ruled that a constructive discharge, if proved, constitutes a tangible employment action that renders an employer strictly liable and precludes recourse to the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense.
Held:To establish constructive discharge, a plaintiff alleging sexual harassment must show that the abusive working environment became so intolerable that her resignation qualified as a fitting response.  An employer may assert the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense to such a claim unless the plaintiff quit in reasonable response to an adverse action officially changing her employment status or situation, e.g., a humiliating demotion, extreme cut in pay, or transfer to a position in which she would face unbearable working conditions.  Pp.921.
(a)Under the constructive discharge doctrine, an employees reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.  The inquiry is objective: Did working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employees position would have felt compelled to resign?  This doctrine was developed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the 1930s, and was solidly established in the lower federal courts by 1964, when Title VII was enacted.  The Court agrees that Title VII encompasses employer liability for a constructive discharge.  Pp.911.


(b)This case concerns employer liability for one subset of constructive discharge claims: those resulting from sexual harassment, or hostile work environment, attributable to a supervisor.  The Courts starting point is the Ellerth/Faragher framework.  Those decisions delineate two categories of sexual harassment claims: (1) those alleging a tangible employment action, for which employers may be held strictly liable; and (2) those asserting no tangible employment action, in which case employers may assert the affirmative defense.  Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765.  The key issues here are: Into which Ellerth/Faragher category hostile-environment constructive discharge claims fall, and what proof burdens the parties bear in such cases.  In Ellerth and Faragher, the Court invoked the principle drawn from agency law that an employer is liable for the acts of its agent when the agent is aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.  Id., at 758.  When a supervisor engaged in harassing conduct takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate, the Court reasoned, it is beyond question that the supervisor is aided by the agency relation.  A tangible employment action, the Court stated, is an official act of the enterprise and fall[s] within the special province of the supervisor.  Id., at 762.  In contrast, when supervisor harassment does not culminate in a tangible employment action, Ellerth and Faragher explained, it is less obvious that the agency relation is the driving force.  The Court also recognized that a liability limitation linked to an employers effort to install effective grievance procedures and an employees effort to report harassing behavior would advance Title VIIs conciliation and deterrence purposes.  Id., at 764.  Accordingly, the Court held that when no tangible employment action is taken, an employer may defeat vicarious liability for supervisor harassment by establishing the two-part affirmative defense.  That defense, the Court observed, accommodates the avoidable consequences doctrine Title VII borrows from tort law, ibid., by requiring plaintiffs reasonably to stave off avoidable harm.  Ellerth and Faragher clarify, however, that the defending employer bears the burden to prove that the plaintiff-employee unreasonably failed to avoid or reduce harm.  Faragher, at 807.  Pp.1115.


(1)The constructive discharge at issue stems from, and can be regarded as an aggravated case of, sexual harassment or hostile work environment.   For an atmosphere of harassment or hostility to be actionable, the offending behavior must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the victims employment conditions and create an abusive working environment.  Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67.  A hostile-environment constructive discharge claim entails something more: working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign.  Suders claim is of the same genre as the claims analyzed in Ellerth and Faragher.  Essentially, Suders presents a worse case harassment scenario, harassment ratcheted up to the breaking point.  Like the harassment considered in Ellerth and Faragher, harassment so intolerable as to cause a resignation may be effected through co-worker conduct, unofficial supervisory conduct, or official company acts.  Unlike an actual termination, which is always effected through an official company act, a constructive discharge may or may not involve official action.  When it does not, the extent to which the agency relationship aided the supervisors misconduct is less certain, and that uncertainty justifies affording the employer the chance to establish, through the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, that it should not be held vicariously liable.  The Third Circuit erred in drawing the line differently.  Pp.1519.


(2)The Third Circuit qualified its holding that a constructive discharge itself constitutes a tangible employment action under Ellerth and Faragher: The affirmative defense delineated in those cases, the court noted, might be imported into the anterior issue whether the employees decision to resign was reasonable under the circumstances.  However, the appeals court left open when and how the Ellerth/Faragher considerations would be brought home to the fact trier.  The Court of Appeals did not address specifically the allocation of pleading and persuasion burdens, but simply relied on the wisdom and expertise of trial judges to exercise their gatekeeping authority when assessing whether all, some, or none of the evidence relating to employers antiharassment programs and to employees exploration of alternative avenues warrants introduction at trial.  325 F.3d, at 463.  There is no cause for leaving the district courts thus unguided.  Following Ellerth and Faragher, the plaintiff who alleges no tangible employment action has the duty to mitigate harm, but the defendant bears the burden to allege and prove that the plaintiff failed in that regard.  Pp.1921.


(c)Although the Third Circuit correctly ruled that the case, in its current posture, presents genuine issues of material fact concerning Suders hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims, that court erred in declaring the affirmative defense described in Ellerth and Faragher never available in constructive discharge cases.  P.21.  
325 F.3d 432, vacated and remanded.

|541 u.s. 677|"REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA et al. v. ALTMANN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 0313. Argued February 25, 2004Decided June 7, 2004
Upon evidence that certain of her uncles valuable art works had either been seized by the Nazis or expropriated by Austria after World War II, respondent filed this action in Federal District Court to recover six of the paintings from petitioners, Austria and its instrumentality, the Austrian Gallery.  She asserts jurisdiction under 2 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.C. 1330(a), which authorizes federal civil suits against foreign states as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity under another section of the FSIA or under any applicable international agreement.  She further asserts that petitioners are not entitled to immunity under the FSIAs expropriation exception, 1605(a)(3), which expressly exempts from immunity certain cases involving rights in property taken in violation of international law.  Petitioners moved to dismiss based on, inter alia, the two-part claim that (1) as of 1948, when much of their alleged wrongdoing took place, they would have enjoyed absolute sovereign immunity from suit in United States courts, and that (2) nothing in the FSIA retroactively divests them of that immunity.  Rejecting this argument, the District Court concluded, among other things, that the FSIA applies retroactively to pre-1976 actions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The FSIA applies to conduct, like petitioners alleged wrongdoing, that occurred prior to the Acts 1976 enactment and even prior to the United States 1952 adoption of the so-called restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.  Pp.924.
(a)This Court has long deferred to Executive Branch sovereign immunity decisions.  Until 1952, Executive policy was to request immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns.  In that year, the State Department began to apply the restrictive theory, whereby immunity is recognized with regard to a foreign states sovereign or public acts, but not its private acts.  Although this change had little impact on federal courts, which continued to abide by the Departments immunity suggestions, Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 487, the change threw immunity decisions into some disarray: Foreign nations diplomatic pressure sometimes prompted the Department to file suggestions of immunity in cases in which immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory; and when foreign nations failed to ask the Department for immunity, the courts had to determine whether immunity existed, so responsibility for such determinations lay with two different branches, ibid.  To remedy these problems, the FSIA codified the restrictive principle and transferred primary responsibility for immunity determinations to the Judicial Branch.  The Act grants federal courts jurisdiction over civil actions against foreign states and carves out the expropriation and other exceptions to its general grant of immunity.  In any such action, the district courts subject-matter jurisdiction depends on the applicability of one of those exceptions.  Id., at 493494.  Pp.913.


(b)This case is not controlled by Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244.  In describing the general presumption against retroactive application of a statute, the Court there declared, inter alia, that, if a federal law enacted after the events in suit does not expressly prescribe its own proper reach but does operate retroactivelyi.e., would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completedit does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring that result.  Id., at 280.  Though seemingly comprehensive, this inquiry does not provide a clear answer here.  None of the three examples of retroactivity mentioned above fits the FSIAs clarification of sovereign immunity law.  However, the preliminary conclusion that the FSIA does not appear to operate retroactively within the meaning of Landgrafs default rule creates some tension with the Courts observation in Verlinden that the FSIA is not simply a jurisdictional statute, but a codification of the standards governing foreign sovereign immunity as an aspect of substantive federal law.  461 U. S., at 496497 (emphasis added).  And while the FSIAs preamble suggests that it applies to preenactment conduct, that statement by itself falls short of the requisite express prescription.  Thus Landgrafs default rule does not definitively resolve this case.  While Landgrafs antiretroactivity presumption aims to avoid unnecessary post hoc changes to legal rules on which private parties relied in shaping their primary conduct, however, foreign sovereign immunitys principal purpose is to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some present protection from the inconvenience of suit, Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 479.  In this sui generis context, it is more appropriate, absent contraindications, to defer to the most recent decision of the political branches on whether to take jurisdiction, the FSIA, than to presume that decision inapplicable merely because it postdates the conduct in question.  Pp.1318.


(c)Nothing in the FSIA or the circumstances surrounding its enactment suggests that it should not be applied to petitioners 1948 actions.  Indeed, clear evidence that Congress intended it to apply to preenactment conduct lies in its preambles statement that foreign states immunity [c]laims  should henceforth be decided by [American] courts  in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter, 1602 (emphasis added).  Though perhaps not sufficient to satisfy Landgrafs express command requirement, 511 U. S., at 280, this language is unambiguous: Immunity claimsnot actions protected by immunity, but assertions of immunity to suits arising from those actionsare the relevant conduct regulated by the Act and are henceforth to be decided by the courts.  Thus, Congress intended courts to resolve all such claims in conformity with [FSIA] principles regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.  The FSIAs overall structure strongly supports this conclusion: Many of its provisions unquestionably apply to cases arising out of conduct that occurred before 1976, see, e.g., Dole Food Co., supra, and its procedural provisions undoubtedly apply to all pending cases.  In this context, it would be anomalous to presume that an isolated provision (such as the expropriation exception on which respondent relies) is of purely prospective application absent any statutory language to that effect.  Finally, applying the FSIA to all pending cases regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred is most consistent with two of the Acts principal purposes: clarifying the rules judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims and eliminating political participation in the resolution of such claims.  Pp.1822.


(d)This holding is extremely narrow.  The Court does not review the lower courts determination that 1605(a)(3) applies here, comment on the application of the so-called act of state doctrine to petitioners alleged wrongdoing, prevent the State Department from filing statements of interest suggesting that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction in particular cases implicating foreign sovereign immunity, or express an opinion on whether deference should be granted such filings in cases covered by the FSIA.  The issue here concerns only the interpretation of the FSIAs reacha pure question of statutory construction  well within the province of the Judiciary.  INS v. Cardoza&nbhyph;Fonseca, 480 U.

et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 02891. Argued April 19, 2004Decided June 7, 2004
Respondents (collectively, Heinz) are retired participants in a multiemployer pension plan (hereinafter Plan) administered by petitioner.  Heinz retired from the construction industry after accruing enough pension credits to qualify for early retirement payments under a service only pension scheme that pays him the same monthly benefit he would have received had he retired at the usual age.  The Plan prohibits such beneficiaries from certain disqualifying employment after they retire, suspending monthly payments until they stop the forbidden work.  When Heinz retired, the Plan defined disqualifying employment to include a job as a construction worker but not as a supervisor, the job Heinz took.  In 1998, the Plan expanded its definition to include any construction industry job and stopped Heinzs payments when he did not leave his supervisors job.  Heinz sued to recover the suspended benefits, claiming that the suspension violated the anti-cutback rule of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which prohibits any pension plan amendment that would reduce a participants accrued benefit, ERISA 204(g), 29 U. S.C. 1054(g).  The District Court granted the Plan judgment on the pleadings, but the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that imposing new conditions on rights to benefits already accrued violates the anti-cutback rule.
Held:ERISA 204(g) prohibits a plan amendment expanding the categories of postretirement employment that triggers suspension of the payment of early retirement benefits already accrued.  Pp.311.
(a)The anti-cutback provision is crucial to ERISAs central object of protecting employees justified expectations of receiving the benefits that they have been promised, see Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887.  The provision prohibits plan amendments that have the effect of  eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit. 29 U. S.C. 1054(g)(2).  The question here is whether the Plans amendment had such an effect.  Although the statutory text is not as helpful as it might be, it is clear as a matter of common sense that a benefit has suffered under the amendment.  Heinz accrued benefits under a plan allowing him to supplement his retirement income, and he reasonably relied on that plans terms in planning his retirement.  The 1998 amendment undercut that reliance, paying benefits only if he accepted a substantial curtailment of his opportunity to do the kind of work he knew.  There is no way that, in any practical sense, this change of terms could not be viewed as shrinking the value of Heinzs pension rights and reducing his promised benefits.  Pp.35.


(b)The Plans technical responses are rejected.  To give the anti-cutback rule the constricted reading urged by the Planapplying it only to amendments directly altering the monthly payments nominal dollar amount and not to a suspension when the amount that would be paid is unalteredwould take textual force majeure, and certainly something closer to irresistible than language in 29 U. S.C. 1002(23)(A) to the effect that accrued benefits are ordinarily expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.  And the Plans argument that 204(g)s eliminat[e] or reduc[e] language does not apply to mere suspensions misses the point.  ERISA permits conditions that are elements of the benefit itself but the question here is whether a new condition may be imposed after a benefit has accrued.  The right to receive certain money on a certain date may not be limited by a new condition narrowing that right.  Pp.56.


(c)This Courts conclusion is confirmed by an Internal Revenue Service regulation that adopts the reading of 204(g) approved here.  Pp.69.


(d)ERISA 203(a)(3)(B), 29 U. S.C. 1053(a)(3)(B)which provides that the right to an accrued benefit shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan suspends benefit payments when beneficiaries like respondents are employed in the same industry and the same geographic area covered by the planis irrelevant to the question here.  Section 203(a) addresses the entirely distinct concept of benefit forfeitures.  And read most simply and in context, 203(a)(3)(B) is a statement about the terms that can be offered to plan participants up front, not as an authorization to adopt retroactive amendments.  Pp.911.

PUBLIC CITIZEN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03358. Argued April 21, 2004Decided June 7, 2004
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental impact of their proposals and actions in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), but Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) if the agencys proposed action neither is categorically excluded from the EIS production requirement nor would clearly require production of an EIS.  An agency that decides, pursuant to an EA, that no EIS is required must issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI).  The Clean Air Act (CAA) leaves States to develop implementation plans to comply with national air quality standards mandated by the Act, and requires federal agencies actions to conform to those state plans, 42 U. S.C. 7506(c)(1).  In 1982, Congress enacted a moratorium, prohibiting, inter alia, Mexican motor carriers from obtaining operating authority within the United States and authorizing the President to lift the moratorium.  In 2001, the President announced his intention to lift the moratorium once new regulations were prepared to grant operating authority to Mexican motor carriers.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) published one proposed rule addressing the application form for such carriers and another addressing the establishment of a safety-inspection regime for carriers receiving operating authority.  Congress subsequently provided, in 350 of a DOT appropriations Act, that no funds appropriated could be obligated or expended to review or process any Mexican motor carriers applications until FMCSA implemented specific application and safety-monitoring requirements.  Acting pursuant to NEPA, FMCSA issued an EA for its proposed rules.  The EA did not consider the environmental impact that might be caused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks in the United States, concluding that any such impact would be an effect of the moratoriums modification, not the regulations implementation.  Concluding that the regulations issuance would have no significant environmental impact, FMCSA issued a FONSI.  In subsequent interim rules, FMCSA relied on the EA and FONSI to demonstrate compliance with NEPA, and determined that any emissions increase from the regulations would fall below the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) threshold levels needed to trigger a conformity review under the CAA.  Before the moratorium was lifted, respondents sought judicial review of the proposed rules, arguing that their promulgation violated NEPA and the CAA.  The Court of Appeals agreed, finding the EA deficient because it did not consider the environmental impact of lifting the moratorium, when that action was reasonably foreseeable at the time FMCSA prepared the EA and directing FMCSA to prepare an EIS and a full CAA conformity determination for the regulations. 
Held:Because FMCSA lacks discretion to prevent cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers, neither NEPA nor the CAA requires FMCSA to evaluate the environmental effects of such operations.  Pp.919.
(a)FMCSA did not violate NEPA or the relevant CEQ regulations.  Pp.916.


(1)An agencys decision not to prepare an EIS can be set aside only if it is arbitrary and capricious, see 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  Respondents argue that the issuance of a FONSI was arbitrary and capricious because the EA did not take into account the environmental effects of an increase in cross-border operations of Mexican motor carriers.  The relevant question, under NEPA, is whether that increase, and the correlative release of emissions, is an effect, 40 CFR 1508.8, of FMCSAs rules; if not, FMCSAs failure to address these effects in the EA did not violate NEPA, and the FONSIs issuance cannot be arbitrary and capricious.  Pp.910.


(2)Respondents have forfeited any objection to the EA on the ground that it did not adequately discuss potential alternatives to the proposed action because respondents never identified in their comments to the rules any alternatives beyond those the EA evaluated.  Pp.1011.


(3)Respondents argue that the EA must take the increased cross-border operations environmental effects into account because 350s expenditure bar makes it impossible for any Mexican truck to operate in the United States until the regulations are issued, and hence the trucks entry is a reasonably foreseeable indirect effect of the issuance of the regulations.  40 CFR 1508.8.  Critically, that argument overlooks FMCSAs inability to countermand the Presidents lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to exclude Mexican trucks from operating in the United States.  While 350 restricted FMCSAs ability to authorize such operations, FMCSA remains subject to 49 U. S.C. 13902(a)(1)s mandate that it register any motor carrier willing and able to comply with various safety and financial responsibility rules.  Only the moratorium prevented it from doing so for Mexican trucks before 2001.  Respondents must rest on but for causation, where an agencys action is considered a cause of an environmental effect even when the agency has no authority to prevent the effect.  However, but for causation is insufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.  NEPA requires a reasonably close causal relationship akin to proximate cause in tort law.  Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U. S. 766, 774.  Also, inherent in NEPA and its implementing regulations is a rule of reason, which ensures that agencies determine whether and to what extent to prepare an EIS based on the usefulness of any new potential information to the decisionmaking process.  The underlying policies behind NEPA and Congress intent, as informed by the rule of reason, make clear that the causal connection between the proposed regulations and the entry of Mexican trucks is insufficient to make FMCSA responsible under NEPA to consider the environmental effects of entry.  Neither of the purposes of NEPAs EIS requirementto ensure both that an agency has information to make its decision and that the public receives information so it might also play a role in the decisionmaking processwill be fulfilled by requiring FMCSA to consider the environmental impact at issue.  Since FMCSA has no ability to prevent such cross-border operations, it lacks the power to act on whatever information might be contained in an EIS and could not act on whatever input the public could provide.  This analysis is not changed by the CEQ regulation requiring an agency to evaluate the cumulative impact of its action, 40 CFR 1508.7, since that rule does not require FMCSA to treat the lifting of the moratorium itself or the consequences from that lifting as an effect of its rules promulgation.  Pp.1116.


(b)FMCSA did not act improperly by not performing a full conformity analysis pursuant to the CAA and relevant regulations.  To ensure that its actions are consistent with 42 U. S.C. 7606, a federal agency must undertake a conformity determination  where the total of direct and indirect emissions in a nonattainment or maintenance area caused by [the] action would equal or exceed certain threshold levels established by the EPA.  40 CFR 93.153(b).  Direct emissions are caused or initiated by the Federal action and occur at the same time and place as the action, 93.152; and indirect emissions are caused by the Federal action but may occur later in time, and may be practicably controlled or maintained by the federal agency, ibid.  Some sort of  but for causation is sufficient for evaluating causation in the conformity review process.  See ibid.  Because it excluded emissions attributable to the increased presence of Mexican trucks within the United States, FMCSA concluded that its regulations would not exceed EPA thresholds.  Although arguably FMCSAs proposed regulations would be but for causes of the entry of Mexican trucks into the United States, such trucks emissions are not direct because they will not occur at the same time or place as the promulgation of the regulations.  And they are not indirect because FMCSA cannot practicably control or maintain control over the emissions: FMCSA has no ability to countermand the Presidents decision to lift the moratorium or to act categorically to prevent Mexican carriers from registering and Mexican trucks from entering the country; and once the regulations are promulgated, FMCSA will not be able to regulate any aspect of vehicle exhaust from those trucks.

PUBLIC CITIZEN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03358. Argued April 21, 2004Decided June 7, 2004
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental impact of their proposals and actions in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), but Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) if the agencys proposed action neither is categorically excluded from the EIS production requirement nor would clearly require production of an EIS.  An agency that decides, pursuant to an EA, that no EIS is required must issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI).  The Clean Air Act (CAA) leaves States to develop implementation plans to comply with national air quality standards mandated by the Act, and requires federal agencies actions to conform to those state plans, 42 U. S.C. 7506(c)(1).  In 1982, Congress enacted a moratorium, prohibiting, inter alia, Mexican motor carriers from obtaining operating authority within the United States and authorizing the President to lift the moratorium.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 021609. Argued March 24, 2004Decided June 7, 2004
Under petitioner citys adult business license ordinance, the citys decision to deny a license may be appealed to the state district court pursuant to Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure.  Respondent Z.J. Gifts D4, L.L.C. (hereinafter ZJ), opened an adult bookstore in a place not zoned for adult businesses.  Instead of applying for a license, ZJ filed suit attacking the ordinance as facially unconstitutional.  The Federal District Court rejected ZJs claims, but the Tenth Circuit held, as relevant here, that state law does not assure the constitutionally required prompt final judicial decision.
Held:The ordinance meets the First Amendments requirement that such a licensing scheme assure prompt judicial review of an administrative decision denying a license.  Pp.39.
(a)The Court rejects the citys claim that its licensing scheme need only provide prompt access to judicial review, but not a prompt judicial determination, of an applicants legal claim.  The city concedes that Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 59, in listing constitutionally necessary safeguards applicable to a motion picture censorship statute, spoke of the need to assure a prompt final judicial decision, but adds that Justice OConnors controlling plurality opinion in FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, which addressed an adult business licensing scheme, did not use the word decision, instead speaking only of the possibility of prompt judicial review, id., at 228 (emphasis added).  Justice OConnors FW/PBS opinion, however, points out that Freedmans judicial review safeguard is meant to prevent undue delay, 493 U. S., at 228, which includes judicial, as well as administrative, delay.  A delay in issuing a judicial decision, no less than a delay in obtaining access to a court, can prevent a license from being issued within a reasonable period of time.  Ibid.  Nothing in the opinion suggests the contrary.  Pp.36.


(b)However, the Court accepts the citys claim that Colorado law satisfies any prompt judicial determination requirement, agreeing that the Court should modify FW/PBS, withdrawing its implication that Freedmans special judicial review rulese.g., strict time limitsapply in this case.  Colorados ordinary judicial review rules suffice to assure a prompt judicial decision, as long as the courts remain sensitive to the need to prevent First Amendment harms and administer those procedures accordingly.  And whether the courts do so is a matter normally fit for case-by-case determination rather than a facial challenge.  Four considerations support this conclusion.  First, ordinary court procedural rules and practices give reviewing courts judicial tools sufficient to avoid delay-related First Amendment harm.  Indeed, courts may arrange their schedules to accelerate proceedings, and higher courts may grant expedited review.  Second, there is no reason to doubt state judges willingness to exercise these powers wisely so as to avoid serious threats of delay-induced First Amendment harm.  And federal remedies would provide an additional safety valve in the event of any such problem.  Third, the typical First Amendment harm at issue here differs from that at issue in Freedman, diminishing the need in the typical case for procedural rules imposing special decisionmaking time limits.  Unlike in Freedman, this ordinance does not seek to censor material.  And its licensing scheme applies reasonably objective, nondiscretionary criteria unrelated to the content of the expressive materials that an adult business may sell or display.  These criteria are simple enough to apply and their application simple enough to review that their use is unlikely in practice to suppress totally any specific item of adult material in the community.  And the criterias simple objective nature means that in the ordinary case, judicial review, too, should prove simple, hence expeditious.  Finally, nothing in FW/PBS or Freedman requires a city or State to place judicial review safeguards all in the city ordinance that sets forth a licensing scheme.  Pp.69.

|541 u.s. 652|"YARBOROUGH, WARDEN v. ALVARADO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021684. Argued March 1, 2004Decided June 1, 2004
Respondent Alvarado helped Paul Soto try to steal a truck, leading to the death of the trucks owner.  Alvarado was called in for an interview with Los Angeles detective Comstock.  Alvarado was 17 years old at the time, and his parents brought him to the station and waited in the lobby during the interview.  Comstock took Alvarado to a small room where only the two of them were present.  The interview lasted about two hours, and Alvarado was not given a warning under Miranda v. Arizona, 334 U. S. 436.  Although he at first denied being present at the shooting, Alvarado slowly began to change his story, finally admitting that he had helped Soto try to steal the victims truck and to hide the gun after the murder.  Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he needed a break and, when the interview was over, returned him to his parents, who drove him home.  After California charged Alvarado with murder and attempted robbery, the trial court denied his motion to suppress his interview statements on Miranda grounds.  In affirming Alvarados conviction, the District Court of Appeal (hereinafter state court) ruled that a Miranda warning was not required because Alvarado had not been in custody during the interview under the test articulated in Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112, which requires a court to consider the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and then determine whether a reasonable person would have felt at liberty to leave.  The Federal District Court agreed with the state court on habeas review, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court erred in failing to account for Alvarados youth and inexperience when evaluating whether a reasonable person in his position would have felt free to leave the interview.  Noting that this Court has considered a suspects juvenile status in other criminal law contexts, see, e.g., Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599, the Court of Appeals held that the state courts error warranted habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) because it resulted in a decision that  involved an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  
Held:The state court considered the proper factors and reached a reasonable conclusion that Alvarado was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview.  Pp.715.
(a)AEDPA requires federal courts to consider whether the state-court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established law.  Clearly established law refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412.  The Miranda custody test is an objective test.  Two discrete inquiries are essential:(1) the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, and (2) given those circumstances, whether a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave.  Once the  players lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.  Thompson, 516 U. S., at 112.  Pp. 79.


(b)The state-court adjudication did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established law when it concluded that Alvarado was not in custody.  The meaning of unreasonable can depend in part on the specificity of the relevant legal rule.  If a rule is specific, the range of reasonable judgment may be narrow.  Applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect.  Other rules are more general, and their meaning must emerge in application over time.  The more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case determinations.  Cf. Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308309.  Fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.  The custody test is general, and the state courts application of this Courts law fits within the matrix of the Courts prior decisions.  Certain facts weigh against a finding that Alvarado was in custody.  The police did not transport him to the station or require him to appear at a particular time, cf. Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495; they did not threaten him or suggest he would be placed under arrest, ibid.; his parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that the interview would be brief, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 441442; Comstock appealed to Alvarados interest in telling the truth and being helpful to a police officer, cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495; Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he wanted to take a break; and, at the end of the interview, Alvarado went home, ibid.  Other facts point in the opposite direction.  Comstock interviewed Alvarado at the police station; the interview lasted 4 times longer than the 30-minute interview in Mathiason; Comstock did not tell Alvarado that he was free to leave; he was brought to the station by his legal guardians rather than arriving on his own accord; and his parents allegedly asked to be present at the interview but were rebuffed.  Given these differing indications, the state courts application of this Courts custody standard was reasonable.  Indeed, a number of the facts echo those in Mathiason, a per curiam summary reversal in which we found it clear that the suspect was not in custody.  Pp.912.


(c)The state courts failure to consider Alvarados age and inexperience does not provide a proper basis for finding that the state courts decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.  The Courts opinions applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspects age, much less mandated its consideration.  The only indications in those opinions relevant to a suspects experience with law enforcement have rejected reliance on such factors.  See, e.g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, n.35, 430432.  It was therefore improper for the Court of Appeals to grant relief on the basis of the state courts failure to consider them.  There is an important conceptual difference between the Miranda test and the line of cases from other contexts considering age and experience.  The Miranda custody inquiry is an objective test, see Thompson, supra, at 112, that furthers the clarity of [Mirandas] rule, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, ensuring that the police need not gues[s] as to [the circumstances] at issue before deciding how they may interrogate the suspect, id., at 431.  This objective inquiry could reasonably be viewed as different from doctrinal tests that depend on the actual mindset of a particular suspect, where the Court does consider a suspects age and experience.  In concluding that such factors should also apply to the Miranda custody inquiry, the Ninth Circuit ignored the argument that that inquiry states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspects individual characteristicsincluding his agecould be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry, cf. Mathiason, supra, at 495496.  Reliance on Alvarados prior history with law enforcement was improper not only under 2254(d)(1)s deferential standard, but also as a de novo matter.  In most cases, the police will not know a suspects interrogation history.  See Berkemer, supra, at 430431.  Even if they do, the relationship between a suspects experiences and the likelihood a reasonable person with that experience would feel free to leave often will be speculative.  Officers should not be asked to consider these contingent psychological factors when deciding when suspects should be advised of Miranda rights.  See Berkemer, supra, at 431432.  Pp. 1215.

Respondent Alvarado helped Paul Soto try to steal a truck, leading to the death of the trucks owner.  Alvarado was called in for an interview with Los Angeles detective Comstock.  Alvarado was 17 years old at the time, and his parents brought him to the station and waited in the lobby during the interview.  Comstock took Alvarado to a small room where only the two of them were present.  The interview lasted about two hours, and Alvarado was not given a warning under Miranda v. Arizona, 334 U. S. 436.  Although he at first denied being present at the shooting, Alvarado slowly began to change his story, finally admitting that he had helped Soto try to steal the victims truck and to hide the gun after the murder.  Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he needed a break and, when the interview was over, returned him to his parents, who drove him home.  After California charged Alvarado with murder and attempted robbery, the trial court denied his motion to suppress his interview statements on Miranda grounds.  In affirming Alvarados conviction, the District Court of Appeal (hereinafter state court) ruled that a Miranda warning was not required because Alvarado had not been in custody during the interview under the test articulated in Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99, 112, which requires a court to consider the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and then determine whether a reasonable person would have felt at liberty to leave.  The Federal District Court agreed with the state court on habeas review, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court erred in failing to account for Alvarados youth and inexperience when evaluating whether a reasonable person in his position would have felt free to leave the interview.  Noting that this Court has considered a suspects juvenile status in other criminal law contexts, see, e.g., Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 599, the Court of Appeals held that the state courts error warranted habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) because it resulted in a decision that  involved an unreasonable application of  clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  
Held:The state court considered the proper factors and reached a reasonable conclusion that Alvarado was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview.  Pp.715.
(a)AEDPA requires federal courts to consider whether the state-court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established law.  Clearly established law refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412.  The Miranda custody test is an objective test.  Two discrete inquiries are essential:(1) the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, and (2) given those circumstances, whether a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave.  Once the  players lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve the ultimate inquiry: was there a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.  Thompson, 516 U. S., at 112.  Pp. 79.


(b)The state-court adjudication did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established law when it concluded that Alvarado was not in custody.  The meaning of unreasonable can depend in part on the specificity of the relevant legal rule.  If a rule is specific, the range of reasonable judgment may be narrow.  Applications of the rule may be plainly correct or incorrect.  Other rules are more general, and their meaning must emerge in application over time.  The more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case determinations.  Cf. Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 308309.  Fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.  The custody test is general, and the state courts application of this Courts law fits within the matrix of the Courts prior decisions.  Certain facts weigh against a finding that Alvarado was in custody.  The police did not transport him to the station or require him to appear at a particular time, cf. Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495; they did not threaten him or suggest he would be placed under arrest, ibid.; his parents remained in the lobby during the interview, suggesting that the interview would be brief, see Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 441442; Comstock appealed to Alvarados interest in telling the truth and being helpful to a police officer, cf. Mathiason, 429 U. S., at 495; Comstock twice asked Alvarado if he wanted to take a break; and, at the end of the interview, Alvarado went home, ibid.  Other facts point in the opposite direction.  Comstock interviewed Alvarado at the police station; the interview lasted 4 times longer than the 30-minute interview in Mathiason; Comstock did not tell Alvarado that he was free to leave; he was brought to the station by his legal guardians rather than arriving on his own accord; and his parents allegedly asked to be present at the interview but were rebuffed.  Given these differing indications, the state courts application of this Courts custody standard was reasonable.  Indeed, a number of the facts echo those in Mathiason, a per curiam summary reversal in which we found it clear that the suspect was not in custody.  Pp.912.


(c)The state courts failure to consider Alvarados age and inexperience does not provide a proper basis for finding that the state courts decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.  The Courts opinions applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspects age, much less mandated its consideration.  The only indications in those opinions relevant to a suspects experience with law enforcement have rejected reliance on such factors.  See, e.g., Berkemer, supra, at 442, n.35, 430432.  It was therefore improper for the Court of Appeals to grant relief on the basis of the state courts failure to consider them.  There is an important conceptual difference between the Miranda test and the line of cases from other contexts considering age and experience.  The Miranda custody inquiry is an objective test, see Thompson, supra, at 112, that furthers the clarity of [Mirandas] rule, Berkemer, 468 U. S., at 430, ensuring that the police need not gues[s] as to [the circumstances] at issue before deciding how they may interrogate the suspect, id., at 431.  This objective inquiry could reasonably be viewed as different from doctrinal tests that depend on the actual mindset of a particular suspect, where the Court does consider a suspects age and experience.  In concluding that such factors should also apply to the Miranda custody inquiry, the Ninth Circuit ignored the argument that that inquiry states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to the police, while consideration of a suspects individual characteristicsincluding his agecould be viewed as creating a subjective inquiry, cf. Mathiason, supra, at 495496.  Reliance on Alvarados prior history with law enforcement was improper not only under 2254(d)(1)s deferential standard, but also as a de novo matter.  In most cases, the police will not know a suspects interrogation history.  See Berkemer, supra, at 430431.  Even if they do, the relationship between a suspects experiences and the likelihood a reasonable person with that experience would feel free to leave often will be speculative.  Officers should not be asked to consider these contingent psychological factors when deciding when suspects should be advised of Miranda rights.  See Berkemer, supra, at 431432.  Pp. 1215.

Before Officer Nichols could pull over petitioner, petitioner parked and got out of his car.  Nichols then parked, accosted petitioner, and arrested him after finding drugs in his pocket.  Incident to the arrest, Nichols searched petitioners car and found a handgun under the drivers seat.  Petitioner was charged with federal drug and firearms violations.  In denying his motion to suppress the firearm as the fruit of an unconstitutional search, the District Court found, inter alia, the automobile search valid under New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, in which this Court held that, when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an automobiles occupant, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to search the vehicles passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident of arrest, id., at 460.  Petitioner appealed his conviction, arguing that Belton was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact with an arrestee while he was still in the car.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.
Held:Belton governs even when an officer does not make contact until the person arrested has left the vehicle.  In Belton, the Court placed no reliance on the fact that the officer ordered the occupants out of the vehicle, or initiated contact with them while they remained within it.  And here, there is simply no basis to conclude that the span of the area generally within the arrestees immediate control is determined by whether the arrestee exited the vehicle at the officers direction, or whether the officer initiated contact with him while he was in the car.  In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer safety and evidence destruction as one who is inside.  Under petitioners proposed contact initiation rule, officers who decide that it may be safer and more effective to conceal their presence until a suspect has left his car would be unable to search the passenger compartment in the event of a custodial arrest, potentially compromising their safety and placing incriminating evidence at risk of concealment or destruction.  The Fourth Amendment does not require such a gamble.  Belton allows police to search a cars passenger compartment incident to a lawful arrest of both occupants and recent occupants.  Ibid.  While an arrestees status as a recent occupant may turn on his temporal or spatial relationship to the car at the time of the arrest and search, it certainly does not turn on whether he was inside or outside the car when the officer first initiated contact with him.  Although not all contraband in the passenger compartment is likely to be accessible to a recent occupant, the need for a clear rule, readily understood by police and not depending on differing estimates of what items were or were not within an arrestees reach at any particular moment, justifies the sort of generalization which Belton enunciated.  Under petitioners rule, an officer would have to determine whether he actually confronted or signaled confrontation with the suspect while he was in his car, or whether the suspect exited the car unaware of, and for reasons unrelated to, the officers presence.  Such a rule would be inherently subjective and highly fact specific, and would require precisely the sort of adhoc determinations on the part of officers in the field and reviewing courts that Belton sought to avoid.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 036821. Argued March 29, 2004Decided May 24, 2004
Three days before his scheduled execution by lethal injection, petitioner filed a 42 U. S.C. 1983 action against respondent Alabama prison officials, alleging that the use of a cut-down procedure requiring an incision into his arm or leg to access his severely compromised veins constituted cruel and unusual punishment and deliberate indifference to his medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Petitioner, who had already filed an unsuccessful federal habeas application, sought a permanent injunction against the cut-downs use, a temporary stay of execution so the District Court could consider his claims merits, and orders requiring respondents to furnish a copy of the protocol on the medical procedures for venous access and directing them to promulgate a venous access protocol that comports with contemporary standards.  Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that the 1983 claim and stay request were the equivalent of a second or successive habeas application subject to 28 U. S.C. 2244(b)s gatekeeping requirements.  Agreeing, the District Court dismissed the complaint because petitioner had not obtained authorization to file such an application.  In affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that method-of-execution challenges necessarily sound in habeas, and that it would have denied a habeas authorization request.
Held:Section 1983 is an appropriate vehicle for petitioners Eighth Amendment claim seeking a temporary stay and permanent injunctive relief.  Pp.513.
(a)Section 1983 must yield to the federal habeas statute where an inmate seeks injunctive relief challenging the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence.  Such claims fall within the core of habeas.  By contrast, constitutional claims challenging confinement conditions fall outside of that core and may be brought under 1983 in the first instance.  The Court need not reach here the difficult question of how method-of-execution claims should be classified generally.  Respondents have conceded that 1983 would be the appropriate vehicle for an inmate who is not facing execution to bring a deliberate indifference challenge to the cut-down procedures constitutionality if used to gain venous access for medical treatment.  There is no reason on the complaints face to treat petitioners claim differently solely because he has been condemned to die.  Respondents claim that because the cut-down is part of the execution procedure, petitioner is actually challenging the fact of his execution.  However, that venous access is a necessary prerequisite to execution does not imply that a particular means of gaining such access is likewise necessary.  Petitioner has argued throughout the proceedings that the cut-down and the wardens refusal to provide reliable information on the cut-down protocol are wholly unnecessary to gaining venous access.  If, after an evidentiary hearing, the District Court finds the cut-down necessary, it will need to address the broader method-of-execution question left open here.  The instant holding is consistent with this Courts approach to civil rights damages actions, which also fall at the margins of habeas.  Pp.59.


(b)If a permanent injunction request does not sound in habeas, it follows that the lesser-included request for a temporary stay (or preliminary injunction) does not either.  Here, a fair reading of the complaint leaves no doubt that petitioner sought to enjoin the cut-down, not his execution by lethal injection.  However, his stay request asked to stay his execution, seemingly without regard to whether the State did or did not resort to the cut-down.  The execution warrant has now expired.  If the State reschedules the execution while this case is pending on remand and petitioner seeks another similarly broad stay, the District Court will need to address the question whether a request to enjoin the execution, rather than merely to enjoin an allegedly unnecessary precursor medical procedure, properly sounds in habeas.  Pp.911.


(c)Respondents are incorrect that a reversal here would open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges and last-minute stay requests.  Because this Court does not here resolve the question of how to treat method-of-execution claims generally, the instant holding is extremely limited.  Moreover, merely stating a cognizable 1983 claim does not warrant a stay as a matter of right.  A court may consider a stay applications last-minute nature in deciding whether to grant such equitable relief.  And the ability to bring a 1983 claim does not free inmates from the substantive or procedural limitations of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Pp.1113.

|541 u.s. 440|"TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORPORATION v. HOOD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 021606. Argued March 1, 2004Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent Hood had an outstanding balance on student loans guaranteed by petitioner Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC), a state entity, at the time she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  Hoods general discharge did not cover her student loans, as she did not list them and they are only dischargeable if a bankruptcy court determines that excepting the debt from the order would be an undue hardship on the debtor, 11 U. S.C. 523(a)(8).  Hood subsequently reopened the petition, seeking an undue hardship determination.  As prescribed by Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7001(6), 7003, and 7004, she filed a complaint and, later, an amended complaint, and served them with a summons on TSAC and others.  The Bankruptcy Court denied TSACs motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that 11 U. S.C. 106(a) abrogated the States Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  The Sixth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed, as did the Sixth Circuit, which held that the Bankruptcy Clause gave Congress the authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity in 106(a).  This Court granted certiorari to determine whether the Bankruptcy Clause grants Congress such authority. 
Held:Because the Bankruptcy Courts discharge of a student loan debt does not implicate a States Eleventh Amendment immunity, this Court does not reach the question on which certiorari was granted.  Pp.413.
(a)States may be bound by some judicial actions without their consent.  For example, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal jurisdiction over in rem admiralty actions when the State does not possess the res.  California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc., 523 U. S. 491, 507
508.  A debts discharge by a bankruptcy court is similarly an in rem proceeding.  The court has exclusive jurisdiction over a debtors property, wherever located, and over the estate.  Once debts are discharged, a creditor who did not submit a proof of claim will be unable to collect on his unsecured loans.  A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtor a fresh start, even if all of his creditors do not participate, because the courts jurisdiction is premised on the debtor and his estate, not on the creditors.  Because the courts jurisdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipating creditor cannot be personally liable.  States, whether or not they choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound by a bankruptcy courts discharge order no less than other creditors, see, e.g., New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329, 333.  And when the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over the res is unquestioned, the exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge the debt does not infringe a States sovereignty.  TSAC argues, however, that the individualized process by which student loan debts are discharged unconstitutionally infringes its sovereignty.  If a debtor does not affirmatively secure 523(a)(8)s undue hardship determination, States choosing not to submit themselves to the courts jurisdiction might receive some benefit: The debtors personal liability on the loan may survive the discharge.  TSAC misunderstands the proceedings fundamental nature when it claims that Congress, by making a student loan debt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out for an individualized determination, has authorized a suit against a State.  The bankruptcy courts jurisdiction is premised on the res, not the persona; that States were granted the presumptive benefit of nondischargeability does not alter the courts underlying authority.  A debtor does not seek damages or affirmative relief from a State or subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial process by seeking to discharge his debts.  Indeed, this Court has endorsed individual determinations of States interests within the federal courts in rem jurisdiction, e.g., Deep Sea Research, supra.  Although bankruptcy and admiralty are specialized areas of the law, there is no reason why the exercise of federal courts in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction is more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise of their in rem admiralty jurisdiction.  Pp. 49.


(b)With regard to the procedure used in this case, the Bankruptcy Rules require a debtor to file an adversary proceeding against the State to discharge student loan debts.  While this is part of the original bankruptcy case and within the bankruptcy courts in rem jurisdiction, it requires the service of a summons and a complaint, see Rules 7001(6), 7003, and 7004.  The issuance of process is normally an indignity to a States sovereignty, because its purpose is to establish personal jurisdiction; but the courts in rem jurisdiction allows it to adjudicate the debtors discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State.  Section 523(a)(8) does not require a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6) a debtor could proceed by motion, which would raise no constitutional concern.  There is no reason why service of a summons, which in this case is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should be given dispositive weight.  Dismissal of the complaint is not appropriate here where the court has in rem jurisdiction and has not attempted to adjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction.  This case is unlike an adversary proceeding by a bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover property in the States hands on the grounds that the transfer was a voidable preference.  Even if this Court were to hold that Congress lacked the ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, the Bankruptcy Court would still have authority to make the undue hardship determination Hood seeks.  Thus, this Court declines to decide whether a bankruptcy courts exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would be valid under the Eleventh Amendment.  If the Bankruptcy Court on remand exceeds its in rem jurisdiction, TSAC would be free to challenge the courts authority.  Pp.1013.

508.  A debts discharge by a bankruptcy court is similarly an in rem proceeding.  The court has exclusive jurisdiction over a debtors property, wherever located, and over the estate.  Once debts are discharged, a creditor who did not submit a proof of claim will be unable to collect on his unsecured loans.  A bankruptcy court is able to provide the debtor a fresh start, even if all of his creditors do not participate, because the courts jurisdiction is premised on the debtor and his estate, not on the creditors.  Because the courts jurisdiction is premised on the res, however, a nonparticipating creditor cannot be personally liable.  States, whether or not they choose to participate in the proceeding, are bound by a bankruptcy courts discharge order no less than other creditors, see, e.g., New York v. Irving Trust Co., 288 U. S. 329, 333.  And when the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over the res is unquestioned, the exercise of its in rem jurisdiction to discharge the debt does not infringe a States sovereignty.  TSAC argues, however, that the individualized process by which student loan debts are discharged unconstitutionally infringes its sovereignty.  If a debtor does not affirmatively secure 523(a)(8)s undue hardship determination, States choosing not to submit themselves to the courts jurisdiction might receive some benefit: The debtors personal liability on the loan may survive the discharge.  TSAC misunderstands the proceedings fundamental nature when it claims that Congress, by making a student loan debt presumptively nondischargeable and singling it out for an individualized determination, has authorized a suit against a State.  The bankruptcy courts jurisdiction is premised on the res, not the persona; that States were granted the presumptive benefit of nondischargeability does not alter the courts underlying authority.  A debtor does not seek damages or affirmative relief from a State or subject an unwilling State to a coercive judicial process by seeking to discharge his debts.  Indeed, this Court has endorsed individual determinations of States interests within the federal courts in rem jurisdiction, e.g., Deep Sea Research, supra.  Although bankruptcy and admiralty are specialized areas of the law, there is no reason why the exercise of federal courts in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction is more threatening to state sovereignty than the exercise of their in rem admiralty jurisdiction.  Pp. 49.


(b)With regard to the procedure used in this case, the Bankruptcy Rules require a debtor to file an adversary proceeding against the State to discharge student loan debts.  While this is part of the original bankruptcy case and within the bankruptcy courts in rem jurisdiction, it requires the service of a summons and a complaint, see Rules 7001(6), 7003, and 7004.  The issuance of process is normally an indignity to a States sovereignty, because its purpose is to establish personal jurisdiction; but the courts in rem jurisdiction allows it to adjudicate the debtors discharge claim without in personam jurisdiction over the State.  Section 523(a)(8) does not require a summons, and absent Rule 7001(6) a debtor could proceed by motion, which would raise no constitutional concern.  There is no reason why service of a summons, which in this case is indistinguishable in practical effect from a motion, should be given dispositive weight.  Dismissal of the complaint is not appropriate here where the court has in rem jurisdiction and has not attempted to adjudicate any claims outside of that jurisdiction.  This case is unlike an adversary proceeding by a bankruptcy trustee seeking to recover property in the States hands on the grounds that the transfer was a voidable preference.  Even if this Court were to hold that Congress lacked the ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Bankruptcy Clause, the Bankruptcy Court would still have authority to make the undue hardship determination Hood seeks.  Thus, this Court declines to decide whether a bankruptcy courts exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would be valid under the Eleventh Amendment.  If the Bankruptcy Court on remand exceeds its in rem jurisdiction, TSAC would be free to challenge the courts authority.  Pp.1013.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 021016. Argued December 2, 2003Decided May 17, 2004
Under the so-called cram down option permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, a Chapter 13 debtors proposed debt adjustment plan must provide each allowed, secured creditor both a lien securing the claim and a promise of future property disbursements whose total value, as of the plans date, is not less than the [claims] allowed amount, 11 U. S.C. 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).  When such plans provide for installment payments, each installment must be calibrated to ensure that the creditor receives disbursements whose total present value equals or exceeds that of the allowed claim.  Respondents retail installment contract on petitioners truck had a secured value of $4,000 at the time petitioners filed a Chapter 13 petition.  Petitioners proposed debt adjustment plan provided the amount that would be distributed to creditors each month and that petitioners would pay an annual 9.5% interest rate on respondents secured claim.  This prime-plus or formula rate was reached by augmenting the national prime rate of 8% to account for the nonpayment risk posed by borrowers in petitioners financial position.  In confirming the plan, the Bankruptcy Court overruled respondents objection that it was entitled to its contract interest rate of 21%.  The District Court reversed, ruling that the 21% coerced loan rate was appropriate because cram down rates must be set at the level the creditor could have obtained had it foreclosed on the loan, sold the collateral, and reinvested the proceeds in equivalent loans.  The Seventh Circuit modified that approach, holding that the original contract rate was a presumptive rate that could be challenged with evidence that a higher or lower rate should apply, and remanding the case to the Bankruptcy Court to afford the parties an opportunity to rebut the presumptive 21% rate.  The dissent proposed a cost of funds rate that would simply ask what it would cost the creditor to obtain the cash equivalent of the collateral from another source.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
301 F. 3d 583, reversed and remanded.
Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded that the prime-plus or formula rate best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.  Pp.718.


(a)The Code gives little guidance as to which of the four interest rates advocated by opinions in this case Congress intended when it adopted the cram down provision.  A debtors promise of future payments is worth less than an immediate lump sum payment because the creditor cannot use the money right away, inflation may cause the dollars value to decline before the debtor pays, and there is a nonpayment risk.  In choosing an interest rate sufficient to compensate the creditor for such concerns, bankruptcy courts must consider that: (1) Congress likely intended bankruptcy judges and trustees to follow essentially the same approach when choosing an appropriate interest rate under any of the many Code provisions requiring a court to discount a stream of deferred payments back to their present dollar value; (2) Chapter 13 expressly authorizes a bankruptcy court to modify the rights of a creditor whose claim is secured by an interest in anything other than the debtors principal residence; and (3) from a creditors point of view, the cram down provision mandates an objective rather than a subjective inquiry.  Pp.710.


(b)These considerations lead to the conclusion that the coerced loan, presumptive contract rate, and cost of funds approaches should be rejected, since they are complicated, impose significant evidentiary costs, and aim to make each individual creditor whole rather than to ensure that a debtors payments have the required present value.  Pp.1012.


(c)The formula approach has none of these defects.  Taking its cue from ordinary lending practices, it looks to the national prime rate, which reflects the financial markets estimate of the amount a commercial bank should charge a creditworthy commercial borrower to compensate for the loans opportunity costs, the inflation risk, and the relatively slight default risk.  A bankruptcy court is then required to adjust the prime rate to account for the greater nonpayment risk that bankrupt debtors typically pose.  Because that adjustment depends on such factors as the estates circumstances, the securitys nature, and the reorganization plans duration and feasibility, the court must hold a hearing to permit the debtor and creditors to present evidence about the appropriate risk adjustment.  Unlike the other approaches proposed in this case, the formula approach entails a straightforward, familiar, and objective inquiry, and minimizes the need for potentially costly additional evidentiary hearings.  The resulting prime-plus rate also depends only on the state of financial markets, the bankruptcy estates circumstances, and the loans characteristics, not on the creditors circumstances or its prior interactions with the debtor.  The risk adjustments proper scale is not before this Court.  The Bankruptcy Court approved 1.5% in this case, and other courts have generally approved 1% to 3%, but respondent claims a risk adjustment in this range is inadequate.  The issue need not be resolved here; it is sufficient to note that courts must choose a rate high enough to compensate a creditor for its risk but not so high as to doom the bankruptcy plan.  Pp.1214.


Justice Thomas concluded that the proposed 9.5% rate will sufficiently compensate respondent for the fact that it is receiving monthly payments rather than a lump sum payment, but that 11 U. S.C. 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not require that the proper interest rate reflect the risk of nonpayment.  Pp.17.


(a)The plain language of 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires a court to determine, first, the allowed amount of the claim; second, what is the property to be distributed under the plan; and third, the value, as of the effective date of the plan of the property to be distributed.  This third requirement, which is at issue here, incorporates the principle of the time value of money.  Section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires valuation of the property, not valuation of the plan.  Thus, a plan need only propose an interest rate that will compensate a creditor for the fact that had he received the property immediately rather than at a future date, he could have immediately made use of the property.  In most, if not all, cases, where the plan proposes simply a stream of cash payments, the appropriate risk-free rate should suffice.  There may be some risk of nonpayment, but 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) does not take this risk into account.  Respondents argument that 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) was crafted to protect creditors rather than debtors ignores the statutes plain language and overlooks the fact that secured creditors are compensated in part for the nonpayment risk through the valuation of the secured claim.  Further, the statutes plain language is by no means debtor protective.  Given the presence of multiple creditor-specific protections, it is not irrational to assume that Congress opted not to provide further protection for creditors by requiring a debtor-specific risk adjustment under 1325(a)(5).  Pp.26.


(b)Here, the allowed amount of the secured claim is $4,000, and the property to be distributed under the plan is cash payments.  Because the proposed 9.5% interest rate is higher than the risk-free rate, it is sufficient to account for the time value of money, which is all the statute requires.  Pp.67.

|541 u.s. 509|"TENNESSEE v. LANE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 021667. Argued January 13, 2004Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief, alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them physical access to that States courts in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which provides: [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, 42 U. S. C. 12132.  After the District Court denied the States motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance pending Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356.  This Court later ruled in Garrett that the Eleventh Amendment bars private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I, which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled.  The en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its Popovich decision, in which it interpreted Garrett to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles, but not those relying on due process, and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the States immunity claim.  Thereafter, a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case, explaining that respondents claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles.  In response to a rehearing petition arguing that Popovich did not control because respondents complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion, explaining that due process protects the right of access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II established, inter alia, that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity for such access.
Held:As it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress authority under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendments substantive guarantees.  Pp.423.
(a)Determining whether Congress has constitutionally abrogated a States Eleventh Amendment immunity requires resolution of two predicate questions: (1) whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate; and (2), if so, whether it acted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.  Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73.  The first question is easily answered here, since the ADA specifically provides for abrogation.  See 12202.  With regard to the second question, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  E.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 456.  That power is not, however, unlimited.  While Congress must have a wide berth in devising appropriate remedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional actions, those measures may not work a substantive change in the governing law.  City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 519.  In Boerne, the Court set forth the test for distinguishing between permissible remedial legislation and unconstitutional substantive redefinition: Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits a congruence and proportionality between an injury and the means adopted to prevent or remedy it.  Id., at 520.  Applying the Boerne test in Garrett, the Court concluded that ADA Title I was not a valid exercise of Congress 5 power because the historical record and the statutes broad sweep suggested that Title Is true aim was not so much enforcement, but an attempt to rewrite this Courts Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.  531 U. S., at 372374.  In view of significant differences between Titles I and II, however, Garrett left open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress 5 power, id., at 360, n.1.  Pp.510.


(b)Title II is a valid exercise of Congress 5 enforcement power.  Pp.1123.


(1)The Boerne inquirys first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II.  Garrett, 531 U. S., at 365.  Like Title I, Title II seeks to enforce the Fourteenth Amendments prohibition on irrational disability discrimination, Garrett, 531 U. S., at 366.  But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, including some, like the right of access to the courts here at issue, infringements of which are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336337.  Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.  E.g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308.  Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.  The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts, which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services.  With respect to the particular services at issue, Congress learned that many individuals, in many States, were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities.  A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons.  Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses.  And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs, including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities.  The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Terms Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 728733, in which the Court approved the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as valid 5 legislation.  Congress finding in the ADA that discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as  access to public services, 12101(a)(3), together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.  Pp.1118.


(2)Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment.  Unquestionably, it is valid 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.  Congress chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue, Title IIs requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts.  The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem.  Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts, Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures.  Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 737.  The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.  Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.  12132.  But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service.  Ibid.  Title IIs implementing regulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various ways, including less costly measures than structural changes.  This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established due process principle that, within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard in its courts.  Boddie, 401 U. S., at 379.  A number of affirmative obligations flow from this principle.  Cases such as Boddie, Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone cannot justify a States failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts.  Judged against this backdrop, Title IIs affirmative obligation to accommodate is a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end.  Pp.1823.

But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, including some, like the right of access to the courts here at issue, infringements of which are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336337.  Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.  E.g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308.  Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.  The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts, which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services.  With respect to the particular services at issue, Congress learned that many individuals, in many States, were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities.  A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons.  Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses.  And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs, including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities.  The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Terms Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 728733, in which the Court approved the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as valid 5 legislation.  Congress finding in the ADA that discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as  access to public services, 12101(a)(3), together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.  Pp.1118.


(2)Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment.  Unquestionably, it is valid 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.  Congress chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue, Title IIs requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts.  The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem.  Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts, Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures.  Hibbs, 538 U. S., at 737.  The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.  Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.  12132.  But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service.  Ibid.  Title IIs implementing regulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various ways, including less costly measures than structural changes.  This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established due process principle that, within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard in its courts.  Boddie, 401 U. S., at 379.  A number of affirmative obligations flow from this principle.  Cases such as Boddie, Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone cannot justify a States failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts.  Judged against this backdrop, Title IIs affirmative obligation to accommodate is a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end.  Pp.1823.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 021689. Argued March 3, 2004Decided May 17, 2004
Respondent Atlas Global Group, L.P., a limited partnership created under Texas law, filed a state-law suit against petitioner, a Mexican corporation, in federal court, alleging diversity jurisdiction.  After the jury returned a verdict for Atlas, but before entry of judgment, petitioner moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the parties were not diverse at the time the complaint was filed.  In granting the motion, the Magistrate Judge found that, as a partnership, Atlas was a Mexican citizen because two of its partners, also respondents, were Mexican citizens at the time of filing; and that the requisite diversity was absent because petitioner was also a Mexican citizen.  On appeal, Atlas urged the Fifth Circuit to disregard the diversity failure at the time of filing because the Mexican partners had left Atlas before the trial began and, thus, diversity existed thereafter.  Relying on Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, the Fifth Circuit held that the conclusiveness of citizenship at the time of filing is subject to an exception where, as here, the jurisdictional error was not identified until after the jurys verdict and the postfiling change in the partnership cured the jurisdictional defect before it was identified.
Held:A partys postfiling change in citizenship cannot cure a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction that existed at the time of filing in a diversity action.  This Court has long adhered to the rule that subject-matter jurisdiction in diversity cases depends on the state of facts that existed at the time of filing.  Caterpillars statement that [o]nce a diversity case has been tried in federal court  considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy become overwhelming, 519 U. S., at 75, did not augur a new approach to deciding whether a jurisdictional defect has been cured.  The jurisdictional defect Caterpillar addressed had been cured by the dismissal of the party that had destroyed diversity, a curing method that had long been an exception to the time-of-filing rule.  This Court has never approved a deviation from the longstanding rule that [w]here there is no change of party, a jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party is governed by that condition, as it was at the commencement of the suit.  Conolly v. Taylor, 2 Pet. 556, 565 (emphasis added).  Dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is the only option available here.  Allowing a citizenship change in the partnership to cure the jurisdictional defect existing at the time of filing would contravene the Conolly principle. Apart from breaking with this Courts longstanding precedent, holding that finality, efficiency, and judicial economy can justify suspension of the time-of-filing rule would create an exception of indeterminate scope that is bound to produce costly collateral litigation.

||"SABRI v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 0344. Argued March 3, 2004Decided May 17, 2004
After petitioner Sabri offered three separate bribes to a Minneapolis councilman to facilitate construction in the city, Sabri was charged with violating 18 U. S.C. 666(a)(2), which proscribes bribery of state and local officials of entities, such as Minneapolis, that receive at least $10,000 in federal funds.  Before trial, Sabri moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that 666(a)(2) is unconstitutional on its face for failure to require proof of a connection between the federal funds and the alleged bribe, as an element of liability.  The District Court agreed, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the absence of such an express requirement was not fatal, and that the statute was constitutional under the Constitutions Necessary and Proper Clause in serving the objects of the congressional spending power.
Held:Section 666(a)(2) is a valid exercise of Congresss Article I authority.  Pp.39.
(a)Sabris facial challenge that 666(a)(2) must, as an element of the offense, require proof of connection with federal money is readily rejected.  This Court does not presume the unconstitutionality of all federal criminal statutes from the absence of an explicit jurisdictional hook, and there is no occasion even to consider the need for such a requirement where there is no reason to suspect that enforcing a criminal statute would extend beyond a legitimate interest cognizable under Article I, 8.  Congress has Spending Clause authority to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare, Art.I, 8, cl.1, and corresponding Necessary and Proper Clause authority, Art.I, 8, cl.18, to assure that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for the general welfare, rather than frittered away in graft or upon projects undermined by graft.  See, e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.  Congress does not have to accept the risk of getting poor performance for its money, owing to local and state administrators improbity.  See, e.g., id., at 417.  Section 666(a)(2) addresses the problem at the sources of bribes, by rational means, to safeguard the integrity of federal dollar recipients.  Although not every bribe offered or paid to covered government agents will be traceably skimmed from specific federal payments, or be found in the guise of a quid pro quo for some dereliction in spending a federal grant, these facts do not portend enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the simple reason that corruption need not be so limited in order to affect that interest.  Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value.  It is enough that the statute condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars to the government such as that provided here and a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and cigars.  The legislative history confirms that 666(a)(2) is an instance of necessary and proper legislation.  Neither of Sabris arguments against 666(a)(2)s constitutionality helps him.  First, his claim that 666 is of a piece with the legislation ruled unconstitutional in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, is unavailing because these precedents do not control here.  In them, the Court struck down federal statutes regulating gun possession near schools and gender-motivated violence, respectively, because it found the effects of those activities on interstate commerce insufficiently robust.  Here, in contrast, Congress was within its prerogative to ensure that the objects of spending are not menaced by local administrators on the take.  Cf. Lopez, supra, at 561.  Second, contrary to Sabris argument, 666(a)(2) is not an unduly coercive, and impermissibly sweeping, condition on the grant of federal funds, but is authority to bring federal power to bear directly on individuals who convert public spending into unearned private gain.  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, distinguished.  Pp.37.


(b)The Court disapproves Sabris technique for challenging his indictment by facial attack on the underlying statute.  If Sabri was making any substantive constitutional claim, it had to be seen as an overbreadth challenge; the most he could seriously say was that the statute could not be enforced against him, because it could not be enforced against someone else whose behavior would be outside the scope of Congresss Article I authority to legislate.  Facial challenges of this sort are to be discouraged because they invite judgments on fact-poor records and entail a departure from the norms of federal-court adjudication by calling for relaxation of familiar standing requirements to allow a determination that the law would be unconstitutionally applied to different parties and different circumstances from those at hand.  See, e.g., Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 5556, n.22.  Thus, the Court has recognized the validity of facial attacks alleging overbreadth (though not necessarily using that term) in relatively few settings, and, generally, only on the strength of a specific reason, such as free speech, that is weighty enough to overcome the Courts well-founded reticence.  See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601.  Pp.89.
326 F.3d 937, affirmed and remanded.

After this Court held that federal courts should apply the most appropriate state statute of limitations to claims arising under 42 U. S.C. 1981, which contains no statute of limitations, see Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 660, Congress enacted a 4-year statute of limitations for causes of action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after [December 1, 1990], 28 U. S.C. 1658(a).  Petitioners, African-American former employees of respondent, filed a class action alleging violations of 1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  Respondent sought summary judgment, claiming that the applicable state 2-year statute of limitations barred their claims, but the District Court held that petitioners wrongful discharge, refusal to transfer, and hostile work environment claims arose under the 1991 Act and therefore are governed by 1658.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, concluding that 1658 does not apply to a cause of action based on a post-1990 amendment to a pre-existing statute.
Held:Petitioners causes of action are governed by 1658.  Pp.515.
(a)Because the meaning of arising under in 1658 is ambiguous, Congress intent must be ascertained by looking beyond the sections bare text to the context in which it was enacted and the purposes it was designed to accomplish.  Pp.57.


(b)Before 1658s enactment, Congress failure to pass a uniform limitations statute for federal causes of action had created a void that spawned a vast amount of litigation.  The settled practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations generated a host of issues, such as which of the forum States statutes was the most appropriate, whether the forum States law or that of the situs of the injury controlled, and when a statute of limitations could be tolled.  Congress was keenly aware of these problems, and a central purpose of 1658 was to minimize the need for borrowing.  That purpose would not be served if 1658 were interpreted to reach only entirely new sections of the United States Code.  An amendment to an existing statute is no less an Act of Congress than a new, stand-alone statute.  What matters is the new rights of action and corresponding liabilities created by the enactment.  Thus, a cause of action aris[es] under an Act of Congress enacted after December 1, 1990and therefore is governed by 1658s 4-year statute of limitationsif the plaintiffs claim against the defendant was made possible by a post-1990 enactment.  This construction best serves Congress interest in alleviating the uncertainty inherent in the practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations, while protecting litigants settled expectations by applying only to causes of actions not available until after December 1, 1990.  It also is consistent with the common usage of arise and with this Courts interpretations of arising under as it is used in statutes governing the scope of federal subject-matter jurisdiction.  Pp. 713.


(c)Petitioners hostile work environment, wrongful termination, and failure-to-transfer claims all ar[rose] under the 1991 Act in the sense that they were made possible by that Act.  The 1991 Act overturned this Courts decision in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 171, which held that racial harassment relating to employment conditions was not actionable under 1981.  The Act redefined 1981s key make and enforce contracts language to include the termination of contracts and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship, 1981(b).  In Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, this Court held that the amendment enlarged the category of conduct subject to 1981 liability, id., at 303, and thus did not apply to a case that arose before it was enacted, id., at 300.  Rivers reasoning supports the conclusion that the 1991 Act qualifies as an Act of Congress enacted after [December 1, 1990].  Petitioners causes of action clearly arose under the 1991 Act, and the hypothetical problems posited by respondent and the Seventh Circuit pale in comparison with the difficulties that federal courts faced for decades in trying to answer questions raised by borrowing state limitations rules.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 021824. Argued March 2, 2004Decided May 3, 2004
Respondent was charged with and convicted of felony theft.  Based on two prior convictions, he was also charged as a habitual offender.  Under Texas habitual offender statute, a defendant convicted of a felony is subject to a sentence of 2 to 20 years if (1) he has two prior felony convictions, and (2) the conviction for the first prior offense became final before commission of the second.  Texas law requires the State to prove the habitual offender allegations to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt at a separate penalty hearing.  The jury here convicted respondent of the habitual offender charge, and the judge sentenced him to 16 years.  As it turned out, the evidence presented at the penalty phase showed that respondent had committed his second offense three days before his first conviction became final, meaning that he was not eligible for the habitual offender enhancement.  No one, including defense counsel, noted the discrepancyeither at trial or on direct appeal.  Respondent first raised the issue in a request for state postconviction relief, arguing that the evidence at the penalty hearing was insufficient to support the habitual offender conviction.  The state court rejected his sufficiency of the evidence claim on procedural grounds, because he had not raised the issue earlier; the state court likewise rejected respondents claim that counsel had been ineffective for failing to object.  Respondent renewed his sufficiency of the evidence and ineffective assistance claims in a subsequent federal habeas application.  Conceding that respondent was not, in fact, eligible for the habitual offender enhancement, the State nevertheless argued that respondent had procedurally defaulted his sufficiency of the evidence claim.  The District Court excused the procedural default because respondent was actually innocent of the enhanced sentence; it thus did not reach the ineffective assistance claim.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the actual innocence exception applies to noncapital sentencing procedures involving career offenders and habitual felony offenders.
Held:A federal court faced with allegations of actual innocence, whether of the sentence or of the crime charged, must first address all nondefaulted claims for comparable relief and other grounds for cause to excuse the procedural default.  Normally, a federal court will not entertain a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim in a habeas petition absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the default.  However, this Court recognizes a narrow exception to the general rule when the applicant can demonstrate actual innocence of the substantive offense, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 496, or, in the capital sentencing context, of the aggravating circumstances rendering the inmate eligible for the death penalty, Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333.  The Court declines to answer the question presented here, whether this exception should be extended to noncapital sentencing error, because the District Court failed first to consider alternative grounds for relief urged by respondent.  This avoidance principle was implicit in Carrier itself, where the Court expressed confidence that, for the most part, victims of fundamental miscarriage of justice will meet the cause-and-prejudice standard, 477 U. S., at 495496, particularly given the availability of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, id., at 496.  Petitioner concedes that respondent has a viable and significant ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  Success on the merits would give respondent all of the relief that he seeks, i.e., resentencing, and also would provide cause to excuse the procedural default of his sufficiency of the evidence claim.  The many threshold legal questions often accompanying actual innocence claims provide additional reason for restraint.  For instance, respondents claim raises the question whether the holding of In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358that each element of a criminal offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubtshould be extended to proof of prior convictions used to support recidivist enhancements.  Not all actual innocence claims will involve threshold constitutional questions, but, as this case illustrates, such claims are likely to present equally difficult questions regarding the scope of the actual innocence exception itself.

VETERANS AFFAIRS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 021657. Argued February 23, 2004Decided May 3, 2004
The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) authorizes the payment of attorneys fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States absent a showing by the Government that its position in the underlying litigation was substantially justified.  28 U. S. C. 2412(d)(1)(A).  Section 2412(d)(1)(B) sets a deadline of 30 days after final judgment for the filing of a fee application and directs that the application include: (1) a showing that the applicant is a prevailing party; (2) a showing that the applicant is eligible to receive an award; and (3) a statement of the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney  stating the actual time expended and the rate charged.  Section 2412(d)(1)(B)s second sentence further requires the applicant to allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.


Petitioner Scarborough prevailed before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in an action for disability benefits against respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Scarboroughs counsel filed a timely application for attorneys fees and costs pursuant to 2412(d), showing that Scarborough was the prevailing party in the underlying litigation and was eligible to receive an award.  Counsel also stated the total amount sought, and itemized hours and rates of work.  But counsel failed initially to allege, in addition, that the position of the United States was not substantially justified. 2412(d)(1)(B).  The Secretary moved to dismiss the application on the ground that the CAVC lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to award fees because Scarboroughs counsel had failed to make the required no-substantial-justification allegation.  Scarboroughs counsel immediately filed an amended application adding that allegation.  In the interim between the initial filing and the amendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing period had expired.  For that sole reason, the CAVC dismissed Scarboroughs fee application.


In affirming, the Federal Circuit initially held that EAJA plainly and unambiguously requires a party seeking fees under 2412(d) to submit an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day time limit.  This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106.  In Edelman, the Court had upheld an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation allowing amendment of an employment discrimination charge, timely filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to add, after the filing deadline, the required, but initially absent, verification.  Title VII, the Court explained, permitted relation back of a verification missing from an original filing.  Id., at 115118.  On remand, the Federal Circuit adhered to its earlier decision, distinguishing Edelman on the ground that, in Title VIIs remedial scheme, laypersons often initiate the process, whereas EAJA is directed to attorneys.  The appeals court also observed that the timely filing and verification requirements at issue in Edelman appear in separate statutory provisions, while EAJAs 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutory provision.  The Federal Circuit also distinguished the holding in Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U. S. 757, that a pro se litigants failure to hand sign a timely filed notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect.  This Court had noted in Becker, the Federal Circuit pointed out, that the timing and signature requirements there at issue were found in separate rules.
Held:A timely fee application, pursuant to 2412(d), may be amended after the 30-day filing period has run to cure an initial failure to allege that the Governments position in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification.  Thus, Scarboroughs fee application, as amended, qualifies for consideration and determination on the merits.  Pp.920.
(a)Whether Scarborough is time barred by 2412(d)(1)(B) from gaining the fee award authorized by 2412(d)(1)(A) does not concern the federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction.  Rather, it concerns a mode of relief (costs including legal fees) ancillary to the judgment of a court that has plenary jurisdiction of [the civil] action in which the fee application is made.  See 2412(b) and (d)(1)(A); 38 U. S. C. 7252(a).  More particularly, the current dispute presents a question of time.  The issue is not whether, but when, 2412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee applicant to allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.  Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for such claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a courts adjudicatory authority.  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S.___ , ___ (slip op., at 10).  Section 2412(d)(1)(B) does not describe what classes of cases the CAVC is competent to adjudicate, but relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that courts adjudicatory authority.  Pp.911.


(b)Unlike the 2412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must show (his prevailing party status, eligib[ility] to receive an award, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement), the required not substantially justified allegation imposes no proof burden on the fee applicant, but is simply an allegation or pleading requirement.  So understood, the applicants pleading burden is akin to Beckers signature requirement and Edelmans verification requirement.  Like those requirements, EAJAs ten-word not substantially justified allegation is a think twice prescription that stem[s] the urge to litigate irresponsibly, Edelman, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, the allegation functions to shift the burden to the Government to prove that its position in the underlying litigation was substantially justified, 2412(d)(1)(A).  The allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the Government is aware, from the moment a fee application is filed, that to defeat the application on the merits, it will have to prove its position was substantially justified.  A failure to make the allegation, therefore, should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is applying for fees, from what judgment, and to which court.  Becker, 532 U. S., at 767.  Moreover, because Scarboroughs lawyers statutory contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by an EAJA award, see 38 U. S. C. 5904(d)(1); Fee Agreements, note following 28 U. S. C. 2412, allowing the curative amendment benefits the complainant directly, and is not fairly described as simply a boon for his counsel.


The Court rejects the Governments assertion that the relation-back regime, as now codified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), is out of place in this context because that Rule governs pleadings, a term that does not encompass fee applications.  In Becker and Edelman, the Court approved application of the relation-back doctrine to a notice of appeal and an EEOC discrimination charge, neither of which is a pleading under the Federal Rules.  Moreover, relation back was not an invention of the federal rulemakers.  This Court applied the doctrine well before the Federal Rules became effective, see, e.g., New York Central & Hudson River R. Co. v. Kinney, 260 U. S. 340, 346.  Thus, the relation-back doctrine properly guides the Courts determination here: The amended application arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the initial application.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).  Pp.1116.


(c)The Court rejects the Governments argument that 2412s waiver of sovereign immunity from liability for fees is conditioned on the fee applicants meticulous compliance with each and every 2412(d)(1)(B) requirement within 30 days of final judgment, including the allegation that that the United States position was not substantially justified.  Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95, and Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145in which the Court recognized that limitation principles generally apply to the Government in the same way they apply to private partiesare enlightening on this issue.  The Government asserts unpersuasively that Irwin and Franconia do not bear on this case because 2412(d) authorizes fee awards against it under rules that have no analogue in private litigation.  Because many statutes that create claims for relief against the United States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants, Irwins reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent.  In any event, 2412(d) is analogous to federal prevailing party fee-shifting statutes that are applicable to suits between private litigants.  Finally, the Courts conclusion will not expose the Government to any unfair imposition.  The Government has never argued that it will be prejudiced if Scarboroughs not substantially justified allegation is permitted to relate back to his timely filed fee application.  Moreover, a showing of prejudice should preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in the first place.  EAJA itself also has a built-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A) disallows fees where special circumstances make an award unjust.  Pp.1720.

|541 u.s. 428|"JAY SHAWN JOHNSON, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of california
[May 3, 2004]
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California interpreting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986).  540 U. S. ___ (2003).  The case was briefed and argued, but we now conclude that we are without jurisdiction in the matter.


The California Supreme Court reversed the California Court of Appeals decision reversing petitioners conviction.  30 Cal. 4th 1302, 71 P.3d 270 (2003).  The Court of Appeal held that petitioner was entitled to relief under California v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P.2d 748 (1978), and Batson v. Kentucky, supra.  88 Cal. App. 4th 318, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001).  It also noted petitioners separate evidentiary and prosecutorial misconduct claims, App. 87, but did not determine whether those claims would independently support reversal of petitioners conviction.  The California Supreme Court addressed only the Wheeler/Batson claim, and, after reversing on that ground, remanded for further proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.  30 Cal. 4th., at 1328, 71 P.3d, at 287.


Under 28 U. S.C. 1257, our jurisdiction is limited to review of [f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.  In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469 (1975), we described four exceptional categories of cases to be regarded as final on the federal issue despite the ordering of further proceedings in the lower state courts.  In a post-oral-argument supplemental brief, petitioner argues that the fourth of these categories fits this case.  That category involves situations:
where the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come.  In these circumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.  Id., at 482483.

Here, petitioner can make no convincing claim of erosion of federal policy that is not common to all decisions rejecting a defendants Batson claim.  The fourth category therefore does not apply.  See Florida v. Thomas, 532 U. S. 774, 780 (2001).  A contrary conclusion would permit the fourth exception to swallow the rule.  See Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, 622 (1981) (per curiam).


The present case comes closest to fitting in the third Cox category, but ultimately falls outside of it.  That category involves those situations where the federal claim has been finally decided, with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come, but in which later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case.  Cox Broadcasting, Corp., supra, at 481.  In the event that the California Court of Appeal on remand affirms the judgment of conviction, petitioner could once more seek review of his Batson claim in the Supreme Court of Californiaalbeit unsuccessfullyand then seek certiorari on that claim from this Court.


Compliance with the provisions of 1257 is an essential prerequisite to our deciding the merits of a case brought here under that section.  It is our obligation to raise any question of such compliance on our own motion, even though counsel has not called our attention to it.  See, e.g., Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 384 (1884).  But as the present case illustrates, we are not always successful in policing this gatekeeping function without the aid of counsel.


Part of the problem was that the California Court of Appeals decision was certified by that court for partial publication.  It addressed the Wheeler/Batson claim in the published portion.  88 Cal. App. 4th 318, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727 (2001).  In the unpublished portion, the court briefly addressed petitioners evidentiary claims to provide guidance for the trial court on retrial, and noted that it would not address whether petitioners objections were properly preserved or consider petitioners prosecutorial misconduct claim.  App. 58.  Petitioner appended only the published portion of the California Court of Appeals decision to his petition for a writ of certiorari.  This Courts Rule 14.1(i) instructs petitioners to include, inter alia, any relevant opinions . . . entered in the case in the appendix to the petition for certiorari.  The full opinion of the California Court of Appeal was not filed in this Court until the joint appendix to the briefs on the merits was filed.  App. 58
112.  Had the full opinion been brought to this Courts attention, it might have been more evident to us that the Supreme Court of Californias decision was not final for the purposes of 1257.


A petition for certiorari must demonstrate to this Court that it has jurisdiction to review the judgment.  This Courts Rule 14.1(g).  And a respondent has a duty to address any perceived misstatement of fact or law in the petition that bears on what issues properly would be before the Court if certiorari were granted.  Rule 15.2.  Our Rules also require that each party provide a statement for the basis of our jurisdiction in its brief on the merits.  Rule 24.1(e).  At all stages in this case, both parties represented that our jurisdiction was proper pursuant to 1257(a).  Pet. for Cert. 1; Brief in Opposition 1; Brief for Petitioner 1; Brief for Respondent 1.


It behooves counsel for both petitioner and respondent to assure themselves that the decision for which review is sought is indeed a [f]inal judgmen[t] under 1257.  Such attention is mandated by our Rules and will avoid the expenditure of resources of both counsel and of this Court on an abortive proceeding such as the present one.


We dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.
It is so ordered.

|541 u.s. 433|"RAYMOND L. MIDDLETON, WARDEN v. SALLY MARIE McNEIL
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031028. Decided May 3, 2004
Per Curiam.
I

Respondent Sally Marie McNeil killed her husband after an argument over his infidelity and spending habits.  The State of California charged her with murder.  Respondents theory at trial was that her husband had tried to strangle her during the argument, but that she had escaped, fetched a shotgun from the bedroom, and killed him out of fear for her life.  Fingernail marks were indeed found on her neck after the shooting.  She testified that her husband had been abusive, and a defense expert opined that she suffered from Battered Womens Syndrome.  The State countered with forensic evidence showing that the fingernail marks were not her husbands and may have been self-inflicted, and with the testimony of a 911 operator who overheard respondent tell her husband she had shot him because she would no longer tolerate his behavior. 
Under California law, [m]urder is the unlawful killing of a human being  with malice aforethought.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. 187(a) (West 1999).  The element of malice is negated if one kills out of fear of imminent peril.  Inre Christian S., 7 Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P.2d 574, 576 (1994).  Where that fear is unreasonable (but nevertheless genuine), it reduces the crime from murder to voluntary manslaughtera doctrine known as imperfect self-defense.  Ibid.  At respondents trial, the judge instructed the jury on these concepts as follows:
The specific intent for voluntary manslaughter, as opposed to murder, must arise upon one of [the] following circumstances:
.     .     .     .     .


[A]n honest but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend oneself against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury.  That would be imperfect self-defense.
.     .     .     .     .


To establish that a killing is murder [and] not manslaughter, the burden is on the People to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of murder and that the act which caused the death was not done  in the honest, even though unreasonable, belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or to great bodily injury.
.     .     .     .     .


A person, who kills another person in the actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril to life or great bodily injury, kills unlawfully, but is not guilty of murder.  This would be so even though a reasonable person in the same situation, seeing and knowing the same facts, would not have had the same belief.  Such an actual but unreasonable belief is not a defense to the crime of voluntary manslaughter.


An imminent peril is one that is apparent, present, immediate and must be instantly dealt with, or must so appear at the time to the slayer as a reasonable person.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3133.

The last four words of this instructionas a reasonable personare not part of the relevant form instruction, 1California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 5.17 (6th ed. 1996), and were apparently included in error.  The prosecutors closing argument, however, correctly stated the law.


Respondent was convicted of second-degree murder and appealed on the basis of the erroneous jury instruction.  The California Court of Appeal acknowledged the error but upheld her conviction, reasoning:
[R]eversal is not required because [e]rror cannot be predicated upon an isolated phrase, sentence or excerpt from the instructions since the correctness of an instruction is to be determined in its relation to the other instructions and in light of the instructions as a whole.  Here, when all of the jury instructions on voluntary manslaughter and imperfect self-defense, are considered in their entirety, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have misunderstood the requirements of the imperfect self-defense component of voluntary manslaughter.  On the contrary, these instructions repeatedly informed the jury that if the defendant had an honest (or actual) but unreasonable belief in the need to act in self-defense, then the offense would be manslaughter and the defendant could not be convicted of murder.  Furthermore, in arguing to the jury, the prosecutor set forth the appropriate standard, stating [i]f you believe it is an imperfect self-defense, that she actually believed but that a reasonable person would not believe in the necessity for self-defense, that lessens the crime to what is called, voluntary manslaughter.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3334 (citations omitted).

Respondent then sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court denied her petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  344 F.3d 988 (2003).  We now grant the States petition for a writ of certiorari and respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse.
II

A federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if a state courts adjudication of his constitutional claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Where, as here, the state courts application of governing federal law is challenged, it must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.  Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, ___ (2003) (slip op., at 45) (per curiam); see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 409 (2000).
In a criminal trial, the State must prove every element of the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to give effect to that requirement.  See Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 520521 (1979).  Nonetheless, not every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation.  The question is whether the ailing instruction  so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)).  [A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.  Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 378 (1990) (quoting Cupp, supra, at 146147).  If the charge as a whole is ambiguous, the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.  Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).


The Ninth Circuit held that the erroneous imminent-peril instruction eliminated respondents imperfect self-defense claim, and that the state court unreasonably applied federal law by completely ignor[ing] unchallenged and uncorrected instructions to the jury.  344 F.3d, at 999.  It acknowledged that it was bound to consider the jury charge as a whole, but held that the other instructions were irrelevant because [t]he only time that the trial judge actually defined imminent peril for the jury was in the erroneous instruction on imperfect self-defense.  Id., at 997.


This conclusion failed to give appropriate deference to the state courts decision.  Contrary to the Ninth Circuits description, the state court did not ignor[e] the faulty instruction.  It merely held that the instruction was not reasonably likely to have misled the jury given the multiple other instances (at least three, see supra, at 2) where the charge correctly stated that respondents belief could be unreasonable.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34.  Given three correct instructions and one contrary one, the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it found that there was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.


The Ninth Circuit thought that the other references to unreasonableness were irrelevant because they were not part of the definition of imminent peril.  That alone does not make them irrelevant; whether one defines imminent peril in terms of an unreasonable belief or instead describes imperfect self-defense as allowing an unreasonable belief in imminent peril, the import of the instruction is the same.  Perhaps the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the erroneous definition of imminent peril caused the jury to believe that the earlier, correct instructions (actual but unreasonable belief in the necessity to defend against imminent peril) meant that, although the belief in the necessity to defend may be unreasonable, the belief in the existence of the imminent peril may not.  This interpretation would require such a rare combination of extremely refined lawyerly parsing of an instruction, and extremely gullible acceptance of a result that makes no conceivable sense, that the state courts implicit rejection of the possibility was surely not an unreasonable application of federal law.


The Ninth Circuit also faulted the state court for relying on the prosecutors argument, noting that instructions from a judge are presumed to have more influence than arguments of counsel.  344 F.3d, at 999 (citing Boyde, supra, at 384).  But this is not a case where the jury charge clearly says one thing and the prosecutor says the opposite; the instructions were at worst ambiguous because they were internally inconsistent.  Nothing in Boyde precludes a state court from assuming that counsels arguments clarified an ambiguous jury charge.  This assumption is particularly apt when it is the prosecutors argument that resolves an ambiguity in favor of the defendant.


The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

|541 u.s. 246|"ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION et al. v. SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
DISTRICT et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021343. Argued January 14, 2004Decided April 28, 2004
Respondent South Coast Air Quality Management District (District)the California subdivision responsible for air pollution control in the Los Angeles metropolitan areaenacted six Fleet Rules prohibiting the purchase or lease by various public and private fleet operators of vehicles that do not comply with requirements in the Rules.  Petitioner Engine Manufacturers Association sued the District and its officials, claiming that the Fleet Rules were pre-empted by 209 of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which prohibits the adoption or attempted enforcement of any state or local standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, 42 U. S.C. 7543(a).  In upholding the Rules, the District Court found that they were not standard[s] under 209 because they regulate only the purchase of vehicles that are otherwise certified for sale in California, and distinguished decisions of the First and Second Circuits pre-empting similar state laws as involving a restriction on vehicle sales rather than vehicle purchases.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.The Fleet Rules do not escape pre-emption just because they address the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale.  Neither the District Courts interpretation of standard to include only regulations that compel manufacturers to meet specified emission limits nor its resulting distinction between purchase and sales restrictions finds support in 209(a)s text or the CAAs structure.  The ordinary meaning of language employed by Congress is assumed accurately to express its legislative purpose.  Park N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194.  Today, as when 209(a) became law, standard means that which is established by authority, custom, or general consent, as a model or example; criterion; test.  Websters Second New International Dictionary 2455.  The criteria referred to in 209 relate to the emission characteristics of a vehicle or engine.  This interpretation is consistent with the use of standard throughout Title II of the CAA.  Defining standard to encompass only production mandates confuses standards with methods of enforcing standards.  Manufacturers (or purchasers) can be made responsible for ensuring that vehicles comply with emission standards, but the standards themselves are separate from enforcement techniques.  While standards target vehicles and engines, standard-enforcement efforts can be directed toward manufacturers or purchasers.  This distinction is borne out in the enforcement provisions immediately following CAA 202.  And 246, which requires federal purchasing restrictions, shows that Congress contemplated the enforcement of emission standards through purchase requirements.  A purchase/sale distinction also makes no sense, since a manufacturers right to sell federally approved vehicles is meaningless absent a purchasers right to buy them.  Pp.511.


2.While at least certain aspects of the Fleet Rules appear to be pre-empted, the case is remanded for the lower courts to address, in light of the principles articulated here, questions neither passed on below nor presented in the certiorari petition that may affect the ultimate disposition of petitioners suit.  Pp.1112.
309 F. 3d 550, vacated and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and Stevens, OConnor, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

||"VIETH et al. v. JUBELIRER, PRESIDENT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SENATE, et al.
appeal from united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania
No. 021580. Argued December 10, 2003Decided April 28, 2004
After Pennsylvanias General Assembly adopted a congressional redistricting plan, plaintiffs-appellants sued to enjoin the plans implementation, alleging, inter alia, that it constituted a political gerrymander in violation of Article I and the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause.  The three-judge District Court dismissed the gerrymandering claim, and the plaintiffs appealed.
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
241 F.Supp. 2d 478, affirmed.
Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice OConnor, and Justice Thomas, concluded that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable because no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating such claims exist.  They would therefore overrule Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, in which this Court held that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable, but could not agree upon a standard for assessing political gerrymandering claims.  Pp. 437.


(a)Political gerrymanders existed in colonial times and continued through the framing.  The Framers provided a remedy for the problem: the Constitution gives state legislatures the initial power to draw federal election districts, but authorizes Congress to make or alter those districts.  U. S. Const., Art. I, 4.  In Bandemer, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause also grants judges the powerand dutyto control that practice.  Pp. 47.


(b) Neither Art. I, 2 or 4, nor the Equal Protection Clause, provides a judicially enforceable limit on the political considerations that the States and Congress may take into account when districting.  Pp. 737.


(1)Among the tests for determining the existence of a nonjusticiable or political question is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question.  Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217.  Because the Bandemer Court was not persuaded that there are no such standards for deciding political gerrymandering cases, 478 U. S., at 123, such cases were justiciable.  However, the six-Justice majority in Bandemer could not discern what the standards might be.  For the past 18 years, the lower courts have simply applied the Bandemer pluralitys standard, almost invariably producing the same result as would have obtained had the question been nonjusticiable: judicial intervention has been refused.  Eighteen years of judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justifies revisiting whether the standard promised by Bandemer exists.  Pp. 711.


(2)The Bandemer pluralitys standardthat a political gerrymandering claim can succeed only where the plaintiffs show both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group, 478 U. S., at 127has proved unmanageable in application.  Because that standard was misguided when proposed, has not been improved in subsequent application, and is not even defended by the appellants in this Court, it should not be affirmed as a constitutional requirement.  Pp.1114.


(3)Appellants proposed two-pronged standard based on Art. I, 2, and the Equal Protection Clause is neither discernible nor manageable.  Appellants are mistaken when they contend that their intent prong (predominant intent) is no different from that which this Court has applied in racial gerrymandering cases.  In those cases, the predominant intent test is applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted, see, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, whereas here appellants assert that their test is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation behind the entire statewide plan.  Vague as a predominant-motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.  For this and other reasons, the racial gerrymandering cases provide no comfort.  The effects prong of appellants proposal requires (1) that the plaintiffs show that the rival partys voters are systematically packed or cracked; and (2) that the court be persuaded from the totality of the circumstances that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  This standard is not discernible because the Constitution provides no right to proportional representation.  Even were the standard discernible, it is not judicially manageable.  There is no effective way to ascertain a partys majority status, and, in any event, majority status in statewide races does not establish majority status for particular district contests.  Moreover, even if a majority party could be identified, it would be impossible to assure that it won a majority of seats unless the States traditional election structures were radically revised.  Pp. 1421.


(4)For many of the same reasons, Justice Powells Bandemer standarda totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that evaluates districts with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander is not fairmust also be rejected.  Fairness is not a judicially manageable standard.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that is necessary to enable state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the courts discretion, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.  Pp. 2122.


(c) Writing separately in dissent, Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer each propose a different standard for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims.  These proposed standards each have their own deficiencies, but additionally fail for reasons identified with respect to the standards proposed by appellants and those proposed in Bandemer.  Justice Kennedy concurs in the judgment, recognizing that there are no existing manageable standards for measuring whether a political gerrymander burdens the representational rights of a partys voters.  Pp. 2237.


(d)Stare decisis does not require that Bandemer be allowed to stand.  Stare decisis claims are at their weakest with respect to a decision interpreting the Constitution, particularly where there has been no reliance on that decision.  P. 37.


Justice Kennedy, while agreeing that appellants complaint must be dismissed, concluded that all possibility of judicial relief should not be foreclosed in cases such as this because a limited and precise rationale may yet be found to correct an established constitutional violation.  Courts confront two obstacles when presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting commands general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  That courts can grant relief in districting cases involving race does not answer the need for fairness principles, since those cases involve sorting permissible districting classifications from impermissible ones.  Politics is a different matter.  Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735.  A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.  The object of districting is to establish fair and effective representation for all citizens.  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533.  It might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes the analysis difficult.  With no agreed upon substantive principles of fair districting, there is no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden are critical to our intervention. In this case, the plurality convincingly demonstrates that the standards proposed in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, by the parties here, and by the dissents are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both.  There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable.  However, they are not so compelling that they require the Court now to bar all future partisan gerrymandering claims.  Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, makes clear that the more abstract standards that guide analysis of all Fourteenth Amendment claims suffice to assure justiciability of claims like these.  That a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights has not yet emerged does not mean that none will emerge in the future.  The Court should adjudicate only what is in the case before it.  In this case, absent a standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.  That describes no constitutional flaw under the governing Fourteenth Amendment standard.  Gaffney, 412 U. S., at 752.  While the equal protection standard continues to govern such cases, the First Amendment may prove to offer a sounder and more prudential basis for judicial intervention in political gerrymandering cases.  First Amendment analysis does not dwell on whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose, but concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.  That analysis allows a pragmatic or functional assessment that accords some latitude to the States.  See, e.g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214.  Pp.113.

(2)The Bandemer pluralitys standardthat a political gerrymandering claim can succeed only where the plaintiffs show both intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group, 478 U. S., at 127has proved unmanageable in application.  Because that standard was misguided when proposed, has not been improved in subsequent application, and is not even defended by the appellants in this Court, it should not be affirmed as a constitutional requirement.  Pp.1114.


(3)Appellants proposed two-pronged standard based on Art. I, 2, and the Equal Protection Clause is neither discernible nor manageable.  Appellants are mistaken when they contend that their intent prong (predominant intent) is no different from that which this Court has applied in racial gerrymandering cases.  In those cases, the predominant intent test is applied to the challenged district in which the plaintiffs voted, see, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, whereas here appellants assert that their test is satisfied only when partisan advantage was the predominant motivation behind the entire statewide plan.  Vague as a predominant-motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.  For this and other reasons, the racial gerrymandering cases provide no comfort.  The effects prong of appellants proposal requires (1) that the plaintiffs show that the rival partys voters are systematically packed or cracked; and (2) that the court be persuaded from the totality of the circumstances that the map can thwart the plaintiffs ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.  This standard is not discernible because the Constitution provides no right to proportional representation.  Even were the standard discernible, it is not judicially manageable.  There is no effective way to ascertain a partys majority status, and, in any event, majority status in statewide races does not establish majority status for particular district contests.  Moreover, even if a majority party could be identified, it would be impossible to assure that it won a majority of seats unless the States traditional election structures were radically revised.  Pp. 1421.


(4)For many of the same reasons, Justice Powells Bandemer standarda totality-of-the-circumstances analysis that evaluates districts with an eye to ascertaining whether the particular gerrymander is not fairmust also be rejected.  Fairness is not a judicially manageable standard.  Some criterion more solid and more demonstrably met than that is necessary to enable state legislatures to discern the limits of their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain the courts discretion, and to win public acceptance for the courts intrusion into a process that is the very foundation of democratic decisionmaking.  Pp. 2122.


(c) Writing separately in dissent, Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer each propose a different standard for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims.  These proposed standards each have their own deficiencies, but additionally fail for reasons identified with respect to the standards proposed by appellants and those proposed in Bandemer.  Justice Kennedy concurs in the judgment, recognizing that there are no existing manageable standards for measuring whether a political gerrymander burdens the representational rights of a partys voters.  Pp. 2237.


(d)Stare decisis does not require that Bandemer be allowed to stand.  Stare decisis claims are at their weakest with respect to a decision interpreting the Constitution, particularly where there has been no reliance on that decision.  P. 37.


Justice Kennedy, while agreeing that appellants complaint must be dismissed, concluded that all possibility of judicial relief should not be foreclosed in cases such as this because a limited and precise rationale may yet be found to correct an established constitutional violation.  Courts confront two obstacles when presented with a claim of injury from partisan gerrymandering.  First is the lack of comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries.  No substantive definition of fairness in districting commands general assent.  Second is the absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.  That courts can grant relief in districting cases involving race does not answer the need for fairness principles, since those cases involve sorting permissible districting classifications from impermissible ones.  Politics is a different matter.  Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U. S. 735.  A determination that a gerrymander violates the law must rest on something more than the conclusion that political classifications were applied.  It must rest instead on a conclusion that the classifications, though generally permissible, were applied in an invidious manner or in a way unrelated to any legitimate legislative objective.  The object of districting is to establish fair and effective representation for all citizens.  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533.  It might seem that courts could determine, by the exercise of their judgment, whether political classifications are related to this object or instead burden representational rights.  The lack, however, of any agreed upon model of fair and effective representation makes the analysis difficult.  With no agreed upon substantive principles of fair districting, there is no basis on which to define clear, manageable, and politically neutral standards for measuring the burden a given partisan classification imposes on representational rights.  Suitable standards for measuring this burden are critical to our intervention. In this case, the plurality convincingly demonstrates that the standards proposed in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, by the parties here, and by the dissents are either unmanageable or inconsistent with precedent, or both.  There are, then, weighty arguments for holding cases like these to be nonjusticiable.  However, they are not so compelling that they require the Court now to bar all future partisan gerrymandering claims.  Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, makes clear that the more abstract standards that guide analysis of all Fourteenth Amendment claims suffice to assure justiciability of claims like these.  That a workable standard for measuring a gerrymanders burden on representational rights has not yet emerged does not mean that none will emerge in the future.  The Court should adjudicate only what is in the case before it.  In this case, absent a standard by which to measure the burden appellants claim has been imposed on their representational rights, appellants evidence at best demonstrates only that the legislature adopted political classifications.  That describes no constitutional flaw under the governing Fourteenth Amendment standard.  Gaffney, 412 U. S., at 752.  While the equal protection standard continues to govern such cases, the First Amendment may prove to offer a sounder and more prudential basis for judicial intervention in political gerrymandering cases.  First Amendment analysis does not dwell on whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose, but concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining partys voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association.  That analysis allows a pragmatic or functional assessment that accords some latitude to the States.  See, e.g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214.  Pp.113.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 02857. Argued February 23, 2004Decided April 21, 2004
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) regulates, inter alia, the disclosures that credit card issuers must make to consumers, 15 U. S.C. 1637(a), and provides consumers with a civil remedy for creditors failure to comply, 1640.  Among other things, the creditors periodic balance statement to the consumer must include [t]he amount of any finance charge, 1637(b)(4), which is defined as an amount payable directly or indirectly by the [consumer], and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.  1605(a).  Section 1604(a) expressly gives to the Federal Reserve Board (Board) expansive authority to prescribe regulations containing such classifications, differentiations, or other provisions, as, in the Boards judgment, are necessary or proper to effectuate [TILAs] purposes  , to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance therewith.  The Boards Regulation Z interprets 1605(a)s finance charge definition to exclude charges  for exceeding a credit limit (over-limit fees).


Respondent holds a credit card issued by one of the petitioner financial institutions and in which the other holds an interest.  Although the parties agreement set respondents credit limit at $2,000, she was able to make charges exceeding that limit, subject to a $29 over-limit fee for each month in which her balance exceeded $2,000.  While her monthly billing statement disclosed the over-limit fees, the amount was not included as part of the finance charge, consistent with Regulation Z.  Respondent filed suit alleging that petitioners violated TILA by failing to classify over-limit fees as finance charges, but the District Court granted petitioners motion to dismiss on the ground that Regulation Z specifically excludes such fees.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the exclusion conflicts with 1605(a)s plain language.  Noting, first, that, as a remedial statute, TILA must be liberally interpreted in favor of consumers, the court then concluded that the over-limit fees in this case were imposed incident to an extension of credit and therefore fell squarely within 1605s language.  That conclusion turned on the distinction the court drew between unilateral acts of default, which would not generate a finance charge, and acts of default resulting from an agreement between the creditor and the consumer, which would.
Held:Regulation Z is not an unreasonable interpretation of 1605.  Pp.411.
(a)Because respondent does not challenge the Boards authority under 1604(a) to issue binding regulations, this Court faces only two questions.  It asks, first, whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue, Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, in which case courts, as well as the Board, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress, id., at 842843.  However, whenever Congress has explicitly left a gap for the [implementing] agency to fill, the agencys regulation is given controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.  Id., at 843844.  Pp.45.


(b)TILA itself does not explicitly address whether over-limit fees are included within the finance charge definition.  The Sixth Circuit did not attempt to clarify the scope of 1605(a)s critical term incident to the extension of credit.  Because the phrase incident to does not make clear whether a substantial (as opposed to a remote) connection is required between an antecedent and its object, cf. Holly Farms Corp. v. NLRB, 517 U. S. 392, 402, n.9, it cannot be concluded that the term finance charge, standing alone, unambiguously includes over-limit fees.  Moreover, an examination of TILAs related provisions, as well as the full text of 1605 itself, casts doubt on the Sixth Circuits interpretation.  A consumer holding an open-end credit plan may incur two types of chargesfinance charges and other charges which may be imposed as part of the plan.  1637(a)(1)(5).  TILA does not make clear which charges fall into each category, but its recognition of at least two categories establishes that Congress did not contemplate that all charges made in connection with an open-end credit plan would be considered finance charges.  And where TILA explicitly addresses over-limit fees, it defines them as fees imposed in connection with an extension of credit, 1637(c)(1)(B)(iii), rather than incident to an extension of credit, 1605(a).  Furthermore, none of 1605s specific examples of charges that fall within the finance charge definition includes over-limit or comparable fees.  Thus, 1605(a) is, at best, ambiguous.  Pp.58.


(c)Regulation Zs exclusion of over-limit fees from finance charge[s] is in no way manifestly contrary to 1605.  Regulation Z defines finance charge as the cost of consumer credit, excluding as less relevant to determining such cost a number of specific payments, including over-limit fees, that do not automatically recur or are imposed only when a consumer defaults on a credit agreement.  Because over-limit fees are imposed only in the latter circumstance, they can reasonably be characterized as a penalty for defaulting on the credit agreement, and the Boards decision to exclude them from finance charge[s] is reasonable.  Despite the Boards rational decision to adopt a uniform rule excluding from the term finance charge all penalties imposed for exceeding the credit limit, the lower court adopted a case-by-case approach contingent on whether an act of default was unilateral.  That approach would prove unworkable to creditors and, more importantly, lead to significant confusion for the consumer, who would be able to decipher if a charge is more properly a finance charge or an other charge only by recalling the details of the particular transaction that caused him to exceed his credit limit.  In most cases, the consumer would not even know the relevant facts, which are contingent on the nature of the authorization given by the creditor to the merchant.  Here, the Board accomplished all of the objectives set forth in 1604(a)s broad delegation of rulemaking authority when it set forth a clear, easy to apply (and easy to enforce) rule that highlights the charges the Board determined to be most relevant to a consumers credit decisions.  Pp.811.  
295 F. 3d 522, reversed.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

|541 u.s. 193|"UNITED STATES v. LARA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 03107. Argued January 21, 2004Decided April 19, 2004
After respondent Lara, an Indian who is not a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe (Tribe), ignored the Tribes order excluding him from its reservation, he struck one of the federal officers arresting him.  He pleaded guilty in Tribal Court to the crime of violence to a policeman.  The Federal Government then charged him with the federal crime of assaulting a federal officer.  Lara claimed that, because key elements of that crime mirrored elements of his tribal crime, he was protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The Government countered that the Clause does not bar successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns, and that this dual sovereignty doctrine determined the outcome.  The Government noted that this Court has held that a tribe acts as a separate sovereign in prosecuting its own members, United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 318, 322323; that, after this Court ruled that a tribe lacks sovereign authority to prosecute nonmember Indians, see Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 679, Congress specifically authorized such prosecutions; and that, because this statute enlarges the tribes self-government powers to include the inherent power of Indian tribes  to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians, 25 U. S.C. 1301(2), the Tribe here had exercised its own tribal authority, not delegated federal authority.  Accepting this argument, the Magistrate Judge rejected Laras double jeopardy claim.  The en banc Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the dual sovereignty doctrine did not apply because the Tribal Court was exercising a federal prosecutorial power, and, thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second prosecution.
Held:Because the Tribe acted in its capacity as a sovereign authority, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal Government from proceeding with the present prosecution for a discrete federal offense.  Pp.416.
(a)Congress has the constitutional power to lift the restrictions on the tribes criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians.  Pp.413.


(1)Section 1301(2) recognize[s] and affirm[s] in each tribe the inherent power to prosecute nonmember Indians, and its legislative history confirms that such was Congress intent.  Thus, it seeks to adjust the tribes status, relaxing restrictions, recognized in Duro, that the political branches had imposed on the tribes exercise of inherent prosecutorial power.  Pp.45.


(2)Several considerations lead to the conclusion that Congress has the constitutional power to lift these restrictions.  First, the Constitution, through the Indian Commerce and Treaty Clauses, grants Congress plenary and exclusive powers to legislate in respect to Indian tribes.  E.g., Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 470471.  Second, Congress, with this Courts approval, has interpreted these plenary grants of power as authorizing it to enact legislation that both restricts tribal powers and, in turn, relaxes those restrictions.  Third, Congress statutory goalto modify the degree of autonomy enjoyed by a dependent sovereign that is not a Stateis not an unusual legislative objective.  Fourth, Lara points to no explicit language in the Constitution suggesting a limitation on Congress institutional authority to relax tribal sovereignty restrictions previously imposed by the political branches.  Fifth, the change at issue is limited, concerning a power similar to the power to prosecute a tribes own members, which this Court has called inherent.  Sixth, concluding that Congress has the power to relax the restrictions imposed by the political branches on the tribes inherent prosecutorial authority is consistent with this Courts earlier cases.  The holdings in Wheeler, supra, at 326; Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, 209210; and Duro, supra, at 686, that the tribes power to prosecute nonmembers was divested by treaties and Congress, reflected the Courts view of the tribes retained sovereign status at the time of those decisions; but they did not set forth constitutional limits prohibiting Congress from taking actions to modify or adjust that status.  The Court there based its descriptions of inherent tribal authority on the sources as they existed at the time.  Congressional legislation was one such important source, but it is a source subject to change.  When Duro, supra, at 686, like other cases, referred to a statute that delegated power to the tribes, it simply did not consider whether a statute could constitutionally achieve the same end by removing restrictions on the tribes inherent authority.  Thus, none of those cases can be read to hold that the Constitution forbids Congress to change judicially made federal Indian law through an amendment to 1301(2).  Wheeler, Oliphant, and Duro, then, are not determinative because Congress has enacted a new statute, relaxing restrictions on the bounds of the inherent tribal authority the United States recognizes.  Pp. 513.


(b)Laras additional arguments cannot help him win his double jeopardy claim.  This Court will not consider the merits of his due process claim that his prosecution was invalid because the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 does not guarantee counsel to an indigent criminal defendant.  Proving that claim does not show that the source of the tribal prosecution was federal power, something Lara must do to win his double jeopardy claim.  Like the due process claim, Laras argument that the phrase all Indians in inherent power  to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians violates the Equal Protection Clause is beside the point.  And Lara simply repeats these due process and equal protection arguments in a different form when he argues that the Duro Court found the absence of certain constitutional safeguards, such as an indigent defendants right to counsel, an important reason for concluding that tribes lacked the inherent power to try nonmember Indians.

No. 021593. Argued January 20, 2004Decided March 31, 2004
The Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to designate certain nonmineral Nevada lands on which settlers could obtain permits to drill for water.  Under 8 of the Pittman Act, each land grant, or patent, reserved to the United States all coal and other valuable minerals in the lands, and the right to remove the same.  When one of petitioners predecessors-in-interest began extracting sand and gravel from land patented under the Pittman Act, the Bureau of Land Management ruled that he had trespassed against the Governments reserved interest in the propertys valuable minerals, and the Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed.  Petitioner BedRoc Limited, LLC, which subsequently acquired the property and continued to remove the sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior, and petitioner Western Elite, Inc., filed a quiet title action in Federal District Court.  The court granted the Government summary judgment, holding that the contested sand and gravel are valuable minerals reserved to the United States by the Pittman Act.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
314 F. 3d 1080, reversed and remanded.
The Chief Justice, joined by Justice OConnor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded that sand and gravel are not valuable minerals reserved to the United States in land grants issued under the Pittman Act.  In construing the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA)which was identical to the Pittman Acts except insofar as it reserved to the United States all the coal and other minerals, whereas the Pittman Act reserved valuable mineralsthis Court determined that neither the dictionary nor the legal understanding of minerals prevailing in 1916 was conclusive, but that the SRHAs purpose and history demonstrated that gravel was a mineral reserved to the United States.  Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36, 5560.  This Court will not extend that holding to conclude that sand and gravel are valuable minerals.  The Western Nuclear Court had no choice but to speculate about congressional intent with respect to the scope of the amorphous term minerals, but here Congress has textually narrowed the terms scope by using the modifier valuable.  The inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as the text is unambiguous.  The proper inquiry  in interpreting mineral reservations focuses on the reservations ordinary meaning when it was enacted.  Amoco Production Co. v. Southern Ute Tribe, 526 U. S. 865, 874.  Because the Pittman Act applied only to Nevada, the ultimate question is whether the States sand and gravel were commonly regarded as valuable minerals in 1919.  Common sense says no: They were, and are, abundant throughout Nevada; they have no intrinsic value; and they were commercially worthless in 1919.  Thus, even if they were regarded as minerals, no one would have mistaken them for valuable minerals.  The statutory context of the Pittman Acts mineral reservation further confirms its ordinary meaning, as Congress explicitly cross-referenced the General Mining Act of 1872, and it is beyond dispute that when the Pittman Act became law, common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable valuable mineral deposit under the General Mining Act.  Because the statutory reservations text clearly excludes sand and gravel, there is no occasion to resort to legislative history here.  Pp.411.


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Breyer, concluded that the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919s mineral reservation cannot be meaningfully distinguished from the analogous provision in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA), and that the mineral reservations pursuant to both do not include sand and gravel.  Emphasizing valuable in the Pittman Act ignores the fact that the Act uses valuable minerals and minerals interchangeably.  And it implies that the Court erred in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., 462 U. S. 36, not by interpreting minerals too broadly to include sand and gravel, but by interpreting minerals too narrowly by reading into the term a requirement that the minerals can be used for commercial purposes.  If valuable were the textual source of a commercial purpose requirement, then the SRHAs lack of that modifier would imply that the SRHA contains no such requirement.  Because the SRHA and the Pittman Act should be construed similarly, the pluralitys reasoning with respect to the Pittman Act cannot be confined to that Act and naturally carries over to the SRHA.  If sand and gravel are not included within the Pittman Acts mineral reservations because they were not considered valuable minerals at the time the Act was passed, they, with respect to SRHA lands, were not considered to be susceptible of commercial use when Congress passed the SRHA.  Although the Western Nuclear Court incorrectly defined minerals to include sand and gravel, significant reliance interests would be upset if Western Nuclear were overruled.  The Pittman Act, however, involves substantially less land than the SRHA, and the Government does not identify any significant reliance interest that would be unsettled by this Courts failing to extend Western Nuclears reasoning.

No. 021794. Argued February 25, 2004Decided March 30, 2004
At the international border in southern California, customs officials seized 37 kilograms of marijuana from respondents gas tank by removing and disassembling the tank.  After respondent was indicted on federal drug charges, he moved to suppress the drugs recovered from the gas tank, relying on a Ninth Circuit panel decision holding that a gas tanks removal requires reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted the motion, and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed.
Held:The search did not require reasonable suspicion.  In the decision relied on below, the Ninth Circuit panel seized on language from United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U. S. 531, 538, that used routine as a descriptive term in discussing border searches.  The panel took routine, fashioned a new balancing test, and extended it to vehicle searches.  But the reasons that might support a suspicion requirement in the case of highly intrusive searches of persons simply do not carry over to vehicles.  Complex balancing tests to determine what is a routine vehicle search, as opposed to a more intrusive search of a person, have no place in border searches of vehicles.  The Governments interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border.  United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 616.  Congress has always granted the Executive plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border, without probable cause or a warrant, in order to regulate the collection of duties and to prevent the introduction of contraband into this country.  Montoya de Hernandez, supra, at 537.  Respondents assertion that he has a privacy interest in his fuel tank, and that the suspicionless disassembly of his tank is an invasion of his privacy, is rejected, as the privacy expectation is less at the border than it is in the interior, id., at 538, and this Court has long recognized that automobiles seeking entry into this country may be searched, see Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 154.  And while the Fourth Amendment protects property as well as privacy, Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56, 62, the interference with a motorists possessory interest in his gas tank is justified by the Governments paramount interest in protecting the border.  Thus, the Governments authority to conduct suspicionless inspections at the border includes the authority to remove, disassemble, and reassemble a vehicles fuel tank.  Pp.27.

|541 u.s. 157|"NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION v. FAVISH et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02954. Argued December 3, 2003Decided March 30, 2004
Skeptical about five Government investigations conclusions that Vincent Foster, Jr., deputy counsel to President Clinton, committed suicide, respondent Favish filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for, among other things, 10 death-scene photographs of Fosters body.  The Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) refused the request, invoking FOIA Exemption 7(C), which excuses from disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes if their production could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, 5 U. S.C. 552(b)(7)(C).  Favish sued to compel production.  In upholding OICs exemption claim, the District Court balanced the Foster familys privacy interest against any public interest in disclosure, holding that the former could be infringed by disclosure and that Favish had not shown how disclosure would advance his investigation, especially in light of the exhaustive investigation that had already occurred.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Favish need not show knowledge of agency misfeasance to support his request, and remanded the case for the interests to be balanced consistent with its opinion.  On remand, the District Court ordered the release of five of the photographs.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the release of four.
Held:
1.FOIA recognizes surviving family members right to personal privacy with respect to their close relatives death-scene images.  Favishs contention that Exemption 7(C)s personal privacy right is confined to the right to control information about oneself is too narrow an interpretation of Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U. S. 749, which held that the personal privacy concept must encompass an individuals control of information about himself, but had no occasion to consider whether those whose personal data are not in the requested materials also have a recognized privacy interest under the exemption.  It did explain, however, that Exemption 7(C)s concept of privacy is not a limited or cramped notion.  The exemption is in marked contrast to Exemption 6, which requires withholding of personnel and medical files only if disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.  Exemption 7(C)s comparative breadthit does not include clearly and uses could reasonably be expected to constitute instead of would constituteis no drafting accident, but is the result of specific amendments to an existing statute.  Because law enforcement documents often have information about persons whose link to the official inquiry may be the result of mere happenstance, there is special reason to protect intimate personal data, to which the public does not have a general right of access in the ordinary course.  The modifier personal before privacy does not bolster Favishs view that the family has no privacy interest in a decedents pictures.  Fosters relatives invoke that interest to secure their own refuge from a sensation-seeking culture for their own peace of mind and tranquility, not for the sake of Fosters reputation or some other interest personal to him.  It is proper to conclude that Congress intended to permit family members to assert their own privacy rights against public intrusions long deemed impermissible under the common law and cultural traditions.  This does not mean that the family is in the same position as the individual who is the disclosures subject.  However, this Court has little difficulty in finding in case law and traditions the right of family members to direct and control disposition of a deceaseds body and to limit attempts to exploit pictures of the deceaseds remains for public purposes.  The well-established cultural tradition of acknowledging a familys control over the body and the deceaseds death images has long been recognized at common law.  In enacting FOIA and amending Exemption 7(C) to extend its terms, Congress legislated against this background and the Attorney Generals consistent interpretation of the exemption.  The exemption protects a statutory privacy right that goes beyond the common law and the Constitution, see id., at 762, n.13.  It would be anomalous to hold in this case that the statute provides less protection than does the common law.  The statute must also be understood in light of the consequences that would follow from Favishs position.  Since FOIA withholding cannot be predicated on the requesters identity, violent criminals, who often make FOIA requests, would be able to obtain autopsies, photographs, and records of their deceased victims at the expense of surviving family members personal privacy.  Pp.512.


2.The Foster familys privacy interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure.  As a general rule, citizens seeking documents subject to FOIA disclosure are not required to explain why they seek the information.  However, when Exemption 7(C)s privacy concerns are present, the requester must show that public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake, and that the information is likely to advance that interest.  The Court does not in this single decision attempt to define the reasons that will suffice, or the necessary nexus between the requested information and the public interest served by disclosure, but there must be some stability with respect to both the specific category of privacy interests protected and the specific category of public interests that could outweigh the privacy claim.  Here, the Ninth Circuit correctly ruled that the family has a privacy interest protected by the statute and recognized as significant the asserted public interest in uncovering deficiencies or misfeasance in the Governments investigations into Fosters death, but it erred in defining the showing Favish must make to establish his public interest claim.  By requiring no particular evidence of some actual misfeasance or other impropriety, that courts holding leaves Exemption 7(C) with little force or content.  Under its rationale, the invasion of privacy would be extensive, since once disclosed, information belongs to the general public.  Thus, where there is a privacy interest protected by Exemption 7(C) and the public interest asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in performing their duties, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.  When the presumption of legitimacy accorded to the Governments official conduct is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it.  Given FOIAs pro-disclosure purpose, however, a less stringent standard is more faithful to the statutory scheme.  Only when the FOIA requester has produced evidence sufficient to warrant a belief by a reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred will there be a counterweight on the FOIA scale for a court to balance against the cognizable privacy interests in the requested documents.  Favish has produced no evidence to put that balance into play.  The District Courts first orderbefore it was set aside by the Ninth Circuit and superseded by the District Courts remand orderfollowed the correct approach.  Pp.1217.

|541 u.s. 125|"NIXON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI v.
MISSOURI MUNICIPAL LEAGUE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 021238. Argued January 12, 2004Decided March 24, 2004
After Missouri enacted a statute forbidding its political subdivision[s to] provide or offer for sale  a telecommunications service or  facility, the municipal respondents, including municipally owned utilities, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an order declaring the statute unlawful under 47 U. S.C. 253, which authorizes preemption of state and local laws and regulations that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications services.  Relying on its earlier order resolving a challenge to a comparable Texas law and the affirming opinion of the District of Columbia Circuit, the FCC refused to declare the Missouri statute preempted, concluding that any entity in 253(a) does not include state political subdivisions, but applies only to independent entities subject to state regulation.  The FCC also adverted to the principle of Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, that Congress needs to be clear before it constrains traditional state authority to order its government.  The Eighth Circuit panel unanimously reversed, explaining that 253(a)s word entity, especially when modified by any, manifested sufficiently clear congressional attention to governmental entities to get past Gregory. 
Held:The class of entities contemplated by 253 does not include the States own subdivisions, so as to affect the power of States and localities to restrict their own (or their political inferiors) delivery of telecommunications services.  Pp.414.
(a)Two considerations fall short of supporting the municipal respondents.  First, they argue that fencing governmental entities out of the telecommunications business flouts the public interest in promoting competition.  It does not follow, however, that preempting state or local barriers to governmental entry into the market would be an effective way to draw municipalities into the business, and in any event the issue here does not turn on the merits of municipal telecommunications services.  Second, concentrating on the undefined statutory phrase any entity does not produce a persuasive answer here.  While an entity can be either public or private, there is no convention of omitting the modifiers public and private when both are meant to be covered.  Nor is coverage of public entities reliably signaled by speaking of any entity; any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting.  To get at Congresss understanding requires a broader frame of reference, and in this litigation it helps to ask how Congress could have envisioned the preemption clause actually working if the FCC applied it at the municipal respondents urging.  See, e.g., New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals of N.J., 338 U. S. 665, 673.  The strange and indeterminate results of using federal preemption to free public entities from state or local limitations is the key to understanding that Congress used any entity with a limited reference to any private entity.  Pp.46.


(b)The municipal respondents position holds sufficient promise of futility and uncertainty to keep this Court from accepting it.  Pp.613.


(1)In familiar instances of regulatory preemption under the Supremacy Clause, a federal measure preempting state regulation of economic conduct by a private party simply leaves that party free to do anything it chooses consistent with the prevailing federal law.  See, e.g., Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 540553.  But no such simple result would follow from federal preemption meant to unshackle local governments from entrepreneurial limitations.  Such a governments capacity to enter an economic market turns not only on the effect of straightforward economic regulation below the national level (including outright bans), but on the authority and potential will of state or local governments to support entry into the market.  Preempting a ban on government utilities would not accomplish much if the government could not point to some law authorizing it to run a utility in the first place.  And preemption would make no difference to anyone if the state regulator were left with control over funding needed for any utility operation and declined to pay for it.  In other words, when a government regulates itself (or the subdivision through which it acts) there is no clear distinction between the regulator and the entity regulated.  Legal limits on what the government itself (including its subdivisions) may do will often be indistinguishable from choices that express what the government wishes to do with the authority and resources it can command.  Thus, preempting state or local governmental self-regulation (or regulation of political inferiors) would work so differently from preempting regulation of private players that it is highly unlikely that Congress intended to set off on such uncertain adventures.  Pp.67.


(2)Several hypothetical examples illustrate the implausibility of the municipal respondents reading that Congress intended 253 to preempt state or local governmental self-regulation.  Whether a law prohibiting an entitys ability to provide telecommunications under 253 means denying the entity a capacity or authority to act in the first place, or whether it means limiting or cutting back on some preexisting authority to go into the telecommunications business (under a different law), the hypotheticals demonstrate that 253 would not work like a normal preemptive statute if it applied to a governmental unit.  It would often accomplish nothing, it would treat States differently depending on the formal structures of their laws authorizing municipalities to function, and it would hold out no promise of a national consistency.  That Congress meant 253 to start down such a road in the absence of any clearer signal than the phrase ability of any entity is farfetched.  See, e.g., United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310 U. S. 534, 543.  Pp.712.


(3)The practical implication of the dissents reading of 253 to forbid States to withdraw municipalities preexisting authority expressly to enter the telecommunications business, but not withdrawals of authority that are competitively neutral in the sense of being couched in general terms that do not expressly target telecommunications, is to read out of 253 the words or has the effect of prohibiting.  Those words signal Congress willingness to preempt laws that produce the unwanted effect, even if they do not advertise their prohibitory agenda on their faces.  The dissents reading therefore disregards 253s plain language and entails a policy consequence that Congress could not possibly have intended.  Pp.1213.


(c)A complementary principle would bring the Court to the same conclusion even on the assumption that preemption might operate straightforwardly to provide local choice.  Section 253(a) is hardly forthright enough to pass Gregory: ability of any entity is not limited to one reading, and neither statutory structure nor legislative history points unequivocally to a commitment by Congress to treat governmental telecommunications providers on par with private firms.

			"|"NIXON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI v.
MISSOURI MUNICIPAL LEAGUE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 021238. Argued January 12, 2004Decided March 24, 2004
After Missouri enacted a statute forbidding its political subdivision[s to] provide or offer for sale  a telecommunications service or  facility, the municipal respondents, including municipally owned utilities, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an order declaring the statute unlawful under 47 U. S.C. 253, which authorizes preemption of state and local laws and regulations that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications services.  Relying on its earlier order resolving a challenge to a comparable Texas law and the affirming opinion of the District of Columbia Circuit, the FCC refused to declare the Missouri statute preempted, concluding that any entity in 253(a) does not include state political subdivisions, but applies only to independent entities subject to state regulation.  The FCC also adverted to the principle of Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, that Congress needs to be clear before it constrains traditional state authority to order its government.  The Eighth Circuit panel unanimously reversed, explaining that 253(a)s word entity, especially when modified by any, manifested sufficiently clear congressional attention to governmental entities to get past Gregory. 
Held:The class of entities contemplated by 253 does not include the States own subdivisions, so as to affect the power of States and localities to restrict their own (or their political inferiors) delivery of telecommunications services.  Pp.414.
(a)Two considerations fall short of supporting the municipal respondents.  First, they argue that fencing governmental entities out of the telecommunications business flouts the public interest in promoting competition.  It does not follow, however, that preempting state or local barriers to governmental entry into the market would be an effective way to draw municipalities into the business, and in any event the issue here does not turn on the merits of municipal telecommunications services.  Second, concentrating on the undefined statutory phrase any entity does not produce a persuasive answer here.  While an entity can be either public or private, there is no convention of omitting the modifiers public and private when both are meant to be covered.  Nor is coverage of public entities reliably signaled by speaking of any entity; any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting.  To get at Congresss understanding requires a broader frame of reference, and in this litigation it helps to ask how Congress could have envisioned the preemption clause actually working if the FCC applied it at the municipal respondents urging.  See, e.g., New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals of N.J., 338 U. S. 665, 673.  The strange and indeterminate results of using federal preemption to free public entities from state or local limitations is the key to understanding that Congress used any entity with a limited reference to any private entity.  Pp.46.


(b)The municipal respondents position holds sufficient promise of futility and uncertainty to keep this Court from accepting it.  Pp.613.


(1)In familiar instances of regulatory preemption under the Supremacy Clause, a federal measure preempting state regulation of economic conduct by a private party simply leaves that party free to do anything it chooses consistent with the prevailing federal law.  See, e.g., Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 540553.  But no such simple result would follow from federal preemption meant to unshackle local governments from entrepreneurial limitations.  Such a governments capacity to enter an economic market turns not only on the effect of straightforward economic regulation below the national level (including outright bans), but on the authority and potential will of state or local governments to support entry into the market.  Preempting a ban on government utilities would not accomplish much if the government could not point to some law authorizing it to run a utility in the first place.  And preemption would make no difference to anyone if the state regulator were left with control over funding needed for any utility operation and declined to pay for it.  In other words, when a government regulates itself (or the subdivision through which it acts) there is no clear distinction between the regulator and the entity regulated.  Legal limits on what the government itself (including its subdivisions) may do will often be indistinguishable from choices that express what the government wishes to do with the authority and resources it can command.  Thus, preempting state or local governmental self-regulation (or regulation of political inferiors) would work so differently from preempting regulation of private players that it is highly unlikely that Congress intended to set off on such uncertain adventures.

|541 u.s. 95|"SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT v. MICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 02626. Argued January 14, 2004Decided March 23, 2004
Congress established the Central and South Florida Flood Control Project (Project) to address drainage and flood control problems in reclaimed portions of the Everglades.  Five Project elements are at issue here.  The first, the C11 canal, collects ground water and rainwater from an area that includes urban, agricultural, and residential development.  The second Project element, pump station S9, moves water from the canal to the third element, an undeveloped wetland, WCA3, which is a remnant of the original South Florida Everglades.  Petitioner, the Projects day-to-day operator (hereinafter District), impounds the water there to keep if from flowing into the ocean and to preserve wetlands habitat.  Absent such human intervention, the water would flow back to the canal and flood the C11 basins populated areas.  Such flow is prevented by levees, including the L33 and L37 levees at issue here.  The combined effect of L33, L37, C11, and S9 is artificially to separate the C11 basin from WCA3, which would otherwise be a single wetland.  The Project has an environmental impact on wetland ecosystems.  Rain on the western side of L33 and L37 falls into WCA3s wetland ecosystem, but rain falling on the eastern side absorbs contaminants, including phosphorous from fertilizers, before entering the C11 canal.  When that water is pumped across the levees, the phosphorus alters the WCA3 ecosystems balance, stimulating the growth of algae and plants foreign to the Everglades.  Respondents (hereinafter Tribe) filed suit under the Clean Water Act (Act), which prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person unless done in compliance with the Act, 33 U. S. C. 1311(a).  Under the Acts National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), dischargers must obtain permits limiting the type and quantity of pollutants they can release into the Nations waters.  1342.  The Act defines discharge of a pollutant as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, 1362(12), and defines point source as any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance  from which pollutants are or may be discharged, 1362(14).  The Tribe claims that S9 requires an NPDES permit because it moves phosphorus-laden water from C11 into WCA3, but the District contends that S9s operation does not constitute the discharge of [a] pollutant under the Act.  The District Court granted the Tribe summary judgment, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Both rested their holdings on the predicate determination that C11 and WCA3 are two distinct water bodies.  
Held:The case is remanded for further proceedings regarding the parties factual dispute over whether C11 and WCA3 are meaningfully distinct water bodies.  Pp.614.
(a)Each of three arguments advanced by the District and the Federal Government as amicus would, if accepted, lead to the conclusion that S9 does not require an NPDES permit.  P.6.


(b)The Court rejects the Districts initial argument that the NPDES program covers a point source only when pollutants originate from that source and not when pollutants originating elsewhere merely pass through the point source.  The definition of a point source as a conveyance, 1362(14), makes plain that the point source need only convey the pollutant to navigable waters.  The Acts examples of point sourcespipes, ditches, tunnels, and conduitsare objects that transport, but do not generate, pollutants.  And one of the Acts primary goals was to impose NPDES permitting requirements on municipal wastewater treatment plants, which treat and discharge pollutants added to water by others.  Pp.78.


(c)The Government contends that all water bodies that are navigable waters under the Act should be viewed unitarily for purposes of NPDES permitting.  Because the Act requires NPDES permits only when a pollutant is added to navigable waters, the Government contends that such permits are not required when water from one navigable body is discharged, unaltered, into another navigable body.  Despite the relevance of this unitary waters approach, neither the District nor the Government raised it before the Eleventh Circuit or in their briefs respecting certiorari, and this Court is unaware of any case that has examined the argument in its present form.  Thus, the Court declines to resolve the argument here.  However, because the judgment must be vacated in any event, the unitary waters argument will be open to the parties on remand.  Pp.812.


(d)The District and the Government believe that the C11 canal and WCA3 impoundment area are not distinct water bodies, but are two hydrologically indistinguishable parts of a single water body.  The Tribe agrees that, if this is so, pumping water from one into the other cannot constitute an addition of pollutants within the meaning of the Act, but it disputes the Districts factual premise that C11 and WCA3 are one.  The parties also disagree about how the relationship between S9 and WCA3 should be assessed.  This Court does not decide here whether the District Courts test is adequate for determining whether C11 and WCA3 are distinct, because that court applied its test prematurely.  Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, but some factual issues remain unresolved here.  The District Court correctly characterized the flow through S9 as nonnatural, and it appears that if S9 were shut down, the water in the C11 canal might for a brief time flow east, rather than west.  But the record also suggests that if S9 were shut down, the area drained by C11 would flood, which might mean C11 would no longer be a distinct body of navigable water, but instead part of a larger water body extending over WCA3 and the C11 basin.  It also might call into question the Eleventh Circuits conclusion that S9 is the cause in fact of phosphorous addition to WCA3.  Nothing in the record suggests that the District Court considered these issues when it granted summary judgment.  If, after further development of the record, that court concludes that C11 and WCA3 are not meaningfully distinct water bodies, S9 will not need an NPDES permit.  Pp.1214.

No. 021389. Argued January 12, 2004Decided March 23, 2004
[T]he amount of any tax imposed [by the Internal Revenue Code] shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed.  26 U. S.C. 6501(a).  If a tax is properly so assessed, the statute of limitations for collecting it is extended by 10 years from the assessment date.  6502(a).  Respondents were general partners of a partnership (hereinafter Partnership) that failed to pay significant federal employment taxes from 1992 to 1995.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) timely assessed the Partnership, but the taxes were never paid.  Respondents later filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and the IRS then filed proof of claims against them for the Partnerships unpaid employment taxes.  Respondents objected, arguing that the timely assessment of the Partnership did not extend the 3-year limitations period against the general partners, who had not been separately assessed within that period.  The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents objections.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that since respondents are taxpayers under 7701, which defines taxpayer to mean any person subject to any internal revenue tax, they are also taxpayers under 6203 and 6501.  As such, the court held that the assessment against the Partnership extended the limitations period only with respect to the Partnership.
Held:The proper tax assessment against the Partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the Partnerships debts.  Pp.49.
(a)Respondents argue that a valid assessment triggering the 10-year increase in the limitations period must name them individually, as they are primarily liable for the tax debt.  They claim, first, that they are the relevant taxpayers under 6203, which requires the assessment to be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer.  Although the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded that an individual partner can be a taxpayer, 6203 speaks of the taxpayers liability, which indicates that the relevant taxpayer must be determined.  Here, the liability arose from the Partnerships failure to comply with 3402(a)(1)s requirement that an employer [paying] wages deduct and withhold employment taxes.  And 3403 makes clear that the employer that fails to withhold and submit the requisite employment taxes is the liable taxpayer.  In this case, the Partnership is the employer.  Second, respondents claim that they are primarily liable for the tax debt because California law makes them jointly and severally liable for the Partnerships debts.  However, to be primarily liable for this debt, respondents must show that they are the employer.  And, under California law, a partnership and its general partners are separate entities.  Thus respondents cannot argue that, for all intents and purposes, imposing a tax directly on the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly on the general partners, but must instead prove that the tax liability was imposed both on the Partnership and on respondents as separate employers.  That respondents are jointly and severally liable for the Partnerships debts is irrelevant to this determination.  Pp.47.


(b)The Code does not require the Government to make separate assessments of a single tax debt against persons or entities secondarily liable for that debt in order for 6502s extended limitations period to apply to judicial collection actions against those persons or entities.  It is clear that assessment refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability, see, e.g., 6201, and that it is the tax that is assessed, not the taxpayer, see, e.g., 6501.  The limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs the time extension for enforcing the tax liability.  United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489, 495.  Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for the taxpayers debt.  The assessments consequencesthe extension of the limitations period for collecting the debtattach to the debt without reference to the special circumstances of the secondarily liable parties.  Here, the tax was properly assessed against the Partnership, thereby extending the limitations period for collecting the debt.  The United States now timely seeks to collect that debt in judicial proceedings against respondents.  Pp.79.

The limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs the time extension for enforcing the tax liability.  United States v. Updike, 281 U. S. 489, 495.  Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for the taxpayers debt.  The assessments consequencesthe extension of the limitations period for collecting the debtattach to the debt without reference to the special circumstances of the secondarily liable parties.  Here, the tax was properly assessed against the Partnership, thereby extending the limitations period for collecting the debt.  The United States now timely seeks to collect that debt in judicial proceedings against respondents.  Pp.79.

|541 u.s. 36|"CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON
certiorari to the supreme court of washington
No. 029410. Argued November 10, 2003Decided March 8, 2004
Petitioner was tried for assault and attempted murder.  The State sought to introduce a recorded statement that petitioners wife Sylvia had made during police interrogation, as evidence that the stabbing was not in self-defense.  Sylvia did not testify at trial because of Washingtons marital privilege.  Petitioner argued that admitting the evidence would violate his Sixth Amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.  Under Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, that right does not bar admission of an unavailable witnesss statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bears adequate indicia of reliability, a test met when the evidence either falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Id., at 66. The trial court admitted the statement on the latter ground.  The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction, deeming the statement reliable because it was nearly identical to, i.e., interlocked with, petitioners own statement to the police, in that both were ambiguous as to whether the victim had drawn a weapon before petitioner assaulted him.
Held:The States use of Sylvias statement violated the Confrontation Clause because, where testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is confrontation.  Pp.533.
(a)The Confrontation Clauses text does not alone resolve this case, so this Court turns to the Clauses historical background.  That history supports two principles.  First, the principal evil at which the Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, particularly the use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.  The Clauses primary object is testimonial hearsay, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class.  Second, the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  English authorities and early state cases indicate that this was the common law at the time of the founding.  And the right  to be confronted with the witnesses against him, Amdt. 6, is most naturally read as a reference to the common-law right of confrontation, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.  See Mattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 243.  Pp.521.


(b)This Courts decisions have generally remained faithful to the Confrontation Clauses original meaning.  See, e.g., Mattox, supra.  Pp.2123.


(c)However, the same cannot be said of the rationales of this Courts more recent decisions.  See Roberts, supra, at 66.  The Roberts test departs from historical principles because it admits statements consisting of ex parte testimony upon a mere reliability finding.  Pp. 2425.


(d)The Confrontation Clause commands that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.  Roberts allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability, thus replacing the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.  Pp. 2527.


(e)Roberts framework is unpredictable.  Whether a statement is deemed reliable depends on which factors a judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them.  However, the unpardonable vice of the Roberts test is its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.  Pp. 2730.


(f)The instant case is a self-contained demonstration of Roberts unpredictable and inconsistent application.  It also reveals Roberts failure to interpret the Constitution in a way that secures its intended constraint on judicial discretion.  The Constitution prescribes the procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and this Court, no less than the state courts, lacks authority to replace it with one of its own devising.

|541 u.s. 77|"IOWA v. TOVAR
certiorari to the supreme court of iowa
No. 021541. Argued January 21, 2004Decided March 8, 2004
At respondent Tovars November 1996 arraignment for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OWI), in response to the trial courts questions, Tovar affirmed that he wanted to represent himself and to plead guilty.  Conducting the guilty plea colloquy required by the Iowa Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court explained that, if Tovar pleaded not guilty, he would be entitled to a speedy and public jury trial where he would have the right to counsel who could help him select a jury, question and cross-examine witnesses, present evidence, and make arguments on his behalf.  By pleading guilty, the court cautioned, Tovar would give up his right to a trial and his rights at that trial to be represented by counsel, to remain silent, to the presumption of innocence, and to subpoena witnesses and compel their testimony.  The court then informed Tovar of the maximum and minimum penalties for an OWI conviction, and explained that, before accepting a guilty plea, the court had to assure itself that Tovar was in fact guilty of the charged offense.  To that end, the court informed Tovar of the two elements of the OWI charge:The defendant must have (1)operated a motor vehicle in Iowa (2)while intoxicated.  Tovar confirmed, first, that on the date in question, he was operating a motor vehicle in Iowa and, second, that he did not dispute the result of the intoxilyzer test showing his blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit nearly twice over.  The court then accepted his guilty plea and, at a hearing the next month, imposed the minimum sentence of two days in jail and a fine.  In 1998, Tovar was again charged with OWI, this time as a second offense, an aggravated misdemeanor under Iowa law.  Represented by counsel in that proceeding, he pleaded guilty.  In 2000, Tovar was charged with third-offense OWI, a class D felony under Iowa law.  Again represented by counsel, Tovar pleaded not guilty to the felony charge.  Counsel moved to preclude use of Tovars first (1996) OWI conviction to enhance his 2000 offense from an aggravated misdemeanor to a third-offense felony.  Tovar maintained that his 1996 waiver of counsel was invalidnot fully knowing, intelligent, and voluntarybecause he was never made aware by the court of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.  The trial court denied the motion, found Tovar guilty, and sentenced him on the OWI third-offense charge.  The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court of Iowa reversed and remanded for entry of judgment without consideration of Tovars first OWI conviction.  Holding that the colloquy preceding acceptance of Tovars 1996 guilty plea had been constitutionally inadequate, Iowas high court ruled, as here at issue, that two warnings not given to Tovar are essential to the knowing and intelligent waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the plea stage: The defendant must be advised specifically that waiving counsels assistance in deciding whether to plead guilty (1) entails the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked and (2) deprives him of the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty.
Held:Neither warning ordered by the Iowa Supreme Court is mandated by the Sixth Amendment.  The constitutional requirement is satisfied when the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the charges against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant upon the entry of a guilty plea.  Pp.815.
(a)The Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant facing incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process, see, e.g., Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 170, including a plea hearing, White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59, 60 (per curiam).  Because Tovar received a two-day prison term for his first OWI conviction, he had a right to counsel both at the plea stage and at trial had he elected to contest the charge.  Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 34, 37.  Although an accused may choose to forgo representation, any waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, see Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464.  The information a defendant must possess in order to make an intelligent election depends on a range of case-specific factors, including his education or sophistication, the complex or easily grasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding.  See Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464.  Although warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial uncounseled must be rigorous[ly] conveyed, Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, 298; see Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 835, a less searching or formal colloquy may suffice at earlier stages of the criminal process, 487 U. S., at 299.  In Patterson, this Court described a pragmatic approach to right-to-counsel waivers, one that asks what purposes a lawyer can serve at the particular stage of the proceedings in question, and what assistance [counsel] could provide to an accused at that stage.  Id., at 298.  Less rigorous warnings are required pretrial because, at that stage, the full dangers and disadvantages of self-representation  are less substantial and more obvious to an accused than they are at trial.  Id., at 299.  Pp.811.


(b)The Sixth Amendment does not compel the two admonitions ordered by the Iowa Supreme Court.  [T]he law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in general in the circumstances .  United States v. Ruiz, 536 U. S. 622, 629.  Even if the defendant lacked a full and complete appreciation of all of the consequences flowing from his waiver, the State may nevertheless prevail if it shows that the information provided to the defendant satisfied the constitutional minimum.  Patterson, 487 U. S., at 294.  The Iowa high court gave insufficient consideration to this Courts guiding decisions.  In prescribing scripted admonitions and holding them necessary in every guilty plea instance, that court overlooked this Courts observations that the information a defendant must have to waive counsel intelligently will depend upon the particular facts and circumstances in each case, Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464.  Moreover, as Tovar acknowledges, in a collateral attack on an uncounseled conviction, it is the defendants burden to prove that he did not competently and intelligently waive his right to counsel.  Tovar has never claimed that he did not fully understand the 1996 OWI charge or the range of punishment for that crime prior to pleading guilty.  He has never articulate[d] with precision the additional information counsel could have provided, given the simplicity of the charge.  See Patterson, 487 U. S., at 294.  Nor does he assert that he was unaware of his right to be counseled prior to and at his arraignment.  Before this Court, he suggests only that he may have been under the mistaken belief that he had a right to counsel at trial, but not if he was, instead, going to plead guilty.  Given the particular facts and circumstances surrounding [this] case, Johnson, 304 U. S., at 464, it is far from clear that warnings of the kind required by the Iowa Supreme Court would have enlightened Tovars decision whether to seek counsel or to represent himself.  In a case so straightforward, the two admonitions at issue might confuse or mislead a defendant more than they would inform him, i.e., the warnings might be misconstrued to convey that a meritorious defense exists or that the defendant could plead to a lesser charge, when neither prospect is a realistic one.  If a defendant delays his plea in the vain hope that counsel could uncover a tenable basis for contesting or reducing the criminal charge, the prompt disposition of the case will be impeded, and the resources of either the State (if the defendant is indigent) or the defendant himself (if he is financially ineligible for appointed counsel) will be wasted.  States are free to adopt by statute, rule, or decision any guides to the acceptance of an uncounseled plea they deem useful, but the Federal Constitution does not require the two admonitions here in controversy.  Pp.1115.
656 N.W. 2d 112, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

|541 u.s. 1|"RAYMOND B. YATES, M. D., P.C. PROFIT SHARING PLAN et al. v. HENDON, TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 02458. Argued January 13, 2004Decided March 2, 2004
Enacted to protect  the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, 29 U. S.C. 1001(b), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) comprises four titles.  Relevant here, Title I, 29 U. S. C. 1001 et seq., mandates minimum participation, vesting, and funding schedules for covered pension plans, and establishes fiduciary conduct standards for plan administrators.  Title II, codified in 26 U. S. C., amended various Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions pertaining to qualification of pension plans for special tax treatment, in order, inter alia, to conform to Title Is standards.  Title III, 29 U. S. C. 1201 et seq., contains provisions designed to coordinate enforcement efforts of different federal departments.  Title IV, 29 U. S.C. 1301 et seq., created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and an insurance program to protect employees against the loss of nonforfeitable benefits upon termination of pension plans lacking sufficient funds to pay benefits in full.  This case concerns Title Is definition and coverage provisions, though those provisions, indicating who may participate in an ERISA-sheltered plan, inform each of ERISAs four titles.  Title I defines employee benefit plan as an employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or  both, 1002(3); participant to encompass any employee  eligible to receive a benefit  from an employee benefit plan, 1002(7); employee as any individual employed by an employer, 1002(6); and employer to include any person acting  as an employer, or  in the interest of an employer, 1002(5).


Yates was sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation that maintained a profit sharing plan (Plan).  From the Plans inception, at least one person other than Yates or his wife was a Plan participant.  The Plan qualified for favorable tax treatment under IRC 401.  As required by the IRC, 26 U. S.C. 401(a)(13), and ERISA, 29 U. S. C. 1056(d), the Plan contained an anti-alienation provision.  Entitled Spendthrift Clause, the provision stated, in relevant part:Except for  loans to Participants as [expressly provided for in the Plan], no benefit or interest available hereunder will be subject to assignment or alienation.  In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 from another of his corporations pension plans (which later merged into the Plan), but failed to make any of the required monthly payments.  In November 1996, however, Yates paid off the loan in full with the proceeds of the sale of his house.  Three weeks later, Yatess creditors filed an involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Respondent Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint against petitioners (the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee), asking the Bankruptcy Court to avoid the loan repayment.  Granting Hendon summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court first determined that the repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U. S.C. 547(b).  That finding was not challenged on appeal.  The Bankruptcy Court then held that the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee, could not rely on the Plans anti-alienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the loan repayment for the bankruptcy estate.  That holding was dictated by Sixth Circuit precedent, under which a self-employed owner of a pension plans corporate sponsor could not participate as an employee under ERISA and therefore could not use ERISAs provisions to enforce the restriction on transfer of his beneficial interest in the plan.  The District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  The Sixth Circuits determination that Yates was not a participant in the Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether, had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustees reach.
Held:The working owner of a business (here, the sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation) may qualify as a participant in a pension plan covered by ERISA.  If the plan covers one or more employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants.  Such a working owner, in common with other employees, qualifies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies.  Pp.820.
(a)Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants.  Because ERISAs definitions of employee and, in turn, participant are uninformative, the Court looks to other ERISA provisions for instruction.  See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323.  ERISAs multiple textual indications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants provide, in combination, specific guidance, ibid., so there is no cause in this case to resort to common law.  ERISAs enactment in 1974 did not change the existing backdrop of IRC provisions permitting corporate shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.  Rather, Congress objective was to harmonize ERISA with these longstanding tax provisions.  Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit plans.  Most notably, Title I frees certain plans in which working owners likely participate from all of ERISAs fiduciary responsibility requirements.  See 29 U. S.C. 1101(a) and 26 U. S.C. 414(q)(1)(A) and 416(i)(1)(B)(i).  Title I also contains more limited exemptions from ERISAs fiduciary responsibility requirements for plans that ordinarily include working owners as participants.  See 29 U. S.C. 1103(a) and (b)(3)(A) and 26 U. S.C. 401(c)(1) and (2)(A)(i), 1402(a) and (c).  Further, Title I contains exemptions from ERISAs prohibited transaction exemptions, which, like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, indicate that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans.  See 29 U. S. C. 1108(b)(1)(B) and (d)(1) and 26 U. S.C. 401(c)(3).  Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place.  Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative.  For example, Title IV does not apply to plans established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners, 1321(b)(9) (emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or greater ownership interest, 1322(b)(5)(A).  But Title IV does cover plans in which substantial owners participate along with other employees.  See 1322(b)(5)(B).  Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower courts:Under ERISA, a working owner may wear two hats, i.e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at the same time, the employer who established the plan.  See 1301(b)(1) and 26 U. S. C. 401(c)(4).  Congress aim to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans is advanced by the Courts reading of ERISAs text.  The working employers opportunity personally to participate and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to the creation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowner employees alike.  Treating the working owner as a participant in an ERISA-sheltered plan also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes: federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner.  Excepting working owners from ERISAs coverage is hardly consistent with the statutory goal of uniform national treatment of pension benefits, Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753, 765, and would generate administrative difficulties.  A 1999 Department of Labor advisory opinion (hereinafter Advisory Opinion 9904A) accords with the Courts comprehension of Title Is definition and coverage provisions.  Concluding that working owners may qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the Departments opinion reflects a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.  Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140.  Pp.814.


(b)This Court rejects the lower courts position that a working owner may rank only as an employer and not also as an employee for purposes of ERISA-sheltered plan participation.  The Sixth Circuits leading decision in point relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a portion of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR 2510.33, which states:[T]he term employee benefit plan [as used in Title I] shall not include any plan  under which no employees are participants; [f]or purposes of this section, an individual and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to a  business they own.  (Emphasis added.)  In common with other Courts of Appeals that have held working owners do not qualify as participants in ERISA-governed plans, the Sixth Circuit apparently understood the regulation to provide a generally applicable definition of employee, controlling for all Title I purposes.  The Labor Departments Advisory Opinion 9904A, however, interprets the regulation to mean that the statutory term employee benefit plan does not include a plan whose only participants are the owner and his or her spouse, but does include a plan that covers as participants one or more common-law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals.  This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth Circuit, merits the Judiciarys respectful consideration.  Cf. Clackamas Gastroenterology Assoc., P.C., 538 U. S., at ___.  Moreover, the Departments regulation itself reveals the definitional prescriptions limited scope.  The prescription describes employees only [f]or purposes of this section, i.e., the section defining employee benefit plans.  Accordingly, the regulation addresses only what plans qualify as employee benefit plans under ERISAs Title I.  Plans that cover only sole owners or partners and their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside Title Is domain, while plans that cover working owners and their nonowner employees fall entirely within ERISAs compass.  The Sixth Circuits leading decision also mistakenly relied on ERISAs anti-inurement provision, 29 U. S. C. 1103(c)(1), which states that plan assets shall not inure to the benefit of employers.  Correctly read, that provision does not preclude Title I coverage of working owners as plan participants.  It demands only that plan assets be held to supply benefits to plan participants.  Its purpose is to apply the law of trusts to discourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent investment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers and others.  Those concerns are not implicated by paying benefits to working owners who participate on an equal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protected plans.  This Court expresses no opinion as to whether Yates himself, in his handling of loan repayments, engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurement provision, an issue not yet reached by the courts below.  Pp.1420.


(c)Given the undisputed fact that Yates failed to honor his loans periodic repayment requirements, these questions should be addressed on remand:(1)Did the November 1996 close-to-bankruptcy repayments, despite the prior defaults, become a portion of Yatess interest in the Plan that is excluded from his bankruptcy estate and (2) if so, were the repayments beyond the reach of the Bankruptcy Trustees power to avoid and recover preferential transfers?

			"|"RAYMOND B. YATES, M. D., P.C. PROFIT SHARING PLAN et al. v. HENDON, TRUSTEE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 02458. Argued January 13, 2004Decided March 2, 2004
Enacted to protect  the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, 29 U. S.C. 1001(b), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) comprises four titles.  Relevant here, Title I, 29 U. S. C. 1001 et seq., mandates minimum participation, vesting, and funding schedules for covered pension plans, and establishes fiduciary conduct standards for plan administrators.  Title II, codified in 26 U. S. C., amended various Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions pertaining to qualification of pension plans for special tax treatment, in order, inter alia, to conform to Title Is standards.  Title III, 29 U. S. C. 1201 et seq., contains provisions designed to coordinate enforcement efforts of different federal departments.  Title IV, 29 U. S.C. 1301 et seq., created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and an insurance program to protect employees against the loss of nonforfeitable benefits upon termination of pension plans lacking sufficient funds to pay benefits in full.  This case concerns Title Is definition and coverage provisions, though those provisions, indicating who may participate in an ERISA-sheltered plan, inform each of ERISAs four titles.  Title I defines employee benefit plan as an employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or  both, 1002(3); participant to encompass any employee  eligible to receive a benefit  from an employee benefit plan, 1002(7); employee as any individual employed by an employer, 1002(6); and employer to include any person acting  as an employer, or  in the interest of an employer, 1002(5).


Yates was sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation that maintained a profit sharing plan (Plan).  From the Plans inception, at least one person other than Yates or his wife was a Plan participant.  The Plan qualified for favorable tax treatment under IRC 401.  As required by the IRC, 26 U. S.C. 401(a)(13), and ERISA, 29 U. S. C. 1056(d), the Plan contained an anti-alienation provision.  Entitled Spendthrift Clause, the provision stated, in relevant part:Except for  loans to Participants as [expressly provided for in the Plan], no benefit or interest available hereunder will be subject to assignment or alienation.  In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 from another of his corporations pension plans (which later merged into the Plan), but failed to make any of the required monthly payments.  In November 1996, however, Yates paid off the loan in full with the proceeds of the sale of his house.  Three weeks later, Yatess creditors filed an involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Respondent Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint against petitioners (the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee), asking the Bankruptcy Court to avoid the loan repayment.  Granting Hendon summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court first determined that the repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U. S.C. 547(b).  That finding was not challenged on appeal.  The Bankruptcy Court then held that the Plan and Yates, as Plan trustee, could not rely on the Plans anti-alienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the loan repayment for the bankruptcy estate.  That holding was dictated by Sixth Circuit precedent, under which a self-employed owner of a pension plans corporate sponsor could not participate as an employee under ERISA and therefore could not use ERISAs provisions to enforce the restriction on transfer of his beneficial interest in the plan.  The District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  The Sixth Circuits determination that Yates was not a participant in the Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether, had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustees reach.
Held:The working owner of a business (here, the sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation) may qualify as a participant in a pension plan covered by ERISA.  If the plan covers one or more employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants.  Such a working owner, in common with other employees, qualifies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies.  Pp.820.
(a)Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants.  Because ERISAs definitions of employee and, in turn, participant are uninformative, the Court looks to other ERISA provisions for instruction.  See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323.  ERISAs multiple textual indications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants provide, in combination, specific guidance, ibid., so there is no cause in this case to resort to common law.  ERISAs enactment in 1974 did not change the existing backdrop of IRC provisions permitting corporate shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.  Rather, Congress objective was to harmonize ERISA with these longstanding tax provisions.  Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit plans.  Most notably, Title I frees certain plans in which working owners likely participate from all of ERISAs fiduciary responsibility requirements.  See 29 U. S.C. 1101(a) and 26 U. S.C. 414(q)(1)(A) and 416(i)(1)(B)(i).  Title I also contains more limited exemptions from ERISAs fiduciary responsibility requirements for plans that ordinarily include working owners as participants.  See 29 U. S.C. 1103(a) and (b)(3)(A) and 26 U. S.C. 401(c)(1) and (2)(A)(i), 1402(a) and (c).  Further, Title I contains exemptions from ERISAs prohibited transaction exemptions, which, like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, indicate that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans.  See 29 U. S. C. 1108(b)(1)(B) and (d)(1) and 26 U. S.C. 401(c)(3).  Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place.  Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative.  For example, Title IV does not apply to plans established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners, 1321(b)(9) (emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or greater ownership interest, 1322(b)(5)(A).  But Title IV does cover plans in which substantial owners participate along with other employees.  See 1322(b)(5)(B).  Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower courts:Under ERISA, a working owner may wear two hats, i.e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at the same time, the employer who established the plan.  See 1301(b)(1) and 26 U. S. C. 401(c)(4).  Congress aim to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans is advanced by the Courts reading of ERISAs text.

Treating the working owner as a participant in an ERISA-sheltered plan also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes: federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner.

|541 u.s. 27|"BALDWIN v. REESE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02964. Argued December 8, 2003Decided March 2, 2004
Before seeking federal habeas relief, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies, 28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(1), giving the State the opportunity to  correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights, Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364, 365, which means he must fairly present his claim in each appropriate state court to alert that court to the claims federal nature.  After respondent Reese appealed his state convictions and sentences and the lower state courts denied him collateral relief, the Oregon Supreme Court denied him discretionary review.  His subsequent federal habeas petition raised, inter alia, a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim.  The Federal District Court held that Reese had not fairly presented this claim to the state courts because his state appeals court brief had not indicated that he was complaining about a federal law violation.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding the fair presentation requirement satisfied because the State Supreme Court justices had had the opportunity to read the lower court decision before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.  And, had they read that opinion, they would have, or should have, realized that his claim rested upon federal law.
Held:A state prisoner ordinarily does not fairly present a federal claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, a brief, or similar papers to find material that will alert it to the presence of such a claim.  Pp.36.
(a)Assuming that Reeses petition by itself did not properly alert the State Supreme Court to the federal nature of his claim, Reese failed to meet the fair presentation standard.  To say that a petitioner fairly presents a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading the lower court opinions is to say that those judges must read those opinionsfor otherwise they would forfeit the States opportunity to decide the claim in the first instance.  Federal habeas law does not impose such a requirement.  That requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices, since they do not necessarily read lower court opinions in every case.  And it would impose a serious burden upon those judges with discretionary review powers, whose heavy workloads would be significantly increased if they had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.  Finally, the requirement is unnecessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek federal habeas.  A litigant can easily indicate his claims federal law basis in a petition or brief, for example, by citing to the federal source of law on which he relies or simply labeling the claim federal.  Pp.35.


(b)This Court is not wrong to assume that Reeses petition by itself failed to alert the State Supreme Court to his claims federal nature.  He must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel refers to a federal claim, cite any case that might have alerted the court to his claims alleged federal nature, or even contain a factual description supporting his claim.  Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless fairly presents a federal ineffective assistance claim because (1) ineffective is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal law claims, and (2) the state law standards for adjudicating state and federal inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance claims are identical.  This Court rejects his first argument because he has not demonstrated that state law uses ineffective assistance as referring only to a federal law, rather than a similar state law, claim.  However, Reeses second argument was not addressed by, or presented to, the Ninth Circuit, and first appeared here in Reeses merits brief.  Because the issue is complex and lower court consideration would help in its resolution, the Court, without expressing any view on the issues merits, exercises its Rule 15.2 discretion and deems the argument waived.

||"LOCKE, GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON, et al. v. DAVEY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021315. Argued December 2, 2003Decided February 25, 2004
Washington State established its Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use such a scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  Respondent Davey was awarded a Promise Scholarship and chose to attend Northwest College, a private, church-affiliated institution that is eligible under the program.  When he enrolled, Davey chose a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  It is undisputed that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional.  After learning that he could not use his scholarship to pursue that degree, Davey brought this action under 42 U. S. C. 1983 for an injunction and damages, arguing that the denial of his scholarship violated, inter alia, the First Amendments Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses.  The District Court rejected Daveys constitutional claims and granted the State summary judgment.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that, because the State had singled out religion for unfavorable treatment, its exclusion of theology majors had to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest under Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520.  Finding that the States antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared the program unconstitutional.
Held:Washingtons exclusion of the pursuit of a devotional theology degree from its otherwise-inclusive scholarship aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  This case involves the play in the joints between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.  Walz v. Tax Commn of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 669.  That is, it concerns state action that is permitted by the former but not required by the latter.  The Court rejects Daveys contention that, under Lukumi, supra, the program is presumptively unconstitutional because it is not facially neutral with respect to religion.  To accept this claim would extend the Lukumi line of cases well beyond not only their facts but their reasoning.  Here, the States disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind than in Lukumi, where the ordinance criminalized the ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  Washingtons program imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It neither denies to ministers the right to participate in community political affairs, see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618, nor requires students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit, see, e.g., Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Commn of Fla., 480 U. S. 136.  The State has merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.  Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than does the Federal Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, there are few areas in which a States antiestablishment interests come more into play.  Since this countrys founding, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an established religion.  Most States that sought to avoid such an establishment around the time of the founding placed in their constitutions formal prohibitions against using tax funds to support the ministry.  That early state constitutions saw no problem in explicitly excluding only the ministry from receiving state dollars reinforces the conclusion that religious instruction is of a different ilk from other professions.  Moreover, the entirety of the Promise Scholarship Program goes a long way toward including religion in its benefits, since it permits students to attend pervasively religious schools so long as they are accredited, and students are still eligible to take devotional theology courses under the programs current guidelines.  Nothing in the Washington Constitutions history or text or in the programs operation suggests animus towards religion.  Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, it cannot be concluded that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect.  Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Daveys claim must fail.  The States interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial, and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars.  If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here.  Pp.412.

Held:Washingtons exclusion of the pursuit of a devotional theology degree from its otherwise-inclusive scholarship aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  This case involves the play in the joints between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.  Walz v. Tax Commn of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 669.  That is, it concerns state action that is permitted by the former but not required by the latter.  The Court rejects Daveys contention that, under Lukumi, supra, the program is presumptively unconstitutional because it is not facially neutral with respect to religion.  To accept this claim would extend the Lukumi line of cases well beyond not only their facts but their reasoning.  Here, the States disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind than in Lukumi, where the ordinance criminalized the ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion.  Washingtons program imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It neither denies to ministers the right to participate in community political affairs, see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618, nor requires students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit, see, e.g., Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Commn of Fla., 480 U. S. 136.  The State has merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.  Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than does the Federal Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, there are few areas in which a States antiestablishment interests come more into play.  Since this countrys founding, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an established religion.  Most States that sought to avoid such an establishment around the time of the founding placed in their constitutions formal prohibitions against using tax funds to support the ministry.  That early state constitutions saw no problem in explicitly excluding only the ministry from receiving state dollars reinforces the conclusion that religious instruction is of a different ilk from other professions.  Moreover, the entirety of the Promise Scholarship Program goes a long way toward including religion in its benefits, since it permits students to attend pervasively religious schools so long as they are accredited, and students are still eligible to take devotional theology courses under the programs current guidelines.  Nothing in the Washington Constitutions history or text or in the programs operation suggests animus towards religion.  Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, it cannot be concluded that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect.  Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Daveys claim must fail.  The States interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial, and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars.  If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here.  Pp.412.

No. 021290. Argued December 1, 2003Decided February 25, 2004
After their contract to make mail sacks for the United States Postal Service was terminated, respondents brought this suit alleging, inter alia, that the Postal Service had sought to suppress competition and create a monopoly in mail sack production. The District Court dismissed the antitrust claims, concluding that the Postal Service is not subject to liability under federal antitrust law.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Postal Service can be liable but that it has a limited immunity from antitrust liability for conduct undertaken at Congress command.
Held:The Postal Service is not subject to antitrust liability.  In both form and function, it is not a separate antitrust person from the United States but is part of the Government, and so is not controlled by the antitrust laws.  Pp.211.
(a)The waiver of immunity from suit provided by the Postal Reorganization Act (PRA)which gives the Postal Service the power to sue and be sued in its official name, 39 U. S.C. 401does not suffice by its own terms to subject the Postal Service to liability under the Sherman Act.  The two-step analysis of FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484, applies here.  Meyers first step is met because the PRAs sue-and-be-sued clause effects a waiver of sovereign immunity for actions against the Postal Service.  However, Meyers second step for finding liabilitywhether the Sherman Acts substantive prohibitions apply to the Postal Serviceis not satisfied.  The Sherman Act imposes liability on any person, defined to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of  the United States.  15 U. S.C. 7.  In holding that the United States is not a person authorized to bring a treble-damages claim for its own alleged antitrust injury under the Sherman Act, United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600, 606607, this Court observed that, if the definition of person included the United States, the Government would be exposed to liability as an antitrust defendant, a result Congress could not have intended, id., at 607, 609.  Although the antitrust statutes were later amended to allow the United States to bring antitrust suits, see 15 U. S.C. 15a, Congress did not thereby change the statutory definition of person.  So, Coopers conclusion that the United States is not an antitrust person, in particular not a person who can be an antitrust defendant, was unaltered by Congress action; indeed, the means Congress used to amend the antitrust law implicitly ratified Coopers conclusion that the United States is not a proper antitrust defendant.  Pp.28.


(b)For purposes of the antitrust laws, the Postal Service is not a separate person from the United States.  The PRAs designation of the Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States, 39 U. S.C. 201, is not consistent with the idea that the Postal Service is an entity existing outside the Government.  Indeed, the designation indicates just the contrary.  The PRA gives the Postal Service a high degree of independence from other Government offices, but it  remains part of the Government.  The Sherman Act defines person to include corporations, 15 U. S.C. 7, and had Congress chosen to create the Postal Service as a federal corporation, the Court would have to ask whether the Sherman Acts definition extends to the federal entity under this part of the definitional text.  Congress, however, declined to create the Postal Service as a Government corporation, opting instead for an independent establishment.  The choice of words likely was more  informed than unconsidered, because Congress debated proposals to make the Postal Service a Government corporation before it enacted the PRA.  Although the PRA refers explicitly to various federal statutes and specifies that the Postal Service is exempt from some and subject to others, 39 U. S.C. 409410, it makes no mention of the Sherman Act or the antitrust laws.  This silence leads to no helpful inference one way or the other on the question at issue.  However, the other considerations the Court has discussed lead to the conclusion that, absent an express congressional statement that the Postal Service can be sued for antitrust violations despite its status as an independent establishment of the Government, the PRA does not subject the Postal Service to antitrust liability.  This conclusion is consistent with the nationwide, public responsibilities of the Postal Service, which has different goals from private corporations, the most important being that it does not seek profits, 3621.  It also has broader obligations, including the provision of universal mail delivery and free mail delivery to certain classes of persons, 32013405, and, most recently, increased public responsibilities related to national security.  Finally, the Postal Service has many powers more characteristic of Government than of private enterprise, including its state-conferred monopoly on mail delivery, 601 et seq., and the powers of eminent domain and to conclude international postal agreements, 401, 407.  On the other hand, but in ways still relevant to the antitrust laws nonapplicability, the Postal Services powers are more limited than those of private businesses, since it lacks the power unilaterally to set prices or to close a post office, 404.  Its public characteristics and responsibilities indicate it should be treated under the antitrust laws as part of the Government, not a market participant separate from it.  The fact that the Postal Service operates some nonpostal lines of business beyond the scope of its mail monopoly and universal service obligation does not alter this conclusion.  Pp.811.

|540 u.s. 749|"SHAKUR MUHAMMAD, aka JOHN E. MEASE,
PETITIONER v. MARK CLOSE
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
[February 25, 2004]
Per Curiam.
I

Federal law opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment: a petition for habeas corpus, 28 U. S.C. 2254, and a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. 1979, as amended, 42 U. S.C. 1983.  Challenges to the validity of any confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the province of habeas corpus, Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973); requests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented in a 1983 action.  Some cases are hybrids, with a prisoner seeking relief unavailable in habeas, notably damages, but on allegations that not only support a claim for recompense, but imply the invalidity either of an underlying conviction or of a particular ground for denying release short of serving the maximum term of confinement.  In Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), we held that where success in a prisoners 1983 damages action would implicitly question the validity of conviction or duration of sentence, the litigant must first achieve favorable termination of his available state, or federal habeas, opportunities to challenge the underlying conviction or sentence.  Accordingly, in Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641 (1997), we applied Heck in the circumstances of a 1983 action claiming damages and equitable relief for a procedural defect in a prisons administrative process, where the administrative action taken against the plaintiff could affect credits toward release based on good-time served.  In each instance, conditioning the right to bring a 1983 action on a favorable result in state litigation or federal habeas served the practical objective of preserving limitations on the availability of habeas remedies.  Federal petitions for habeas corpus may be granted only after other avenues of relief have been exhausted.  28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(1)(A).  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982). Prisoners suing under 1983, in contrast, generally face a substantially lower gate, even with the requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that administrative opportunities be exhausted first.  42 U. S.C. 1997e(a).
Hecks requirement to resort to state litigation and federal habeas before 1983 is not, however, implicated by a prisoners challenge that threatens no consequence for his conviction or the duration of his sentence.[Footnote 1]  There is no need to preserve the habeas exhaustion rule and no impediment under Heck in such a case, of which this is an example.[Footnote 2] 
II
A

This suit grew out of a confrontation between petitioner, Muhammad, an inmate, and the respondent Michigan prison official, Close.  App. 70.  According to his amended complaint, Muhammad was eating breakfast when he saw Close staring at him through the hallway window.  Id., at 71.  Eventually Muhammad stared back, provoking Close to assume a fighting stance and com[e] into the dining area at a fast pace with his face contorted.  Ibid.  Muhammad stood up and faced him, and when the two were within a foot of one another, Close asked, whats [sic] up, all the while staring angerly [sic].  In the aftermath of the confrontation, Muhammad was handcuffed, taken to a detention cell, and charged with violating the prison rule prohibiting Threatening Behavior.[Footnote 3]  Under the rules, special detention was required prior to a hearing on the charge, which occurred six days later.  Muhammad was acquitted of threatening behavior, but found guilty of the lesser infraction of insolence, for which prehearing detention would not have been mandatory.[Footnote 4]  Ibid.  Muhammad was required to serve an additional 7 days of detention and deprived of privileges for 30 days as penalties for insolence.  Ibid.
Muhammad then brought this 1983 action, alleging that Close had charged him with threatening behavior (and subjected him to mandatory prehearing lockup) in retaliation for prior lawsuits and grievance proceedings against Close.  Id., at 72.  He amended his original complaint after obtaining counsel, and neither in his amended complaint nor at any subsequent juncture did Muhammad challenge his conviction for insolence, or the subsequent disciplinary action.  See Brief for Petitioner 42.  The amended complaint sought no expungement of the misconduct finding, and in fact Muhammad conceded that the insolence determination was justified.  The only relief sought was $10,000 in compensatory and punitive damages for the physical, mental, and emotional injuries sustained during the six days of prehearing detention mandated by the charge of threatening behavior attributable to Closes retaliatory motive.  App. 72.


Following discovery, the Magistrate Judge recommended summary judgment for Close on the ground that Muhammad had failed to come forward with sufficient evidence of retaliation to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to that element.  Id., at 63.  The District Court adopted the recommendation.  Id., at 70.
B

Muhammad then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which, by an opinion designated not for publication, affirmed the summary judgment for Close, though not on the basis recommended by the Magistrate Judge and adopted by the District Court.  47 Fed. Appx. 738 (2002).  Instead of considering the conclusion that Muhammad had produced inadequate evidence of retaliation, a ground that would have been dispositive if sustained, the Court of Appeals held the action barred by Heck because Muhammad had sought, among other relief, the expungement of the misconduct charge from the prison record.  Relying upon Circuit precedent, see Huey v. Stine, 230 F.3d 226 (2000), the Court of Appeals held that an action under 1983 to expunge his misconduct charge and for other relief occasioned by the misconduct proceedings could be brought only after satisfying Hecks favorable termination requirement.  The Circuit thus maintained a split on the applicability of Heck to prison disciplinary proceedings in the absence of any implication going to the fact or duration of underlying sentence, four Circuits having taken the contrary view.  See Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 542544 (CA3 2002); DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607, 613 (CA7 2000); Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 27 (CA2 1999); Brown v. Plaut, 131 F.3d 163, 167169 (CADC 1997).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 539 U. S. 925 (2003), and now reverse.
III

The decision of the Court of Appeals was flawed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.  Its factual error was the assumption that Muhammad sought to expunge the misconduct charge from his prison record.  The court simply overlooked the amended complaint that sought no such relief.
The factual error was compounded by following the mistaken view expressed in Circuit precedent that Heck applies categorically to all suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings.  But these administrative determinations do not as such raise any implication about the validity of the underlying conviction, and although they may affect the duration of time to be served (by bearing on the award or revocation of good-time credits) that is not necessarily so.  The effect of disciplinary proceedings on good-time credits is a matter of state law or regulation, and in this case, the Magistrate expressly found or assumed that no good-time credits were eliminated by the prehearing action Muhammad called in question.  His 1983 suit challenging this action could not therefore be construed as seeking a judgment at odds with his conviction or with the States calculation of time to be served in accordance with the underlying sentence.  That is, he raised no claim on which habeas relief could have been granted on any recognized theory, with the consequence that Hecks favorable termination requirement was inapplicable.
IV

Close tries to salvage the appellate courts judgment by arguing for the first time here that Heck is squarely on point because, if the 1983 suit succeeded, Muhammad would be entitled to restoration of some good-time credits with the result of less time to be spent in prison.  Brief for Respondent 1718.  But this eleventh-hour contention was waived.  The Magistrates report stated that good-time credits were not affected by the allegedly retaliatory overcharge of threatening behavior and the consequential prehearing detention Muhammad complained of, and Close had every opportunity to challenge the Magistrates position in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals.  Having failed to raise the claim when its legal and factual premises could have been litigated, Close cannot raise it now.  See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 464 (1997).  
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for consideration of summary judgment on the ground adopted by the District Court, and for any further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
The assumption is that the incarceration that matters under Heck is the incarceration ordered by the original judgment of conviction, not special disciplinary confinement for infraction of prison rules.  This Court has never followed the speculation in Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 499 (1973), that such a prisoner subject to additional and unconstitutional restraint might have a habeas claim independent of 1983, and the contention is not raised by the State here.
Members of the Court have expressed the view that unavailability of habeas for other reasons may also dispense with the Heck requirement.  See 512 U. S., at 491 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 2122 (1998) (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  This case is no occasion to settle the issue.
The Michigan Department of Corrections Policy Directive, No.03.03.105 (June 6, 1994) (Directive) defines Threatening Behavior as Words, actions or other behavior which expresses a[n] intent to injure or physically abuse another person.  App. 40.
The Directive defines Insolence as Words, actions, or other behavior which is intended to harass, or cause alarm in an employee.  Id., at 44.

|540 u.s. 551|"GROH v. RAMIREZ et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 02811. Argued November 4, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
Petitioner, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent, prepared and signed an application for a warrant to search respondents Montana ranch, which stated that the search was for specified weapons, explosives, and records.  The application was supported by petitioners detailed affidavit setting forth his basis for believing that such items were on the ranch and was accompanied by a warrant form that he completed.  The Magistrate Judge (Magistrate) signed the warrant form even though it did not identify any of the items that petitioner intended to seize.  The portion calling for a description of the person or property described respondents house, not the alleged weapons; the warrant did not incorporate by reference the applications itemized list.  Petitioner led federal and local law enforcement officers to the ranch the next day but found no illegal weapons or explosives.  Petitioner left a copy of the warrant, but not the application, with respondents.  Respondents sued petitioner and others under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, and 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming, inter alia, a Fourth Amendment violation.  The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, finding no Fourth Amendment violation, and finding that even if such a violation occurred, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed except as to the Fourth Amendment claim against petitioner, holding that the warrant was invalid because it did not describe with particularity the place to be searched and the items to be seized.  The court also concluded that United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, precluded qualified immunity for petitioner because he was the leader of a search who did not read the warrant and satisfy himself that he understood its scope and limitations and that it was not obviously defective.
Held:
1.The search was clearly unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Pp. 511.


(a)The warrant was plainly invalid.  It did not meet the Fourth Amendments unambiguous requirement that a warrant particularly describ[e]  the persons or things to be seized.  The fact that the application adequately described those things does not save the warrant; Fourth Amendment interests are not necessarily vindicated when another document says something about the objects of the search, but that documents contents are neither known to the person whose home is being searched nor available for her inspection.  It is not necessary to decide whether the Amendment permits a warrant to cross-reference other documents, because such incorporation did not occur here.  Pp.56.


(b)Petitioners argument that the search was nonetheless reasonable is rejected.  Because the warrant did not describe the items at all, it was so obviously deficient that the search must be regarded as warrantless, and thus presumptively unreasonable.  This presumptive rule applies to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.  Petitioner errs in arguing that such searches should be exempt from the presumption if they otherwise satisfy the particularity requirements goals.  Unless items in the affidavit are set forth in the warrant, there is no written assurance that the Magistrate actually found probable cause for a search as broad as the affiant requested.  The restraint petitioner showed in conducting the instant search was imposed by the agent himself, not a judicial officer.  Moreover, the particularity requirements purpose is not limited to preventing general searches; it also assures the individual whose property is searched and seized of the executing officers legal authority, his need to search, and the limits of his power to do so.  This case presents no occasion to reach petitioners argument that the particularity requirements goals were served when he orally described the items to respondents, because respondents dispute his account.  Pp.611.


2.Petitioner is not entitled to qualified immunity despite the constitutional violation because it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted, Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202.  Given that the particularity requirement is stated in the Constitutions text, no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that did not comply with that requirement was valid.  Moreover, because petitioner prepared the warrant, he may not argue that he reasonably relied on the Magistrates assurance that it contained an adequate description and was valid.  Nor could a reasonable officer claim to be unaware of the basic rule that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of a home is presumptively unconstitutional.  [A] warrant may be so facially deficient  that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  Leon, 468 U. S., at 923.  This is such a case.  Pp.1114.
298 F.3d 1022, affirmed.

It is not necessary to decide whether the Amendment permits a warrant to cross-reference other documents, because such incorporation did not occur here.  Pp.56.


(b)Petitioners argument that the search was nonetheless reasonable is rejected.  Because the warrant did not describe the items at all, it was so obviously deficient that the search must be regarded as warrantless, and thus presumptively unreasonable.  This presumptive rule applies to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.  Petitioner errs in arguing that such searches should be exempt from the presumption if they otherwise satisfy the particularity requirements goals.  Unless items in the affidavit are set forth in the warrant, there is no written assurance that the Magistrate actually found probable cause for a search as broad as the affiant requested.  The restraint petitioner showed in conducting the instant search was imposed by the agent himself, not a judicial officer.  Moreover, the particularity requirements purpose is not limited to preventing general searches; it also assures the individual whose property is searched and seized of the executing officers legal authority, his need to search, and the limits of his power to do so.  This case presents no occasion to reach petitioners argument that the particularity requirements goals were served when he orally described the items to respondents, because respondents dispute his account.  Pp.611.


2.Petitioner is not entitled to qualified immunity despite the constitutional violation because it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted, Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202.  Given that the particularity requirement is stated in the Constitutions text, no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that did not comply with that requirement was valid.  Moreover, because petitioner prepared the warrant, he may not argue that he reasonably relied on the Magistrates assurance that it contained an adequate description and was valid.  Nor could a reasonable officer claim to be unaware of the basic rule that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of a home is presumptively unconstitutional.  [A] warrant may be so facially deficient  that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.  Leon, 468 U. S., at 923.  This is such a case.  Pp.1114.

|540 u.s. 581|"GENERAL DYNAMICS LAND SYSTEMS, INC. v. CLINE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 021080. Argued November 12, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
A collective-bargaining agreement between petitioner company and a union eliminated the companys obligation to provide health benefits to subsequently retired employees, except as to then-current workers at least 50 years old.  Respondent employees (collectively, Cline)who were then at least 40 and thus protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), but under 50 and so without promise of the benefitsclaimed before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that the agreement violated the ADEA because it discriminate[d against them]  because of [their] age, 29 U. S.C. 623(a)(1).  The EEOC agreed, and invited the company and the union to settle informally with Cline.  When they failed, Cline brought this action under the ADEA and state law.  The District Court dismissed, calling the federal claim one of reverse age discrimination upon which no court had ever granted relief under the ADEA, and relying on a Seventh Circuit decision holding that the ADEA does not protect younger workers against older workers.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, reasoning that 623(a)(1)s prohibition of discrimination is so clear on its face that if Congress had meant to limit its coverage to protect only the older worker against the younger, it would have said so.  The court acknowledged that its ruling conflicted with earlier cases, but criticized those decisions for paying too much attention to the general language of Congresss ADEA findings.  The court also drew support from the EEOCs position in an interpretive regulation.  
Held:The ADEAs text, structure, purpose, history, and relationship to other federal statutes show that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one.  Pp.317.
1.The ADEAs prohibition covers discriminat[ion]  because of [an] individuals age that helps the younger by hurting the older.  In the abstract, that phrase is open to the broader construction that it also prohibits favor for the old over the young, since 623(a)(1)s reference to age carries no express modifier, and the word could be read to look two ways.  This more expansive possible understanding does not, however, square with the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination.  In fact Congresss interpretive clues speak almost unanimously to an understanding of discrimination as directed against workers who are older than the ones getting treated better.  The ADEAs prefatory finding and purpose provisions and their legislative history make a case to this effect that is beyond reasonable doubt.  Nor is it remarkable that the record is devoid of any evidence that younger workers were suffering at their elders expense, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one.  The ADEAs restriction of the protected class to those 40 and above confirms this interpretation.  If Congress had been worrying about protecting the younger against the older, it would not likely have ignored everyone under 40.  The federal case reports are as replete with decisions taking this position as they are nearly devoid of decisions like the one under review.  While none of this Courts cases directly addresses the question presented here, all of them show the Courts consistent understanding that the text, structure, and history point to the ADEA as a remedy for unfair preference based on relative youth, leaving complaints of the relatively young outside the statutory concern.  See, e.g., Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610.  The very strength of this consensus is enough to rule out any serious claim of ambiguity, and congressional silence after years of judicial interpretation supports adherence to that view.  Pp.311.


2.This Court rejects the three rejoinders proffered by Cline and amicus EEOC in favor of their view that the statutory age discrimination prohibition works both ways.  Pp.1118.


(a)The argument that, because other instances of age in the ADEA are not limited to old age, 623(a)(1)s discriminat[ion]  because of [an] individuals age phrase means treatment that would not have occurred if the individuals span of years had been either longer or shorter, rests on two mistakes.  First, it erroneously assumes that the word age has the same meaning wherever the ADEA uses it.  The presumption that identical words in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, see, e.g., Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433, is not rigid and readily yields where, as here, there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the Act with different intent, e.g., ibid.  Second, the argument for uniform usage ignores the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context since a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.  E.g., Jones v. United States, 527 U. S. 373, 389.  Social history emphatically reveals an understanding of age discrimination as aimed against the old, and the statutory reference to age discrimination in this idiomatic sense is confirmed by legislative history.  For the very reason that reference to context shows that age means old age when teamed with discrimination, 623(f)s provision of an affirmative defense when age is a bona fide occupational qualification readily shows that age as a qualification means comparative youth.  As context shows that age means one thing in 623(a)(1) and another in 623(f), so it also demonstrates that the presumption of uniformity cannot sensibly operate here.  Pp.1215.


(b)Clines and the EEOCs second argumentthat their view is supported by a colloquy on the Senate floor involving an ADEA sponsorhas more substance than the first, but is still not enough to unsettle this Courts holding.  Senator Yarboroughs view is the only item in all the ADEA hearings, reports, and debates that goes against the grain of the common understanding of age discrimination.  Even from a sponsor, a single outlying statement cannot stand against a tide of context and history, not to mention 30 years of judicial interpretation producing no apparent legislative qualms.  Pp.1517.


(c)Finally, the argument that the Court owes deference to the EEOCs contrary reading falls short because the EEOC is clearly wrong.  Even for an agency able to claim all the authority possible under Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, deference to its statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent, e.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 446.  Here, regular interpretive method leaves no serious question.  The word age takes on a definite meaning from being in the phrase discriminat[ion]  because of such individuals age, occurring as that phrase does in a statute structured and manifestly intended to protect the older from arbitrary favor for the younger.  Pp.1718.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 021377. Argued December 3, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
After petitioner Doe filed a black lung benefits claim with the Department of Labor, the agency used his Social Security number to identify his claim on official agency documents, including a multicaptioned hearing notice that was sent to a group of claimants, their employers, and lawyers.  Doe and other black lung claimants sued the Department, claiming that such disclosures violated the Privacy Act of 1974.  The Government stipulated to an order prohibiting future publication of Social Security numbers on multicaptioned hearing notices, and the parties moved for summary judgment.  The District Court entered judgment against all plaintiffs but Doe, finding that they had raised no issues of cognizable harm.  However, the court accepted Does uncontroverted testimony about his distress on learning of the improper disclosure, granted him summary judgment, and awarded him $1,000, the minimum statutory damages award under 5 U. S.C. 552a(g)(4).  The Fourth Circuit reversed on Does claim, holding that the $1,000 minimum is available only to plaintiffs who suffer actual damages, and that Doe had not raised a triable issue of fact about such damages, having submitted no corroboration for his emotional distress claim.
Held:Plaintiffs must prove some actual damages to qualify for the minimum statutory award.  Pp.313.
(a)The Privacy Act gives agencies detailed instructions for managing their records and provides various sorts of civil relief to persons aggrieved by the Governments failure to comply with the Acts requirements.  Does claim falls within a catchall category for someone who suffers an adverse effect from a failure not otherwise specified in the remedial section of the Act.  552a(g)(1)(D).  If a court determines in a subsection (g)(1)(D) suit that the agency acted in an intentional or willful manner, the Government is liable for actual damages sustained by the individual , but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than  $1,000.  552a(g)(4)(A).  Pp.34.


(b)A straightforward textual analysis supports the Governments position that the minimum guarantee goes only to victims who prove some actual damages.  By the time the statute guarantees the $1,000 minimum, it not only has confined eligibility to victims of adverse effects caused by intentional or willful actions, but has provided expressly for liability to such victims for actual damages sustained.  When the next clause of the sentence containing such an explicit provision guarantees $1,000 to the person entitled to recovery, the obvious referent is the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages, the Acts sole provision for recovering anything.  Does theory that the minimum requires nothing more than proof of a statutory violation is immediately questionable in ignoring the actual damages language so directly at hand and instead looking for a person entitled to recovery in a separate part of the statute devoid of any mention of recovery or of what might be recovered.  Doe ignores statutory language by reading the statute to speak of liability in a freestanding, unqualified way, when it actually speaks in a limited way, by referencing enumerated damages.  His reading is also at odds with the traditional understanding that tort recovery requires both wrongful act plus causation and proof of some harm for which damages can reasonably be assessed.  And an uncodified provision of the Act demonstrates that Congress left for another day the question whether to authorize general damages, i.e., an award calculated without reference to specific harm.  In fact, drafting history shows that Congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized such damages.  Finally, Does reading leaves the entitlement to recovery reference with no job to do.  As he treats the text, Congress could have accomplished its object simply by providing that the Government would be liable for actual damages but in no case less than $1,000.  Pp. 48.


(c)Does argument suggests that it would have been illogical for Congress to create a cause of action for anyone suffering an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action, then deny recovery without actual damages.  But subsection (g)(1)(D)s recognition of a civil action was not meant to provide a complete cause of action.  A subsequent provision requires proof of intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect, and if the specific state of mind must be proven additionally, it is consistent with logic to require some actual damages as well.  Doe also suggests that it is peculiar to offer guaranteed damages, as a form of presumed damages not requiring proof of amount, only to plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages.  But this approach parallels the common-law remedial scheme for certain defamation claims in which plaintiffs can recover presumed damages only if they can demonstrate some actual, quantifiable pecuniary loss.  Finally, Doe points to subsequently enacted statutes with remedial provisions similar to 552a(g)(4).  However, the text of one provision is too far different from the Privacy Acts language to serve as a sound basis for analogy; and even as to the other provisions, this Court has said repeatedly that subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment.  Pp.912.

||"OLYMPIC AIRWAYS v. HUSAIN, individually, and as personal representative of the ESTATE OF 
HANSON, DECEASED, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021348. Argued November 12, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
Under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention (Convention), an air carrier is liable for a passengers death or bodily injury caused by an accident occurring on an international flight.  Accident refers to an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger, not to the passengers own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft.  Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 405, 406.  While Rubina Husain (hereinafter respondent) and her husband, Dr. Hanson, were traveling overseas, she requested that petitioner Olympic Airways provide seats away from the smoking section because Dr. Hanson had asthma and was sensitive to secondhand smoke.  After boarding, they discovered that their seats were only three rows in front of the smoking section.  A flight attendant refused respondents three requests to move Dr. Hanson.  As the smoking noticeably increased, Dr. Hanson walked toward the front of the plane to get fresher air.  He then received medical assistance but died.  Respondents filed a wrongful-death suit in state court, which was removed to federal court.  The District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hansons death, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, under Saks definition of accident, the flight attendants refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson was clearly external to him, and unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of the requested accommodation.
Held:The conduct here constitutes an accident under Article 17.  Pp.412.
(a)The parties do not dispute Saks definition of accident, but they disagree about which event should be the focus of the accident inquiry.  The Courts reasoning in Saks sheds light on whether the flight attendants refusal to assist a passenger in a medical crisis is the proper focus of the accident inquiry.  In Saks, the Court focused on what causes can be considered accidents, 470 U. S., at 404, and did not suggest that only one event could be the accident.  Indeed, the Court recognized that [a]ny injury is the product of a chain of causes.  Id., at 406.  Thus, for purposes of the accident inquiry, a plaintiff need only prove that some link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.  Ibid.  Pp.48.


(b)Petitioner does not dispute that the flight attendants conduct was unusual or unexpected, arguing only that her conduct was irrelevant to the accident inquiry.  Petitioner argues that ambient cigarette smoke was the relevant injury producing event.  Petitioners focus on the ambient cigarette smoke neglects the reality that multiple interrelated factual events often combine to cause a given injury.  Any one of these events or happenings may be a link in the chain of causes andso long as it is unusual or unexpectedcould constitute an accident under Article 17.  470 U. S., at 406.  The flight attendants refusal on three separate occasions to move Dr. Hanson was a factual event that the District Court correctly found to be a link in the chain of causes leading to his death.  Petitioners argument that the attendants failure to act cannot constitute an accident because only affirmative acts are events or happenings under Saks is also unavailing.  The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an event or happening under these terms ordinary and usual definitions, and other provisions of the Convention suggest that there is often no distinction between action and inaction on the ultimate liability issue, see, e.g., Art. 25.  Finally, although the Ninth Circuit improperly seemed to approve of a negligence-based approach to the accident inquiry, no party disputes that courts holding that the flight attendants conduct was unexpected and unusual, which is the operative language under Saks and the correct Article 17 analysis.  Pp.812.

			"|"OLYMPIC AIRWAYS v. HUSAIN, individually, and as personal representative of the ESTATE OF 
HANSON, DECEASED, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 021348. Argued November 12, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
Under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention (Convention), an air carrier is liable for a passengers death or bodily injury caused by an accident occurring on an international flight.  Accident refers to an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger, not to the passengers own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft.  Air France v. Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 405, 406.  While Rubina Husain (hereinafter respondent) and her husband, Dr. Hanson, were traveling overseas, she requested that petitioner Olympic Airways provide seats away from the smoking section because Dr. Hanson had asthma and was sensitive to secondhand smoke.  After boarding, they discovered that their seats were only three rows in front of the smoking section.  A flight attendant refused respondents three requests to move Dr. Hanson.  As the smoking noticeably increased, Dr. Hanson walked toward the front of the plane to get fresher air.  He then received medical assistance but died.  Respondents filed a wrongful-death suit in state court, which was removed to federal court.  The District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hansons death, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, under Saks definition of accident, the flight attendants refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson was clearly external to him, and unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of the requested accommodation.
Held:The conduct here constitutes an accident under Article 17.  Pp.412.
(a)The parties do not dispute Saks definition of accident, but they disagree about which event should be the focus of the accident inquiry.  The Courts reasoning in Saks sheds light on whether the flight attendants refusal to assist a passenger in a medical crisis is the proper focus of the accident inquiry.  In Saks, the Court focused on what causes can be considered accidents, 470 U. S., at 404, and did not suggest that only one event could be the accident.  Indeed, the Court recognized that [a]ny injury is the product of a chain of causes.  Id., at 406.  Thus, for purposes of the accident inquiry, a plaintiff need only prove that some link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.  Ibid.  Pp.48.


(b)Petitioner does not dispute that the flight attendants conduct was unusual or unexpected, arguing only that her conduct was irrelevant to the accident inquiry.  Petitioner argues that ambient cigarette smoke was the relevant injury producing event.  Petitioners focus on the ambient cigarette smoke neglects the reality that multiple interrelated factual events often combine to cause a given injury.  Any one of these events or happenings may be a link in the chain of causes andso long as it is unusual or unexpectedcould constitute an accident under Article 17.  470 U. S., at 406.  The flight attendants refusal on three separate occasions to move Dr. Hanson was a factual event that the District Court correctly found to be a link in the chain of causes leading to his death.  Petitioners argument that the attendants failure to act cannot constitute an accident because only affirmative acts are events or happenings under Saks is also unavailing.  The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an event or happening under these terms ordinary and usual definitions, and other provisions of the Convention suggest that there is often no distinction between action and inaction on the ultimate liability issue, see, e.g., Art. 25.  Finally, although the Ninth Circuit improperly seemed to approve of a negligence-based approach to the accident inquiry, no party disputes that courts holding that the flight attendants conduct was unexpected and unusual, which is the operative language under Saks and the correct Article 17 analysis.  Pp.812.
316 F.3d 829, affirmed.

|540 u.s. 668|"BANKS v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 028286. Argued December 8, 2003Decided February 24, 2004
After police found a gun-shot corpse near Texarkana, Texas, Deputy Sheriff Willie Huff learned that the decedent had been seen with petitioner Banks three days earlier.  When a paid informant told Deputy Huff that Banks was driving to Dallas to fetch a weapon, Deputy Huff followed Banks to a residence there.  On the return trip, police stopped Bankss vehicle, found a handgun, and arrested the cars occupants.  Returning to the Dallas residence, Deputy Huff encountered Charles Cook and recovered a second gun, which Cook said Banks had left at the residence several days earlier.  On testing, the second gun proved to be the murder weapon.  Prior to Bankss trial, the State advised defense counsel that, without necessity of motions,  the State would provide Banks with all discovery to which he was entitled.  Nevertheless, the State withheld evidence that would have allowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses.  At the trials guilt phase, Cook testified, inter alia, that Banks admitted kill[ing a] white boy.  On cross-examination, Cook thrice denied talking to anyone about his testimony.  In fact, Deputy Huff and prosecutors intensively coached Cook about his testimony during at least one pretrial session.  The prosecution allowed Cooks misstatements to stand uncorrected.  After Bankss capital murder conviction, the penalty-phase jury found that Banks would probably commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  One of the States two penalty-phase witnesses, Robert Farr, testified that Banks had retrieved a gun from Dallas in order to commit robberies.  According to Farr, Banks had said he would take care of it if trouble arose during those crimes.  Two defense witnesses impeached Farr, but were, in turn, impeached.  Banks testified, among other things, that, although he had traveled to Dallas to obtain a gun, he had no intent to participate in the robberies, which Farr alone planned to commit.  In summation, the prosecution suggested that Banks had not traveled to Dallas only to supply Farr with a weapon.  Stressing Farrs testimony that Banks said he would take care of trouble arising during the robberies, the prosecution urged the jury to find Farr credible.  Farrs admission that he used narcotics, the prosecution suggested, indicated that he had been open and honest in every way.  The State did not disclose that Farr was the paid informant who told Deputy Huff about the Dallas trip.  The judge sentenced Banks to death.


Through Bankss direct appeal, the State continued to hold secret Farrs and Cooks links to the police.  In a 1992 state-court postconviction motion, Banks alleged for the first time that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence that would have revealed Farr as a police informant and Bankss arrest as a set-up.  Banks also alleged that during the trials guilt phase, the State deliberately withheld information of a deal prosecutors made with Cook, which would have been critical to the jurys assessment of Cooks credibility.  Banks asserted that the States actions violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87, which held that the prosecutions suppression of evidence requested by and favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment, irrespective of the prosecutions good or bad faith.  The State denied Bankss allegations, and the state postconviction court rejected his claims.


In 1996, Banks filed the instant federal habeas petition, alleging, as relevant, that the State had withheld material exculpatory evidence revealing Farr to be a police informant and Banks arrest as a set-up.  Banks further alleged that the State had concealed Cooks incentive to testify in a manner favorable to the prosecution.  Banks attached affidavits from Farr and Cook to a February 1999 motion seeking discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  Farrs declaration stated that he had agreed to help Deputy Huff with the murder investigation out of fear Huff would arrest him on drug charges; that Huff had paid him $200; and that Farr had set [Banks] up by convincing him to drive to Dallas to retrieve Bankss gun.  Cook recalled that he had participated in practice sessions before the Banks trial at which prosecutors told him he must either testify as they wanted or spend the rest of his life in prison.  In response to the Magistrate Judges disclosure order in the federal habeas proceeding, the prosecution gave Banks a transcript of a September 1980 pretrial interrogation of Cook by police and prosecutors.  This transcript provided compelling evidence that Cooks testimony had been tutored, but did not bear on whether Cook had a deal with the prosecution.  At the federal evidentiary hearing Huff acknowledged, for the first time, that Farr was an informant paid for his involvement in Bankss case.  A Banks trial prosecutor testified, however, that no deal had been offered to gain Cooks testimony.  The Magistrate Judge recommended a writ of habeas corpus with respect to Bankss death sentence based on, inter alia, the States failure to disclose Farrs informant status.  The judge did not recommend disturbing the guilt-phase verdict, concluding in this regard that Banks had not properly pleaded a Brady claim based on the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judges report and rejected Bankss argument that the Cook transcript claim be treated as if raised in the pleadings, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b).


The Fifth Circuit reversed to the extent the District Court had granted relief on Bankss Farr Brady claim.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, prior to federal habeas proceedings, the prosecution had suppressed Farrs informant status and his part in the Dallas trip.  The Fifth Circuit nonetheless concluded that Banks did not act diligently to develop the facts underpinning his Farr Brady claim when he pursued his 1992 state-court postconviction application.  That lack of diligence, the Court of Appeals held, rendered the evidence uncovered in the federal habeas proceeding procedurally barred.  In any event, the Fifth Circuit ruled, Farrs status as an informant was not material for Brady purposes.  That was so, in the Fifth Circuits judgment, because Banks had impeached Farr at trial by bringing out that he had been an unreliable police informant in Arkansas, and because much of Farrs testimony was corroborated by other witnesses, including Banks himself, who had acknowledged his willingness to get a gun for Farrs use in robberies.  The Fifth Circuit also denied a certificate of appealability on Bankss Cook Brady claim.  In accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals rejected Bankss assertion that, because his Cook Brady claim had been aired by implied consent, Rule 15(b) required it to be treated as if raised in the pleadings.
Held:The Fifth Circuit erred in dismissing Bankss Farr Brady claim and denying him a certificate of appealability on his Cook Brady claim.  When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material in the States possession, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight.  Pp.1734.
(a)Both of Bankss Brady claims arose under the regime in place prior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  P.17.


(b)Bankss Farr Brady claim, as it trains on his death sentence, is not barred.  All three elements of a Brady claim are satisfied as to the suppression of Farrs informant status and its bearing on the reliability of the jurys verdict regarding punishment.  Because Banks has also demonstrated cause and prejudice, he is not precluded from gaining federal habeas relief by his failure to produce evidence in anterior state-court proceedings.  Pp.1731.


(1)Pre-AEDPA habeas law required Banks to exhaust available state-court remedies in order to pursue federal-court relief.  See, e.g., Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509.  Banks satisfied this requirement by alleging in his 1992 state-court habeas application that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence about Farr.  Banks, however, failed to produce evidence in state postconviction court establishing that Farr had served as Deputy Sheriff Huffs informant.  In the federal habeas forum, Banks must show that he was not thereby barred from producing evidence to substantiate his Farr Brady claim.  Banks would be entitled to a federal-court evidentiary hearing if he could show both cause for his failure to develop facts in state court, and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.  Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 11.  A Brady prosecutorial misconduct claim has three essential elements.  Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 281282.  Beyond debate, the first such elementthat the evidence at issue be favorable to the accused as exculpatory or impeachingis satisfied here.  Farrs paid informant status plainly qualifies as evidence advantageous to Banks.  Cause and prejudice in this case parallel the second and third of the three Brady components.  Corresponding to the second Brady elementthat the State suppressed the evidence at issuea petitioner shows cause when the reason for the failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the States suppression of the relevant evidence.  Coincident with the third Brady componentthat prejudice ensuedprejudice within the compass of the cause and prejudice requirement exists when suppressed evidence is material for Brady purposes.  Ibid.  Thus, if Banks succeeds in demonstrating cause and prejudice, he will also succeed in establishing the essential elements of his Farr Brady claim.  Pp.1719.


(2)Banks has shown cause for failing to present evidence in state court capable of substantiating his Farr Brady claim.  As Strickler instructs, 527 U. S., at 289, three inquiries underlie the cause determination: (1) whether the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (2) whether the petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecutions open file policy as fulfilling the prosecutions duty to disclose such evidence; and (3) whether the State confirmed the petitioners reliance on that policy by asserting during the state habeas proceedings that the petitioner had already received everything known to the government.  This case is congruent with Strickler in all three respects.  First, the State knew of, but kept back, Farrs arrangement with Deputy Huff.  Cf. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 437.  Second, the State asserted, on the eve of trial, that it would disclose all Brady material.  Banks cannot be faulted for relying on that representation.  See Strickler, 527 U. S., at 283284.  Third, in its answer to Bankss 1992 state habeas application, the State denied Bankss assertions that Farr was a police informant and Bankss arrest a set-up.  The State thereby confirmed Bankss reliance on the prosecutions representation that it had disclosed all Brady material.  In this regard, Bankss case is stronger than was the Strickler petitioners:Each time Farr misrepresented his dealings with police, the prosecution allowed that testimony to stand uncorrected.  Cf. Giglio v. United States, 405 U. S. 150, 153.  Banks appropriately assumed police would not engage in improper litigation conduct to obtain a conviction.  None of the States arguments for distinguishing Strickler on the cause issue accounts adequately for the States concealment and misrepresentation of Farrs link to Huff.  In light of those misrepresentations, Banks did not lack appropriate diligence in pursuing the Farr Brady claim in state court.  Nor is Banks at fault for failing to move, in the 1992 state-court postconviction proceedings, for investigative assistance so that he could inquire into Farrs police connections, for state law entitled him to no such aid.  Further, Roviaro v. United States, 353 U. S. 53, which concerned the Governments obligation to reveal the identity of an informant it does not call as a witness, does not support the States position.  Pp.1926.


(3)The States suppression of Farrs informant status is material for Brady purposes.  The materiality standard for Brady claims is met when the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.  Kyles, 514 U. S., at 435.  Farr was paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to Bankss indictment.  Farrs declaration, presented to the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks, initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate robberies.  Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Huffs request, the Dallas excursion to fetch Bankss gun, the prosecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banks planned to continue committing violent acts.  Farrs admission of his instigating role, moreover, would have dampened the prosecutions zeal in urging the jury to consider Bankss acquisition of a gun to commit robbery or his planned violence.  Because Banks had no criminal record, Farrs testimony about Bankss propensity to violence was crucial to the prosecution.  Without that testimony, the State could not have underscored to the jury that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to take care of trouble arising during robberies.  The stress placed by the prosecution on this part of Farrs testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the States suggestion that Farrs testimony was adequately corroborated.  The prosecutions penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance the State attached to Farrs testimony.  In contrast to Strickler, where the Court found cause, 527 U. S., at 289, but no prejudice, id., at 292296, the existence of prejudice in this case is marked.  Farrs trial testimony was the centerpiece of the Banks prosecutions penalty-phase case.  That testimony was cast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding.  Had jurors known of Farrs continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Huffs favor and his receipt of funds to set Banks up, they might well have distrusted Farrs testimony, and, insofar as it was uncorroborated, disregarded it.  The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truth-promoting precautions that generally accompany informant testimony.  Such testimony poses serious credibility questions.  This Court, therefore, has long allowed defendants broad latitude to cross-examine informants and has counseled the use of careful instructions on submission of the credibility issue to the jury.  See, e.g., On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, 757.  The States argument that Farrs informant status was rendered cumulative by his impeachment at trial is contradicted by the record.  Neither witness called to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant to Farrs part in Bankss prosecution.  The impeaching witnesses, moreover, were themselves impeached, as the prosecution stressed on summation.  Further, the prosecution turned to its advantage remaining impeachment evidence by suggesting that Farrs admission of drug use demonstrated his openness and honesty.  Pp.2631.


(c)The lower courts wrongly denied Banks a certificate of appealability with regard to his Brady claim resting on the prosecutions suppression of the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  The Court of Appeals rejected Bankss contention that Rule 15(b) required the claim to be treated as having been raised in the pleadings because the transcript substantiating the claim had been aired at an evidentiary hearing before the Magistrate Judge.  The Fifth Circuit apparently relied on the debatable view that Rule 15(b) is inapplicable in habeas proceedings.  This Court has twice assumed that Rules application in such proceedings.  Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 294, n.5; Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 696, and n.7.  The Withrow District Court had granted habeas on a claim neither pleaded, considered at an evidentiary hearing, nor even argu[ed] by the parties.  Id., at 695.  This Court held that there had been no trial of the claim by implied consent; and manifestly, the respondent warden was prejudiced by the lack of opportunity to present evidence bearing on the claims resolution.  Id., at 696.  Here, in contrast, the issue of the undisclosed Cook interrogation transcript was aired at a hearing before the Magistrate Judge, and the transcript was admitted into evidence without objection.  The Fifth Circuits view that an evidentiary hearing should not be aligned with a trial for Rule 15(b) purposes is not well grounded.  Nor does this Court agree with the Court of Appeals that applying Rule 15(b) in habeas proceedings would undermine the States exhaustion and procedural default defenses.  Ibid.  Under pre-AEDPA law, no inconsistency arose between Rule 15(b) and those defenses.  Doubtless, that is why this Courts pre-AEDPA cases assumed Rule 15(b)s application in habeas proceedings.  See, e.g., ibid.  While AEDPA forbids a finding that exhaustion has been waived absent an express waiver by the State, 28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(3), pre-AEDPA law allowed waiver of both defensesexhaustion and procedural defaultbased on the States litigation conduct, see, e.g., Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 166.  To obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could disagree with the district courts resolution of his constitutional claims or that the issues presented warrant encouragement to proceed further.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 327.  This case fits that description as to the application of Rule 15(b).  Pp.3134.

Nor is Banks at fault for failing to move, in the 1992 state-court postconviction proceedings, for investigative assistance so that he could inquire into Farrs police connections, for state law entitled him to no such aid.  Further, Roviaro v. United States, 353 U. S. 53, which concerned the Governments obligation to reveal the identity of an informant it does not call as a witness, does not support the States position.  Pp.1926.


(3)The States suppression of Farrs informant status is material for Brady purposes.  The materiality standard for Brady claims is met when the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.  Kyles, 514 U. S., at 435.  Farr was paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to Bankss indictment.  Farrs declaration, presented to the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks, initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate robberies.  Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Huffs request, the Dallas excursion to fetch Bankss gun, the prosecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banks planned to continue committing violent acts.  Farrs admission of his instigating role, moreover, would have dampened the prosecutions zeal in urging the jury to consider Bankss acquisition of a gun to commit robbery or his planned violence.  Because Banks had no criminal record, Farrs testimony about Bankss propensity to violence was crucial to the prosecution.  Without that testimony, the State could not have underscored to the jury that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to take care of trouble arising during robberies.  The stress placed by the prosecution on this part of Farrs testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the States suggestion that Farrs testimony was adequately corroborated.  The prosecutions penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance the State attached to Farrs testimony.  In contrast to Strickler, where the Court found cause, 527 U. S., at 289, but no prejudice, id., at 292296, the existence of prejudice in this case is marked.  Farrs trial testimony was the centerpiece of the Banks prosecutions penalty-phase case.  That testimony was cast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding.  Had jurors known of Farrs continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Huffs favor and his receipt of funds to set Banks up, they might well have distrusted Farrs testimony, and, insofar as it was uncorroborated, disregarded it.  The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truth-promoting precautions that generally accompany informant testimony.  Such testimony poses serious credibility questions.  This Court, therefore, has long allowed defendants broad latitude to cross-examine informants and has counseled the use of careful instructions on submission of the credibility issue to the jury.  See, e.g., On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747, 757.  The States argument that Farrs informant status was rendered cumulative by his impeachment at trial is contradicted by the record.  Neither witness called to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant to Farrs part in Bankss prosecution.  The impeaching witnesses, moreover, were themselves impeached, as the prosecution stressed on summation.  Further, the prosecution turned to its advantage remaining impeachment evidence by suggesting that Farrs admission of drug use demonstrated his openness and honesty.  Pp.2631.


(c)The lower courts wrongly denied Banks a certificate of appealability with regard to his Brady claim resting on the prosecutions suppression of the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  The Court of Appeals rejected Bankss contention that Rule 15(b) required the claim to be treated as having been raised in the pleadings because the transcript substantiating the claim had been aired at an evidentiary hearing before the Magistrate Judge.  The Fifth Circuit apparently relied on the debatable view that Rule 15(b) is inapplicable in habeas proceedings.  This Court has twice assumed that Rules application in such proceedings.  Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 294, n.5; Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 696, and n.7.  The Withrow District Court had granted habeas on a claim neither pleaded, considered at an evidentiary hearing, nor even argu[ed] by the parties.  Id., at 695.  This Court held that there had been no trial of the claim by implied consent; and manifestly, the respondent warden was prejudiced by the lack of opportunity to present evidence bearing on the claims resolution.  Id., at 696.  Here, in contrast, the issue of the undisclosed Cook interrogation transcript was aired at a hearing before the Magistrate Judge, and the transcript was admitted into evidence without objection.  The Fifth Circuits view that an evidentiary hearing should not be aligned with a trial for Rule 15(b) purposes is not well grounded.  Nor does this Court agree with the Court of Appeals that applying Rule 15(b) in habeas proceedings would undermine the States exhaustion and procedural default defenses.  Ibid.  Under pre-AEDPA law, no inconsistency arose between Rule 15(b) and those defenses.  Doubtless, that is why this Courts pre-AEDPA cases assumed Rule 15(b)s application in habeas proceedings.  See, e.g., ibid.  While AEDPA forbids a finding that exhaustion has been waived absent an express waiver by the State, 28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(3), pre-AEDPA law allowed waiver of both defensesexhaustion and procedural defaultbased on the States litigation conduct, see, e.g., Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 166.  To obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could disagree with the district courts resolution of his constitutional claims or that the issues presented warrant encouragement to proceed further.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 327.  This case fits that description as to the application of Rule 15(b).  Pp.3134.

|540 u.s. 544|"ILLINOIS v. GREGORY FISHER
on petition for writ of certiorari to the appellate
court of illinois, first district
No. 03374. Decided February 23, 2004
Per Curiam.

The Appellate Court of Illinois held here that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause required the dismissal of criminal charges because the police, acting in good faith and according to normal police procedures, destroyed evidence that respondent had requested more than 10 years earlier in a discovery motion.  Petitioner, the State of Illinois, contends that such a result is foreclosed by our decision in Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51 (1988).  There we held that unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.  Id., at 58.  We agree with petitioner, grant the petition for certiorari, and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.


In September 1988, Chicago police arrested respondent in the course of a traffic stop during which police observed him furtively attempting to conceal a plastic bag containing a white powdery substance.  Four tests conducted by the Chicago Police Crime Lab and the Illinois State Police Crime Lab confirmed that the bag seized from respondent contained cocaine.


Respondent was charged with possession of cocaine in the Circuit Court of Cook County in October 1988.  He filed a motion for discovery eight days later requesting all physical evidence the State intended to use at trial.  The State responded that all evidence would be made available at a reasonable time and date upon request.  Respondent was released on bond pending trial.  In July 1989, however, he failed to appear in court, and the court issued an arrest warrant to secure his presence.  Respondent remained a fugitive for over 10 years, apparently settling in Tennessee.  The outstanding arrest warrant was finally executed in November 1999, after respondent was detained on an unrelated matter.  The State then reinstated the 1988 cocaine-possession charge.


Before trial, the State informed respondent that in September 1999, the police, acting in accord with established procedures, had destroyed the substance seized from him during his arrest.  Respondent thereupon formally requested production of the substance and filed a motion to dismiss the cocaine-possession charge based on the States destruction of evidence.  The trial court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to a jury trial.  The State introduced evidence tending to prove the facts recounted above.  Respondents case in chief consisted solely of his own testimony, in which he denied that he ever possessed cocaine and insinuated that the police had framed him for the crime.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and respondent was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.


The Appellate Court reversed the conviction, holding that the Due Process Clause required dismissal of the charge.  Relying on the Illinois Supreme Courts decision in Illinois v. Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d 310, 652 N.E. 2d 288 (1995), the Appellate Court reasoned:
Where evidence is requested by the defense in a discovery motion, the State is on notice that the evidence must be preserved, and the defense is not required to make an independent showing that the evidence has exculpatory value in order to establish a due process violation.  If the State proceeds to destroy the evidence, appropriate sanctions may be imposed even if the destruction is inadvertent.  No showing of bad faith is necessary.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 12 (quoting Newberry, supra, at 317, 652 N.E. 2d, at 292) (citation omitted).

The Appellate Court observed that Newberry distinguished our decision in Youngblood on the ground that the police in Youngblood did not destroy evidence subsequent to a discovery motion by the defendant.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13.  While acknowledging that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the alleged cocaine was destroyed in bad faith, id., at 15, the court further determined that Newberry dictated dismissal because, unlike in Youngblood, the destroyed evidence provided respondents only hope for exoneration, App. to Pet. for Cert. 15, and was essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case,  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16 (quoting Newberry, supra, at 315, 652 N.E. 2d, at 291).  Consequently, the court concluded that respondent was denied due process when he was tried subsequent to the destruction of the alleged cocaine.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16.  The Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.


We have held that when the State suppresses or fails to disclose material exculpatory evidence, the good or bad faith of the prosecution is irrelevant: a due process violation occurs whenever such evidence is withheld.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); United States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97 (1976).  In Youngblood, by contrast, we recognized that the Due Process Clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.  488 U. S., at 57.  We concluded that the failure to preserve this potentially useful evidence does not violate due process unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police.  Id., at 58 (emphasis added).  


The substance seized from respondent was plainly the sort of potentially useful evidence referred to in Youngblood, not the material exculpatory evidence addressed in Brady and Agurs.  At most, respondent could hope that, had the evidence been preserved, a fifth test conducted on the substance would have exonerated him.  See Youngblood, 488 U. S., at 57.  But respondent did not allege, nor did the Appellate Court find, that the Chicago police acted in bad faith when they destroyed the substance.  Quite the contrary, police testing indicated that the chemical makeup of the substance inculpated, not exculpated, respondent, see id., at 57, n., and it is undisputed that police acted in good faith and in accord with their normal practice,  id., at 56 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 488 (1984) (in turn quoting Killian v. United States, 368 U. S. 231, 242 (1961))).  Under Youngblood, then, respondent has failed to establish a due process violation.


We have never held or suggested that the existence of a pending discovery request eliminates the necessity of showing bad faith on the part of police.  Indeed, the result reached in this case demonstrates why such a per se rule would negate the very reason we adopted the bad-faith requirement in the first place: to limi[t] the extent of the polices obligation to preserve evidence to reasonable grounds and confin[e] it to that class of cases where the interests of justice most clearly require it.  488 U. S., at 58.


We also disagree that Youngblood does not apply whenever the contested evidence provides a defendants only hope for exoneration and is essential to and determinative of the outcome of the case.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 15
16 (citing Newberry, 166 Ill. 2d, at 315, 652 N.E. 2d, at 291).  In Youngblood, the Arizona Court of Appeals said that the destroyed evidence could [have] eliminate[d] the defendant as a perpetrator. 488 U. S., at 54.  Similarly here, an additional test might have provided the defendant with an opportunity to show that the police tests were mistaken.  It is thus difficult to distinguish the two cases on this basis.  But in any event, the applicability of the bad-faith requirement in Youngblood depended not on the centrality of the contested evidence to the prosecutions case or the defendants defense, but on the distinction between material exculpatory evidence and potentially useful evidence.  488 U. S., at 5758.  As we have held, supra, at 4, the substance destroyed here was, at best, potentially useful evidence, and therefore Youngbloods bad-faith requirement applies.


The judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Respondent suggests that we lack jurisdiction because the Appellate Court relied on Newberry, which in turn relied on an adequate and independent state ground.  See, e.g., Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 10401042 (1983).  Respondent is correct that Newberry relied on both the Due Process Clause, and in the alternative, Illinois Supreme Court Rule 415(g)(i).  166 Ill. 2d, at 314317, 652 N.E. 2d, at 290292.  The Appellate Court, however, relied only on the portion of Newberry that addressed due process, and the Appellate Court based its decision solely on the Due Process Clause.  Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review that decision.  See, e.g., Long, supra, at 1038, n.4 ([w]e may review a state case decided on a federal ground even if it is clear that there was an available state ground for decision on which the state court could properly have relied) (citing Beecher v. Alabama, 389 U. S. 35, 37, n.3 (1967) (per curiam)).

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 026320. Argued December 10, 2003Decided January 26, 2004
Police officers went to petitioners home and advised him that they had come to discuss his involvement in drug distribution.  They told him that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted him for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.  During the course of a brief discussion, petitioner made several inculpatory statements.  Once at the county jail, petitioner was advised of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285, signed a waiver of those rights, and reiterated his earlier statements.  Before trial, he moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the jail.  A Magistrate Judge recommended that the home statements be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his Miranda rights, and that portions of his jailhouse statements be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide Miranda warnings.  The District Court suppressed the unwarned home statements but admitted the jailhouse statements pursuant to Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, concluding that petitioner had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before making the statements.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that petitioners jailhouse statements were properly admitted under Elstad, and that the officers had not violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Patterson because they did not interrogate him at his home.
Held:The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the absence of an interrogation foreclosed petitioners claim that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from him at his home.  Pp.46.
(a)An accused is denied the protections of the Sixth Amendment when there [is] used against him at his trial  his own incriminating words, which federal agents  deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.  Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, 206.  This Court has consistently applied the deliberate-elicitation standard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see, e.g., United States v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264, and has expressly distinguished it from the Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, see, e.g., Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625.  There is no question here that the officers deliberately elicited information from petitioner at his home.  Because their discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights, the officers actions violated the Sixth Amendment standards established in Massiah, supra, and its progeny.  Pp.45.


(b)Because of its erroneous determination that petitioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the Eighth Circuit improperly conducted its fruits analysis under the Fifth Amendment.  In applying Elstad, supra, to hold that the admissibility of the jailhouse statements turned solely on whether they were knowing and voluntary, the court did not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendment requires suppression of those statements on the ground that they were the fruits of previous questioning that violated the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard.  As this Court has not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of Elstad applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the case is remanded to the Eighth Circuit to address this issue in the first instance.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 02693. Argued November 10, 2003Decided January 26, 2004
Before 1994, 330(a) of the Bankruptcy Code authorized a court to award to a trustee, to an examiner, to a professional person employed under section 327  , or to the debtors attorney (1) reasonable compensation for  services rendered by such trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney .  (Emphasis added to highlight text later deleted.)  In 1994 Congress amended the Code with a reform Act.  The Act altered 330(a) by deleting or to the debtors attorney from what was 330(a) and is now 330(a)(1).  This change created apparent legislative drafting error in the current section.  The section is left with a missing or that infects its grammar.  And its inclusion of attorney in what was 330(a)(1) and is now 330(a)(1)(A) defeats the neat parallelism that otherwise marks the relationship between current 330(a)(1) (trustee,  examiner, [or] professional person) and 330(a)(1)(A) (trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney).  In this case, petitioner filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking attorneys fees under 330(a)(1) for the time he spent working on a behalf of a debtor in a chapter 7 proceeding.  The Government objected to the application.  It argued that 330(a) makes no provision for the estate to compensate an attorney who is not employed by the estate trustee and approved by the court under 327.  Petitioner admitted he was not employed by the trustee and approved by the court under 327, but nonetheless contended 330(a) authorized a fee award to him because he was a debtors attorney.  In denying petitioners application, the Bankruptcy Court, District Court, and Fourth Circuit all held that in a chapter 7 proceeding 330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorneys fees unless the attorney has been appointed under 327.
Held:Under the Codes plain language, 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by 327.  If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under 330(a)(1) in a chapter 7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court.  Pp.515.
(a)Petitioner argues that this Court must look to legislative history to determine Congress intent because the existing statutory text is ambiguous in light of its predecessor.  He claims that subsection (A)s attorney is facially irreconcilable with the sections first part since the two parts lists were previously parallel.  He claims also that only a drafting error can explain the missing conjunction or between an examiner and a professional person since the text was previously grammatically correct.  The starting point in discerning congressional intent, however, is the existing statutory text, Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, and not predecessor statutes.  So this Court begins with the present statute.  Pp.56.


(b)That the present statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical, does not make it ambiguous on the point at issue.  A debtors attorney not engaged under 327 does not fall within the eligible class of persons that the first part of 330(a)(1) authorizes to receive compensation: trustees, examiners, and 327 professional persons.  Subsection (A) allows compensation for services rendered by four types of persons (the same three plus attorneys), but unless an applicant is in one of the classes named in the first part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant.  The missing or does not change this conclusion.  Numerous federal statutes inadvertently lack a conjunction, but are read for their plain meaning.  Here, the missing or neither alters the texts substance nor obscures its meaning.  Subsection (A)s nonparalleled fourth category also does not cloud the statutes meaning.  Attorney can be straightforwardly read to refer to those attorneys who qualify as 327 professional persons.  Likewise, neighboring 331, which permits both debtors attorneys and 327 professional persons to receive interim compensation, most straightforwardly refers to 327 debtors attorneys.  This reading may make attorney in 330(a)(1)(A) surplusage, but surplusage does not always produce ambiguity.  When there are two ways to read the texteither attorney is surplusage, which makes the text plain, or attorney is nonsurplusage, which makes the text ambiguousapplying a rule against surplusage is inappropriate.  Pp.69.


(c)The plain meaning that 330(a)(1) sets forth does not lead to absurd results.  Petitioners argumentsthat this Courts interpretation will lead to a departure from the principle of prompt and effectual administration of bankruptcy law and attributes to Congress an intent to eliminate compensation essential to debtors receipt of legal servicesoverstate 330(a)(1)s effect.  Compensation remains available through various permitted means.  Compensation for debtors attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies, for example, is not much disturbed by 330 as a whole.  Moreover, compensation for debtors attorneys in chapter 7 proceedings is not altogether prohibited.  Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow chapter 7 trustees to engage attorneys, including debtors counsel, and allow courts to award them fees.  Section 327s limitation on a debtors incurring debts for professional services without the trustees approval also advances the trustees responsibility for preserving the chapter 7 estate.  Add to this the apparent sound functioning of the bankruptcy system in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, which have both adopted the plain meaning approach, and petitioners arguments become unconvincing.  And 330(a)(1) does not prevent a debtor from engaging in the common practice of paying counsel compensation in advance to ensure that a bankruptcy filing is in order.  Pp.911.


(d)With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view, this Court will not read attorney in 330(a)(1)(A) to refer to debtors attorneys, in effect enlarging the statutes scope.  See Iselin v. United States, 270 U. S. 245, 251.  This Courts unwillingness to soften the import of Congress chosen words even if it believes the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.  P.11.


(e)Though it is unnecessary to rely on the 1994 Acts legislative history, it is instructive to note that the history creates more confusion than clarity about the congressional intent.  History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioners interpretation and to the holding reached here.  This uncertainty illustrates the difficulty of relying on legislative history and the advantage of resting on the statutory text.  Pp.1214.

In denying petitioners application, the Bankruptcy Court, District Court, and Fourth Circuit all held that in a chapter 7 proceeding 330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorneys fees unless the attorney has been appointed under 327.
Held:Under the Codes plain language, 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by 327.  If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under 330(a)(1) in a chapter 7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court.  Pp.515.
(a)Petitioner argues that this Court must look to legislative history to determine Congress intent because the existing statutory text is ambiguous in light of its predecessor.  He claims that subsection (A)s attorney is facially irreconcilable with the sections first part since the two parts lists were previously parallel.  He claims also that only a drafting error can explain the missing conjunction or between an examiner and a professional person since the text was previously grammatically correct.  The starting point in discerning congressional intent, however, is the existing statutory text, Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U. S. 432, and not predecessor statutes.  So this Court begins with the present statute.  Pp.56.


(b)That the present statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical, does not make it ambiguous on the point at issue.  A debtors attorney not engaged under 327 does not fall within the eligible class of persons that the first part of 330(a)(1) authorizes to receive compensation: trustees, examiners, and 327 professional persons.  Subsection (A) allows compensation for services rendered by four types of persons (the same three plus attorneys), but unless an applicant is in one of the classes named in the first part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant.  The missing or does not change this conclusion.  Numerous federal statutes inadvertently lack a conjunction, but are read for their plain meaning.  Here, the missing or neither alters the texts substance nor obscures its meaning.  Subsection (A)s nonparalleled fourth category also does not cloud the statutes meaning.  Attorney can be straightforwardly read to refer to those attorneys who qualify as 327 professional persons.  Likewise, neighboring 331, which permits both debtors attorneys and 327 professional persons to receive interim compensation, most straightforwardly refers to 327 debtors attorneys.  This reading may make attorney in 330(a)(1)(A) surplusage, but surplusage does not always produce ambiguity.  When there are two ways to read the texteither attorney is surplusage, which makes the text plain, or attorney is nonsurplusage, which makes the text ambiguousapplying a rule against surplusage is inappropriate.  Pp.69.


(c)The plain meaning that 330(a)(1) sets forth does not lead to absurd results.  Petitioners argumentsthat this Courts interpretation will lead to a departure from the principle of prompt and effectual administration of bankruptcy law and attributes to Congress an intent to eliminate compensation essential to debtors receipt of legal servicesoverstate 330(a)(1)s effect.  Compensation remains available through various permitted means.  Compensation for debtors attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies, for example, is not much disturbed by 330 as a whole.  Moreover, compensation for debtors attorneys in chapter 7 proceedings is not altogether prohibited.  Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow chapter 7 trustees to engage attorneys, including debtors counsel, and allow courts to award them fees.  Section 327s limitation on a debtors incurring debts for professional services without the trustees approval also advances the trustees responsibility for preserving the chapter 7 estate.  Add to this the apparent sound functioning of the bankruptcy system in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, which have both adopted the plain meaning approach, and petitioners arguments become unconvincing.  And 330(a)(1) does not prevent a debtor from engaging in the common practice of paying counsel compensation in advance to ensure that a bankruptcy filing is in order.  Pp.911.


(d)With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view, this Court will not read attorney in 330(a)(1)(A) to refer to debtors attorneys, in effect enlarging the statutes scope.  See Iselin v. United States, 270 U. S. 245, 251.  This Courts unwillingness to soften the import of Congress chosen words even if it believes the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.  P.11.


(e)Though it is unnecessary to rely on the 1994 Acts legislative history, it is instructive to note that the history creates more confusion than clarity about the congressional intent.  History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioners interpretation and to the holding reached here.  This uncertainty illustrates the difficulty of relying on legislative history and the advantage of resting on the statutory text.  Pp.1214.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 02819. Argued November 3, 2003Decided January 14, 2004
A creditor in Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings has 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors to file a complaint objecting to the debtors discharge.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(a).  The bankruptcy court may extend that period for cause on motion filed before the time has expired.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(b).  Reinforcing Rule 4004(b)s restriction on extension of the Rule 4004(a) deadline, Rule 9006(b)(3) allows enlargement of the time for taking action under Rule 4004(a) only to the extent and under the conditions stated in [that rule], i.e., only as permitted by Rule 4004(b).


On April 4, 1997, petitioner Kontrick filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.  After gaining three successive time extensions from the Bankruptcy Court, respondent Ryan, Kontricks creditor, filed a complaint on January 13, 1998, objecting to Kontricks discharge.  Ryan alleged that Kontrick had transferred property, within one year of filing his petition, with the intent to defraud creditors, and therefore did not qualify for discharge under 11 U. S.C. 727(a)(2)(5).  Ryan filed an amended complaint on May 6, 1998, with leave of court, but without seeking or gaining a court-approved time extension.  The amended complaint alleged with particularity that Kontrick had fraudulently transferred money to his wife, first by removing his own name from the familys once-joint checking account, then by continuing regularly to deposit his salary checks into the account, from which his wife routinely paid family expenses (the family-account claim).  Kontricks June 10, 1998, answer to the amended complaint did not raise the untimeliness of the family-account claim; on the merits, the answer admitted the transfers to the family account but denied that Kontrick had violated 727(a)(2)(A).  In response to Ryans summary judgment motion, which appended a statement of material facts, Kontrick cross-moved to strike portions of Ryans summary judgment filings, but did not ask the court to strike the amended complaints family-account allegations.  On February 25, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court awarded Ryan summary judgment on the family-account claim, concluding that Kontrick was not entitled to discharge because his transfers to the family account were made with intent to defraud at least creditor Ryan.  Kontrick then moved for reconsideration.  For the first time, Kontrick urged that the court was powerless to adjudicate the family-account claim.  The amended complaint containing that claim, Kontrick observed, was untimely under Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3).  Those rules, Kontrick maintained, establish a mandatory, unalterable time limit of the kind Kontrick called jurisdictional.  The Bankruptcy Court denied reconsideration and entered final judgment, holding that Rule 4004s complaint-filing time instructions are not jurisdictional, and that Kontrick had waived the right to assert the untimeliness of the amended complaint by failing squarely to raise the point before the court reached the merits of Ryans objections to discharge.  The District Court sustained the denial of discharge, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  Both courts relied on decisions of sister Circuits holding that the timeliness provisions at issue are not jurisdictional. 
Held:A debtor forfeits the right to rely on Rule 4004 if the debtor does not raise the Rules time limitation before the bankruptcy court reaches the merits of the creditors objection to discharge.  Pp.815.
(a)Only Congress may determine a lower federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction.  U. S. Const., Art. III, 1.  Congress did so, as pertinent here, by instructing that objections to discharges are [c]ore proceedings within the bankruptcy courts jurisdiction.  28 U. S.C. 157(b)(2)(J).  Congress did not build time constraints into that statutory authorization.  Rather, the time constraints applicable to objections to discharge are contained in Bankruptcy Rules prescribed pursuant to 2075.  Such rules do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.  Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U. S. 365, 370.  As Bankruptcy Rule 9030 states, the Bankruptcy Rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts.  The filing deadlines prescribed in Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) are claim-processing rules that do not delineate what cases bankruptcy courts are competent to adjudicate.  Although Kontrick now concedes that those Rules are not properly labeled jurisdictional in the sense of describing a courts subject-matter jurisdiction, he maintains that the Rules have the same import as provisions governing subject-matter jurisdiction.  A litigant generally may raise a courts lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action.  Mansfield, C.&L.M.R. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382.  Similarly, Kontrick urges, a debtor may challenge a creditors objection to discharge as untimely under Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) at any time in the proceedings, even initially on appeal or certiorari.  The equation Kontrick advances overlooks the critical difference between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule.  Characteristically, a courts subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties litigation conduct; a claim-processing rule, on the other hand, even if unalterable on a partys application, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.  Pp.812.


(b)No reasonable construction of complaint-processing rules would allow a litigant situated as Kontrick is to defeat a claim, as filed too late, after the party has litigated and lost the case on the merits.  The relevant claim-processing rules in this case, Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), include, among their primary purposes, affording the debtor an affirmative defense to a complaint filed outside the Rules 4004(a) and (b) time limits.  It is uncontested that Ryan filed his complaint objecting to Kontricks discharge outside those limits.  Kontrick urges that nothing occurring thereafter counts, for the Rules time prescriptions are unalterable, allowing no recourse to equitable exceptions.  This case, however, involves no issue of equitable tolling or any other equity-based exception.  Neither at the time Ryan filed the amended complaint containing the family-account claim nor anytime thereafter did he assert circumstancesequitable or otherwisequalifying him for a time extension.  The sole question is whether Kontrick forfeited his right to assert the untimeliness of Ryans amended complaint by failing to raise the issue until after that complaint was adjudicated on the merits.  In other words, how long did the affirmative defense Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) afforded Kontrick linger in the proceedings?  The Seventh Circuit followed the proper path on this key question.  It noted that time bars generally must be raised in an answer or responsive pleading.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (made applicable to bankruptcy court adversary proceedings by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7008(a)).  An answer may be amended to include an inadvertently omitted affirmative defense, and even after the time to amend of course has passed, leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a) (made applicable to adversary proceedings by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7015).  Kontrick not only failed to assert the time constraints of Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) in a pleading or amended pleading responsive to Ryans amended complaint.  In addition, Kontrick moved to delete certain items from Ryans summary judgment filings, but, even that far into the litigation, he did not ask the Bankruptcy Court to strike the family-account claim.  Ordinarily, a defense is lost if it is not included in the answer or amended answer.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7012(b) (Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(h) apply in adversary proceedings).  Rules 12(h)(2) and (3) prolong the life of certain defenses, but time prescriptions are not among them.  Even if a defense based on Bankruptcy Rule 4004 could be equated to failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the issue could be raised, at the latest, at the trial on the merits.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(2).  Only lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is preserved post-trial.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).  Kontricks resistance to the family-account claim is not of that order.  Pp.1215.

EDWARDS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 021196. Argued November 4, 2003Decided January 13, 2004
Respondent was the chairman, chief executive officer, and sole shareholder of ETS Payphones, Inc., which sold payphones to the public via independent distributors.  The payphones were offered with an agreement under which ETS leased back the payphone from the purchaser for a fixed monthly payment, thereby giving purchasers a fixed 14% annual return on their investment.  Although ETS marketing materials trumpeted the incomparable pay phone as an exciting business opportunity, the payphones did not generate enough revenue for ETS to make the payments required by the leaseback agreements, so the company depended on funds from new investors to meet its obligations.  After ETS filed for bankruptcy protection, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought this civil enforcement action, alleging, among other things, that respondent and ETS had violated registration requirements and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b5 thereunder.  The District Court concluded that the sale-and-leaseback arrangement was an investment contract within the meaning of, and therefore subject to, the federal securities laws.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that (1) this Courts opinions require an investment contract to offer either capital appreciation or a participation in an enterprises earnings, and thus exclude schemes offering a fixed rate of return; and (2) those opinions requirement that the return on the investment be derived solely from the efforts of others was not satisfied when the purchasers had a contractual entitlement to the return.
Held:An investment scheme promising a fixed rate of return can be an investment contract and thus a security subject to the federal securities laws.  Section 2(a)(1) of the 1933 Act and 3(a)(10) of the 1934 Act define security to include an investment contract, but do not define investment contract.  This Court has established that the test for determining whether a particular scheme is an investment contract is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.  SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293, 301.  This definition embodies a flexible, rather than a static, principle that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those seeking to use others money on the promise of profits.  Id., at 299.  The profits this Court was speaking of in Howey are profitsin the sense of the income or returnthat investors seek on their investment, not the profits of the scheme in which they invest, and may include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment.  There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns for purposes of the test, so understood.  In both cases, the investing public is attracted by representations of investment income.  Moreover, investments pitched as low risk (such as those offering a guaranteed fixed return) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud, including older and less sophisticated investors.  Under the reading respondent advances, unscrupulous marketers of investments could evade the securities laws by picking a rate of return to promise.  This Court will not read into the securities laws a limitation not compelled by the language that would so undermine the laws purposes.  Respondents claim that including investment schemes promising a fixed return among investment contracts conflicts with precedent is mistaken, as no distinction between fixed and variable returns was drawn in the blue sky law cases that the Howey Court relied on, and no post-Howey decision is to the contrary, see United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837, 852853.  Dictum suggesting otherwise in Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U. S. 56, 68, n.4, was incorrect.  The SEC has consistently maintained that a promise of a fixed return does not preclude a scheme from being an investment contract.  The Eleventh Circuits alternative holding, that respondents scheme falls outside the definition because purchasers had a contractual entitlement to a return, is incorrect and inconsistent with this Courts precedent.

Another officer administered a sobriety test and then arrested Lidster.  He was convicted in Illinois state court of driving under the influence of alcohol.  He challenged his arrest and conviction on the ground that the government obtained evidence through use of a checkpoint stop that violated the Fourth Amendment.  The trial court rejected that challenge, but the state appellate court reversed.  The State Supreme Court agreed, holding that, in light of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, the stop was unconstitutional.
Held:The checkpoint stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.28.
(a)Edmond does not govern the outcome of this case.  In Edmond, this Court held that, absent special circumstances, the Fourth Amendment forbids police to make stops without individualized suspicion at a checkpoint set up primarily for general crime control purposes.  531 U. S., at 41, 44.  Specifically, the checkpoint in Edmond was designed to ferret out drug crimes committed by the motorists themselves.  Here, the stops primary law enforcement purpose was not to determine whether a vehicles occupants were committing a crime, but to ask the occupants, as members of the public, for help in providing information about a crime in all likelihood committed by others.  Edmonds language, as well as its context, makes clear that an information-seeking stops constitutionality was not then before this Court.  Pp. 24.


(b)Nor does the Fourth Amendment require courts to apply an Edmond-type rule of automatic unconstitutionality to such stops.  The fact that they normally lack individualized suspicion cannot by itself determine the constitutional outcome, as the Fourth Amendment does not treat a motorists car as his castle, see, e.g., New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, 112113, and special law enforcement concerns will sometimes justify highway stops without individualized suspicion, see, e.g., Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444.  More-over, the context here (seeking information from the public) is one in which, by definition, the concept of individualized suspicion has little role to play, and an information-seeking stop is not the kind of event that involves suspicion, or lack thereof, of the relevant individual.  In addition, information-seeking highway stops are less likely to provoke anxiety or to prove intrusive, since they are likely brief, the questions asked are not designed to elicit self-incriminating information, and citizens will often react positively when police ask for help.  The law also ordinarily permits police to seek the publics voluntary cooperation in a criminal investigation.  That the importance of soliciting the publics assistance is offset to some degree by the need to stop a motorist
which amounts to a seizure in Fourth Amendment terms, e.g., Edmond, supra, at 40is not important enough to justify an Edmond-type rule here.  Finally, such a rule is not needed to prevent an unreasonable proliferation of police checkpoints.  Practical considerations of limited police resources and community hostility to traffic tie-ups seem likely to inhibit any such proliferation, and the Fourth Amendments normal insistence that the stop be reasonable in context will still provide an important legal limitation on checkpoint use.  Pp.46. 


(c)The checkpoint stop was constitutional.  In judging its reasonableness, hence, its constitutionality, this Court looks to the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.  Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 51.  The relevant public concern was grave, as the police were investigating a crime that had resulted in a human death, and the stop advanced this concern to a significant degree given its timing and location.  Most importantly, the stops interfered only minimally with liberty of the sort the Fourth Amendment seeks to protect.  Viewed objectively, each stop required only a brief wait in line and contact with police for only a few seconds.  Viewed subjectively, the systematic contact provided little reason for anxiety or alarm, and there is no allegation that the police acted in a discriminatory or otherwise unlawful manner.  Pp.68.

			"|"ILLINOIS v. LIDSTER
certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
No. 021060. Argued November 5, 2003Decided January 13, 2004
Police set up a highway checkpoint to obtain information from motorists about a hit-and-run accident occurring about one week earlier at the same location and time of night.  Officers stopped each vehicle for 10 to 15 seconds, asked the occupants whether they had seen anything happen there the previous weekend, and handed each driver a flyer describing and requesting information about the accident.  As respondent Lidster approached, his minivan swerved, nearly hitting an officer.  The officer smelled alcohol on Lidsters breath.  Another officer administered a sobriety test and then arrested Lidster.  He was convicted in Illinois state court of driving under the influence of alcohol.
