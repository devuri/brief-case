04-1140|"MARTIN et ux v. FRANKLIN CAPITAL CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 041140.Argued November 8, 2005Decided December 7, 2005
In removing petitioner Martins state-court class action to federal court on diversity grounds, respondents (collectively, Franklin) acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the state-court complaint, but argued that this requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied under precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorneys fees could be aggregated in making the calculation.  The District Court denied the Martins motion to remand to state court and eventually dismissed the case with prejudice.  Reversing and remanding with instructions to remand to state court, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that their suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement and rejected Franklins aggregation theory under decisions issued after the District Courts remand decision.  The latter court then denied the Martins motion for attorneys fees because Franklin had legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within federal-court jurisdiction.  Affirming, the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the Martins argument that attorneys fees should be granted on remand as a matter of course under 28 U. S.C. 1447(c), which provides that a remand order may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, but provides little guidance on when fees are warranted.  The court noted that fee awards are left to the district courts discretion, subject to review only for abuse of discretion; pointed out that, under Circuit precedent, the key factor in deciding whether to award fees is the propriety of removal; and held that, because Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, its basis for removal was objectively reasonable, and the fee denial was not an abuse of discretion.
Held:Absent unusual circumstances, attorneys fees should not be awarded under 1447(c) when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.  Conversely, where no objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be awarded.  This Court rejects the Martins argument for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees.  The reasons for adopting such a presumption in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (per curiam), are absent here.  Also rejected is Franklins argument that 1447(c) simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attorneys fees when otherwise warranted.  Were the statute strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit awards to just costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be just.  The Court therefore gives the statute its natural reading: Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an award is just.  That standard need not be defined narrowly, as the Solicitor General argues, by awarding fees only on a showing that the unsuccessful partys position was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 422, and Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U. S. 754, 762, distinguished.  The fact that a 1447(c) fee award is discretionary does not mean that there is no governing legal standard.  When applying fee-shifting statutes, the Court has found limits in the large objectives of the relevant Act.  E.g., Zipes, 491 U. S., at 759.  The appropriate test for awarding fees under 1447(c) should recognize Congress desire to deter removals intended to prolong litigation and impose costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.  In light of these large objectives, the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal.  In applying the general rule of reasonableness, district courts retain discretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure in a given case.  A courts reasons for departing, however, should be faithful to the purposes of awarding fees under 1447(c).  Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 534, n.19.  Pp.39.
393 F.3d 1143, affirmed.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

04-881|"LOCKHART v. UNITED STATES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04881.Argued November 2, 2005Decided December 7, 2005
In 2002, the Government began withholding a portion of petitioners Social Security payments to offset his debt on federally reinsured student loans that were more than 10 years overdue.  Petitioner sued, arguing that the offset was barred by the 10-year statute of limitations of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U. S.C. 3716(e)(1).  The Social Security Act generally exempts benefits from attachment or other legal process, 42 U. S.C. 407(a), and provides that [n]o other provision of law  may be construed to  modify  this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference, 407(b).  The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991 eliminated time limitations on suits to collect student loans, 20 U. S.C. 1091a(a)(2)(D).  In 1996, the Debt Collection Improvement Act subjected Social Security benefits to offset, [n]otwithstanding [407], 31 U. S.C. 3716(c)(3)(A)(i).  The District Court dismissed petitioners complaint, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The United States may offset Social Security benefits to collect a student loan debt that has been outstanding for over 10 years.  Pp.35.
(a)The Debt Collection Improvement Act makes Social Security benefits subject to offset, providing the sort of express reference that 407(b) says is necessary to supersede the anti-attachment provision.  P.3.


(b)The Higher Education Technical Amendments remove the 10-year limit that would otherwise bar offsetting petitioners Social Security benefits to pay off his student loan debt.  Debt collection by Social Security offset was not authorized until five years after this abrogation of time limits, but the plain meaning of the Higher Education Technical Amendments must be given effect even though Congress may not have foreseen all of its consequences, Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 158.  Though the Higher Education Technical Amendments, unlike the Debt Collection Improvement Act, do not explicitly mention 407, an express reference is only required to authorize attachment in the first place.  Pp.34.


(c)Though the Debt Collection Improvement Act retained the Debt Collection Acts general 10-year bar on offset authority, the Higher Education Technical Amendments retain their effect as a limited exception to the Debt Collection Act time bar in the student loan context.  The Court declines to read any meaning into a failed 2004 congressional effort to amend the latter Act to explicitly authorize offset of debts over 10 years old.  See, e.g., United States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 287.  Pp.45.

04-631|"WAGNON, SECRETARY, KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE v. PRAIRIE BAND POTAWATOMI NATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 04631.Argued October 3, 2005Decided December 6, 2005
Kansas motor fuel tax applies to the receipt of fuel by off-reservation non-Indian distributors who subsequently deliver it to the gas station owned by, and located on the Reservation of, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (Nation).  The station is meant to accommodate reservation traffic, including patrons driving to the casino the Nation owns and operates there.  Most of the stations fuel is sold to such patrons, but some sales are made to persons living or working on the reservation.  The Nations own tax on the stations fuel sales generates revenue for reservation infrastructure.  The Nation sued for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the States collection of its tax from distributors delivering fuel to the reservation.  Granting the State summary judgment, the District Court determined that the balance of state, federal, and tribal interests tilted in favor of the State under the test set forth in White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, agreeing with the Nation that the Kansas tax is an impermissible affront to its sovereignty.  The court reasoned that the Nations fuel revenues were derived from value generated primarily on its reservationi.e., the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the casinoand that the Nations interests in taxing this reservation-created value to raise revenue for reservation infrastructure outweighed the States general interest in raising revenues. 
Held: Because Kansas motor fuel tax is a nondiscriminatory tax imposed on an off-reservation transaction between non-Indians, the tax is valid and poses no affront to the Nations sovereignty.  The Bracker interest-balancing test does not apply to a tax that results from an off-reservation transaction between non-Indians.  Pp. 418.
1.The Kansas tax is imposed on non-Indian distributors based upon their off-reservation receipt of motor fuel, not on the on-reservation sale and delivery of that fuel.  Pp. 412.


(a)Under this Courts Indian tax immunity cases, the who and the where of a challenged tax have significant consequences.  The initial and frequently dispositive question  is who bears [a taxs] legal incidence, Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Chickasaw Nation, 515 U. S. 450, 458 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the States are categorically barred from placing a taxs legal incidence on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside Indian country without congressional authorization.  Id., at 459 (emphasis added).  Even when a State imposes a taxs legal incidence on a non-Indian seller, the tax may nonetheless be pre-empted if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on the reservation and the imposition of the tax fails to satisfy the Bracker interest-balancing test.  See, e.g., Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona Tax Commn, 448 U. S. 160.  Pp. 45.


(b)The Court rejects the Nations argument that it is entitled to prevail under Chickasaws categorical bar because the fairest reading of the Kansas statute is that the taxs legal incidence actually falls on the Tribe on the reservation.  Under the statute, the taxs incidence is expressly imposed on the distributor that first receives the fuel.  Such dispositive language from the state legislature is determinative of who bears a state excise taxs legal incidence.  Chickasaw, supra, at 461.  Even absent such dispositive language, the Court would nonetheless conclude that the taxs legal incidence is on the distributor because Kansas law makes clear that it is the distributor, not the retailer, that is liable for the tax.  The lower courts and the Kansas agency charged with administering the motor fuel tax reached the same conclusion.  Kaul v. Kansas Dept. of Revenue, 266 Kan. 464, 970 P.2d 60, distinguished.  Pp. 58.


(c)Also rejected is the Nations alternative argument that the Bracker test must be applied irrespective of who bears the Kansas taxs legal incidence because the tax arises as a result of the on-reservation sale and delivery of fuel.  The Nation presented a starkly different, and correct, interpretation of the statute in the Tenth Circuit, arguing that the balancing test is appropriate even though the taxs legal incidence is imposed on the Nations non-Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributors receipt of fuel outside the reservation.  The Nations argument here is rebutted by provisions of the Kansas statute demonstrating that the only taxable event occurs when the distributor first receives the fuel and by a final determination by the State reaching the same conclusion.  The Nations theory that the existence of statutory deductions for certain postreceipt transactions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its ultimate tax liability without knowing whether, where, and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered suffers from several conceptual defects.  For example, availability of the deductions does not change the nature of the taxable event, the distributors receipt of the fuel.  Pp. 812.


2.The Tenth Circuit erred in concluding that the Kansas tax is nevertheless subject to Brackers test.  That test applies only where a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation.  448 U. S., at 144.  It has never been applied where, as here, a state tax imposed on a non-Indian arises from a transaction occurring off the reservation.  The Courts Indian tax immunity cases counsel against such an application.  Pp. 1218. 


(a)Limiting the Bracker test exclusively to on-reservation transactions between a nontribal entity and a tribe or tribal member is consistent with this Courts unique Indian tax immunity jurisprudence, which relies heavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty [giving] state law no role to play within a tribes territorial boundaries, Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Sac and Fox Nation, 508 U. S. 114, 123124.  The Court has taken an altogether different course, by contrast, when a State asserts its taxing authority outside of Indian Country.  E.g., Chickasaw, 515 U. S. 450.  In such cases, [a]bsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to non-discriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State.  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145, 148149.  If a State may apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone beyond the reservations boundaries, it may also apply a nondiscriminatory tax where, as here, the tax is imposed on non-Indians as a result of an off-reservation transaction.  In these circumstances, Bracker is inapplicable.  Cf. Arizona Dept. of Revenue v. Blaze Constr. Co., 526 U. S. 32, 37.  The application of the test here is also inconsistent with the Courts efforts to establish bright line standard[s] in the tax administration context.  Ibid.  The Nation is not entitled to interest balancing by virtue of its claim that the Kansas tax interferes with the Nations own motor fuel tax.  This is ultimately a complaint about the state taxs downstream economic consequences.  The Nation cannot invalidate that tax by complaining about a decrease in its revenues.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 156.  Nor would the Courts analysis change if legal significance were accorded the Nations decision to label a portion of its gas stations revenues as tax proceeds.  See id., at 184, n.9.  Pp. 1217.


(b)This Court rejects the Nations contention that the Kansas tax is invalid notwithstanding the Bracker tests inapplicability because it exempts from taxation fuel sold or delivered to state and federal sovereigns and is therefore impermissibly discriminatory.  The Nation is not similarly situated to the exempted sovereigns.  While Kansas tax pays for roads and bridges on the Nations reservation, including the main highway used by casino patrons, Kansas offers no such services to the several States or the Federal Government.  Moreover, to the extent Kansas retailers bear the taxs cost, that burden applies equally to all retailers within the State regardless of whether they are located on a reservation.  P. 18. 
379 F.3d 979, reversed.

No. 04712.Argued October 11, 2005Decided November 29, 2005
Title 28 U. S.C. 1441 authorizes the removal of civil actions from state court to federal court when the state-court action is one that could have been brought, originally, in federal court.  When federal-court jurisdiction is predicated on the parties diversity of citizenship, see 1332, removal is permissible only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which [the] action [was] brought.  1441(b).


Christophe and Juanita Roche, plaintiffs below, respondents here, leased an apartment in a Virginia complex, Westfield Village, managed by Lincoln Property Company (Lincoln).  The Roches commenced suit in state court against diverse defendants, including Lincoln, asserting serious medical ailments from their exposure to toxic mold in their apartment, and alleging loss, theft, or destruction of personal property left in the care of Lincoln and the mold treatment firm during the remediation process.  The Roches identified themselves as Virginia citizens and defendant Lincoln as a Texas corporation.  Defendants removed the litigation to a Federal District Court, invoking that courts diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  In their consolidated federal-court complaint, the Roches identified themselves and Lincoln just as they did in their state-court complaints.  Lincoln, in its answer, admitted that it managed Westfield Village, and did not seek to avoid liability by asserting that some other entity was responsible for managing the property.  After discovery, the District Court granted defendants motion for summary judgment, but before judgment was entered, the Roches moved to remand the case to state court.  The District Court denied the motion, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding the removal improper on the ground that Lincoln failed to show the nonexistence of an affiliated Virginia entity that was a real party in interest.
 Held:Defendants may remove an action on the basis of diversity of citizenship if there is complete diversity between all named plaintiffs and all named defendants, and no defendant is a citizen of the forum State.  It is not incumbent on the named defendants to negate the existence of a potential defendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.  Pp.613.
(a)The Fourth Circuit correctly identified Lincoln as a proper party, but erred in insisting that some other entity affiliated with Lincoln should have been joined as a codefendant, and that it was Lincolns obligation to name that entity and show that its joinder would not destroy diversity.  This Court stresses, first, that the existence of complete diversity between the Roches and Lincoln is plain and no longer subject to debate.  The Court turns next to the reasons why the Fourth Circuit erred in determining that diversity jurisdiction was not proved by the removing parties.  Since Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, this Court has read the statutory formulation between  citizens of different States, 28 U. S.C. 1332(a)(1), to require complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants.  While 1332 allows plaintiffs to invoke diversity jurisdiction, 1441 gives defendants a corresponding opportunity.  The scales are not evenly balanced, however.  An in-state plaintiff may invoke diversity jurisdiction, but 1441(b) bars removal on the basis of diversity if any part[y] in interest properly joined and served as [a] defendan[t] is a citizen of the State in which [the] action is brought.  In this case, Virginia plaintiffs joined and served no Virginian as a party defendant.  Hence, the action qualified for the removal defendants effected.  Neither Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a), captioned Real Party in Interest, nor Rule 19, captioned Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication, requires plaintiffs or defendants to name and join any additional parties to this action.  Both Rules address party joinder, not federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  The Fourth Circuit and the Roches draw from this Courts decisions a jurisdictional real parties to the controversy rule applicable in diversity cases to complaining and defending parties alike.  But the Court is aware of no decision supporting the burden the Fourth Circuit placed on a properly joined defendant to negate the existence of a potential codefendant whose presence in the action would destroy diversity.  Pp.69.


(b)This Courts decisions employing real party to the controversy terminology bear scant resemblance to the Roches action.  No party here has been improperly or collusively named solely to create federal jurisdiction, see, e.g., 28 U. S.C. 1359, Kramer v. Caribbean Mills, Inc., 394 U. S. 823, 830.  Nor are cases in which actions against a state agency have been regarded as suits against the State itself, see State Highway Commn of Wyo. v. Utah Constr. Co., 278 U. S. 194, 199200, relevant to suits between private parties.  Unlike cases in which a party was named to satisfy state pleading rules, e.g., McNutt ex rel. Leggett, Smith, & Lawrence v. Bland, 2 How. 9, 14, or was joined only as designated performer of a ministerial act, e.g., Walden v. Skinner, 101 U. S. 577, 589, or otherwise had no control of, impact, or stake in the controversy, e.g., Wood v. Davis, 18 How. 467, 469470, Lincoln has a vital interest in this case.  Indeed, Lincoln accepted responsibility, in the event the Roches prevailed on the merits, by admitting that it managed Westfield Village.  In any event, the Fourth Circuit had no warrant in this case to inquire whether some other person might have been joined as an additional or substitute defendant.  Congress, empowered to prescribe the jurisdiction of the federal courts, sometimes has specified that a named partys own citizenship does not determine its diverse status.  But Congress has not directed that a corporation, for diversity purposes, shall be deemed to have acquired the citizenship of all or any of its affiliates.  For cases like the Roches, Congress has provided simply and only that a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business, 1332(c)(1).  The jurisdictional rule governing here is unambiguous and not amenable to judicial enlargement.  Under 1332(c)(1), Lincoln is a citizen of Texas alone, and under 1441(a) and (b), this case was properly removed.  Pp.913.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 04712.Argued October 11, 2005Decided November 29, 2005
Title 28 U. S.C. 1441 authorizes the removal of civil actions from state court to federal court when the state-court action is one that could have been brought, originally, in federal court.

05-101|"MARGARET BRADSHAW, WARDEN v. KENNETH T.
RICHEY
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 05101.Decided November 28, 2005
Per Curiam.

In 1987, respondent Kenneth T. Richey was tried in Ohio for aggravated murder committed in the course of a felony.  Evidence showed that respondent set fire to the apartment of his neighbor, Hope Collins, in an attempt to kill his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend, who were spending the night together in the apartment below.  The intended victims escaped unharmed, but Hope Collins 2-year-old daughter Cynthia died in the fire.  At trial, the State presented evidence of respondents intent to kill his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend, but not of specific intent to kill Cynthia Collins.  The State also offered expert forensic evidence to show that the fire had been started deliberately.  Respondent did not contest this forensic evidence at trial because his retained arson expert had reported that the States evidence conclusively established arson.  Respondent was convicted of aggravated felony murder on a theory of transferred intent and sentenced to death.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, where he was represented by new counsel.


Respondent sought postconviction relief in state court.  The state trial court denied his request for an evidentiary hearing and denied relief on all claims, and the state appellate court affirmed.  Respondent then sought federal habeas relief.  The District Court permitted discovery on certain issues, but ultimately denied all of respondents claims.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to habeas relief on two alternative grounds.  First, that transferred intent was not a permissible theory for aggravated felony murder under Ohio law, and that the evidence of direct intent was constitutionally insufficient to support conviction.  Second, that the performance of respondents trial counsel had been constitutionally deficient under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in his retaining and mishandling of his arson expert and in his inadequate treatment of the States expert testimony.


We now grant the States petition for writ of certiorari and vacate the judgment below.
I

The Sixth Circuit erred in holding that the doctrine of transferred intent was inapplicable to aggravated felony murder for the version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2903.01(B) (Anderson 1982) under which respondent was convicted.  See Richey v. Mitchell, 395 F.3d 660, 675 (2005).  The Ohio Supreme Courts interpretation of that section, as announced in its review of respondents case, directly contradicts the Sixth Circuits analysis:
The fact that the intended victims escaped harm, and that an innocent child, Cynthia Collins, was killed instead, does not alter Richeys legal and moral responsibility.  The doctrine of transferred intent is firmly rooted in Ohio law.  Very simply, the culpability of a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill is not altered by the fact that the scheme is directed at someone other than the actual victim.  State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 364, 595 N.E. 2d 915, 925 (1992) (citations omitted).

This statement was dictum, since the only sufficiency-of-evidence claim raised by respondent pertained to his setting of the fire.  Nonetheless, its explanation of Ohio law was perfectly clear and unambiguous.  We have repeatedly held that a state courts interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 6768 (1991); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975).


The Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Courts opinion should not be read to endorse transferred intent in respondents case because such a construction would likely constitute an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language, Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 352 (1964), in violation of the Due Process Clause.  395 F.3d, at 677 (citing United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259 (1997); Bouie, 378 U. S., at 352).  It is doubtful whether this principle of fair notice has any application to a case of transferred intent, where the defendants contemplated conduct was exactly what the relevant statute forbade, see id., at 351.  And it is further doubtful whether the doctrine of constitutional doubt permits such a flatly countertextual interpretation of what the Ohio Supreme Court said, see Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52, 5960 (1997).  But assuming all that, Ohio law at the time of respondents offense provided fully adequate notice of the applicability of transferred intent.  The relevant mens rea provision in 2903.01(D) required only that [n]o person shall be convicted of aggravated murder unless he is specifically found to have intended to cause the death of another.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2903.01(D) (Anderson 1982) (emphasis added).  Respondents intention to kill his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend plainly came within this provision.  There was no reason to read another (countertextually) as meaning only the actual victim, since the doctrine of transferred intent was firmly rooted in Ohio law.  State v. Sowell, 39 Ohio St.3d 322, 332, 530 N.E. 2d 1294, 1305 (1988) (citing Wareham v. State, 25 Ohio St. 601 (1874)).  Respondent could not plausibly claim unfair surprise that the doctrine applied in his case.  See Lanier, supra, at 269270 (requiring, as adequate notice for due process purposes, only reasonable warning, rather than fundamentally similar prior cases).


The foregoing provision was in effect at the time of respondents crime in 1986.  The Sixth Circuit reasoned, however, that the following subsequent clause in the version of 2903.01(D) that existed in 1986 foreclosed transferred intent in this case:
If a jury in an aggravated murder case is instructed that a person who commits or attempts to commit any offense listed in division (B) of this section may be inferred, because he engaged in a common design with others to commit the offense by force or violence or because the offense and the manner of its commission would be likely to produce death, to have intended to cause the death of any person who is killed during the commission of  the offense, the jury also shall be instructed that  it is to consider all evidence introduced by the prosecution to indicate the persons intent and by the person to indicate his lack of intent in determining whether the person specifically intended to cause the death of the person killed.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2903.01(D) (Anderson 1982) (emphases added).

Contrary to the Sixth Circuits reading, see 395 F.3d, at 673, this clause by its terms did not apply to every case in which the defendant was charged with aggravated felony murder, but rather only to those in which intent to kill was sought to be proved from the inherent dangerousness of the relevant felony.  See State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio St. 3d 72, 100, 656 N.E. 2d 643, 668 (1995) (R.C. 2903.01(D) does not apply in this case because the trial court never instructed that the jury could infer purpose to kill from the commission of an underlying felony in a manner likely to produce death).  Here, however, intent to kill was proved directly.  It was not inferred from the dangerousness of the arson; it was shown to be the purpose of the arson.


The Sixth Circuit also argued that dicta in a case decided by an intermediate Ohio appellate court, prior to the Ohio Supreme Courts opinion here, rejected transferred intent for respondents crime, and thus rendered its application in respondents case unforeseeable and retroactive.  395 F.3d, at 675676 (citing State v. Mullins, 76 Ohio App.3d 633, 602 N.E. 2d 769 (1992)).  But that case was decided long after the 1986 offense for which respondent was convicted, and thus has no bearing on whether the law at the time of the charged conduct was clear enough to provide fair notice.  Lanier, supra; see also Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 196 (1977).


Because the Sixth Circuit disregarded the Ohio Supreme Courts authoritative interpretation of Ohio law, its ruling on sufficiency of the evidence was erroneous.
II

The Sixth Circuit also held that respondent was entitled to relief on the ground that the state courts denial of his Strickland claim was unreasonable.  395 F.3d, at 688.  As petitioner contends, the Sixth Circuit erred in its adjudication of this claim by relying on evidence that was not properly presented to the state habeas courts without first determining (1) whether respondent was at fault for failing to develop the factual bases for his claims in state court, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 430432 (2000), or (2) whether respondent satisfied the criteria established by 28 U. S.C. 2254(e)(2).  See Holland v. Jackson, 452 U. S. 649, (2004) (per curiam).  Similarly, the Sixth Circuit erred by disregarding the state habeas courts conclusion that the forensic expert whom respondents trial counsel hired was a properly qualified expert, App. to Pet. for Cert. 347a, without analyzing whether the state courts factual finding had been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.  See 28 U. S.C. 2254(e)(1).  Compare App. to Pet. for Cert., 347a, with 395 F.3d, at 683.  In addition, as petitioner contends, the Sixth Circuit erred in relying on certain grounds that were apparent from the trial record but not raised on direct appealnamely that trial counsel (1) inadequately cross-examined experts called by the State, (2) erred by prematurely placing the forensic expert counsel had hired on the witness list, and (3) failed to present competing scientific evidence against the States forensic expertswithout first determining whether respondents procedural default of these subclaims could be excused by a showing of cause and prejudice or by the need to avoid a miscarriage of justice.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 340a341a, 351a354a (state courts holding that these subclaims should have been raised on direct appeal); id., at 109a110a (District Courts holding that this default was not excusable under Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 749750 (1991)).  Respondent, however, contends that the State failed to preserve its objection to the Sixth Circuits reliance on evidence not presented in state court by failing to raise this argument properly before the Sixth Circuit.  See Brief in Opposition 2426.  Because the relevant errors had not yet occurred, the Sixth Circuit has had no opportunity to address the argument that the State failed to preserve its Holland argument.  It is better situated to address this argument in the first instance.
***

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

To ensure disabled children a free appropriate public education, 20 U. S.C.A. 1400(d)(1)(A), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act) requires school districts to create an individualized education program (IEP) for each disabled child, 1414(d), and authorizes parents challenging their childs IEP to request an impartial due process hearing, 1415(f), but does not specify which party bears the burden of persuasion at that hearing.  After an IDEA hearing initiated by petitioners, the Administrative Law Judge held that they bore the burden of persuasion and ruled in favor of respondents.  The District Court reversed, concluding that the burden of persuasion is on the school district.  The Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court, concluding that petitioners had offered no persuasive reason to depart from the normal rule of allocating the burden to the party seeking relief.  
Held:The burden of persuasion in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking relief, whether that is the disabled child or the school district.  Pp.612.
(a)Because IDEA is silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion, this Court begins with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the burden regarding the essential aspects of their claims.  Although the ordinary rule admits  of exceptions, decisions that place the entire burden of persuasion on the opposing party at the outset of a proceedingas petitioners urge the Court to do hereare extremely rare.  Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, the Court will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.  Pp.68.


(b)Petitioners arguments for departing from the ordinary default rule are rejected.  Petitioners assertion that putting the burden of persuasion on school districts will help ensure that children receive a free appropriate public education is unavailing.  Assigning the burden to schools might encourage them to put more resources into preparing IEPs and presenting their evidence, but IDEA is silent about whether marginal dollars should be allocated to litigation and administrative expenditures or to educational services.  There is reason to believe that a great deal is already spent on IDEA administration, and Congress has repeatedly amended the Act to reduce its administrative and litigation-related costs.  The Act also does not support petitioners conclusion, in effect, that every IEP should be assumed to be invalid until the school district demonstrates that it is not.  Petitioners most plausible argumentthat ordinary fairness requires that a litigant not have the burden of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary, United States v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., 355 U.

Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor shortly thereafter concluded that the Act did not affect the computation of hours within a workday, 29 CFR 790.6(a), which includes the period between the commencement and completion of the principal activity or activities, 790.6(b).  Eight years after the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act and these interpretative regulations, the Court explained that the term principal activity or activities  embraces all activities which are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities, including the donning and doffing of specialized protective gear before or after the regular work shift, on or off the production line.  Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247, 256.


In No. 031238, respondent employees filed a class action seeking compensation for time spent donning and doffing required protective gear and walking from the locker rooms to the production floor of a meat processing facility owned by petitioner IBP, Inc. (IBP), and back.  The District Court found the activities compensable, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In No. 0466, petitioner employees sought compensation for time spent donning and doffing required protective gear at a poultry processing plant operated by respondent Barber Foods, Inc. (Barber), as well as the attendant walking and waiting times.  Barber prevailed on the walking and waiting claims.  On appeal, the First Circuit found those times preliminary and postliminary activities excluded from FLSA coverage by 4(a)(1) and (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.
Held:
1.The time respondents in No. 031238 spend walking between changing and production areas is compensable under the FLSA.  Pp.715.


(a)Section 4(a)(1)s text does not exclude such time from the FLSAs scope.  IBP claims that, because donning is not the principal activity that starts the workday, walking occurring immediately after donning and immediately before doffing is not compensable.  That argument, which in effect asks for a third category of activitiesthose that are integral and indispensable to a principal activity and thus not excluded from coverage by 4(a)(2), but are not themselves principal activities as defined by 4(a)(1)is foreclosed by Steiner, which made clear that 4 does not remove activities that are integral and indispensable to principal activities from FLSA coverage precisely because such activities are themselves principal activities.  350 U. S., at 253.  There is no plausible argument that these terms mean different things in 4(a)(2) and in 4(a)(1).  Under the normal rule of statutory interpretation, identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning; and in 4(a)(2)s reference to said principal activity or activities, said is an explicit reference to the use of the identical term in 4(a)(1).  Pp.1012.


(b)Also unpersuasive is IBPs argument that Congress repudiation of the Anderson holding reflects a purpose to exclude the walking time at issue.  That time, which occurs after the workday begins and before it ends, is more comparable to time spent walking between two different positions on an assembly line than to the walking in Anderson, which occurred before the workday began.  Pp.1213.


(c)The relevant regulations also support this view of walking.  Contrary to IBPs claim, 29 CFR 790.6 does not strictly define the workdays limits as the period from whistle to whistle. And 790.7(g), n. 49, which provides that postdonning walking time is not necessarily excluded from 4(a)(1)s scope, does not mean that such time is always excluded and is insufficient to overcome clear statements in the regulations text that support the holding here.  Pp.1315.


2.Because donning and doffing gear that is integral and indispensable to employees work is a principal activity under the statute, the continuous workday rule mandates that the time the No. 0466 petitioners spend walking to and from the production floor after donning and before doffing, as well as the time spent waiting to doff, are not affected by the Portal-to-Portal Act, and are instead covered by the FLSA.  Pp.1517.


3.However, 4(a)(2) excludes from the FLSAs scope the time employees spend waiting to don the first piece of gear that marks the beginning of the continuous workday.  Such waitingwhich is two steps removed from the productive activity on the assembly linecomfortably qualifies as a preliminary activity.  The fact that certain preshift activities are necessary for employees to engage in their principal activities does not mean that those preshift activities are integral and indispensable to a principal activity under Steiner.  No limiting principle allows this Court to conclude that the waiting time here is such an activity without also leading to the logical (but untenable) conclusion that the walking time in Anderson would also be a principal activity unaffected by the Portal-to-Portal Act.  Title 29 CFR 790.7(h) does not support a contrary view.  Pp.1719.
No. 031238, 339 F.3d 894, affirmed; No. 0466, 360 F.3d 274, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

No. 031238.Argued October 3, 2005Decided November 8, 2005
After this Court ruled that the term workweek in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) included the time employees spent walking from time clocks near a factory entrance to their workstations, Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U. S. 680, 691692, Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, which, inter alia, excepted from FLSA coverage walking on the employers premises to and from the location of the employees principal activity or activities, 4(a)(1), and activities that are preliminary or postliminary to said principal activity or activities, 4(a)(2).  The Act did not otherwise change this Courts descriptions of work and workweek or define workday.

No. 04759.Argued October 12, 2005Decided November 8, 2005
Claiming that federal mine inspectors negligence helped cause a mine accident, two injured workers (and a spouse) sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act), which authorizes private tort actions against the Government under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, 28 U. S.C. 1346(b)(1).  The District Court dismissed in part on the ground that the allegations did not show that Arizona law would impose liability upon a private person in similar circumstances.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning from two premises: (1) Where unique governmental functions are at issue, the Act waives sovereign immunity if a state or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred, and (2) federal mine inspections are such unique governmental functions since there is no private-sector analogue for mine inspections.  Because Arizona law would make a state or municipal entity liable in the circumstances alleged, the Circuit concluded that the United States sovereign immunity was waived.
Held:Under 1346(b)(1), the United States waives sovereign immunity only where local law would make a private person liable in tort, not where local law would make a state or municipal entity liable.  Pp.25.
(a)The Ninth Circuits first premise is too broad, reading into the Act something that is not there.  Section 1346(b)(1) says that it waives sovereign immunity under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, not the United States, if a state or municipal entity, would be liable.  (Emphasis added.)  This Court has consistently adhered to this private person standard, even when uniquely governmental functions are at issue.  Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 61, 64; Rayonier Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S. 315, 318.  Even though both these cases involved Government efforts to escape liability by pointing to the absence of municipal entity liability, there is no reason for treating differently a plaintiffs effort to base liability solely upon the fact that a State would impose liability upon a state governmental entity.  Nothing in the Acts context, history, or objectives or in this Courts opinions suggests otherwise.  Pp.23.


(b)The Ninth Circuits second premise reads the Act too narrowly.  Section 2674 makes the United States liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.  (Emphasis added.)  The words like circumstances do not restrict a court's inquiry to the same circumstances, but require it to look further afield.  See, e.g., Indian Towing, supra, at 64.  The Government in effect concedes, and other Courts of Appeals decisions applying Indian Towings logic suggest, that private person analogies exist for the federal mine inspectors conduct at issue.  The Ninth Circuit should have looked for a such an analogy.  Pp.34.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 041538.Decided October 31, 2005
Per Curiam.

Respondent Garcia Espitia, a criminal defendant who chose to proceed pro se, was convicted in California state court of carjacking and other offenses.  He had received no law library access while in jail before trialdespite his repeated requests and court orders to the contraryand only about four hours of access during trial, just before closing arguments.  (Of course, he had declined, as was his right, to be represented by a lawyer with unlimited access to legal materials.)  The California courts rejected his argument that his restricted library access violated his Sixth Amendment rights.  Once his sentence became final, he petitioned in Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.C. 2254.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the lack of any pretrial access to lawbooks violated Espitias constitutional right to represent himself as established by the Supreme Court in Faretta [v. California, 422 U. S. 806 (1975)].  Garcia Espitia v. Ortiz, 113 Fed. Appx. 802, 804 (2004).  The wardens petition for certiorari and respondents motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment below reversed, and the case remanded.


A necessary condition for federal habeas relief here is that the state courts decision be contrary to, or involv[e] an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  Neither the opinion below, nor any of the appellate cases it relies on, identifies a source in our case law for the law library access right other than Faretta.  See 113 Fed. Appx., at 804 (relying on Bribiesca v. Galaza, 215 F.3d 1015, 1020 (CA9 2000) (quoting Milton v. Morris, 767 F.2d 1443, 1446 (CA9 1985)); ibid. (Faretta controls this case).


The federal appellate courts have split on whether Faretta, which establishes a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, implies a right of the pro se defendant to have access to a law library.  Compare Milton, supra, with United States v. Smith, 907 F.2d 42, 45 (CA6 1990) ([B]y knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to counsel, the appellant also relinquished his access to a law library); United States ex rel. George v. Lane, 718 F.2d 226, 231 (CA7 1983) (similar).  That question cannot be resolved here, however, as it is clear that Faretta does not, as 2254(d)(1) requires, clearly establis[h] the law library access right.  In fact, Faretta says nothing about any specific legal aid that the State owes a pro se criminal defendant.  The Bribiesca court and the court below therefore erred in holding, based on Faretta, that a violation of a law library access right is a basis for federal habeas relief.


The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

04-9949|"IVAN EBERHART v. UNITED STATES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 049949.Decided October 31, 2005 
Per Curiam.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) allows a district court to vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.  But [a]ny motion for a new trial grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within 7 days after the verdict or finding of guilty, or within such further time as the court sets during the 7-day period.  Rule 33(b)(2).  This deadline is rigid.  The Rules provide that courts may not extend the time to take any action under [Rule 33], except as stated in Rule 33 itself.  Rule 45(b)(2).  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has construed Rule 33s time limitations as jurisdictional, permitting the Government to raise noncompliance with those limitations for the first time on appeal.  388 F.3d 1043, 1049 (2004).  However, there is a critical difference between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule.  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004).  Rule 33 is an example of the latter.  We grant the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.
I

Petitioner Ivan Eberhart was convicted of one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine.  On the last day available for post-trial motions, he moved for judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial.  That motion raised a single ground for reliefan alleged flaw in a transcript that had been published to the jury.  Nearly six months later, petitioner filed a supplemental memorandum supporting his motion.  Two additional grounds appeared in that filingadmission of potential hearsay testimony into evidence, and the District Courts failure to give a so-called buyer-seller instruction to the jury.  388 F.3d, at 10471048.  Rather than arguing, however, that the untimeliness of the supplemental memorandum barred the District Court from considering the issues it raised, the Government opposed it on the merits.
The District Court granted the motion for a new trial, citing all three grounds raised by petitioner.  The judge concluded that none of these concerns standing alone or in pairing would cause me to grant a new trial, but that taken together, they persuade me that the interests of justice require a new trial.  Id., at 1048.  The judge also predicted that a new trial will quite likely lead to another conviction.  Ibid.


On appeal, the Government pointed to the untimeliness of petitioners supplemental memorandum, and argued that the District Court had abused its discretion in granting a new trial based on the arguments that the memorandum had raised.  The Court of Appeals reversed the grant of a new trial, finding that the District Court had lacked jurisdiction to grant one.  The Seventh Circuit observed, The Supreme Court has held that Rule 45(b)s prohibition on extensions of time is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Id., at 1049 (quoting United States v. Robinson, 361 U. S. 220, 229 (1960), and citing United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469, 474, n. 2 (1947)).  Based on Robinson and Smith, the Seventh Circuit explained, [w]e have previously emphasized that [Rule 33s] 7-day period is jurisdictional, and that the court is without jurisdiction to consider even an amendment to a timely new trial motion if it is filed outside the seven day period, absent a timely extension by the court or new evidence.  388 F.3d, at 1049 (quoting United States v. Washington, 184 F.3d 653, 659 (CA7 1999)).


The Court of Appeals did, however, express some misgiving.  After describing the holding of Kontrick, it commented that [t]he reasoning of Kontrick may suggest that Rule 33s time limits are merely inflexible claim-processing rules that could be forfeited if not timely asserted.  388 F.3d, at 1049.  It concluded, however, that even if Kontrick had undermined Robinson and Smith, we are bound to follow them until expressly overruled by the Supreme Court.  388 F.3d, at 1049 (citing Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 237 (1997)).
II

In Kontrick, we determined that defenses made available by the time limitations of Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 and 9006 may be forfeited.  540 U. S., at 458460.  They are not jurisdiction[al], but are instead claim-processing rules, that may be unalterable on a partys application but can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.  Id., at 456.  In Kontrick, the debtor responded on the merits to a creditors untimely objection to his discharge.  He did not raise the untimeliness issue, and the court resolved the merits in favor of the creditor.  On motion for reconsideration and on appeal, the debtor raised the argument that Rules 4004 and 9006 have the same import as provisions governing subject-matter jurisdiction.  Id., at 455.  We rejected this assertion and found that the debtor had forfeited the timeliness argument.
The Rules we construed in Kontrick closely parallel those at issue here.  Like a defendant wishing to move for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, a creditor wishing to object to a debtors discharge in Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings has a set period of time to file with the court (measured, in the latter context, from the first date set for the meeting of creditors). Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(a).  If a creditor so moves, the court may for cause extend the time to file a complaint objecting to discharge.  Rule 4004(b).  And using language almost identical to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b)(2)s admonition that [t]he court may not extend the time to take any action under Rules 29, 33, 34, and 35, except as stated in those rules, Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(3) states that [t]he court may enlarge the time for taking action under Rules 1006(b)(2), 1017(e), 3002(c), 4003(b), 4004(a), 4007(c), 8002, and 9033, only to the extent and under the conditions stated in those rules.


It is implausible that the Rules considered in Kontrick can be nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules, while virtually identical provisions of the Rules of Criminal Procedure can deprive federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Nothing in Rules 33 or 45 or our cases requires such a dissonance.  Moreover, our most recent decisions have attempted to brush away confusion introduced by our earlier opinions.  Clarity would be facilitated, we have said, if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a courts adjudicatory authority.  Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 455.  We break no new ground in firmly classifying Rules 33 and 45 as claim-processing rules, despite the confusion generated by the less than meticulous uses of the term jurisdictional in our earlier cases.  Id., at 454.


The Seventh Circuit correctly identified our decisions in Smith and Robinson as the source of the confusion.  388 F.3d, at 1049.  Since we have not expressly overruled them, it held, petitioners appeal had to be dismissed.  Ibid.  Those cases, however, do not hold the limits of the Rules to be jurisdictional in the proper sense that Kontrick describes.  See 540 U. S., at 455.  We need not overrule Robinson or Smith to characterize Rules 33 and 45 as claim-processing rules.


In Smith, the District Judge rejected a Rule 33 motion for new trial, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal.  331 U. S., at 470.  After the defendant was taken into custody, the District Judge changed his mind.  Purporting to act under the authority of Rule 33, he issued an order vacating his earlier judgment and granting a new trial.  Id., at 471.  Although we observed in a footnote that [t]he policy of the Rules was not to extend power indefinitely but to confine it within constant time periods, id., at 473474, n.2, that observation hardly transforms the Rules into the keys to the kingdom of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Rather, as we emphasized in the text, the District Judge could not use Rule 33 to sidestep a pre-existing basic principle of judicial processthat once a final judgment is issued and the court of appeals considers a case, a district court has no power to act on it further.  This was a consequence, however, not of the Rule, but of the Rules failure to alter prior law.  Smith does not address the effect of untimely arguments in support of a motion for new trial when, as here, the district court is still considering post-trial motions and the case has not yet been appealed.


Nor does Robinson address that circumstance.  Defendants were 11 days late in filing their notices of appeal under (what was then) Rule 37.  The Government responded not by contesting the merits of the appeal, but by moving to dismiss on the basis of untimeliness.  361 U. S., at 221.  The Court of Appeals determined that if the District Court found that the untimely notices of appeal sprang from excusable neglect, it could allow the appeals.  On remand, the District Court so found.  Id., at 222.  We held that the Court of Appeals was wrong in having failed to dismiss under Rule 45(b).  Id., at 229230.  Robinson is correct not because the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, but because district courts must observe the clear limits of the Rules of Criminal Procedure when they are properly invoked.  This does not mean that limits like those in Rule 33 are not forfeitable when they are not properly invoked.  Despite its narrow and unremarkable holding, Robinson has created some confusion because of its observation that courts have uniformly held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Id., at 229 (emphasis added).  Indeed, we used the phrase mandatory and jurisdictional four times in the opinion.  And subsequent opinions have repeated this phrase, attributing it directly or indirectly to Robinson.  See, e.g., Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 247 (1998); Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U. S. 196, 203 (1988); Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (1982) (per curiam); Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 264, 271272 (1978).  But see Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 269 (1988) (reversing an order dismissing an appeal as jurisdictionally out of time when [n]either the District Court nor respondent suggested that the notice of appeal might be untimely); Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384, 386 (1964) (per curiam) (permitting appeal, when petitioner conceded that post-trial motions were served late, in part because petitioner relied on the Governments failure to raise a claim of untimeliness when the motions were filed).


As we recognized in Kontrick, courts have more than occasionally used the term jurisdictional to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court.  540 U. S., at 454.  See also ibid. (citing Robinson as an example of when we have been less than meticulous in our use of the word jurisdictional).  The resulting imprecision has obscured the central point of the Robinson casethat when the Government objected to a filing untimely under Rule 37, the courts duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.  The net effect of Robinson, viewed through the clarifying lens of Kontrick, is to admonish the Government that failure to object to untimely submissions entails forfeiture of the objection, and to admonish defendants that timeliness is of the essence, since the Government is unlikely to miss timeliness defects very often.


Our more recent cases have done much to clarify this point.  For instance, in Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416 (1996), we held that a court may not grant a postverdict motion for a judgment of acquittal that is untimely under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) when the prosecutor objects.  As we pointedly noted in Kontrick, our holding in Carlisle did not characterize [Rule 29] as jurisdictional. 540 U. S.em>., at 454455.  See also Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413414 (2004) (relying on Kontrick to hold that time limitations on applications for attorneys fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U. S.C. 2412(d)(1), did not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction).


After Kontrick, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that Rule 33 motions are similarly nonjurisdictional.  By its terms, Rule 45(b)(2) has precisely the same effect on extensions of time under Rule 29 as it does under Rule 33, and as we noted in Kontrick, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) and Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) are both modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b).  540 U. S., at 456, n.10.  Rule 33, like Rule 29 and Bankruptcy Rule 4004, is a claim-processing ruleone that is admittedly inflexible because of Rule 45(b)s insistent demand for a definite end to proceedings.  These claim-processing rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them, but do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.  Here, where the Government failed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the District Court had reached the merits, it forfeited that defense.  The Court of Appeals should therefore have proceeded to the merits.


We finally add a word about the approach taken by the Court of Appeals.  Although we find its disposition to have been in error, we fully appreciate that it is an error shared among the circuits, and that it was caused in large part by imprecision in our prior cases. Our repetition of the phrase mandatory and jurisdictional has understandably led the lower courts to err on the side of caution by giving the limitations in Rules 33 and 45 the force of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Convinced, therefore, that Robinson and Smith governed this case, the Seventh Circuit felt bound to apply them, even though it expressed grave doubts in light of Kontrick.  This was a prudent course.  It neither forced the issue by upsetting what the Court of Appeals took to be our settled precedents, nor buried the issue by proceeding in a summary fashion.  By adhering to its understanding of precedent, yet plainly expressing its doubts, it facilitated our review.
***

The judgment of the Seventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

04-1475|"DORA B. SCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS v.
ROBERT DOUGLAS SMITH
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 041475.Decided October 17, 2005 
Per Curiam.

In 1982, an Arizona jury convicted respondent Robert Douglas Smith of first-degree murder, kidnaping, and sexual assault.  He was sentenced to death.  The convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and Smiths state petitions for postconviction relief proved unsuccessful.  Smith then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.  In none of these proceedings did Smith argue that he was mentally retarded or that his mental retardation made him ineligible for the death penalty.  Smith had, however, presented evidence in mitigation during the sentencing phase of his trial showing that he had low intelligence.


The District Court denied Smiths petition for habeas corpus in 1996.  Following several rounds of appeals, remands, and petitions for certiorari to this Court (including one successful petition by the State, see Stewart v. Smith, 536 U. S. 856 (2002) (per curiam)), and after we had issued our decision in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), the case returned to the Ninth Circuit.  Shortly thereafter, Smith asserted in briefing that he is mentally retarded and cannot, under Atkins, be executed.  The Ninth Circuit ordered suspension of all federal habeas proceedings and directed Smith to institute proceedings in the proper trial court of Arizona to determine whether the state is prohibited from executing [Smith] in accordance with Atkins.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2.  The court further ordered that the issue whether Smith is mentally retarded must be determined  by a jury trial unless the right to a jury is waived by the parties.  Ibid.


The States petition for certiorari is granted,* the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacated, and the case remanded.  The Ninth Circuit erred in commanding the Arizona courts to conduct a jury trial to resolve Smiths mental retardation claim.  Atkins stated in clear terms that we leave to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their] execution of sentences. 536 U. S., at 317 (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 416-17 (1986); modifications in original).  States, including Arizona, have responded to that challenge by adopting their own measures for adjudicating claims of mental retardation.  While those measures might, in their application, be subject to constitutional challenge, Arizona had not even had a chance to apply its chosen procedures when the Ninth Circuit preemptively imposed its jury trial condition.


Because the Court of Appeals exceeded its limited authority on habeas review, the judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
*Smiths motion to proceed in forma pauperis is also granted.

04-8384|"PAUL ALLEN DYE v. GERALD HOFBAUER, WARDEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 048384.Decided October 11, 2005
Per Curiam.

Tried by a jury for the third time, petitioner Paul Allen Dye was convicted in the Recorders Court in Detroit, Michigan, on two counts of murder and one count of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony.  His defense in each of his three trials was that the crimes were committed by one of the prosecutions key witnesses, who was present at the scene of the crime.


The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the convictions on direct review, People v. Dye, No. 136707 (Nov. 28, 1995) (per curiam), App. to Pet. for Cert. 109, and further review was denied by the Supreme Court of Michigan, People v. Dye, 453 Mich. 852, 551 N.W. 2d 189 (1996).  Petitioner sought relief in habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging various federal constitutional claims.  Denied relief, petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.


Over the next five years, the Court of Appeals issued various orders and two opinions in the case.  45 Fed. Appx. 428 (CA6 2002) (Dye I); 111 Fed. Appx. 363 (CA6 2004) (Dye II).  In Dye I, a majority of a divided three-judge panel ruled the state prosecutor had engaged in flagrant misconduct during the jury trial.  On this ground it reversed the District Courts order denying habeas relief.  The panel did not address petitioners other claims.  45 Fed. Appx., at 428, n.1.


Respondent moved for panel or en banc rehearing.  In the time between this motion and its disposition, one of the judges in the majority retired, and the record was returned to the District Court.


In Dye II, a reconstituted panel granted the petition for rehearing and ruled in favor of respondent.  In an opinion authored by the original panels dissenting judge the Court of Appeals held that, although Dye had raised a prosecutorial misconduct claim in state court, the record did not show that he presented it there as a violation of a federal right.  Because the brief filed by the petitioner in his direct appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is not in the record, we have no way of determining exactly how he framed the issue in state court.  111 Fed. Appx., at 364.  As further support for its conclusion, the panel noted the Michigan Court of Appeals decision analyzed the relevant claim only in terms of state law.  The panel concluded, moreover, it would decline to address the claim even if Dye had properly raised it in state court because the federal habeas corpus petitions allegations were too vague and general to be considered fairly presented.  Ibid.  Stating that its previous opinion, Dye I, had disposed of any remaining claims, the Dye II panel vacated the prior judgment and affirmed the District Courts denial of the habeas corpus petition.


Dye seeks review here.  There are two errors in Dye II meriting reversal of the judgment.


First, the Court of Appeals was incorrect in Dye II to conclude that, when seeking review in the state appellate court, the petitioner failed to raise the federal claim based on prosecutorial misconduct.  The Court of Appeals examined the opinion of the state appellate court and noted that it made no mention of a federal claim.  That, however, is not dispositive.  Failure of a state appellate court to mention a federal claim does not mean the claim was not presented to it.  It is too obvious to merit extended discussion that whether the exhaustion requirement  has been satisfied cannot turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely raised in petitioners brief in the state court.  Smith v. Digmon, 434 U. S. 332, 333 (1978) (per curiam).


Contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals, the District Court record contains the brief petitioner filed in state court, and the brief sets out the federal claim.  The fourth argument heading in his brief before the Michigan Court of Appeals states: THE PROSECUTOR DENIED DEFENDANT DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND A FAIR TRIAL BY NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT. App. to Pet. for Cert. 80 (capitalization in original).  Outlining specific allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, the text of the brief under this argument heading cites the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.  It further cites the following federal cases, all of which concern alleged violations of federal due process rights in the context of prosecutorial misconduct: Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637 (1974); Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78 (1935); United States v. Valentine, 820 F.2d 565 (CA2 1987); United States v. Burse, 531 F.2d 1151 (CA2 1976).


This is not an instance where the habeas petitioner failed to apprise the state court of his claim that the  ruling of which he complained was not only a violation of state law, but denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364, 366 (1995) (per curiam).  Nor is this a case where a state court needed to look beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) to be aware of the federal claim.  Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 32 (2004).  The state-court brief was clear that the prosecutorial misconduct claim was based, at least in part, on a federal right.  It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude otherwise.


A second reason the Dye II panel denied relief was that the habeas petition filed in the United States District Court presented the prosecutorial misconduct claim in too vague and general a form.  This alternative holding cannot rescue the Dye II judgment, for it, too, is incorrect.  The habeas corpus petition made clear and repeated references to an appended supporting brief, which presented Dyes federal claim with more than sufficient particularity.  See Fed Rules Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2), 10(c).  As the prosecutorial misconduct claim was presented properly, it, and any other federal claims properly presented, should be addressed by the Court of Appeals on remand.


The motion to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

03-1500|"VAN ORDEN v. PERRY, in his official capacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN, STATE PRESERVATION BOARD, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 031500.Argued March 2, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Among the 21 historical markers and 17 monuments surrounding the Texas State Capitol is a 6-foot-high monolith inscribed with the Ten Commandments.  The legislative record illustrates that, after accepting the monument from the Fraternal Order of Eaglesa national social, civic, and patriotic organizationthe State selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state organization that maintains the capitol grounds.  Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U. S.C. 1983 suit seeking a declaration that the monuments placement violates the First Amendments Establishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal.  Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a reasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State endorsed religion.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
351 F.3d 173, affirmed.
The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Establishment Clause allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds.  Reconciling the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nations history, see School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 212213, with the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom requires that the Court neither abdicate its responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion, e.g., Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313314.  While the Court has sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, for the governing test, Lemon is not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its capitol grounds.  Instead, the analysis should be driven by both the monuments nature and the Nations history.  From at least 1789, there has been an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of religions role in American life.  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 674.  Texas display of the Commandments on government property is typical of such acknowledgments.  Representations of the Commandments appear throughout this Court and its grounds, as well as the Nations Capital.  Moreover, the Courts opinions, like its building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in Americas heritage.  See, e.g., McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 442, 462.  While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning.  Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.  See, e.g., Lynch v. Donnelly, supra, at 680, 687.  There are, of course, limits to the governments display of religious messages or symbols.  For example, this Court held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom.  Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, 4142.  However, neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stones holding would extend beyond the context of public schools to a legislative chamber, see Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, or to capitol grounds.  Texas placement of the Commandments monument on its capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted elementary school students every day.  Indeed, petitioner here apparently walked by the monument for years before bringing this suit.  Schempp, supra, and Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, distinguished.  Texas has treated her capitol grounds monuments as representing several strands in the States political and legal history.  The inclusion of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.312. 


Justice Breyer concluded that this is a difficult borderline case where none of the Courts various tests for evaluating Establishment Clause questions can substitute for the exercise of legal judgment.  See, e.g., School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  That judgment is not a personal judgment.  Rather, as in all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to the underlying purposes of the First Amendments Religion Clausesto assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, to avoid the religious divisiveness that promotes social conflict, and to maintain the separation of church and state.  No exact formula can dictate a resolution to fact-intensive cases such as this.  Despite the Commandments religious message, an inquiry into the context in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also convey a secular moral message about proper standards of social conduct and a message about the historic relation between those standards and the law.  The circumstances surrounding the monuments placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments text as used on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message.  The determinative factor here, however, is that 40 years passed in which the monuments presence, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner).  Those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their belief systems, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to establish religion.  See ibid.  The public visiting the capitol grounds is more likely to have considered the religious aspect of the tablets message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.  For these reasons, the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line.  Pp.18. 
Rehnquist, C.J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., and Thomas, J., filed concurring opinions.  Breyer, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, J., joined.  OConnor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

03-1693|"McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, etal. v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 031693.Argued March 2, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) etal., sued under 42 U. S.C. 1983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that they violated the First Amendments Establishment Clause.  The Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentuckys precedent legal code.  The resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position, including the state legislatures acknowledgment of Christ as the Prince of Ethics.  The displays around the Commandments were modified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing religious references as their sole common element, e.g., the Declaration of Independences endowed by their Creator passage.  Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court followed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, test to find, inter alia, that the original display lacked any secular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious document, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational documents to those specifically referring to Christianity.  After changing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again.  No new resolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded the second one.  The new posting, entitled The Foundations of American Law and Government Display, consists of nine framed documents of equal size.  One sets out the Commandments explicitly identified as the King James Version, quotes them at greater length, and explains that they have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and this Nation.  With the Commandments are framed copies of, e.g., the Star Spangled Banners lyrics and the Declaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their historical and legal significance.  On the ACLUs motion, the District Court included this third display in the injunction despite the Counties professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government and to educate County citizens as to the documents.  The court took proclaiming the Commandments foundational value as a religious, rather than secular, purpose under Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, and found that the Counties asserted educational goals crumbled upon an examination of this litigations history.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under Stone, displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated with a secular message.  The court saw no integration here because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection between the Commandments and the other documents.  
Held: 
1.A determination of the Counties purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complaints.  The Counties objective may be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry.  Pp.1019.


(a)Lemons secular legislative purpose enquiry, 403 U. S., at 612, has been a common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of this Courts cases, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 75.  When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates the central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the governments ostensible object is to take sides.  Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 335.  A purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion generally, clashes with the understanding  that liberty and social stability demand a  tolerance that respects the religious views of all citizens.  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 718.  Pp.1112.


(b)The Court declines the Counties request to abandon Lemons purpose test.  Their assertions that true purpose is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent, are as seismic as they are unconvincing.  Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation for every American appellate court, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 600, and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitutional doctrine, e.g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229.  Scrutinizing purpose makes practical sense in Establishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily discoverable fact set forth in a statutes text, legislative history, and implementation or comparable official act.  Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S., at 7374.  Nor is there any indication that the purpose enquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose dominant every time a case is filed.  Pp.1215.


(c)The Court also avoids the Counties alternative tack of trivializing the purpose enquiry.  They would read the Courts cases as if the enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually had on the significance of current circumstances.  There is no precedent for these arguments, or reason supporting them.  Pp.1519.


(1)A legislatures stated reasons will generally warrant the deference owed in the first instance to such official claims, but Lemon requires the secular purpose to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective, see, e.g., SantaFe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 308.  In those unusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising results have been findings of no adequate secular object, as against a predominantly religious one.  See, e.g., Stone, supra, at 41.  Pp.1517.


(2)The Counties argument that purpose in a case like this should be inferred only from the latest in a series of governmental actions, however close they may all be in time and subject, bucks common sense.  Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and the Courts precedents sensibly forbid an observer to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose.  SantaFe, supra, at 315.  Pp.1719.


2.Evaluation of the Counties claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays may take their evolution into account.  The development of the presentation should be considered in determining its purpose.  Pp.1926.


(a)Stone is the Courts initial benchmark as its only case dealing with the constitutionality of displaying the Commandments.  It recognized that the Commandments are an instrument of religion and that, at least on the facts before the Court, their texts display could presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secular education explained their being there.  449 U. S., at 41, n.3.  But Stone did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible way the government might set out the Commandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 595.  Hence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression leading up to the Commandments third display, beginning with the first.  Pp.1920.


(b)There are two obvious similarities between the display Stone rejected and the first one here: both set out the Commandments text as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation like blank tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an arguably secular display.  Stone stressed the significance of integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point of reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and Christians.  They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods), regulate details of religious obligation (no graven images, sabbath breaking, or vain oath swearing), and unmistakably rest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, theft, etc.) on the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the texts beginning.  Displaying that text is thus different from symbolic representation, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a sectarian conception of faith.  Where the text is set out, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly suggesting a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view.  The display in Stone had no such context, and the Counties solo exhibit here did nothing more to counter the sectarian implication than the Stone postings.  The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the Commandments religious message.  Pp.2021.


(c)The Counties second display, unlike the first, did not hang the Commandments in isolation, but included the statement of the governments purpose expressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the Commandments to other documents whose references to God were highlighted as their sole common element.  The displays unstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the Counties posted the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content.  That demonstration of the governments objective was enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying resolutions claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ.  Together, the display and resolution presented an indisputable, and undisputed, showing of an impermissible purpose.  Pp.2122.


(d)The lower courts conclusion that no legitimizing secular purpose prompted the Counties third display, the Foundations of American Law and Government exhibit, is amply justified.  That display placed the Commandments in the company of other documents the Counties deemed especially significant in the historical foundation of American government.  In trying to persuade the District Court to lift the preliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new purposes for the third version, including a desire to educate County citizens as to the significance of the documents displayed.  The Counties claims, however, persuaded neither that court, which was intimately familiar with this litigations details, nor the Sixth Circuit.  Where both lower courts were unable to discern an arguably valid secular purpose, this Court normally should hesitate to find one.  Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 594.  The Counties new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigating position, there being no further authorizing resolutions by the Counties governing boards.  And although repeal of the earlier county authorizations would not have erased them from the record of evidence bearing on current purpose, the extraordinary resolutions for the second displays passed just months earlier were not repealed or otherwise repudiated.  Indeed, the sectarian spirit of the resolutions found enhanced expression in the third display, which quoted more of the Commandments purely religious language than the first two displays had done.  No reasonable observer, therefore, could accept the claim that the Counties had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.  Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might prevail over evidence of the continuing religious object.  For example, it is at least odd in a collection of documents said to be foundational to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most significant structural provision adopted since the original framing.  An observer would probably suspect the Counties of reaching for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality.  Pp.2225.


(e)In holding that the preliminary injunction was adequately supported by evidence that the Counties purpose had not changed at the third stage, the Court does not decide that the Counties past actions forever taint any effort on their part to deal with the subject matter.  The Court holds only that purpose is to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and is to be understood in light of context.  District courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief to take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant conditions.  Nor does the Court hold that a sacred text can never be integrated constitutionally into a governmental display on law or history.  Its own courtroom frieze depicts Moses holding tablets exhibiting a portion of the secularly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the National Government was violating religious neutrality.  P. 26.

			"|"McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, etal. v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 031693.Argued March 2, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) etal., sued under 42 U. S.C. 1983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that they violated the First Amendments Establishment Clause.  The Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentuckys precedent legal code.  The resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position, including the state legislatures acknowledgment of Christ as the Prince of Ethics.  The displays around the Commandments were modified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing religious references as their sole common element, e.g., the Declaration of Independences endowed by their Creator passage.  Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court followed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, test to find, inter alia, that the original display lacked any secular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious document, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational documents to those specifically referring to Christianity.  After changing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again.  No new resolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded the second one.  The new posting, entitled The Foundations of American Law and Government Display, consists of nine framed documents of equal size.  One sets out the Commandments explicitly identified as the King James Version, quotes them at greater length, and explains that they have profoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and this Nation.  With the Commandments are framed copies of, e.g., the Star Spangled Banners lyrics and the Declaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their historical and legal significance.  On the ACLUs motion, the District Court included this third display in the injunction despite the Counties professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and Government and to educate County citizens as to the documents.  The court took proclaiming the Commandments foundational value as a religious, rather than secular, purpose under Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, and found that the Counties asserted educational goals crumbled upon an examination of this litigations history.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under Stone, displaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated with a secular message.  The court saw no integration here because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical connection between the Commandments and the other documents.

04-277|"NATIONAL CABLE & TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
ASSOCIATION etal. v. BRAND X INTERNET 
SERVICES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04277.Argued March 29, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Consumers traditionally access the Internet through dial-up connections provided via local telephone lines.  Internet service providers (ISPs), in turn, link those calls to the Internet network, not only by providing a physical connection, but also by offering consumers the ability to translate raw data into information they may both view on their own computers and transmit to others connected to the Internet.  Technological limitations of local telephone wires, however, retard the speed at which Internet data may be transmitted through such narrowband connections.  Broadband Internet service, by contrast, transmits data at much higher speeds.  There are two principal kinds of broadband service: cable modem service, which transmits data between the Internet and users computers via the network of television cable lines owned by cable companies, and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service, which uses high-speed wires owned by local telephone companies.  Other ways of transmitting high-speed Internet data, including terrestrial- and satellite-based wireless networks, are also emerging.


The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, defines two categories of entities relevant here.  Information service providersthose offering  a capability for [processing] information via telecommunications, 47 U. S.C. 153(20)are subject to mandatory regulation by the Federal Communications Commission as common carriers under Title II of the Act.  Conversely, telecommunications carriersi.e., those offering  telecommunications for a fee directly to the public  regardless of the facilities used, 153(46)are not subject to mandatory Title II regulation.  These two classifications originated in the late 1970s, as the Commission developed rules to regulate data-processing services offered over telephone wires.  Regulated telecommunications service under the 1996 Act is the analog to basic service under the prior regime, the Computer II rules.  Those rules defined such service as a pure or transparent transmission capability over a communications path enabling the consumer to transmit an ordinary-language message to another point without computer processing or storage of the information, such as via a telephone or a facsimile.  Under the 1996 Act, [i]nformation service is the analog to enhanced service, defined by the Computer II rules as computer-processing applications that act on the subscribers information, such as voice and data storage services, as well as protocol conversion, i.e., the ability to communicate between networks that employ different data-transmission formats.


In the Declaratory Ruling under review, the Commission classified broadband cable modem service as an information service but not a telecommunications service under the 1996 Act, so that it is not subject to mandatory Title II common-carrier regulation.  The Commission relied heavily on its Universal Service Report, which earlier classified non-facilities-based ISPsthose that do not own the transmission facilities they use to connect the end user to the Internetsolely as information-service providers.  Because Internet access is a capability for manipulating and storing information, the Commission concluded, it was an information service.  However, the integrated nature of such access and the high-speed wire used to provide it led the Commission to conclude that cable companies providing it are not telecommunications service providers.  Adopting the Universal Service Reports reasoning, the Commission held that cable companies offering broadband Internet access, like non-facilities-based ISPs, do not offer the end user telecommunications service, but merely use telecommunications to provide end users with cable modem service.


Numerous parties petitioned for review.  By judicial lottery, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was selected as the venue for the challenge.  That court granted the petitions in part, vacated the Declaratory Ruling in part, and remanded for further proceedings.  In particular, the court held that the Commission could not permissibly construe the Communications Act to exempt cable companies providing cable modem service from mandatory Title II regulation.  Rather than analyzing the permissibility of that construction under the deferential framework of Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, however, the court grounded that holding in the stare decisis effect of its decision in AT&T Corp. v. Portland, 216 F.3d 871, which had held that cable modem service is a telecommunications service. 
Held:The Commissions conclusion that broadband cable modem companies are exempt from mandatory common-carrier regulation is a lawful construction of the Communications Act under Chevron and the Administrative Procedure Act.  Pp.832.
1.Chevrons framework applies to the Commissions interpretation of telecommunications service.  Pp.814.


(a)Chevron governs this Courts review of the Commissions construction.  See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333339.  Chevron requires a federal court to defer to an agencys construction, even if it differs from what the court believes to be the best interpretation, if the particular statute is within the agencys jurisdiction to administer, the statute is ambiguous on the point at issue, and the agencys construction is reasonable.  467 U. S., at 843844, and n.11, 865866.  The Commissions statutory authority to execute and enforce the Communications Act, 151, and to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary  to carry out the [Acts] provisions, 201(b), give the Commission power to promulgate binding legal rules; the Commission issued the order under review in the exercise of that authority; and there is no dispute that the order is within the Commissions jurisdiction.  Pp.810.


(b)The Ninth Circuit should have applied Chevrons framework, instead of following the contrary construction it adopted in Portland.  A courts prior construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.  See Smiley, supra, at 740741.  Because Portland held only that the best reading of 153(46) was that cable modem service was telecommunications service, not that this was the only permissible reading or that the Communications Act unambiguously required it, the Ninth Circuit erred in refusing to apply Chevron.  Pp.1014.


2.The Commissions construction of 153(46)s telecommunications service definition is a permissible reading of the Communications Act at both steps of Chevrons test.  Pp.1429.


(a)For the Commission, the question whether cable companies providing cable modem service offe[r] telecommunications within 153(46)s meaning turned on the nature of the functions offered the end user.  Seen from the consumers point of view, the Commission concluded, the cable wire is used to access the World Wide Web, newsgroups, etc., rather than transparently to transmit and receive ordinary-language messages without computer processing or storage of the message.  The integrated character of this offering led the Commission to conclude that cable companies do not make a stand-alone, transparent offering of telecommunications.  Pp.1517.


(b)The Commissions construction of 153(46) is permissible at Chevrons first step, which asks whether the statutes plain terms directly addres[s] the precise question at issue.  467 U. S., at 843.  This conclusion follows both from the ordinary meaning of offering and the Communications Acts regulatory history.  Pp.1725.


(1)Where a statutes plain terms admit of two or more reasonable ordinary usages, the Commissions choice of one of them is entitled to deference.  See, e.g., Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 498.  It is common usage to describe what a company offers to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated finished product, even to the exclusion of discrete components that compose the product.  What cable companies providing cable modem service offer is finished Internet service, though they do so using the discrete components composing the end product, including data transmission.  Such functionally integrated components need not be described as distinct offerings.  Pp.1721.


(2)The Commissions traditional distinction between basic and enhanced service also supports the conclusion that the Communications Act is ambiguous about whether cable companies offer telecommunications with cable modem service.  Congress passed the Acts definitions against the background of this regulatory history, and it may be assumed that the parallel terms telecommunications service and information service substantially incorporated the meaning of basic and enhanced service.  That history in at least two respects confirms that the term telecommunications service is ambiguous.  First, in the Computer II order establishing the terms basic and enhanced services, the Commission defined those terms functionally, based on how the consumer interacts with the provided information, just as the Commission did in the order under review.  Cable modem service is not transparent in terms of its interaction with customer-supplied information; the transmission occurs only in connection with information processing.  It was therefore consistent with the statutes terms for the Commission to assume that the parallel term telecommunications service in 153(46) likewise describes a pure or transparent communications path not necessarily separately present in an integrated information-processing service from the end-users perspective.  Second, the Commissions application of the basic/enhanced service distinction to non-facilities-based ISPs also supports the Courts conclusion.  The Commission has historically not subjected non-facilities-based information-service providers to common carrier regulation.  That history suggests, in turn, that the Act does not unambiguously classify nonfacilities based ISPs as offerors of telecommunications.  If the Act does not unambiguously classify such providers as offering telecommunications, it also does not unambiguously so classify facilities-based information-service providers such as cable companies; the relevant definitions do not distinguish the two types of carriers.  The Acts silence suggests, instead, that the Commission has the discretion to fill the statutory gap.  Pp.2125.


(c)The Commissions interpretation is also permissible at Chevrons step two because it is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make, 467 U. S., at 845.  Respondents argue unpersuasively that the Commissions construction is unreasonable because it allows any communications provider to evade common-carrier regulation simply by bundling information service with telecommunications.  That result does not follow from the interpretation adopted in the Declaratory Ruling.  The Commission classified cable modem service solely as an information service because the telecommunications input used to provide cable modem service is not separable from the services data-processing capabilities, but is part and parcel of that service and integral to its other capabilities, and therefore is not a telecommunications offering.  This construction does not leave all information-service offerings unregulated under Title II.  It is plain, for example, that a local telephone company cannot escape regulation by packaging its telephone service with voice mail because such packaging offers a transparent transmission pathtelephone servicethat transmits information independent of the information-storage capabilities voice mail provides.  By contrast, the high-speed transmission used to provide cable modem service is a functionally integrated component of Internet service because it transmits data only in connection with the further processing of information and is necessary to provide such service.  The Commissions construction therefore was more limited than respondents assume.


Respondents argument that cable modem service does, in fact, provide transparent transmission from the consumers perspective is also mistaken.  Their characterization of the information-service offering of Internet access as consisting only of access to a cable companys e-mail service, its Web page, and the ability it provides to create a personal Web page conflicts with the Commissions reasonable understanding of the nature of Internet service.  When an end user accesses a third partys Web site, the Commission concluded, he is equally using the information service provided by the cable company as when he accesses that companys own Web site, its e-mail service, or his personal webpage.  As the Commission recognized, the service that Internet access providers offer the public is Internet access, not a transparent ability (from the end-users perspective) to transmit information.  Pp.2529.


3.The Court rejects respondent MCI, Inc.s argument that the Commissions treatment of cable modem service is inconsistent with its treatment of DSL service and is therefore an arbitrary and capricious deviation from agency policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  MCI points out that when local telephone companies began to offer Internet access through DSL technology, the Commission required them to make the telephone lines used to provide DSL available to competing ISPs on nondiscriminatory, common-carrier terms.  Respondents claim that the Commission has not adequately explained its decision not to regulate cable companies similarly.


The Court thinks that the Commission has provided a reasoned explanation for this decision.  The traditional reason for its Computer II common-carrier treatment of facilities-based carriers was that the telephone network was the primary, if not the exclusive, means through which information service providers could gain access to their customers.  The Commission applied the same treatment to DSL service based on that history, rather than on an analysis of contemporaneous market conditions.  The Commissions Declaratory Ruling, by contrast, concluded that changed market conditions warrant different treatment of cable modem service.  Unlike at the time of the DSL order, substitute forms of Internet transmission exist today, including wireline, cable, terrestrial wireless, and satellite.  The Commission therefore concluded that broadband services should exist in a minimal regulatory environment that promotes investment and innovation in a competitive market.  There is nothing arbitrary or capricious about applying a fresh analysis to the cable industry.  Pp.2931.

SERVICES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04277.Argued March 29, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Consumers traditionally access the Internet through dial-up connections provided via local telephone lines.  Internet service providers (ISPs), in turn, link those calls to the Internet network, not only by providing a physical connection, but also by offering consumers the ability to translate raw data into information they may both view on their own computers and transmit to others connected to the Internet.  Technological limitations of local telephone wires, however, retard the speed at which Internet data may be transmitted through such narrowband connections.  Broadband Internet service, by contrast, transmits data at much higher speeds.  There are two principal kinds of broadband service: cable modem service, which transmits data between the Internet and users computers via the network of television cable lines owned by cable companies, and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service, which uses high-speed wires owned by local telephone companies.  Other ways of transmitting high-speed Internet data, including terrestrial- and satellite-based wireless networks, are also emerging.


The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, defines two categories of entities relevant here.  Information service providersthose offering  a capability for [processing] information via telecommunications, 47 U. S.C. 153(20)are subject to mandatory regulation by the Federal Communications Commission as common carriers under Title II of the Act.  Conversely, telecommunications carriersi.e., those offering  telecommunications for a fee directly to the public  regardless of the facilities used, 153(46)are not subject to mandatory Title II regulation.  These two classifications originated in the late 1970s, as the Commission developed rules to regulate data-processing services offered over telephone wires.  Regulated telecommunications service under the 1996 Act is the analog to basic service under the prior regime, the Computer II rules.  Those rules defined such service as a pure or transparent transmission capability over a communications path enabling the consumer to transmit an ordinary-language message to another point without computer processing or storage of the information, such as via a telephone or a facsimile.  Under the 1996 Act, [i]nformation service is the analog to enhanced service, defined by the Computer II rules as computer-processing applications that act on the subscribers information, such as voice and data storage services, as well as protocol conversion, i.e., the ability to communicate between networks that employ different data-transmission formats.


In the Declaratory Ruling under review, the Commission classified broadband cable modem service as an information service but not a telecommunications service under the 1996 Act, so that it is not subject to mandatory Title II common-carrier regulation.  The Commission relied heavily on its Universal Service Report, which earlier classified non-facilities-based ISPsthose that do not own the transmission facilities they use to connect the end user to the Internetsolely as information-service providers.  Because Internet access is a capability for manipulating and storing information, the Commission concluded, it was an information service.  However, the integrated nature of such access and the high-speed wire used to provide it led the Commission to conclude that cable companies providing it are not telecommunications service providers.  Adopting the Universal Service Reports reasoning, the Commission held that cable companies offering broadband Internet access, like non-facilities-based ISPs, do not offer the end user telecommunications service, but merely use telecommunications to provide end users with cable modem service.


Numerous parties petitioned for review.  By judicial lottery, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was selected as the venue for the challenge.  That court granted the petitions in part, vacated the Declaratory Ruling in part, and remanded for further proceedings.  In particular, the court held that the Commission could not permissibly construe the Communications Act to exempt cable companies providing cable modem service from mandatory Title II regulation.  Rather than analyzing the permissibility of that construction under the deferential framework of Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, however, the court grounded that holding in the stare decisis effect of its decision in AT&T Corp. v. Portland, 216 F.3d 871, which had held that cable modem service is a telecommunications service. 
Held:The Commissions conclusion that broadband cable modem companies are exempt from mandatory common-carrier regulation is a lawful construction of the Communications Act under Chevron and the Administrative Procedure Act.  Pp.832.
1.Chevrons framework applies to the Commissions interpretation of telecommunications service.  Pp.814.


(a)Chevron governs this Courts review of the Commissions construction.  See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333339.  Chevron requires a federal court to defer to an agencys construction, even if it differs from what the court believes to be the best interpretation, if the particular statute is within the agencys jurisdiction to administer, the statute is ambiguous on the point at issue, and the agencys construction is reasonable.  467 U. S., at 843844, and n.11, 865866.  The Commissions statutory authority to execute and enforce the Communications Act, 151, and to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary  to carry out the [Acts] provisions, 201(b), give the Commission power to promulgate binding legal rules; the Commission issued the order under review in the exercise of that authority; and there is no dispute that the order is within the Commissions jurisdiction.  Pp.810.


(b)The Ninth Circuit should have applied Chevrons framework, instead of following the contrary construction it adopted in Portland.  A courts prior construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.  See Smiley, supra, at 740741.  Because Portland held only that the best reading of 153(46) was that cable modem service was telecommunications service, not that this was the only permissible reading or that the Communications Act unambiguously required it, the Ninth Circuit erred in refusing to apply Chevron.  Pp.1014.


2.The Commissions construction of 153(46)s telecommunications service definition is a permissible reading of the Communications Act at both steps of Chevrons test.  Pp.1429.


(a)For the Commission, the question whether cable companies providing cable modem service offe[r] telecommunications within 153(46)s meaning turned on the nature of the functions offered the end user.  Seen from the consumers point of view, the Commission concluded, the cable wire is used to access the World Wide Web, newsgroups, etc., rather than transparently to transmit and receive ordinary-language messages without computer processing or storage of the message.  The integrated character of this offering led the Commission to conclude that cable companies do not make a stand-alone, transparent offering of telecommunications.  Pp.1517.


(b)The Commissions construction of 153(46) is permissible at Chevrons first step, which asks whether the statutes plain terms directly addres[s] the precise question at issue.  467 U. S., at 843.  This conclusion follows both from the ordinary meaning of offering and the Communications Acts regulatory history.  Pp.1725.


(1)Where a statutes plain terms admit of two or more reasonable ordinary usages, the Commissions choice of one of them is entitled to deference.  See, e.g., Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 498.  It is common usage to describe what a company offers to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated finished product, even to the exclusion of discrete components that compose the product.  What cable companies providing cable modem service offer is finished Internet service, though they do so using the discrete components composing the end product, including data transmission.  Such functionally integrated components need not be described as distinct offerings.  Pp.1721.


(2)The Commissions traditional distinction between basic and enhanced service also supports the conclusion that the Communications Act is ambiguous about whether cable companies offer telecommunications with cable modem service.  Congress passed the Acts definitions against the background of this regulatory history, and it may be assumed that the parallel terms telecommunications service and information service substantially incorporated the meaning of basic and enhanced service.  That history in at least two respects confirms that the term telecommunications service is ambiguous.  First, in the Computer II order establishing the terms basic and enhanced services, the Commission defined those terms functionally, based on how the consumer interacts with the provided information, just as the Commission did in the order under review.  Cable modem service is not transparent in terms of its interaction with customer-supplied information; the transmission occurs only in connection with information processing.  It was therefore consistent with the statutes terms for the Commission to assume that the parallel term telecommunications service in 153(46) likewise describes a pure or transparent communications path not necessarily separately present in an integrated information-processing service from the end-users perspective.  Second, the Commissions application of the basic/enhanced service distinction to non-facilities-based ISPs also supports the Courts conclusion.  The Commission has historically not subjected non-facilities-based information-service providers to common carrier regulation.  That history suggests, in turn, that the Act does not unambiguously classify nonfacilities based ISPs as offerors of telecommunications.  If the Act does not unambiguously classify such providers as offering telecommunications, it also does not unambiguously so classify facilities-based information-service providers such as cable companies; the relevant definitions do not distinguish the two types of carriers.  The Acts silence suggests, instead, that the Commission has the discretion to fill the statutory gap.  Pp.2125.


(c)The Commissions interpretation is also permissible at Chevrons step two because it is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make, 467 U. S., at 845.  Respondents argue unpersuasively that the Commissions construction is unreasonable because it allows any communications provider to evade common-carrier regulation simply by bundling information service with telecommunications.  That result does not follow from the interpretation adopted in the Declaratory Ruling.  The Commission classified cable modem service solely as an information service because the telecommunications input used to provide cable modem service is not separable from the services data-processing capabilities, but is part and parcel of that service and integral to its other capabilities, and therefore is not a telecommunications offering.  This construction does not leave all information-service offerings unregulated under Title II.  It is plain, for example, that a local telephone company cannot escape regulation by packaging its telephone service with voice mail because such packaging offers a transparent transmission pathtelephone servicethat transmits information independent of the information-storage capabilities voice mail provides.  By contrast, the high-speed transmission used to provide cable modem service is a functionally integrated component of Internet service because it transmits data only in connection with the further processing of information and is necessary to provide such service.  The Commissions construction therefore was more limited than respondents assume.


Respondents argument that cable modem service does, in fact, provide transparent transmission from the consumers perspective is also mistaken.  Their characterization of the information-service offering of Internet access as consisting only of access to a cable companys e-mail service, its Web page, and the ability it provides to create a personal Web page conflicts with the Commissions reasonable understanding of the nature of Internet service.  When an end user accesses a third partys Web site, the Commission concluded, he is equally using the information service provided by the cable company as when he accesses that companys own Web site, its e-mail service, or his personal webpage.  As the Commission recognized, the service that Internet access providers offer the public is Internet access, not a transparent ability (from the end-users perspective) to transmit information.  Pp.2529.


3.The Court rejects respondent MCI, Inc.s argument that the Commissions treatment of cable modem service is inconsistent with its treatment of DSL service and is therefore an arbitrary and capricious deviation from agency policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 5 U. S.C. 706(2)(A).  MCI points out that when local telephone companies began to offer Internet access through DSL technology, the Commission required them to make the telephone lines used to provide DSL available to competing ISPs on nondiscriminatory, common-carrier terms.  Respondents claim that the Commission has not adequately explained its decision not to regulate cable companies similarly.


The Court thinks that the Commission has provided a reasoned explanation for this decision.  The traditional reason for its Computer II common-carrier treatment of facilities-based carriers was that the telephone network was the primary, if not the exclusive, means through which information service providers could gain access to their customers.  The Commission applied the same treatment to DSL service based on that history, rather than on an analysis of contemporaneous market conditions.  The Commissions Declaratory Ruling, by contrast, concluded that changed market conditions warrant different treatment of cable modem service.  Unlike at the time of the DSL order, substitute forms of Internet transmission exist today, including wireline, cable, terrestrial wireless, and satellite.  The Commission therefore concluded that broadband services should exist in a minimal regulatory environment that promotes investment and innovation in a competitive market.  There is nothing arbitrary or capricious about applying a fresh analysis to the cable industry.  Pp.2931.

04-278|"TOWN OF CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO v. GONZALES, individually and a next best friend of her deceased minor children, GONZALES et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 04278.Argued March 21, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Respondent filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983 alleging that petitioner violated the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause when its police officers, acting pursuant to official policy or custom, failed to respond to her repeated reports over several hours that her estranged husband had taken their three children in violation of her restraining order against him.  Ultimately, the husband murdered the children.  The District Court granted the towns motion to dismiss, but an en banc majority of the Tenth Circuit reversed, finding that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedural due process claim because a Colorado statute established the state legislatures clear intent to require police to enforce retraining orders, and thus its intent that the orders recipient have an entitlement to its enforcement.  The court therefore ruled, among other things, that respondent had a protected property interest in the enforcement of her restraining order.  
Held:Respondent did not, for Due Process Clause purposes, have a property interest in police enforcement of the restraining order against her husband. Pp.619.
(a)The Due Process Clauses procedural component does not protect everything that might be described as a government benefit:To have a property interest in a benefit, a person  must  have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.  Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577.  Such entitlements are created by existing rules or understandings stemming from an independent source such as state law.  E.g., ibid.  Pp.67.


(b)A benefit is not a protected entitlement if officials have discretion to grant or deny it.  See, e.g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U. S. 454, 462463.  It is inappropriate here to defer to the Tenth Circuits determination that Colorado law gave respondent a right to police enforcement of the restraining order.  This Court therefore proceeds to its own analysis.  Pp.79.


(c)Colorado law has not created a personal entitlement to enforcement of restraining orders.  It does not appear that state law truly made such enforcement mandatory.  A well-established tradition of police discretion has long coexisted with apparently mandatory arrest statutes.  Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 47, n.2, 62, n.32.  Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indication than the Colorado statutes direction to use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order or even to arrest  or  seek a warrant.  A Colorado officer would likely have some discretion to determine thatdespite probable cause to believe a restraining order has been violatedthe violations circumstances or competing duties counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance.  The practical necessity for discretion is particularly apparent in a case such as this, where the suspected violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown.  In such circumstances, the statute does not appear to require officers to arrest but only to seek a warrant.  That, however, would be an entitlement to nothing but procedure, which cannot be the basis for a property interest.  Pp.915.


(d)Even if the statute could be said to make enforcement mandatory, that would not necessarily mean that respondent has an entitlement to enforcement.  Her alleged interest stems not from common law or contract, but only from a States statutory scheme.  If she was given a statutory entitlement, the Court would expect to see some indication of that in the statute itself.  Although the statute spoke of protected person[s] such as respondent, it did so in connection with matters other than a right to enforcement.  Most importantly, it spoke directly to the protected persons power to initiate contempt proceedings if the order was issued in a civil action, which contrasts tellingly with its conferral of a power merely to request initiation of criminal contempt proceedingsand even more dramatically with its complete silence about any power to request (much less demand) that an arrest be made.  Pp.1517.


(e)Even were the Court to think otherwise about Colorados creation of an entitlement, it is not clear that an individual entitlement to enforcement of a restraining order could constitute a property interest for due process purposes.  Such a right would have no ascertainable monetary value and would arise incidentally, not out of some new species of government benefit or service, but out of a function that government actors have always performedarresting people when they have probable cause.  A benefits indirect nature was fatal to a due process claim in OBannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U. S. 773, 787.  Here, as there, [t]he simple distinction between government action that directly affects a citizens legal rights  and action that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only  incidentally, provides a sufficient answer to cases finding government-provided services to be entitlements.  Id., at 788.  Pp.1719.

04-480|"METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER STUDIOS INC. etal. v. GROKSTER, LTD., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04480.Argued March 29, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Respondent companies distribute free software that allows computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because the computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  Although such networks can be used to share any type of digital file, recipients of respondents software have mostly used them to share copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  Seeking damages and an injunction, a group of movie studios and other copyright holders (hereinafter MGM) sued respondents for their users copyright infringements, alleging that respondents knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to infringe copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act.


Discovery revealed that billions of files are shared across peer-to-peer networks each month.  Respondents are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, although the decentralized networks do not reveal which files are copied, and when.  Respondents have sometimes learned about the infringement directly when users have e-mailed questions regarding copyrighted works, and respondents have replied with guidance.  Respondents are not merely passive recipients of information about infringement.  The record is replete with evidence that when they began to distribute their free software, each of them clearly voiced the objective that recipients use the software to download copyrighted works and took active steps to encourage infringement.  After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitating copyright infringement, both respondents promoted and marketed themselves as Napster alternatives.  They receive no revenue from users, but, instead, generate income by selling advertising space, then streaming the advertising to their users.  As the number of users increases, advertising opportunities are worth more.  There is no evidence that either respondent made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise to impede the sharing of copyrighted files.


While acknowledging that respondents users had directly infringed MGMs copyrights, the District Court nonetheless granted respondents summary judgment as to liability arising from distribution of their software.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It read Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, as holding that the distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  Because the appeals court found respondents software to be capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the softwares decentralized architecture, the court held that they were not liable.  It also held that they did not materially contribute to their users infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing the software in the first place.  Finally, the court held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the softwares use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.
Held:One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the devices lawful uses.  Pp.1024.
(a)The tension between the competing values of supporting creativity through copyright protection and promoting technological innovation by limiting infringement liability is the subject of this case.  Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents software.  When a widely shared product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the devices distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.  One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it.  Although [t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [anothers] infringement, Sony, 464 U. S., at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, e.g., id., at 486.  Pp. 1013. 


(b)Sony addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, copyright holders sued Sony, the manufacturer of videocassette recorders, claiming that it was contributorily liable for the infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs.  The evidence showed that the VCRs principal use was time-shifting, i.e., taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, noninfringing use.  464 U. S., at 423424.  Moreover, there was no evidence that Sony had desired to bring about taping in violation of copyright or taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  Id., at 438.  On those facts, the only conceivable basis for liability was on a theory of contributory infringement through distribution of a product.  Id., at 439.  Because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, the Court held that Sony was not liable.  Id., at 442.  This theory reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.  35 U. S.C 271(c).  The doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with lawful and unlawful uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault.  In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread Sony to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement and failed to act upon that information.  Sony did not displace other secondary liability theories.  Pp.1317. 


(c)Nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists.  It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.  464 U. S., at 439.  Where evidence goes beyond a products characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, Sonys staple-article rule will not preclude liability.  At common law a copyright or patent defendant who not only expected but invoked [infringing use] by advertisement was liable for infringement.  Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 6263.  The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today.  Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct infringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, shows an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and overcomes the laws reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.  A rule that premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.  Pp.1720. 


(d)On the record presented, respondents unlawful objective is unmistakable.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM argues persuasively that such a message is shown here.  Three features of the evidence of intent are particularly notable.  First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.  Respondents efforts to supply services to former Napster users indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent to bring about infringement.  Second, neither respondent attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.  While the Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrelevant because respondents lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, this evidence underscores their intentional facilitation of their users infringement.  Third, respondents make money by selling advertising space, then by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.  The more their software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the advertising revenue.  Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.  This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but its import is clear in the entire records context.  Pp.2023. 


(e)In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribution of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case.  There is evidence of such infringement on a gigantic scale.  Because substantial evidence supports MGM on all elements, summary judgment for respondents was error.  On remand, reconsideration of MGMs summary judgment motion will be in order.  Pp.2324.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04480.Argued March 29, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
Respondent companies distribute free software that allows computer users to share electronic files through peer-to-peer networks, so called because the computers communicate directly with each other, not through central servers.  Although such networks can be used to share any type of digital file, recipients of respondents software have mostly used them to share copyrighted music and video files without authorization.  Seeking damages and an injunction, a group of movie studios and other copyright holders (hereinafter MGM) sued respondents for their users copyright infringements, alleging that respondents knowingly and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to infringe copyrighted works in violation of the Copyright Act.


Discovery revealed that billions of files are shared across peer-to-peer networks each month.  Respondents are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyrighted files, although the decentralized networks do not reveal which files are copied, and when.  Respondents have sometimes learned about the infringement directly when users have e-mailed questions regarding copyrighted works, and respondents have replied with guidance.  Respondents are not merely passive recipients of information about infringement.  The record is replete with evidence that when they began to distribute their free software, each of them clearly voiced the objective that recipients use the software to download copyrighted works and took active steps to encourage infringement.  After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued by copyright holders for facilitating copyright infringement, both respondents promoted and marketed themselves as Napster alternatives.  They receive no revenue from users, but, instead, generate income by selling advertising space, then streaming the advertising to their users.  As the number of users increases, advertising opportunities are worth more.  There is no evidence that either respondent made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users downloads or otherwise to impede the sharing of copyrighted files.


While acknowledging that respondents users had directly infringed MGMs copyrights, the District Court nonetheless granted respondents summary judgment as to liability arising from distribution of their software.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  It read Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, as holding that the distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge.  Because the appeals court found respondents software to be capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the softwares decentralized architecture, the court held that they were not liable.  It also held that they did not materially contribute to their users infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing the software in the first place.  Finally, the court held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the softwares use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.
Held:One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the devices lawful uses.  Pp.1024.
(a)The tension between the competing values of supporting creativity through copyright protection and promoting technological innovation by limiting infringement liability is the subject of this case.  Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents software.  When a widely shared product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the devices distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.  One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it.  Although [t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [anothers] infringement, Sony, 464 U. S., at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, e.g., id., at 486.  Pp. 1013. 


(b)Sony addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distribution of a commercial product.  There, copyright holders sued Sony, the manufacturer of videocassette recorders, claiming that it was contributorily liable for the infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs.  The evidence showed that the VCRs principal use was time-shifting, i.e., taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, noninfringing use.  464 U. S., at 423424.  Moreover, there was no evidence that Sony had desired to bring about taping in violation of copyright or taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping.  Id., at 438.  On those facts, the only conceivable basis for liability was on a theory of contributory infringement through distribution of a product.  Id., at 439.  Because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, the Court held that Sony was not liable.  Id., at 442.  This theory reflected patent laws traditional staple article of commerce doctrine that distribution of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways.  35 U. S.C 271(c).  The doctrine absolves the equivocal conduct of selling an item with lawful and unlawful uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault.  In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread Sony to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement and failed to act upon that information.  Sony did not displace other secondary liability theories.  Pp.1317. 


(c)Nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists.  It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law.  464 U. S., at 439.  Where evidence goes beyond a products characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement, Sonys staple-article rule will not preclude liability.  At common law a copyright or patent defendant who not only expected but invoked [infringing use] by advertisement was liable for infringement.  Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 6263.  The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today.  Evidence of active steps taken to encourage direct infringement, such as advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, shows an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and overcomes the laws reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use.  A rule that premises liability on purposeful, culpable expression and conduct does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise.  Pp.1720. 


(d)On the record presented, respondents unlawful objective is unmistakable.  The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.  MGM argues persuasively that such a message is shown here.  Three features of the evidence of intent are particularly notable.

Respondents efforts to supply services to former Napster users indicate a principal, if not exclusive, intent to bring about infringement.

04-514|"BELL, WARDEN v. THOMPSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04514.Argued April 26, 2005Decided June 27, 2005
After respondent Thompson was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, Tennessee state courts denied postconviction relief on his claim that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to adequately investigate his mental health.  His federal habeas attorneys subsequently retained psychologist Dr. Sultan, whose report and deposition contended that Thompson suffered from serious mental illness at the time of his offense.  The District Court dismissed the petition, but apparently Thompsons habeas counsel had failed to include Sultans deposition and report in the record.  Upholding the dismissal, the Sixth Circuit, inter alia, found no ineffective assistance and did not discuss Sultans report and deposition in detail.  That court later denied rehearing, but stayed issuance of its mandate pending disposition of Thompsons certiorari petition.  After this Court denied certiorari on December 1, 2003, the Sixth Circuit stayed its mandate again, pending disposition of a petition for rehearing, which this Court denied on January 20, 2004.  A copy of that order was filed with the Sixth Circuit on January 23, but the court did not issue its mandate.  The State set Thompsons execution date, and state and federal proceedings began on his competency to be executed.  Competency proceedings were pending in the Federal District Court on June 23, 2004, when the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opinion in the federal habeas case, vacating the District Courts habeas judgment and remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance claim.  The Sixth Circuit supplemented the record on appeal with Sultans deposition and explained that its authority to issue an amended opinion five months after this Court denied rehearing was based on its inherent power to reconsider an opinion before issuance of the mandate.
Held:Assuming that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41 authorizes a stay of a mandate following a denial of certiorari and that a court may stay the mandate without entering an order, the Sixth Circuits decision to do so here was an abuse of discretion.  Pp.619.
(a)This Court need not decide the scope of the court of appeals Rule 41 authority to withhold a mandate in order to resolve this case.  Pp.69.


(b)Prominent among the reasons warranting the result here is that the Sixth Circuit did not release its amended opinion for more than five months after this Court denied rehearing.  The consequence of delay for the States criminal justice system was compounded by the Sixth Circuits failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties that it was reconsidering its earlier opinion.  The express terms of the Sixth Circuits stay state that the mandate would be stayed until this Court acted on the rehearing petition.  Thus, once rehearing was denied, the stay dissolved by operation of law.  Tennessee, relying on the Sixth Circuits earlier orders and this Courts certiorari and rehearing denials could assume that the mandate would issue, especially since Thompson sought no additional stay and the Sixth Circuit gave no indication that it might be revisting its earlier decision.  The latter point is important, for it is an open question whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to extend the time to issue a mandate through mere inaction.  Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way to know whether the Sixth Circuit had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mistake.  That court could have spared the parties and state judicial system considerable time and resources had it notified them that it was reviewing its decision.  The scheduling of Thompsons execution and the resulting competency proceedings were steps taken in reliance on the assumption that the federal habeas case was final.  That assumption was all the more reasonable because the delay in issuing the mandate took place after this Court had denied certiorari, which usually signals the end of litigation.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(d)(2)(D).  The fact that the Sixth Circuit had the opportunity at the rehearing stage to consider the same arguments it eventually adopted in its amended opinion is yet another factor supporting the determination here.  A review of the Sultan deposition also reinforces this conclusion.  While the evidence would have been relevant to the District Courts analysis, it is not of such a character as to warrant the Sixth Circuits extraordinary departure from standard procedures.  Finally, by withholding its mandate for monthsbased on evidence supporting only an arguable constitutional claimwhile the State prepared to carry out Thompsons sentence, the Sixth Circuit did not accord the appropriate level of respect to the States judgment that Thompsons crimes merit the ultimate punishment.  See Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 554557.  Pp.919.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031566.Argued February 23, 2005Decided June 23, 2005
Petitioner California farmers and farming entities purchase water from respondent Westlands Water District, which receives its water from the United States Bureau of Reclamation under a 1963 contract between Westlands and the Bureau.  In 1993, Westlands and other water districts sued the Bureau for reducing their water supply.  Petitioners, though not parties to the 1963 contract, intervened as plaintiffs.  After negotiations, all parties except petitioners stipulated to dismissal of the districts complaint.  Petitioners pressed forward with, as relevant here, the claim that the United States had breached the contract.  They contended that they were third-party beneficiaries entitled to enforce the contract and that the United States had waived its sovereign immunity from breach of contract suits in a provision of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, 43 U. S.C. 390uu.  The District Court ultimately held that petitioners were neither contracting parties nor intended third-party beneficiaries of the contract and therefore could not benefit from 390uus waiver.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part. 
Held:Section 390uu does not waive the United States sovereign immunity from petitioners suit.  The provision grants consent to join the United States as a necessary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate certain rights under a federal reclamation contract.  (Emphasis added.)  A waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.  See, e.g., Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U. S. 255, 261.  In light of this principle, 390uu is best interpreted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties when the action requires construction of a reclamation contract and joinder of the United States is necessary.  It does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone.


This interpretation draws support from 390uus use of the words necessary party, a term of art whose meaning calls to mind Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a)s requirements for joinder of parties.  The interpretation also draws support from the contrast between 390uus language, which speaks in terms of joinder, and the broader phrasing of other statutes, e.g., the Tucker Act, that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone.  Petitioners suit, brought solely against the United States and its agents, is not an attempt to join the United States as a necessary party defendant under 390uu.  Pp.58.
358 F.3d 1137, affirmed.

certiorari to the supreme court of connecticut
No. 04108.Argued February 22, 2005Decided June 23, 2005
After approving an integrated development plan designed to revitalize its ailing economy, respondent city, through its development agent, purchased most of the property earmarked for the project from willing sellers, but initiated condemnation proceedings when petitioners, the owners of the rest of the property, refused to sell.  Petitioners brought this state-court action claiming, inter alia, that the taking of their properties would violate the public use restriction in the Fifth Amendments Takings Clause.  The trial court granted a permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the some of the properties, but denying relief as to others.  Relying on cases such as Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, and Berman v. Parker, 348 U. S. 26, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the proposed takings.
Held:The citys proposed disposition of petitioners property qualifies as a public use within the meaning of the Takings Clause.  Pp.620.
(a)Though the city could not take petitioners land simply to confer a private benefit on a particular private party, see, e.g., Midkiff, 467 U. S., at 245, the takings at issue here would be executed pursuant to a carefully considered development plan, which was not adopted to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals, ibid.  Moreover, while the city is not planning to open the condemned landat least not in its entiretyto use by the general public, this Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the  public.  Id., at 244.  Rather, it has embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as public purpose.  See, e.g., Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, 164 U. S. 112, 158164.  Without exception, the Court has defined that concept broadly, reflecting its longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments as to what public needs justify the use of the takings power.  Berman, 348 U. S. 26; Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229; Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986.  Pp.613.


(b)The citys determination that the area at issue was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to deference.  The city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other exercises in urban planning and development, the city is trying to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational land uses, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  To effectuate this plan, the city has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development.  Given the plans comprehensive character, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of this Courts review in such cases, it is appropriate here, as it was in Berman, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the Fifth Amendment.  P.13.


(c)Petitioners proposal that the Court adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use is supported by neither precedent nor logic.  Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted governmental function, and there is no principled way of distinguishing it from the other public purposes the Court has recognized.  See, e.g., Berman, 348 U. S., at 24.  Also rejected is petitioners argument that for takings of this kind the Court should require a reasonable certainty that the expected public benefits will actually accrue.  Such a rule would represent an even greater departure from the Courts precedent.  E.g., Midkiff, 467 U. S., at 242.  The disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially pronounced in this type of case, where orderly implementation of a comprehensive plan requires all interested parties legal rights to be established before new construction can commence.

			"|"KELO etal. v. CITY OF NEW LONDON etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of connecticut
No. 04108.Argued February 22, 2005Decided June 23, 2005
After approving an integrated development plan designed to revitalize its ailing economy, respondent city, through its development agent, purchased most of the property earmarked for the project from willing sellers, but initiated condemnation proceedings when petitioners, the owners of the rest of the property, refused to sell.  Petitioners brought this state-court action claiming, inter alia, that the taking of their properties would violate the public use restriction in the Fifth Amendments Takings Clause.  The trial court granted a permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the some of the properties, but denying relief as to others.  Relying on cases such as Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, and Berman v. Parker, 348 U. S. 26, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the proposed takings.
Held:The citys proposed disposition of petitioners property qualifies as a public use within the meaning of the Takings Clause.  Pp.620.
(a)Though the city could not take petitioners land simply to confer a private benefit on a particular private party, see, e.g., Midkiff, 467 U. S., at 245, the takings at issue here would be executed pursuant to a carefully considered development plan, which was not adopted to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals, ibid.  Moreover, while the city is not planning to open the condemned landat least not in its entiretyto use by the general public, this Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the  public.  Id., at 244.  Rather, it has embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as public purpose.  See, e.g., Fallbrook Irrigation Dist. v. Bradley, 164 U. S. 112, 158164.  Without exception, the Court has defined that concept broadly, reflecting its longstanding policy of deference to legislative judgments as to what public needs justify the use of the takings power.  Berman, 348 U. S. 26; Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229; Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986.  Pp.613.


(b)The citys determination that the area at issue was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to deference.  The city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other exercises in urban planning and development, the city is trying to coordinate a variety of commercial, residential, and recreational land uses, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  To effectuate this plan, the city has invoked a state statute that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote economic development.  Given the plans comprehensive character, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the limited scope of this Courts review in such cases, it is appropriate here, as it was in Berman, to resolve the challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unquestionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the Fifth Amendment.  P.13.


(c)Petitioners proposal that the Court adopt a new bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as a public use is supported by neither precedent nor logic.  Promoting economic development is a traditional and long accepted governmental function, and there is no principled way of distinguishing it from the other public purposes the Court has recognized.  See, e.g., Berman, 348 U. S., at 24.  Also rejected is petitioners argument that for takings of this kind the Court should require a reasonable certainty that the expected public benefits will actually accrue.  Such a rule would represent an even greater departure from the Courts precedent.  E.g., Midkiff, 467 U. S., at 242.  The disadvantages of a heightened form of review are especially pronounced in this type of case, where orderly implementation of a comprehensive plan requires all interested parties legal rights to be established before new construction can commence.  The Court declines to second-guess the wisdom of the means the city has selected to effectuate its plan.  Berman, 348 U. S., at 26.  Pp. 1320. 
 268 Conn. 1, 843 A.2d 500, affirmed.

04-563|"MAYLE, WARDEN v. FELIX
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04563.Argued April 19, 2005Decided June 23, 2005
Respondent Felix was convicted of murder and robbery in California state court and sentenced to life imprisonment.  His current application for federal habeas relief centers on two alleged trial-court errors, both involving the admission of out-of-court statements during the prosecutors case-in-chief but otherwise unrelated.  Felix had made inculpatory statements during pretrial police interrogation.  He alleged that those statements were coerced, and that their admission violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  He also alleged that the admission of a videotape recording of testimony of a prosecution witness violated the Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause.


Felixs conviction was affirmed on appeal and became final on August 12, 1997.  Under the one-year limitation period imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1), Felix had until August 12, 1998 to file a habeas petition in federal court.  On May 8, 1998, in a timely filed habeas petition, Felix asserted his Confrontation Clause challenge to admission of the videotaped prosecution witness testimony, but did not then challenge the admission of his own pretrial statements.  On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 1998 expiration of AEDPAs time limit and eight months after the court appointed counsel to represent him, Felix filed an amended petition asserting a Fifth Amendment objection to admission of his pretrial statements.  In response to the States argument that the Fifth Amendment claim was time barred, Felix asserted the rule that pleading amendments relate back to the filing date of the original pleading when both the original plea and the amendment arise out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth  in the original pleading, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.15(c)(2).  Because his Fifth Amendment and Confrontation Clause claims challenged the constitutionality of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged, both claims arose out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.  The District Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time barred, and rejected the Confrontation Clause claim on its merits.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed as to the latter claim, but reversed the dismissal of the coerced statements claim and remanded it for further proceedings.  In the courts view, the relevant transaction for Rule 15(c)(2) purposes was Felixs state-court trial and conviction.  Defining transaction with greater specificity, the court reasoned, would unduly strain the meaning of conduct, transaction, or occurrence by dividing the trial and conviction into a series of individual occurrences.  
Held:An amended habeas petition does not relate back (and thereby avoid AEDPAs one-year time limit) when it asserts a new ground for relief supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those set forth in the original pleading.  Pp.718.
(a)Under 2244(d)(1), a one-year limitation period applies to a state prisoners federal habeas application.  Habeas Corpus Rule 11 permits application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in habeas cases to the extent [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions or [the habeas] rules.  Section 2242 provides that habeas applications may be amended  as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) allows pleading amendments with leave of court any time during a proceeding.  Before a responsive pleading is served, pleadings may be amended once as a matter of course, i.e., without seeking court leave.  Ibid.  Amendments made after the statute of limitations has run relate back to the date of the original pleading if the original and amended pleadings ar[i]se out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence.  Rule 15(c)(2).  The original pleading in a habeas proceeding is the petition as initially filed.  That pleading must specify all the grounds for relief available to the petitioner and state the facts supporting each ground.  Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c).  A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)s demand that petitioners plead with particularity is to assist the district court in determining whether the State should be ordered to show cause why the writ should not be granted, 2243, or the petition instead should be summarily dismissed without ordering a responsive pleading.  Habeas Corpus Rule 4.  Pp.79.


(b)Under the Ninth Circuits comprehensive definition of conduct, transaction, or occurrence, virtually any new claim introduced in an amended habeas petition will relate back, for federal habeas claims, by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto.  The majority of Circuits define conduct, transaction, or occurrence in federal habeas cases far less broadly, allowing relation back only when the claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely filed claims, and not when the new claims depend upon events separate in both time and type from the originally raised episodes.  Under that view, Felixs own pretrial statements, newly raised in his amended petition, would not relate back because they were separated in time and type from the videotaped witness testimony.  This Court is not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings Rule 15 governs, of any reading of conduct, transaction, or occurrence as capacious as the Ninth Circuits construction for habeas cases.  Decisions applying Rule 15(c)(2) in the civil context illustrate that Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a common core of operative facts uniting the original and newly asserted claims.  The Court disagrees with Felixs assertion that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)s relation-back provision than was given the words conduct, transaction, or occurrence in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R.Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580581.  There, the amended complaint invoked a legal theory not suggested in the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.  Relation back was nevertheless permitted.  In Tiller, however, there was but one occurrence, the death of the petitioners husband, which she attributed throughout to the respondents failure to provide a safe workplace.  In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes, the videotaped witness testimony in his original petition and his own interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.  Pp.913.


Felixs contention that the trial itself is the appropriate transaction or occurrence artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes those claims actionable in a habeas proceeding.  Although his self-incrimination claim did not ripen until the prosecutor introduced his pretrial statements at trial, the essential predicate for his Fifth Amendment claim was an extrajudicial event, i.e., an out-of-court police interrogation.  The dispositive question in an adjudication of that claim would be the character of the police interrogation, specifically, did Felix answer voluntarily or were his statements coerced.  See Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 513514.  Under Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c)s particularity-in-pleading requirement, Felixs Confrontation Clause claim would be pleaded discretely, as would his self-incrimination claim.  Each separate congeries of facts supporting the grounds for relief, the Rule suggests, would delineate an occurrence.  Felixs and the Ninth Circuits approach is boundless by comparison, allowing a miscellany of claims for relief to be raised later rather than sooner and to relate back.  If claims asserted after the one-year period could be revived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim, AEDPAs limitation period would have slim significance.  Pp.1316.


Felixs argument that a firm check against petition amendments presenting new, discrete claims after AEDPAs limitation period has run is provided by Rule 15(a)which gives district courts discretion to deny petition amendments once a responsive pleading has been filedoverlooks a pleaders right to amend without leave of court any time before a responsive pleading is served.  That time can be long under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, pursuant to which a petition is not served until  the judge first examines it to determine whether it plainly appears  that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.  This Courts reading that relation back will be in order so long as the original and amended petitions state claims that are tied to a common core of operative facts is consistent with Rule 15(c)(2)s general application in civil cases, with Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), and with AEDPAs tight time line for petitions.  Pp.1618.
379 F.3d 612, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and OConnor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined.

Petitioners federal habeas corpus petition was dismissed as time barred when the District Court concluded that the federal limitations period was not tolled while petitioners motion for postconviction relief was pending in state court.  After petitioner abandoned his attempt to seek review of the District Courts decision, this Court decided that a state postconviction relief petition can toll the federal statute of limitations even if, like petitioners, the petition is ultimately dismissed as procedurally barred.  Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4.  Petitioner filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the judgment, which the District Court denied.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the denial, holding that the Rule 60(b) motion was in substance a second or successive habeas petition, which under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.C. 2244(b), cannot be filed without precertification by the court of appeals.
Held:
1.Because petitioners Rule 60(b) motion challenged only the District Courts previous ruling on AEDPAs statute of limitations, it is not the equivalent of a successive habeas petition and can be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Eleventh Circuit.  Pp.311.


(a)Rule 60(b) applies in 2254 habeas proceedings only to the extent that [it is] not inconsistent with applicable federal statutes and rules.  2254 Rule 11.  Because 2244(b) applies only where a court acts pursuant to a prisoners habeas corpus application, the question here is whether a Rule 60(b) motion is such an application.  The text of 2244(b) shows that, for these purposes, a habeas application is a filing containing one or more claims.  Other federal habeas statutes and this Courts decisions also make clear that a claim is an asserted federal basis for relief from a state-court conviction.  If a Rule 60(b) motion contains one or more claims, the motion is, if not in substance a habeas corpus application, at least similar enough that failing to subject it to AEDPAs restrictions on successive habeas petitions would be inconsistent with the statute.  A Rule 60(b) motion can be said to bring a claim if it seeks to add a new ground for relief from the state conviction or attacks the federal courts previous resolution of a claim on the merits, though not if it merely attacks a defect in the federal habeas proceedings integrity.  Pp. 38.


(b)When no claim is presented, there is no basis for contending that a Rule 60(b) motion should be treated like a habeas petition.  If neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movants state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed on its own terms creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.  Petitioners motion, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied 2244(d)s statute of limitations, fits this description.  Nothing in Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, suggests that entertaining a filing confined to a nonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceeding is inconsistent with AEDPA.  Pp. 811.


2.Under the proper Rule 60(b) standards, the District Court was correct to deny relief.  The change in the law worked by Artuz is not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief under Rule 60(b)(6), and it is made all the less extraordinary by the lack of diligence that petitioner showed in seeking direct appellate review of the statute-of-limitations issue.

The First Circuit ruled that the girl, but not her family, had alleged the requisite amount, and then held that supplemental jurisdiction over the familys claims was improper because original jurisdiction is lacking in a diversity case if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.
Held:Where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies 1332(a)s amount-in-controversy requirement, 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the requisite amount.  Pp.425.
(a)Although district courts may not exercise jurisdiction absent a statutory basis, once a court has original jurisdiction over some claims in an action, it may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims arising from the same case or controversy.  See Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715.  This expansive interpretation does not apply to 1332s complete diversity requirement, for incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdiction with respect to all claims, leaving nothing to which supplemental claims can adhere.  But other statutory prerequisites, including the federal-question and amount-in-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim.  Before 1367 was enacted, every plaintiff had to separately satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement, Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583; Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291, and the grant of original jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties did not itself confer supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims involving other parties, Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 556.  Pp.49.


(b)All parties here agree that 1367 overturned Finley, but there is no warrant for assuming that is all it did.  To determine 1367s scope requires examination of the statutes text in light of context, structure, and related statutory provisions.  Section 1367(a) is a broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction over other claims within the same case or controversy, as long as the action is one in which district courts would have original jurisdiction.  Its last sentence makes clear that this grant extends to claims involving joinder or intervention of additional parties.  The question here is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some, but not all, plaintiffs satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement qualifies as a civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, 1367(a).  Pp.911.


(c)The answer must be yes.  When a well-pleaded complaint has at least one claim satisfying the amount-in-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant jurisdictional defects, the district court, beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim.  A court with original jurisdiction over a single claim in the complaint has original jurisdiction over a civil action under 1367(a), even if that action comprises fewer claims than were included in the complaint.  Once a court has original jurisdiction over the action, it can then decide whether it has a constitutional and statutory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over other claims in the action.  Section 1367(b), which contains exceptions to 1367(a)s broad rule, does not withdraw supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the additional parties here.  In fact, its exceptions support this Courts conclusion.  Pp.1113.


(d)The Court cannot accept the alternative view, or its supporting theories, that a district court lacks original jurisdiction over a civil action unless it has original jurisdiction over every claim in the complaint.  The indivisibility theorythat all claims must stand or fall as a single, indivisible actionis inconsistent with the whole notion of supplemental jurisdiction and is belied by this Courts practice of allowing federal courts to cure jurisdictional defects by dismissing the offending parties instead of the entire action.  And the statutes broad and general language does not permit the theory to apply in diversity cases when it does not apply in federal-question cases.  The contamination theorythat inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district courts original jurisdiction contaminates every other claim in the complaintmakes sense with respect to the complete diversity requirement because a nondiverse partys presence eliminates the justification for a federal forum.  But it makes little sense with regard to the amount-in-controversy requirement, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufficiently important to warrant federal-court attention.  It is fallacious to suppose, simply from the proposition that 1332 imposes both requirements, that the contamination theory germane to the former also applies to the latter.  This Court has already considered and rejected a virtually identical argument in the closely analogous removal-jurisdiction context.  See Chicago v. International College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156.  Pp.1319.


(e)In light of the statutes text and structure, 1367s only plausible reading is that a court has original jurisdiction over a civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect.  Though a single nondiverse party can contaminate every other claim in a lawsuit, contamination does not occur with respect to jurisdictional defects going only to the substantive importance of individual claims.  Thus, 1367(a)s threshold requirement is satisfied in cases, such as these, where some but not all of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufficient amount in controversy.  Section 1367 by its plain text overruled Clark and Zahn and authorized supplemental jurisdiction over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same case or controversy, subject only to enumerated exceptions not applicable here.  P.19.


(f)Because 1367 is not ambiguous, this Court need not examine other interpretative tools, including legislative history.  Even were it appropriate to do so, the Court would not give the legislative history significant weight.  Pp. 1924.


(g)The Class Action Fairness Act has no impact on the analysis of these cases.  Pp.2425.

No. 0470.Argued March 1, 2005Decided June 23, 2005
In No. 0470, Exxon dealers filed a class action against Exxon Corporation, invoking the Federal District Courts 28 U. S.C. 1332(a) diversity jurisdiction.  After the dealers won a jury verdict, the court certified the case for interlocutory review on the question whether it had properly exercised 1367 supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of class members who had not met 1332(a)s minimum amount-in-controversy requirement.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld this extension of supplemental jurisdiction.  In No. 0479, a girl and her family sought damages from Star-Kist Foods, Inc., in a diversity action.

03-1230|"AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS, INC., etal. v. MICHIGAN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION etal.
certiorari to the court of appeals of michigan
No. 031230.Argued April 26, 2005Decided June 20, 2005 
Petitioners, a trucking company engaged in both interstate and intrastate hauling and a trucking association, asked Michigan courts to invalidate the States flat $100 annual fee imposed on trucks engaged in intrastate commercial hauling, see Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. 478.2(1), claiming that it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate trade because trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engage in less intrastate business than trucks carrying only intrastate loads.  The State Court of Claims rejected the claim, holding that, because the fee is regulatory and intended for the Michigan Motor Carrier Acts administration, it is not amenable to apportionment; that it is an appropriate exercise of the States police power; and that it does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate commerce.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, and the State Supreme Court declined review.
Held:Michigans fee does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.  That Clause prevents a State from jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole by plac[ing] burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear.  Oklahoma Tax Commn v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 180.  Applying this Courts dormant Commerce Clause principles and precedents here, nothing in 478.2(1) offends the Commerce Clause.  The flat fee is imposed only on intrastate transactions.  It does not facially discriminate against interstate or out-of-state activities or enterprises.  It applies evenhandedly to all carriers making domestic journeys and does not reflect an effort to tax activity taking place outside of the State.  Nothing in this Courts case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.  That is not surprising, since States impose numerous flat fees on local business and service providers, e.g., insurers and auctioneers.  The Constitution neither displaces States authority to shelter their people from health and safety menaces nor unduly curtails their power to lay taxes to support state government.  The record, moreover, shows no special circumstances suggesting that Michigans fee operates as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the States police power.  Neither does it show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers.  Because the costs the fee seeks to defray, e.g., those of regulating vehicular size and weight, would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than per-mile traveled, a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair.  And petitioners provide no details of their preferred alternative miles-traveled system or point to evidence of its practicality.  Nor is there any reason to infer that the States lump-sum levy on purely local activity erects an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.  American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, distinguished.  As for petitioners internal consistency argumentthat if every State did the same as Michigan, an interstate trucker doing local business in multiple States would have to pay a fee of several hundred or thousand dollarsany interstate firm with local outlets normally expects to pay local fees uniformly assessed on all those engaging in local business.

certiorari to the court of appeals of michigan
No. 031234.Argued April 26, 2005Decided June 20, 2005
Federal law requires most interstate truckers to obtain a permit (Federal Permit) that reflects compliance with certain federal requirements.  The 1965 version of the law authorized States to require proof that a truck operator had such a permit.  By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof, requiring a $10 per truck registration fee (State Registration) and giving each trucker a stamp to affix to a multistate bingo card carried in the vehicle.  Finding this scheme inefficient and burdensome, Congress created the current Single State Registration System (SSRS), which allows a trucking company to fill out one set of forms in one State (base State), thereby registering its Federal Permit in every participating State through which its trucks travel.  49 U. S.C. 14504(c).  The base State can demand proof of the Federal Permit, proof of insurance, the name of an agent to receive service of process, and a fee equal to the sum of the individual state fees.  14504(c)(2)(A)(i)(iv).  The SSRS prohibits a State from imposing any additional State registration requirement.  14504(b).  Michigan Comp. Laws Ann. 478.2(2) imposes an annual $100 fee on each Michigan license-plated truck operating entirely in interstate commerce.  Petitioner interstate trucking companies subject to 478.2(2) sought to have it invalidated, but the Michigan Court of Claims refused.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that, because the fee is imposed for the administration of the States Motor Carrier Act and for enforcement of state safety regulations, it is not a registration requirement pre-empted by 14504(b).
Held:Section 14504 does not pre-empt Michigans $100 fee.  Pp.513.
(a)Reference to text, historical context, and purpose disclose that the words State registration requirement in 14504(b)s second sentence apply only to those state requirements concerning SSRS registration.  Statutory language makes clear that the federal provision reaches no further.  The subsections first sentence uses the words State registration to refer only to state systems seeking evidence that a trucker has complied with the specific SSRS obligations enumerated in 14504(c)(2)(A)(i)(iv).  No language in the second sentence suggests that the same words should be given a different, broader meaning there.  Nor does any language elsewhere in the statute suggest that State registration requirement refers to any kind of State Registration whatsoever that might affect interstate carriers, or to those state requirements imposed by reason of a motor carriers operation in interstate commerce.  The implementing regulations also do not support a broader meaning.  Historical context confirms this reading.  Congress enacted 14504 to simplify the bingo card system, which placed no constraints on any state filings or fees other than those concerning Federal Permit and insurance requirements.  In creating the SSRS, Congress gave no indication that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.  Finally, nothing in the statutes basic purposes or objectivesimproving the bingo card systems efficiency and simplifying a uniform scheme for providing States with certain vital informationeither requires a broader reading of the statutory term or impliedly pre-empts non-SSRS-related state rules.  Pp.511.


(b)Section 478.2(2)s requirements do not concern the SSRSs subject matter.  First, the Michigan statute makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, an insurance requirement, or an agent for receiving service of process.  Nor do any state rules related to the fee appear to require the filing of information on these matters.  In addition, because Michigan imposed its separate fee before the SSRS existed and before it began to participate in the bingo card system, the fee does not represent an effort to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal Permits.  Finally, petitioners have failed to show that Michigan rules do not allow a Michigan-plated interstate truck choosing Michigan as its base State to comply with the SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with 478.2(2).  The fact that Michigan appears to forgive the States $10 SSRS fee for trucks that comply with 478.2(2) can be seen as an effort to provide a modest, administratively efficient recompense to those motor carriers that choose Michigan as their base State, but such a subsidiary connection cannot transform the States fee into a requirement concerning the SSRS statutes subject matter.

Section 3731(b) provides that [a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought  more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.  In 2001, respondent Wilson brought an FCA qui tam action against petitioners, along with an FCA retaliation claim.  Petitioner Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District employed Wilson as a secretary.  Wilson alleged that petitioner county officials retaliated against her for alerting federal officials to the purported fraud and for cooperating with the ensuing investigation, ultimately forcing her 1997 resignation from the District.  Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss the retaliation claim as untimely, on the ground that North Carolinas 3-year statute of limitations governed Wilsons FCA action and barred it.  Reversing, the Fourth Circuit found it unnecessary to borrow a state limitations period because one was supplied by 3731(b)(1).
Held:Section 3731(b)(1)s limitations period does not govern 3730(h) retaliation actions.  Instead, the most closely analogous state statute of limitations applies.  Pp.413.
(a)To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by federal statute, this Court asks first whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period.  If not, the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.  Pp.45.


(b)Section 3730(h) is a subsection of 3730, but 3731(b)(1) is nonetheless ambiguous about whether a 3730(h) retaliation action is a civil action under section 3730 as that phrase is used in 3731(b)(1).  Another reasonable reading is that 3731(b)(1)s limitations period applies only to 3730(a) and (b) actions.  Section 3731(b)(1) starts the limitations period running on the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, that is, on the date the false claim was actually submitted.  That language casts doubt on whether 3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions.  For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if 3731(b)(1) is applicable.  By contrast, the section naturally applies to well-pleaded 3370(a) and (b) actions.  Those actions require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim and therefore necessarily specify when 3731(b)(1)s time limit begins.  At a minimum this anomaly shows that 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether action under section 3730 means all actions arising under that section.  Pp.57.


(c)Two considerations show that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only 3370(a) and (b) actions.  First, the very next subsection, 3730(c), uses the similarly unqualified phrase action brought under section 3730 to refer only to 3370(a) and (b) actions.  Second, reading 3731(b)(1) to apply only to those actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.  Where, as here, there are two plausible constructions, this Court should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.  This approach resolves 3731(b)(1)s ambiguity in petitioners favor.  Reading 3731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues, for the likely analogous state statutes virtually all start when the retaliatory action occurs.  However, under the reading favored by Wilson and the Government, the limitations period would begin at best on the date an actual or suspected FCA violation occurred, which would precede the retaliatory conduct.  Pp.712.


(d)The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance the appropriate state statute of limitations to borrow.  Pp.1213.

04-340|"SAN REMO HOTEL, L.P., etal. v. CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04340.Argued March 28, 2005Decided June 20, 2005
Petitioners, hoteliers in respondent city, initiated this litigation over the application of an ordinance requiring them to pay a $567,000 fee for converting residential rooms to tourist rooms.  They initially sought mandamus in California state court, but that action was stayed when they filed suit in Federal District Court asserting, inter alia, facial and as-applied challenges to the ordinance under the Fifth Amendments Takings Clause.  Although the District Court granted the city summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit abstained from ruling on the facial challenge under Railroad Commn of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, because the pending state mandamus action could moot the federal question.  The court did, however, affirm the District Courts ruling that the as-applied claim was unripe.  Back in state court, petitioners attempted to reserve the right to return to federal court for adjudication of their federal takings claims.  Ultimately, the California courts rejected petitioners various state-law takings claims, and they returned to the Federal District Court, advancing a series of federal takings claims that depended on issues identical to those previously resolved in the state courts.  In order to avoid being barred from suit by the general rule of issue preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt their federal takings claims from the reach of the full faith and credit statute, 28 U. S.C. 1738.  Relying on the Williamson County Regional Planning Commn v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 195, holding that takings claims are not ripe until a State fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking, petitioners argued that, unless courts disregard 1738 in takings cases, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state court without any realistic possibility of ever obtaining federal review.  Holding, inter alia, that petitioners facial attack was barred by issue preclusion, the District Court reasoned that 1738 requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any state-court judgment that would have such effect under the States laws.  The court added that because California courts had interpreted the relevant substantive state takings law coextensively with federal law, petitioners federal claims constituted the same claims the state courts had already resolved.  Affirming, the Ninth Circuit rejected petitioners contention that general preclusion principles should be cast aside whenever plaintiffs must litigate in state court under Pullman and/or Williamson County.  
Held:This Court will not create an exception to the full faith and credit statute in order to provide a federal forum for litigants seeking to advance federal takings claims.  Pp.1123.
(a)The Court rejects petitioners contention that whenever plaintiffs reserve their federal takings claims in state court under England v. Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, federal courts should review the reserved federal claims de novo, regardless of what issues the state court may have decided or how it may have decided them.  The England Courts discussion of the typical case in which reservations of federal issues are appropriate makes clear that the decision was aimed at cases fundamentally distinct from petitioners.  England cases generally involve federal constitutional challenges to a state statute that can be avoided if a state court construes the statute in a particular manner.  Id., at 420.  In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that is functionally identical to the federal question, but to avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-law determination that may moot the federal controversy.  See id., at 416417, and n.7.  Additionally, the Court made clear that the effective reservation of a federal claim was dependent on the condition that plaintiffs take no action to broaden the scope of the state courts review beyond deciding the antecedent state-law issue.  Id., at 419.  Because the Ninth Circuit invoked Pullman abstention after determining that a ripe federal question existed as to the petitioners facial takings challenge, they were entitled to insulate from preclusive effect that one federal issue while they returned to state court to resolve their mandamus petition.  Petitioners, however, chose to advance broader issues than the limited ones in the mandamus petition, putting forth facial and as-applied takings challenges to the city ordinance in their state action.  By doing so, they effectively asked the state court to resolve the same federal issue they had previously asked it to reserve.  England does not support the exercise of any such right.  Petitioners as-applied takings claims fare no better.  The Ninth Circuit found those claims unripe under Williamson County, and therefore affirmed their dismissal.  They were never properly before the District Court, and there was no reason to expect that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedings.  Pp.1117.


(b)Federal courts are not free to disregard 1738 simply to guarantee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federal court.  Petitioners misplace their reliance on the Second Circuits Santini decision, which held that parties who are forced to litigate their state-law takings claims in state court pursuant to Williamson County cannot be precluded from having those very claims resolved by a federal court.  The Santini courts reasoning is unpersuasive for several reasons.  First, both petitioners and Santini ultimately depend on an assumption that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federal claims in a federal forum.  This Court has repeatedly held to the contrary.  See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 103104.  Second, petitioners argument assumes that courts may simply create exceptions to 1738 wherever they deem them appropriate.  However, this Court has held that no such exception will be recognized unless a later statute contains an express or implied partial repeal.  E.g., Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 468.  Congress has not expressed any intent to exempt federal takings claims from 1738.  Third, petitioners have overstated Williamson Countys reach throughout this litigation.  Because they were never required to ripen in state court their claim that the city ordinance was facially invalid for failure to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, see Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534, they could have raised the heart of their facial takings challenges directly in federal court.  With respect to those federal claims that did require ripening, petitioners are incorrect that Williamson County precludes state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiffs request for compensation under state law together with a claim that, in the alternative, the denial of compensation would violate the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  Pp.1723.
364 F.3d 1088, affirmed.
Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Scalia, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Rehnquist, C.J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which OConnor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 045286.Argued March 22, 2005Decided June 20, 2005
On April 4, 2001, petitioner Dodd filed a pro se motion under 28 U. S.C. 2255, claiming that his conviction for knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U. S.C. 841 and 846, should be set aside because it was contrary to Richardson v. United States, 526 U. S. 813, 815, which held that a jury must agree unanimously that a defendant is guilty of each of the specific violations that together constitute the continuing criminal enterprise.  The District Court held that, because Richardson had been decided more than one year before Dodd filed his motion, the motion was untimely under 2255, 6(3), which provides that 2255s 1-year limitation period begins to run on the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.  On appeal, Dodd argued that 6(3)s limitation period began to run on April 19, 2002, the date the Eleventh Circuit recognized Richardsons retroactive application to cases on collateral review.  The Eleventh Circuit held that the period began to run on June 1, 1999, the date that this Court initially decided Richardson.
Held: 
1.The 1-year limitation period under 6(3) begins to run on the date on which this Court initially recognized the right asserted in an applicants motion, not the date on which that right was made retroactive.  The text of 6(3) unequivocally identifies one, and only one, date from which the limitation period is measured: the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.  This Court presumes that a legislature says what it means and means what it says in a statute.  Dodds reliance on 6(3)s second clause to identify the operative date is misplaced.  That clause merely limits the subsections applicability to cases in which applicants assert rights newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.  Thus, 6(3)s datethe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Courtdoes not apply at all unless the conditions in the second clause are satisfied.  This result may make it difficult for applicants filing second or successive 2255 motions to obtain relief, since this Court rarely announces a new rule of constitutional law and makes it retroactive within a year, but the Court is not free to rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted.

04-5462|"ROMPILLA v. BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 045462.Argued January 18, 2005Decided June 20, 2005
Petitioner Rompilla was convicted of murder and other crimes.  During the penalty phase, the jury found the aggravating factors that the murder was committed during a felony, that it was committed by torture, and that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence.  In mitigation, five members of Rompillas family beseeched the jury for mercy.  He was sentenced to death, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  His new lawyers filed for state postconviction relief, claiming ineffective assistance by his trial counsel in failing to present significant mitigating evidence about Rompillas childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism.  The state courts found that trial counsel had sufficiently investigated the mitigation possibilities.  Rompilla then raised inadequate representation in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court found that the State Supreme Court had unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.

In reversing, the Third Circuit found nothing unreasonable in the state courts application of Strickland, given defense counsels efforts to uncover mitigation evidence from Rompilla, certain family members, and three mental health experts.  The court distinguished Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510in which counsel had failed to investigate adequately to the point of ignoring the leads their limited enquiry yieldednoting that, although trial counsel did not unearth useful information in Rompillas school, medical, police, and prison records, their investigation had gone far enough to give them reason to think that further efforts would not be a wise use of their limited resources. 
Held:Even when a capital defendant and his family members have suggested that no mitigating evidence is available, his lawyer is bound to make reasonable efforts to obtain and review material that counsel knows the prosecution will probably rely on as evidence of aggravation at the trials sentencing phase.  Pp.418.
(a)Rompillas entitlement to federal habeas relief turns on showing that the state courts resolution of his ineffective-assistance claim under Strickland resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by this Court, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  The state courts result must be not only incorrect but also objectively unreasonable.  Wiggins, supra, at 520521.  In judging the defenses investigation in preparing for a capital trials sentencing phase, hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to counsels perspective at the time investigative decisions were made and by giving deference to counsels judgments.  Strickland, supra, at 689, 691.  Pp.45.


(b)Here, the lawyers were deficient in failing to examine the court file on Rompillas prior rape and assault conviction.  They knew that the Commonwealth intended to seek the death penalty by proving that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence, that it would attempt to establish this history by proving the prior conviction, and that it would emphasize his violent character by introducing a transcript of the rape victims trial testimony.  Although the prior conviction file was a public record, readily available at the courthouse where Rompilla was to be tried, counsel looked at no part of it until warned by the prosecution a second time, and even then did not examine the entire file.  With every effort to view the facts as a defense lawyer would have at the time, it is difficult to see how counsel could have failed to realize that not examining the file would seriously compromise their opportunity to respond to an aggravation case.  Their duty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they could about the offense the prosecution was going to use certainly included obtaining the Commonwealths own readily available file to learn what it knew about the crime, to discover any mitigating evidence it would downplay, and to anticipate the details it would emphasize.  The obligation to examine the file was particularly pressing here because the violent prior offense was similar to the crime charged and because Rompillas sentencing strategy stressed residual doubt.  This obligation is not just common sense, but is also described in the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, which are guides to determining what is reasonable, Wiggins, supra, at 524.  The state courts conclusion that defense counsels efforts to find mitigating evidence by other means were enough to free them from further enquiry fails to answer the considerations set out here, to the point of being objectively unreasonable.  No reasonable lawyer would forgo examination of the file thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or family relations what they recalled.  Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for school reports, juvenile records, and evidence of drinking habits to the opportunity to take a look at a file disclosing what the prosecutor knows and plans to read from in his case.  Pp.514.


(c)Because the state courts found counsels representation adequate, they never reached the prejudice element of a Strickland claim, whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsels unprofessional errors, the result  would have been different, 466 U. S., at 694.  A de novo examination of this element shows that counsels lapse was prejudicial.  Had they looked at the prior conviction file, they would have found a range of mitigation leads that no other source had opened up.  The imprisonment records contained in that file pictured Rompillas childhood and mental health very differently from anything they had seen or heard.  The accumulated entriese.g., that Rompilla had a series of incarcerations, often related to alcohol; and test results that would have pointed the defenses mental health experts to schizophrenia and other disorderswould have destroyed the benign conception of Rompillas upbringing and mental capacity counsel had formed from talking to five family members and from the mental health experts reports.  Further effort would presumably have unearthed much of the material postconviction counsel found.  Alerted to the school, medical, and prison records that trial counsel never saw, postconviction counsel found red flags pointing up a need for further testing, which revealed organic brain damage and childhood problems probably related to fetal alcohol syndrome.  These findings in turn would probably have prompted a look at easily available school and juvenile records, which showed additional problems, including evidence of a highly abusive home life.  The evidence adds up to a mitigation case bearing no relation to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury.  The undiscovered mitigating evidence, taken as a whole, might well have influenced the jurys appraisal of [Rompillas] culpability, Wiggins, supra, at 538, and the likelihood of a different result had the evidence gone in is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome actually reached at sentencing, Strickland, supra, at 694.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 045462.Argued January 18, 2005Decided June 20, 2005
Petitioner Rompilla was convicted of murder and other crimes.  During the penalty phase, the jury found the aggravating factors that the murder was committed during a felony, that it was committed by torture, and that Rompilla had a significant history of felony convictions indicating the use or threat of violence.  In mitigation, five members of Rompillas family beseeched the jury for mercy.  He was sentenced to death, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  His new lawyers filed for state postconviction relief, claiming ineffective assistance by his trial counsel in failing to present significant mitigating evidence about Rompillas childhood, mental capacity and health, and alcoholism.  The state courts found that trial counsel had sufficiently investigated the mitigation possibilities.  Rompilla then raised inadequate representation in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court found that the State Supreme Court had unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, concluding that trial counsel had not investigated obvious signs that Rompilla had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental illness and alcoholism, unjustifiably relying instead on Rompillas own description of an unexceptional background.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 031237.Argued April 20, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
It is not an act of [patent] infringement to  use  or import into the United States a patented invention  solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates the  use  of drugs.  35 U. S.C. 271(e)(1).  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) is such a law.  Under the FDCA, a drug maker must submit research data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an investigational new drug application (IND) when seeking authorization to conduct human clinical trials, and in a new drug application (NDA) when seeking authorization to market a new drug.  Respondents filed a patent-infringement suit, claiming, inter alia, that petitioner had willfully infringed their patents by supplying respondents RGD peptides to other defendants for use in preclinical research.  Petitioner answered, among other things, that 271(e)(1) exempted its actions from infringement.  The jury found otherwise and awarded damages.  In post-trial motions, the District Court affirmed the jurys award and denied petitioners motion for judgment as a matter of law.  The Federal Circuit affirmed that denial, finding that 271(e)(1)s safe harbor did not apply.  It reversed the District Courts refusal to modify the damages award and remanded for further proceedings.
Held:The use of patented compounds in preclinical studies is protected under 271(e)(1) at least as long as there is a reasonable basis to believe that the compound tested could be the subject of an FDA submission and the experiments will produce the types of information relevant to an IND or NDA.  The statutory text makes clear that 271(e)(1) provides a wide berth for the use of patented drugs in activities related to the federal regulatory process, including uses reasonably related to the development and submission of any information under the FDCA.  Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 665669.  This necessarily includes preclinical studies, both those pertaining to a drugs safety in humans and those related to, e.g., a drugs efficacy and mechanism of action.  Additionally, 271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of patented compounds in preclinical research, even when the patented compounds do not themselves become the subject of an FDA submission.  The reasonable relation requirement cannot be read effectively to limit 271(e)(1)s stated protection of activities leading to FDA approval for all drugs to those activities leading to FDA approval for generic drugs.  Similarly, the use of a patented compound in experiments not themselves included in a submission of information to the FDA does not, standing alone, render the use infringing.  Because the Federal Circuit applied the wrong standard in rejecting petitioners challenge to the jurys finding that petitioner failed to show that its activities were covered by 271(e)(1), the trial evidence has yet to be reviewed under the standard set forth in the jury instruction, and developed in more detail here.

03-9659|"MILLER-EL v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 039659.Argued December 6, 2004Decided June 13, 2005
When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory strikes against 10 of the 11 qualified black venire members during jury selection for petitioner Miller-Els capital murder trial, he objected, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could not be presumed legitimate since the District Attorneys Office had a history of excluding blacks from criminal juries. The trial court denied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death sentence. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, that discrimination by a prosecutor in selecting a defendants jury violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  On remand, the trial court reviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Macalusos justifications for the strikes that were not explained during voir dire, and found no showing that prospective black jurors were struck because of their race.  The State Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Miller-El federal habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.  This Court reversed, finding that the merits of Miller-Els Batson claim were, at least, debatable by jurists of reason.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322. The Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability but rejected Miller-Els Batson claim on the merits.
Held:Miller-El is entitled to prevail on his Batson claim and, thus, entitled to habeas relief.  Pp.333.
(a)[T]his Court consistently and repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State in jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.  Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 44.  The rub has been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination in selections discretionary by nature and subject to a myriad of legitimate influences. The Batson Court held that a defendant can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury selection by the totality of the relevant facts about a prosecutors conduct during the defendants own trial.  476 U. S., at 94.  Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and the trial court must determine if the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination, id., at 98, in light of all relevant circumstances, id., at 9697.  Since this case is on review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U. S.C. 2254, and since the Texas trial courts prior determination that the States race-neutral explanations were true is a factual determination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the trial courts conclusion to be an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(e)(1).  Pp.36.


(b)The prosecutors used peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a disparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342.  More powerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were not.  If a prosecutors proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination.  The details of two panel member comparisons bear out this Courts observation, id., at 343, that the prosecutions reason for exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared to apply equally to some white jurors.  There are strong similarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a black venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death penalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but the differences seem far from significant, particularly when reading Fieldss voir dire testimony in its entirety.  Upon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors explanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death if rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his testimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack veniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were not struck.  The prosecutions reason that Fieldss brother had prior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to enquire about the matter.  The prosecutions proffered reasons for striking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably unlikely.  The fact that the reason for striking him, that he thought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to suffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were selected is evidence of pretext.  The suggestion of pretext is not, moreover, mitigated by Macalusos explanation that Warren was struck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10 remaining peremptory challenges.  Were that the explanation for striking Warren and later accepting similar panel members, prosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was examined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.  Macalusos explanation also weakens any suggestion that the States acceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not in play.  When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had used 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members; and the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel opposed capital punishment.  Because the prosecutors had to exercise prudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel member willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the early-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.  The Fifth Circuits substituted reason for the elimination, Warrens general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a matter of fact and law.  As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about general ambivalence, and Warrens answer to several questions was that he could impose the death penalty.  As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give the reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess the reasons plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it does not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis.  Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason he gave, the Fifth Circuits substitution of a reason for excluding Warren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors burden of stating a racially neutral explanation for their own actions.  Comparing Warrens strike with the treatment of panel members with similar views supports a conclusion that race was significant in determining who was challenged and who was not.  Pp.  619.


(c)The prosecutions broader patterns of practice during jury selection also support the case for discrimination.  Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards bearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are questioned.  Members seated in the back may escape voir dire, for those not questioned by the end of each week are dismissed.  Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number of black members were seated at the front of the panel at the beginning of the second week.  The third week, they shuffled when the first four members were black, placing them in the back.  After the defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared in the front, the court denied the prosecutions request for another shuffle.  No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has ever been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of discriminatory intent from rising to an inference.  The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and nonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to avoid black jurors.  Prosecutors gave a bland description of the death penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking about the individuals feelings on the subject, but used a script describing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53% of the black venire members.  The argument that prosecutors used the graphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not fit the facts.  Black venire members were more likely to receive that script regardless of their expressions of certainty or ambivalence about the death penalty, and the States chosen explanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members who received it: two received it after clearly stating their opposition to the death penalty and two received it even though they unambiguously favored that penalty.  The States explanation misses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks who received the graphic description.  Ambivalent black panel members were also more likely to receive the graphic script than nonblack ambivalent ones.  The States attempt at a race-neutral rationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did.  The explanation that the prosecutors first object was to use the graphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more persuasive than the States explanation, and the reasonable inference is that race was the major consideration when the prosecution chose to follow the graphic script.  The same is true for another kind of disparate questioning.  The prosecutors asked all black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder without telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but prosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members who had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence confirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District Attorneys Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of systematically excluding blacks from juries.  The Miller-El prosecutors notes of the race of each panel member show that they took direction from a jury selection manual that included racial stereotypes.  Pp.1931.


(d)The Fifth Circuits conclusion that Miller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the state courts no-discrimination finding was wrong is as unsupportable as the dismissive and strained interpretation of his evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was entitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344.  Ten of the eleven black venire members were peremptorily struck.  At least two of them were ostensibly acceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty.  The prosecutors chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not hold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair conclusion.  The selection process was replete with evidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential jurors because of race.  And the prosecutors took their cues from a manual on jury selection with an emphasis on race.  It blinks reality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because they were black.  The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.  The state courts contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as erroneous.  Pp. 3233.

S.C. 2254, and since the Texas trial courts prior determination that the States race-neutral explanations were true is a factual determination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the trial courts conclusion to be an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(e)(1).  Pp.36.


(b)The prosecutors used peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a disparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342.  More powerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were not.  If a prosecutors proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination.  The details of two panel member comparisons bear out this Courts observation, id., at 343, that the prosecutions reason for exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared to apply equally to some white jurors.  There are strong similarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a black venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death penalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but the differences seem far from significant, particularly when reading Fieldss voir dire testimony in its entirety.  Upon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors explanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death if rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his testimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack veniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were not struck.  The prosecutions reason that Fieldss brother had prior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to enquire about the matter.  The prosecutions proffered reasons for striking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably unlikely.  The fact that the reason for striking him, that he thought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to suffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were selected is evidence of pretext.  The suggestion of pretext is not, moreover, mitigated by Macalusos explanation that Warren was struck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10 remaining peremptory challenges.  Were that the explanation for striking Warren and later accepting similar panel members, prosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was examined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.  Macalusos explanation also weakens any suggestion that the States acceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not in play.  When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had used 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members; and the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel opposed capital punishment.  Because the prosecutors had to exercise prudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel member willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the early-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.  The Fifth Circuits substituted reason for the elimination, Warrens general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a matter of fact and law.  As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about general ambivalence, and Warrens answer to several questions was that he could impose the death penalty.  As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give the reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess the reasons plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it does not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis.  Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason he gave, the Fifth Circuits substitution of a reason for excluding Warren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors burden of stating a racially neutral explanation for their own actions.  Comparing Warrens strike with the treatment of panel members with similar views supports a conclusion that race was significant in determining who was challenged and who was not.  Pp.  619.


(c)The prosecutions broader patterns of practice during jury selection also support the case for discrimination.  Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards bearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are questioned.  Members seated in the back may escape voir dire, for those not questioned by the end of each week are dismissed.  Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number of black members were seated at the front of the panel at the beginning of the second week.  The third week, they shuffled when the first four members were black, placing them in the back.  After the defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared in the front, the court denied the prosecutions request for another shuffle.  No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has ever been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of discriminatory intent from rising to an inference.  The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and nonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to avoid black jurors.  Prosecutors gave a bland description of the death penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking about the individuals feelings on the subject, but used a script describing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53% of the black venire members.  The argument that prosecutors used the graphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not fit the facts.  Black venire members were more likely to receive that script regardless of their expressions of certainty or ambivalence about the death penalty, and the States chosen explanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members who received it: two received it after clearly stating their opposition to the death penalty and two received it even though they unambiguously favored that penalty.  The States explanation misses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks who received the graphic description.  Ambivalent black panel members were also more likely to receive the graphic script than nonblack ambivalent ones.  The States attempt at a race-neutral rationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did.  The explanation that the prosecutors first object was to use the graphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more persuasive than the States explanation, and the reasonable inference is that race was the major consideration when the prosecution chose to follow the graphic script.  The same is true for another kind of disparate questioning.  The prosecutors asked all black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder without telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but prosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members who had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence confirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District Attorneys Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of systematically excluding blacks from juries.  The Miller-El prosecutors notes of the race of each panel member show that they took direction from a jury selection manual that included racial stereotypes.  Pp.1931.


(d)The Fifth Circuits conclusion that Miller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the state courts no-discrimination finding was wrong is as unsupportable as the dismissive and strained interpretation of his evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was entitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344.  Ten of the eleven black venire members were peremptorily struck.  At least two of them were ostensibly acceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty.  The prosecutors chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not hold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair conclusion.  The selection process was replete with evidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential jurors because of race.  And the prosecutors took their cues from a manual on jury selection with an emphasis on race.  It blinks reality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because they were black.  The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.  The state courts contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as erroneous.  Pp. 3233.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04495.Argued March 30, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
Supermax prisons are maximum security facilities with highly restrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general prison population.  Their use has increased in recent years, in part as a response to the rise in prison gangs and prison violence.  Ohio opened its only Supermax facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its maximum security prisons.  In the OSP almost every aspect of an inmates life is controlled and monitored.  Incarceration there is synonymous with extreme isolation.  Opportunities for visitation are rare and are always conducted through glass walls.  Inmates are deprived of almost any environmental or sensory stimuli and of almost all human contact.  Placement at OSP is for an indefinite period, limited only by an inmates sentence.  Inmates otherwise eligible for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP.


When OSP first became operational, no official policy governing placement there was in effect, and the procedures used to assign inmates to the facility were inconsistent and undefined, resulting in haphazard and erroneous placements.  In an effort to establish guidelines for the selection and classification of OSP inmates, Ohio issued its Policy 11107.  Relevant here are two versions of the policy: the Old Policy and the New Policy.  Because assignment problems persisted after the Old Policy took effect, Ohio promulgated the New Policy to provide more guidance regarding the factors to be considered in placement decisions and to afford inmates more procedural protection against erroneous placement.  Under the New Policy, a prison official conducts a classification review either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e.g., organized crime, or (2) during the incarceration if the inmate engages in specified conduct, e.g., leads a prison gang.  The New Policy also provides for a three-tier review process after a recommendation that an inmate be placed in OSP.  Among other things, the inmate must receive notice of the factual basis leading to consideration for OSP placement and a fair opportunity for rebuttal at a hearing, although he may not call witnesses.  In addition, the inmate is invited to submit objections prior to the final level of review.  Although a subsequent reviewer may overturn an affirmative recommendation for OSP placement at any level, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process terminates.  Ohio also provides for a placement review within 30 days of an inmates initial assignment to OSP, and annual review thereafter.


A class of current and former OSP inmates filed this suit for equitable relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Old Policy, which was then in effect, violated the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.  On the eve of trial, Ohio promulgated its New Policy and represented that it contained the procedures to be followed in the future.  After extensive evidence was presented, the District Court made findings and conclusions and issued a detailed remedial order.  First, relying on Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, the court found that inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.  Second, it found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford many of them notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give them sufficient notice of the grounds for their retention at OSP; and failing to give them sufficient opportunity to understand the reasoning and evidence used to retain them at OSP.  Third, it held that, although the New Policy provided more procedural safeguards than the Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedural due process requirements.  The court therefore ordered modifications to the New Policy, including substantive modifications narrowing the grounds that Ohio could consider in recommending assignment to OSP, and various specific procedural modifications.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Courts conclusion that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding OSP placement and upheld the lower courts procedural modifications in their entirety, but set aside the far-reaching substantive modifications on the ground they exceeded the District Courts authority.  
Held:The procedures by which Ohios New Policy classifies prisoners for placement at its Supermax facility provide prisoners with sufficient protection to comply with the Due Process Clause.  Pp.919.
(a)Inmates have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  Such an interest may arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin, which requires a determination whether OSP assignment imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. 515 U. S., at 483.  The Court is satisfied that assignment to OSP imposes such a hardship compared to any plausible baseline from which to measure the Ohio prison system.  For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not permitted from cell to cell; his cells light may be dimmed, but is on for 24 hours; and he may exercise only one hour per day in a small indoor room.  Save perhaps for the especially severe limitations on all human contact, these conditions likely would apply to most solitary confinement facilities, but here there are two added components.  First is the duration.  Unlike the 30-day placement in segregated confinement at issue in Sandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and, after an initial 30-day review, is reviewed just annually.  Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole consideration.  Taken together these conditions impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context.  Pp.913.


(b)The New Policys procedures are sufficient to satisfy due process.  Evaluating the sufficiency of particular prison procedures requires consideration of three distinct factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the governments interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335.  Applying those factors demonstrates that Ohios New Policy provides a sufficient level of process.  First, the inmates interest in avoiding erroneous placement at OSP, while more than minimal, must nonetheless be evaluated within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties.  The liberty of prisoners in lawful confinement is curtailed by definition, so their procedural protections are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from all confinement.  Second, the risk of an erroneous placement is minimized by the New Policys requirements.  Ohio provides multiple levels of review for any decision recommending OSP placement, with power to overturn the recommendation at each level.  In addition, Ohio reduces the risk of erroneous placement by providing for a placement review within 30 days of an inmates initial assignment to OSP.  Notice of the factual basis for a decision and a fair opportunity for rebuttal are among the most important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.  See, e.g., Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 15.  Third, in the context of prison management and the specific circumstances of this case, Ohios interest is a dominant consideration.  Ohios first obligation must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the public, and the prisoners themselves.  See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 473.  Prison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison gangs, provides the backdrop of the States interest.  Another component of Ohios interest is the problem of scarce resources.  The high cost of maintaining an inmate at OSP would make it difficult to fund more effective education and vocational assistance programs to improve prisoners lives.  Courts must give substantial deference to prison management decisions before mandating additional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards when correctional officials conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behavior.  Were Ohio required to provide other attributes of an adversary hearing before ordering transfer to OSP, both the States immediate objective of controlling the prisoner and its greater objective of controlling the prison could be defeated.  Where, as here, the inquiry draws more on the experience of prison administrators, and where the States interest implicates the safety of other inmates and prison personnel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenholtz and Hewitt provide the appropriate model.  If an inmate were to demonstrate that the New Policy did not in practice operate in the fashion described, any cognizable injury could be the subject of an appropriate future challenge.  In light of the foregoing, the procedural modifications ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Sixth Circuit were in error.  Pp.1319.
372 F.3d 346, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04603.Argued April 18, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
The Internal Revenue Service seized real property owned by petitioner (hereinafter Grable) to satisfy a federal tax delinquency, and gave Grable notice by certified mail before selling the property to respondent (hereinafter Darue).  Grable subsequently brought a quiet title action in state court, claiming that Darues title was invalid because 26 U. S.C. 6335 required the IRS to give Grable notice of the sale by personal service, not certified mail.  Darue removed the case to Federal District Court as presenting a federal question because the title claim depended on an interpretation of federal tax law.  The District Court declined to remand the case, finding that it posed a significant federal-law question, and it granted Darue summary judgment on the merits.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari on the jurisdictional question.
Held:The national interest in providing a federal forum for federal tax litigation is sufficiently substantial to support the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction over the disputed issue on removal.  Pp.311.
(a)Darue was entitled to remove the quiet title action if Grable could have brought it in federal court originally, as a civil action arising under the  laws  of the United States, 28 U. S.C. 1331.  Federal-question jurisdiction is usually invoked by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law, but this Court has also long recognized that such jurisdiction will lie over some state-law claims that implicate significant federal issues, see, e.g., Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180.  Such federal jurisdiction demands not only a contested federal issue, but a substantial one.  And the jurisdiction must be consistent with congressional judgment about the sound division of labor between state and federal courts governing 1331s application.  These considerations have kept the Court from adopting a single test for jurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law claims between nondiverse parties.  Instead, the question is whether the state-law claim necessarily stated a federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing a congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.  Pp.36.


(b)This case warrants federal jurisdiction.  Grable premised its superior title claim on the IRSs failure to give adequate notice, as defined by federal law.  Whether Grable received notice is an essential element of its quiet title claim, and the federal statutes meaning is actually disputed.  The meaning of a federal tax provision is an important federal-law issue that belongs in federal court.  The Government has a strong interest in promptly collecting delinquent taxes, and the IRSs ability to satisfy its claims from delinquents property requires clear terms of notice to assure buyers like Darue that the IRS has good title.  Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a federal-law issue, federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.  This conclusion puts the Court in venerable company, quiet title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims.  E.g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490491.  Pp.67.


(c)Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, is not to the contrary.  There, in finding federal jurisdiction unavailable for a state tort claim resting in part on an allegation that the defendant drug company had violated a federal branding law, the Court noted that Congress had not provided a private federal cause of action for such violations.  Merrell Dow cannot be read to make a federal cause of action a necessary condition for federal-question jurisdiction.  It disclaimed the adoption of any bright-line rule and expressly approved the exercise of jurisdiction in Smith, where there was no federal cause of action.  Accordingly, Merrell Dow should be read in its entirety as treating the absence of such cause as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the sensitive judgments about congressional intent, required by 1331.  Id., at 810.  In Merrell Dow, the principal significance of this absence was its bearing on the consequences to the federal system.  If the federal labeling standard without a cause of action could get a state claim into federal court, so could any other federal standards without causes of action.  And that would mean an enormous number of cases.  A comparable analysis yields a different jurisdictional conclusion here, because state quiet title actions rarely involve contested federal-law issues.  Pp.711.

This conclusion puts the Court in venerable company, quiet title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims.  E.g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490491.  Pp.67.


(c)Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, is not to the contrary.  There, in finding federal jurisdiction unavailable for a state tort claim resting in part on an allegation that the defendant drug company had violated a federal branding law, the Court noted that Congress had not provided a private federal cause of action for such violations.  Merrell Dow cannot be read to make a federal cause of action a necessary condition for federal-question jurisdiction.  It disclaimed the adoption of any bright-line rule and expressly approved the exercise of jurisdiction in Smith, where there was no federal cause of action.  Accordingly, Merrell Dow should be read in its entirety as treating the absence of such cause as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the sensitive judgments about congressional intent, required by 1331.  Id., at 810.  In Merrell Dow, the principal significance of this absence was its bearing on the consequences to the federal system.  If the federal labeling standard without a cause of action could get a state claim into federal court, so could any other federal standards without causes of action.  And that would mean an enormous number of cases.  A comparable analysis yields a different jurisdictional conclusion here, because state quiet title actions rarely involve contested federal-law issues.  Pp.711.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04637.Argued April 19, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
Respondent Stumpf and his accomplice Wesley committed an armed robbery that left Mr. Stout wounded and Mrs. Stout dead.  Stumpf admitted shooting Mr. Stout but has always denied killing Mrs. Stout.  In Ohio state court proceedings, Stumpf pleaded guilty to, among other things, aggravated murder and one of three capital murder specifications charged in his indictment.  This left Stumpf eligible for the death penalty.  In a contested penalty hearing before a three-judge panel, Stumpfs principal mitigation arguments were that he had participated in the robbery at Wesleys urging, that Wesley had killed Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpfs minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence.  The State, however, claimed that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout, and that he therefore was the principal offender in her murder.  In the alternative, the State noted that even an accomplice can be sentenced to death under Ohio law if he acted with the specific intent to cause death, and the State argued that such intent could be inferred from the circumstances of the robbery regardless of who actually shot Mrs. Stout.  The panel concluded that Stumpf was the principal offender and sentenced him to death.  At Wesleys subsequent jury trial, however, the State presented evidence that Wesley had admitted to shooting Mrs. Stout.  But Wesley argued that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position in Stumpfs trial, and Wesley was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.  After Wesleys trial, Stumpf moved to withdraw his own plea or vacate his death sentence, arguing that the evidence endorsed by the State in Wesleys trial cast doubt on Stumpfs conviction and sentence.  This time, however, the prosecutor emphasized other evidence confirming Stumpf as the shooter and again raised, in the alternative, the aider-and-abettor theory.  The court denied Stumpfs motion, and Ohios appellate courts affirmed.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Stumpf habeas relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed on two grounds.  First, the Sixth Circuit found that Stumpf had not understood that specific intent to cause death was a necessary element of the aggravated murder charge, and that his guilty plea therefore had not been knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.  Second, the court found that the conviction and sentence could not stand because the State had secured convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theories.
Held: 
1.The Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that Stumpf was uninformed of the aggravated murder charges specific intent element.  While a guilty plea is invalid if the defendant has not been informed of the crimes elements, Stumpfs attorneys represented at his plea hearing that they had explained the elements to their client, and Stumpf confirmed that the representation was true.  This Court has never held that the judge must himself explain a crimes elements to the defendant.  Rather, constitutional requirements may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the charges nature and the crimes elements were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel.  Stumpf argues that his plea was so inconsistent with his denial of having shot Mrs. Stout that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the aggravated murder charges specific intent element.  But that argument fails because Stumpfs conviction did not require a showing that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout.  Ohio law also considers aiders and abettors who act with specific intent to cause death liable for aggravated murder.  Stumpf and Wesley entered the Stout home with guns, intending to commit armed robbery, and Stumpf admitted shooting Mr. Stout.  Taken together, these facts could show that the two men had agreed to kill both Stouts, which in turn could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of who shot Mrs. Stout.  Stumpfs claim that he and his attorneys were confused about the relevance and timing of defenses that they planned to make is not supported by the record.  Finally, the pleas validity may not be collaterally attacked on the ground that Stumpf made what he now claims was a bad deal.  Pp.610.


2.The Sixth Circuit was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases required voiding Stumpfs guilty plea.  The precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to Stumpfs aggravated murder conviction, and Stumpf has never explained how the prosecutions postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.  P.11.


3.The prosecutors use of allegedly inconsistent theories may have a more direct effect on Stumpfs sentence, however, for it is arguable that the sentencing panels conclusion about his role was material to its sentencing determination.  The opinion below leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between how the lower court resolved Stumpfs due process challenge to his conviction and how it resolved his challenge to his sentence.  It is not clear whether the Court of Appeals would have found Stumpf entitled to resentencing had it not also considered the conviction invalid.  Likewise, the parties briefing here, and the question on which this Court granted certiorari, largely focused on the conviction.  In these circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the merits of Stumpfs sentencing claim before giving the Sixth Circuit the opportunity to consider in the first instance the question of how the prosecutors conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases related to Stumpfs death sentence in particular.  Pp.1112.

04-6964|"JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district
No. 046964.Argued April 18, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
Petitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a California state court of assaulting and murdering a white child.  During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, three of whom were black.  The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospective black jurors, resulting in an all-white jury.  Defense counsel objected to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstitutionally based on race.  The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain his strikes, but instead simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under the governing state precedent, People v. Wheeler, which required a showing of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was based on group bias.  The judge explained that, although the case was close, his review of the record convinced him that the prosecutors strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.  The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the State Supreme Court reinstated it, stressing that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, permits state courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.  Reviewing Batson, Wheeler, and their progeny, the court concluded that Wheelers strong likelihood standard is entirely consistent with Batson.  Under Batson, the court held, a state court may require the objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit an inference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were more likely than not based on race.  Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the exclusion of all three black prospective jurors looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial judges ruling.  
Held: Californias more likely than not standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.  This narrow but important issue concerns the scope of the first of three steps Batson enumerated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie case and (2) the State has satisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes, e.g., 476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial court must decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful racial discrimination, Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765.  Batson does not permit California to require at step one that the objector show that it is more likely than not the other partys peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.  The Batson Court held that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.  476 U. S., at 94.  The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case, the defendant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial group, the prosecutors exercise of peremptory challenges to remove members of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges permit those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire members on account of race.  Id., at 96.  The Court assumed that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutors explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improperly motivated.  The Court did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judgeon the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certaintythat the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination.  Instead, a defendant satisfies Batsons first step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.  The facts of this case illustrate that Californias standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson.  The permissible inferences of discrimination, which caused the trial judge to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious that all three black prospective jurors were removed, were sufficient to establish a prima facie case.

03-1388|"SPECTOR etal. v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 031388.Argued February 28, 2005Decided June 6, 2005
Respondent NCL is a cruise line operating foreign-flag ships departing from, and returning to, United States ports.  The petitioners, disabled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets for round-trip NCL cruises from Houston, sued NCL under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S.C. 12181 et seq., which prohibits discrimination based on disability in places of public accommodation, 12182(a), and in specified public transportation services, 12184(a), and requires covered entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to accommodate disabled persons, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and to remove architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature where such removal is readily achievable, 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).  Though holding Title III generally applicable, the District Court found that the petitioners claims regarding physical barriers to access could not go forward because the federal agencies charged with promulgating ADA architectural and structural guidelines had not done so for cruise ships.  The court therefore dismissed the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCLs motion to dismiss the petitioners other claims.  The Fifth Circuit held that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters because of a presumption, which the court derived from, e.g., Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, that absent a clear indication of congressional intent, general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships.  Emphasizing that Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its application to such vessels, the court sustained the dismissal of the petitioners barrier-removal claims and reversed on their remaining claims.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
356 F.3d 641, reversed and remanded.
Justice Kennedy delivered an opinion concluding that except insofar as Title III regulates a vessels internal affairs, the statute is applicable to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters.  Parts IIA1 and IIB2 of that opinion held for the Court: 


(a)Although Title IIIs public accommodation and specified public transportation definitions, 12181(7)(A),(B)(I),(L), 12181(10), do not expressly mention cruise ships, there is no doubt that the NCL ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation.  The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title III inapplicable because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for foreign-flag ships in U. S.waters.  This Courts cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold, in some circumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in U. S. waters, absent a clear statement.  The broad clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the business and operations of foreign-flag ships.  That formulation is inconsistent with the Courts case law and with sound principles of statutory interpretation.  Pp.56.


(b)Title III defines readily achievable barrier removal as that which is easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense, 12181(9).  The statute does not further define difficulty, but the sections use of the disjunctive indicates that it extends to considerations in addition to cost.  Furthermore, Title III directs that the readily achievable determination take into account the impact  upon the [facilitys] operation, 12181(9)(B).  A Title III barrier-removal requirement that would bring a vessel into noncompliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea or any other international legal obligation would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact on its operation, and thus would not be readily achievable.  Congress could not have intended this result.  It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier modification is readily achievable must take into consideration the modifications effect on shipboard safety.  Title IIIs nondiscrimination and accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures.  12182(b)(3).  It would be incongruous to attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications threatening others safety simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodation itself.  Pp.1213.


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Souter, concluded in Parts IIA2, IIB1, IIB3, and IIIB:


(a)As a matter of international comity, a clear statement of congressional intent is necessary before a general statutory requirement can interfere with matters that concern a foreign-flag vessels internal affairs and operations.  See, e.g., Wildenhuss Case, 120 U. S. 1, 12.  In Benz and McCulloch, the Court held the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because that particular application of the NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the ships internal operations.  These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties that implicate the foreign vessels internal order rather than the welfare of American citizens.  E.g., McCulloch, supra, at 21.  In contrast, the Court later held the NLRA fully applicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and American longshoremen because this relationship, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ships internal order and discipline.  Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195, 198201.  This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound principles of statutory construction.  It is reasonable to presume Congress intends no interference with matters that are primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state in which it is registered.  It is also reasonable, however, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in U. S. territory that serve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace and tranquility of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreign-flag ships.  Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience but departing from and returning to U. S. ports accommodate and transport over 7 million U. S. residents annually, including large numbers of disabled individuals.  To hold there is no Title III protection for the disabled would be a harsh and unexpected interpretation of a statute designed to provide broad protection for them.  Pp.69.


(b)Plainly, most of the Title III violations alleged belowthat NCL required disabled passengers to pay higher fares and special surcharges; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessible to them; required them, but not other passengers, to waive any potential medical liability and to travel with companions; reserved the right to remove them from ships if they endangered other passengers comfort; and, more generally, failed to make reasonable modifications necessary to ensure their full enjoyment of the services offeredhave nothing to do with a ships internal affairs.  However, the petitioners allegations concerning physical barriers to access on boarde.g., their assertion that most of NCLs cabins, including the most attractive ones in the most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengerswould appear to involve requirements that might be construed as relating to internal ship affairs.  The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels.  Pp.912.


(c)Because Title III does not require structural modifications that conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Title III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with cruise ships internal affairs.  If so, recourse to the internal affairs clear statement rule would not be necessary.  Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to invoke that rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes a particular barrier-removal requirement entailing a permanent and significant structural modification interfering with a foreign ships internal affairs.  Conversely, where it is not obvious that a particular physical modification relates to a vessels basic architecture and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with an international legal obligation, the court may simply hold the modification not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.  Pp.1314.


(d)The holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a ships internal affairs are affected does not implicate the Courts holding in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. ___, ___, that statutory language given a limiting construction in one context must be interpreted consistently in other contexts, even though other of the statutes applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.  Martinez applied a canon for choosing among plausible meanings of an ambiguous statute, not a clear statement rule that implies a special substantive limit on the application of an otherwise unambiguous statutory mandate.  Pp.1618.


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IIIA that if Title III imposed a requirement that interfered with a foreign-flag cruise ships internal affairs, the clear statement rule would come into play, but that requirement would still apply to domestic ships, and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.  This application-by-application approach is consistent with how the clear statement rule has traditionally operated.  If the rule restricts some NLRA applications to foreign ships (e.g., labor relations with foreign crews in Benz and McCulloch), but not others (e.g., labor relations with American longshoremen in Ariadne Shipping), it follows that its case-by-case application is also required under Title III.  The clear statement rule, if it is invoked, would restrict some applications of Title III to foreign ships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification requirements), but not others (e.g., the statutes prohibition on discriminatory ticket pricing).  The rule is an implied limitation on a statutes otherwise unambiguous general terms.  It operates much like other implied limitation rules, which avoid applications of otherwise unambiguous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domains in a way that Congress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260.  An all-or-nothing approach would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress, requiring nullification of the entire statute, or of some arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain the rule protects.  Pp.1416.


Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer, agreed that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships and allows them to resist modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations, but would give no wider berth to the internal affairs clear statement rule in determining Title IIIs application to respondents ships.  That rule derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with principles of international law.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U. S. 764, 815.  This noninterference principle is served here by the Courts interpretation of 42 U. S.C. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)s readily achievable language to avoid conflict with international legal obligations.  The pluralitys further suggestion that the internal affairs clear statement rule may block Title III-prompted structural modifications, even  in the absence of conflict with international obligations, cuts the rule loose from its foundation.  Because international relations are not at risk and the United States has a strong interest in protecting American passengers on foreign and domestic cruise ships, there is no reason to demand a clearer congressional statement that Title III reaches the vessels in question.  Pp.14.  


Justice Thomas concluded that Title III of the of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, insofar as it could be read to require structural changes, lacks a sufficiently clear statement that it applies to the internal affairs of foreign vessels.  However, the clear statement rule does not render Title III entirely inapplicable to foreign vessels; instead, Title III applies to foreign ships only to the extent to which it does not bear on their internal affairs.  Pp.14.

			"|"SPECTOR etal. v. NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 031388.Argued February 28, 2005Decided June 6, 2005
Respondent NCL is a cruise line operating foreign-flag ships departing from, and returning to, United States ports.  The petitioners, disabled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets for round-trip NCL cruises from Houston, sued NCL under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S.C. 12181 et seq., which prohibits discrimination based on disability in places of public accommodation, 12182(a), and in specified public transportation services, 12184(a), and requires covered entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to accommodate disabled persons, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and to remove architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature where such removal is readily achievable, 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).  Though holding Title III generally applicable, the District Court found that the petitioners claims regarding physical barriers to access could not go forward because the federal agencies charged with promulgating ADA architectural and structural guidelines had not done so for cruise ships.  The court therefore dismissed the barrier-removal claims, but denied NCLs motion to dismiss the petitioners other claims.  The Fifth Circuit held that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters because of a presumption, which the court derived from, e.g., Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, that absent a clear indication of congressional intent, general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag ships.  Emphasizing that Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its application to such vessels, the court sustained the dismissal of the petitioners barrier-removal claims and reversed on their remaining claims.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
356 F.3d 641, reversed and remanded.
Justice Kennedy delivered an opinion concluding that except insofar as Title III regulates a vessels internal affairs, the statute is applicable to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters.  Parts IIA1 and IIB2 of that opinion held for the Court: 


(a)Although Title IIIs public accommodation and specified public transportation definitions, 12181(7)(A),(B)(I),(L), 12181(10), do not expressly mention cruise ships, there is no doubt that the NCL ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation.  The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title III inapplicable because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for foreign-flag ships in U. S.waters.  This Courts cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold, in some circumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in U. S. waters, absent a clear statement.  The broad clear statement rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, however, would apply to every facet of the business and operations of foreign-flag ships.  That formulation is inconsistent with the Courts case law and with sound principles of statutory interpretation.  Pp.56.


(b)Title III defines readily achievable barrier removal as that which is easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense, 12181(9).  The statute does not further define difficulty, but the sections use of the disjunctive indicates that it extends to considerations in addition to cost.  Furthermore, Title III directs that the readily achievable determination take into account the impact  upon the [facilitys] operation, 12181(9)(B).  A Title III barrier-removal requirement that would bring a vessel into noncompliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea or any other international legal obligation would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact on its operation, and thus would not be readily achievable.  Congress could not have intended this result.  It is logical and proper to conclude, moreover, that whether a barrier modification is readily achievable must take into consideration the modifications effect on shipboard safety.  Title IIIs nondiscrimination and accommodation requirements do not apply if disabled individuals would pose a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures.  12182(b)(3).  It would be incongruous to attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications threatening others safety simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodation itself.  Pp.1213.


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Souter, concluded in Parts IIA2, IIB1, IIB3, and IIIB:


(a)As a matter of international comity, a clear statement of congressional intent is necessary before a general statutory requirement can interfere with matters that concern a foreign-flag vessels internal affairs and operations.  See, e.g., Wildenhuss Case, 120 U. S. 1, 12.  In Benz and McCulloch, the Court held the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because that particular application of the NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the ships internal operations.  These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties that implicate the foreign vessels internal order rather than the welfare of American citizens.  E.g., McCulloch, supra, at 21.  In contrast, the Court later held the NLRA fully applicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and American longshoremen because this relationship, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a foreign ships internal order and discipline.  Longshoremen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195, 198201.  This narrow clear statement rule is supported by sound principles of statutory construction.  It is reasonable to presume Congress intends no interference with matters that are primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state in which it is registered.  It is also reasonable, however, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in U. S. territory that serve, employ, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace and tranquility of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreign-flag ships.  Cruise ships flying foreign flags of convenience but departing from and returning to U. S. ports accommodate and transport over 7 million U. S. residents annually, including large numbers of disabled individuals.  To hold there is no Title III protection for the disabled would be a harsh and unexpected interpretation of a statute designed to provide broad protection for them.  Pp.69.


(b)Plainly, most of the Title III violations alleged belowthat NCL required disabled passengers to pay higher fares and special surcharges; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessible to them; required them, but not other passengers, to waive any potential medical liability and to travel with companions; reserved the right to remove them from ships if they endangered other passengers comfort; and, more generally, failed to make reasonable modifications necessary to ensure their full enjoyment of the services offeredhave nothing to do with a ships internal affairs.  However, the petitioners allegations concerning physical barriers to access on boarde.g., their assertion that most of NCLs cabins, including the most attractive ones in the most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengerswould appear to involve requirements that might be construed as relating to internal ship affairs.  The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels.  Pp.912.


(c)Because Title III does not require structural modifications that conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Title III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with cruise ships internal affairs.  If so, recourse to the internal affairs clear statement rule would not be necessary.  Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to invoke that rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes a particular barrier-removal requirement entailing a permanent and significant structural modification interfering with a foreign ships internal affairs.  Conversely, where it is not obvious that a particular physical modification relates to a vessels basic architecture and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with an international legal obligation, the court may simply hold the modification not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.  Pp.1314.


(d)The holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a ships internal affairs are affected does not implicate the Courts holding in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. ___, ___, that statutory language given a limiting construction in one context must be interpreted consistently in other contexts, even though other of the statutes applications, standing alone, would not support the same limitation.  Martinez applied a canon for choosing among plausible meanings of an ambiguous statute, not a clear statement rule that implies a special substantive limit on the application of an otherwise unambiguous statutory mandate.  Pp.1618.


Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IIIA that if Title III imposed a requirement that interfered with a foreign-flag cruise ships internal affairs, the clear statement rule would come into play, but that requirement would still apply to domestic ships, and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.  This application-by-application approach is consistent with how the clear statement rule has traditionally operated.  If the rule restricts some NLRA applications to foreign ships (e.g., labor relations with foreign crews in Benz and McCulloch), but not others (e.g., labor relations with American longshoremen in Ariadne Shipping), it follows that its case-by-case application is also required under Title III.  The clear statement rule, if it is invoked, would restrict some applications of Title III to foreign ships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification requirements), but not others (e.g., the statutes prohibition on discriminatory ticket pricing).  The rule is an implied limitation on a statutes otherwise unambiguous general terms.  It operates much like other implied limitation rules, which avoid applications of otherwise unambiguous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domains in a way that Congress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260.  An all-or-nothing approach would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress, requiring nullification of the entire statute, or of some arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain the rule protects.  Pp.1416.


Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer, agreed that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships and allows them to resist modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations, but would give no wider berth to the internal affairs clear statement rule in determining Title IIIs application to respondents ships.  That rule derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes should not be interpreted to regulate foreign persons or conduct if that regulation would conflict with principles of international law.  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U. S. 764, 815.  This noninterference principle is served here by the Courts interpretation of 42 U. S.C. 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)s readily achievable language to avoid conflict with international legal obligations.  The pluralitys further suggestion that the internal affairs clear statement rule may block Title III-prompted structural modifications, even  in the absence of conflict with international obligations, cuts the rule loose from its foundation.  Because international relations are not at risk and the United States has a strong interest in protecting American passengers on foreign and domestic cruise ships, there is no reason to demand a clearer congressional statement that Title III reaches the vessels in question.

03-1454|"GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al. v. RAICH et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031454.Argued November 29, 2004Decided June 6, 2005
Californias Compassionate Use Act authorizes limited marijuana use for medicinal purposes.  Respondents Raich and Monson are California residents who both use doctor-recommended marijuana for serious medical conditions.  After federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents seized and destroyed all six of Monsons cannabis plants, respondents brought this action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting the enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessing, obtaining, or manufacturing cannabis for their personal medical use.  Respondents claim that enforcing the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause and other constitutional provisions.  The District Court denied respondents motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that they had demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the claim that the CSA is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress Commerce Clause authority as applied to the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal medical purposes as recommended by a patients physician pursuant to valid California state law.  The court relied heavily on United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, to hold that this separate class of purely local activities was beyond the reach of federal power.  
Held:Congress Commerce Clause authority includes the power to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana in compliance with California law.  Pp. 631.
(a)For the purposes of consolidating various drug laws into a comprehensive statute, providing meaningful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversion into illegal channels, and strengthening law enforcement tools against international and interstate drug trafficking, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Title II of which is the CSA.  To effectuate the statutory goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system making it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess any controlled substance except as authorized by the CSA.  21 U. S.C. 841(a)(1), 844(a).  All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, 812, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body, 811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, 812(c),  based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment, 812(b)(1).  This classification renders the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana a criminal offense.  841(a)(1), 844(a).  Pp. 611.


(b)Congress power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established.  See, e.g., Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 151.  If Congress decides that the total incidence of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class.  See, e.g., id., at 154155.  Of particular relevance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127128, where, in rejecting the appellee farmers contention that Congress admitted power to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not authorize federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the appellees own consumption, the Court established that Congress can regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself commercial, i.e., not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.  The similarities between this case and Wickard are striking.  In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress commerce power because production of the commodity meant for home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity.  In assessing the scope of Congress Commerce Clause authority, the Court need not determine whether respondents activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a rational basis exists for so concluding.  E.g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 557.  Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U. S.C. 801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, the Court has no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA.  Pp. 1220.


(c)Respondents heavy reliance on Lopez and Morrison overlooks the larger context of modern-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence preserved by those cases, while also reading those cases far too broadly.  The statutory challenges at issue there were markedly different from the challenge here.  Respondents ask the Court to excise individual applications of a concededly valid comprehensive statutory scheme.  In contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties asserted that a particular statute or provision fell outside Congress commerce power in its entirety.  This distinction is pivotal for the Court has often reiterated that [w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federal power, the courts have no power to excise, as trivial, individual instances of the class.  Perez, 402 U. S., at 154.  Moreover, the Court emphasized that the laws at issue in Lopez and Morrison had nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise.  See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610.  In contrast, the CSA regulates quintessentially economic activities: the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative, interstate market.  Prohibiting the intrastate possession or manufacture of an article of commerce is a rational means of regulating commerce in that product.  The Ninth Circuit cast doubt on the CSAs constitutionality by isolating a distinct class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federal power: the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation, possession, and use of marijuana for personal medical purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.  However, Congress clearly acted rationally in determining that this subdivided class of activities is an essential part of the larger regulatory scheme.  The case comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated product that is used domestically rather than sold on the open market is not subject to federal regulation.  Given the CSAs findings and the undisputed magnitude of the commercial market for marijuana, Wickard and its progeny foreclose that claim.  Pp. 2030.
352 F.3d 1222, vacated and remanded.

03-1488|"TORY etal. v. COCHRAN
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district
No. 031488.Argued March 22, 2005Decided May 31, 2005
In a state-law defamation action filed by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner Craft and others, had, inter alia, falsely claimed that Cochran owed him money, picketed Cochrans office with signs containing insults and obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from such libelous and slanderous activity.  Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  After oral argument, Cochrans counsel informed the Court of Cochrans death, moved to substitute Cochrans widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be dismissed as moot.  Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied that the case was moot.
Held:Cochrans widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not moot.  Despite Cochrans death, the injunction remains in effect.  Nothing in its language says to the contrary.  Cochrans counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochrans death.  As this Court understands that law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is.  Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy.  Cochrans death, however, makes it unnecessary for this Court to explore petitioners basic claims.  Rather, the Court need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much diminished or have disappeared altogether.  Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification.  Pp.24.
Vacated and remanded.

Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, and this Court granted certiorari.  After oral argument, Cochrans counsel informed the Court of Cochrans death, moved to substitute Cochrans widow as respondent, and suggested that the case be dismissed as moot.  Petitioners agreed to the substitution, but denied that the case was moot.
Held:Cochrans widow is substituted as respondent, but the case is not moot.  Despite Cochrans death, the injunction remains in effect.  Nothing in its language says to the contrary.  Cochrans counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochrans death.  As this Court understands that law, a person cannot definitively know whether an injunction is legally void until a court has ruled that it is.  Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy.  Cochrans death, however, makes it unnecessary for this Court to explore petitioners basic claims.  Rather, the Court need only point out that the injunction, as written, has lost its underlying rationale.  Since picketing Cochran and his law offices while engaging in injunction-forbidden speech could no longer coerce Cochran to pay for desisting in this activity, the grounds for the injunction are much diminished or have disappeared altogether.  Consequently the injunction amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech, lacking plausible justification.  Pp.24.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 039877.Argued March 21, 2005Decided May 31, 2005
Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U. S.C. 2000cc1(a)(1)(2), provides in part: No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, unless the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest, and does so by the least restrictive means.  Petitioners, current and former inmates of Ohio state institutions, allege, inter alia, that respondent prison officials violated 3 by failing to accommodate petitioners exercise of their nonmainstream religions in a variety of ways.  Respondents moved to dismiss that claim, arguing, among other things, that 3, on its face, improperly advances religion in violation of the First Amendments Establishment Clause.  Rejecting that argument, the District Court stated that RLUIPA permits safety and securityundisputedly compelling state intereststo outweigh an inmates claim to a religious accommodation.  On the thin record before it, the court could not find that enforcement of RLUIPA, inevitably, would compromise prison security.  Reversing on interlocutory appeal, the Sixth Circuit held that 3 impermissibly advances religion by giving greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights, and suggested that affording religious prisoners superior rights might encourage prisoners to become religious.
Held:Section 3 of RLUIPA, on its face, qualifies as a permissible accommodation that is not barred by the Establishment Clause.  Pp.816.
(a)Foremost, 3 is compatible with the Establishment Clause because it alleviates exceptional government-created burdens on private religious exercise.  See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 705.  Furthermore, the Act on its face does not founder on shoals the Courts prior decisions have identified: Properly applying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries, see Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472 U. S. 703; and they must be satisfied that the Acts prescriptions are and will be administered neutrally among different faiths, see Kiryas Joel, 512 U. S. 687.  [T]he exercise of religion often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of  physical acts [such as] assembling with others for a worship service [or] participating in sacramental use of bread and wine .  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877.  Section 3 covers state-run institutionsmental hospitals, prisons, and the likein which the government exerts a degree of control unparalleled in civilian society and severely disabling to private religious exercise.  42 U. S.C. 2000cc1(a); 1997.  RLUIPA thus protects institutionalized persons who are unable freely to attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent on the governments permission and accommodation for exercise of their religion.  But the Act does not elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institutions need to maintain order and safety.  An accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.  See Caldor, 472 U. S., at 709710.  There is no reason to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way, with particular sensitivity to security concerns.  While the Act adopts a compelling interest standard, 2000cc1(a), [c]ontext matters in the application of that standard, see Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327.  Lawmakers supporting RLUIPA were mindful of the urgency of discipline, order, safety, and security in penal institutions and anticipated that courts would apply the Acts standard with due deference to prison administrators experience and expertise.  Finally, RLUIPA does not differentiate among bona fide faiths.  It confers no privileged status on any particular religious sect.  Cf. Kiryas Joel, 512 U. S., at 706.  Pp.813.


(b)The Sixth Circuit misread this Courts precedents to require invalidation of RLUIPA as impermissibly advancing religion by giving greater protection to religious rights than to other constitutionally protected rights.  Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, counsels otherwise.  There, in upholding against an Establishment Clause challenge a provision exempting religious organizations from the prohibition against religion-based employment discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court held that religious accommodations need not come packaged with benefits to secular entities.  Id., at 338.  Were the Court of Appeals view correct, all manner of religious accommodations would fall.  For example, Ohio could not, as it now does, accommodate traditionally recognized religions by providing chaplains and allowing worship services.  In upholding 3, the Court emphasizes that respondents have raised a facial challenge and have not contended that applying RLUIPA would produce unconstitutional results in any specific case.  There is no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden state and local institutions.  However, should inmate requests for religious accommodations become excessive, impose unjustified burdens on other institutionalized persons, or jeopardize an institutions effective functioning, the facility would be free to resist the imposition.  In that event, adjudication in as-applied challenges would be in order.  Pp.1316.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 04368.Argued April 27, 2005Decided May 31, 2005
As Enron Corporations financial difficulties became public, petitioner, Enrons auditor, instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant to its document retention policy.  Petitioner was indicted under 18 U. S.C. 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B), which make it a crime to knowingly  corruptly persuad[e] another person  with intent to  cause that person to withhold documents from, or alter documents for use in, an official proceeding.  The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the District Courts jury instructions properly conveyed the meaning of corruptly persuades and official proceeding in 1512(b); that the jury need not find any consciousness of wrongdoing in order to convict; and that there was no reversible error.  
Held:The jury instructions failed to convey properly the elements of a corrup[t] persuas[ion] conviction under 1512(b).  Pp.612.
(a)This Courts traditional restraint in assessing federal criminal statutes reach, see, e.g., United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600, is particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the convictionpersua[sion]is by itself innocuous.  Even persuad[ing] a person with intent to  cause that person to withhold testimony or documents from the Government is not inherently malign.  Under ordinary circumstances, it is not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy, even though the policy, in part, is created to keep certain information from others, including the Government.  Thus, 1512(b)s knowingly  corruptly persuades phrase is key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the situation presented here.  The Government suggests that knowingly does not modify corruptly persuades, but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.  [K]nowledge and knowingly are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness, and corrupt and corruptly with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil.  Joining these meanings together makes sense both linguistically and in the statutory scheme.  Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to knowingly  corruptly persuad[e].  And limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows 1512(b) to reach only those with the level of culpability usually required to impose criminal liability.  See Aguilar, supra, at 602.  Pp.69.


(b)The jury instructions failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing.  Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.  For example, the jury was told that, even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could convict.  The instructions also diluted the meaning of corruptly such that it covered innocent conduct.  The District Court based its instruction on the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for 1503, which defined corruptly as knowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity of a proceeding.  However, the court agreed with the Governments insistence on excluding dishonestly and adding the term impede to the phrase subvert or undermine, so the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner intended to subvert, undermine, or impede governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.  These changes were significant.  [D]ishonest[y] was no longer necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply impede[d] the Governments factfinding ability.  Impede has broader connotations than subvert or even undermine, and many of these connotations do not incorporate any corrupt[ness] at all.  Under the dictionary definition of impede, anyone who innocently persuades another to withhold information from the Government get[s] in the way of the progress of the Government.  With regard to such innocent conduct, the corruptly instructions did no limiting work whatsoever.  The instructions also led the jury to believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the persua[sion] to destroy documents and any particular proceeding.  In resisting any nexus element, the Government relies on 1512(e)(1), which states that an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.  It is, however, quite another thing to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen.  A knowingly  corrup[t] persaude[r] cannot be someone who persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material.  Cf. Aguilar, supra, at 599600.  Pp.912.

No. 031164.Argued December 8, 2004Decided May 23, 2005
The Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985 (Beef Act) establishes a federal policy of promoting and marketing beef and beef products.  The Secretary of Agriculture has implemented the Act through a Beef Promotion and Research Order (Order), which creates a Cattlemens Beef Promotion and Research Board (Beef Board) and an Operating Committee, and imposes an assessment, or checkoff, on all sales and importation of cattle.  The assessment funds, among other things, beef promotional campaigns approved by the Operating Committee and the Secretary.  Respondents, associations whose members pay the checkoff and individuals whose cattle are subject to the checkoff, challenged the program on First Amendment grounds, relying on United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, in which this Court invalidated a mandatory checkoff that funded mushroom advertising.  The District Court found that the Beef Act and Order unconstitutionally compel respondents to subsidize speech to which they object.  Affirming, the Eighth Circuit held that compelled funding of speech may violate the First Amendment even when it is the governments speech.
Held:Because the beef checkoff funds the Governments own speech, it is not susceptible to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge.  Pp.515.
(a)This Court has sustained First Amendment challenges in compelled-subsidy cases, in which the government requires an individual to subsidize a private message he disagrees with.  See Keller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U. S. 1; Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209.  Keller and Abood led the Court to sustain a compelled-subsidy challenge to an assessment whose only purpose was to fund mushroom advertising.  United Foods, supra, at 413, 415416.  However, the speech in United Foods, Keller, and Abood was found, or presumed, to be private.  The compelled-subsidy cases have consistently respected the principle that compelled support of private speech differs from compelled support of government speech.  The Court has generally assumed, though not squarely held, that such funding of government speech does not alone raise First Amendment concerns.  Pp.58.


(b)Respondents argue that the speech here is not government speech because it is controlled by nongovernmental entities, i.e., the Beef Board and Operating Committee.  In fact, the message is effectively controlled by the Federal Government.  Congress and the Secretary have set out the overarching message and some of the campaigns elements, and have left the development of the remaining details to the Operating Committee, half of whose members are appointed by the Secretary and all of whom are subject to removal by the Secretary.  The Secretary also has final approval authority over every word in every promotional campaign, and his subordinates attend and participate in meetings at which proposals are developed.  By contrast, in Keller the compelled subsidy funded communicative activities that were not prescribed by law or developed under official government supervision.  Nor does the Orders funding mechanism affect the compelled-subsidy analysis.  That citizens have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech is no less true when, as here, the funding is achieved through targeted assessments devoted to a program to which some assessed citizens object, rather than through general taxes.  The Court need not address respondents argument that the advertisements, most of which are credited to Americas Beef Producers, give the impression that respondents endorse their message.  Neither the Beef Act nor the Order requires attribution of the ads to Americas Beef Producers or to anyone else, so neither can be facially invalid on this theory, and the record contains no evidence from which to conclude that the ads message would be associated with respondents.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04163.Argued February 22, 2005Decided May 23, 2005
Concerned about the effects of market concentration on retail gasoline prices, the Hawaii Legislature passed Act 257, which limits the rent oil companies may charge dealers leasing company-owned service stations.  Respondent Chevron U. S. A. Inc., then one of the largest oil companies in Hawaii, brought this suit seeking a declaration that the rent cap effected an unconstitutional taking of its property and an injunction against application of the cap to its stations.  Applying Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260where this Court declared that government regulation of private property effects a taking if [it] does not substantially advance legitimate state intereststhe District Court held that the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not substantially advance Hawaiis asserted interest in controlling retail gas prices.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  
Held: Agins substantially advance[s] formula is not an appropriate test for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking.  Pp. 619.
(a) The paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.  See, e.g., United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U. S. 114.  Beginning with Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, however, the Court recognized that government regulation of private property may be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.  Regulatory actions generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes (1) where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property, see Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, or (2) where regulations completely deprive an owner of all economically beneficial us[e] of her property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1019.  Outside these two categories (and the special context of land-use exactions discussed below), regulatory takings challenges are governed by Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124.  Penn Central identified several factorsincluding the regulations economic impact on the claimant, the extent to which it interferes with distinct investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government actionthat are particularly significant in determining whether a regulation effects a taking.  Because the three inquiries reflected in Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central all aim to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to a direct appropriation of or ouster from private property, each of them focuses upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon property rights.  Pp. 610.


(b) The substantially advances formula is not a valid method of identifying compensable regulatory takings.  It prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process test, which has no proper place in the Courts takings jurisprudence.  The formula unquestionably was derived from due process precedents, since Agins supported it with citations to Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, 185, and Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395.  Although Agins reliance on those precedents is understandable when viewed in historical context, the language the Court selected was imprecise.  It suggests a means-ends test, asking, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose.  Such an inquiry is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been taken for Fifth Amendment purposes.  In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the substantially advances inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights or how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners.  Thus, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.  Moreover, the Agins formulas application as a takings test would present serious practical difficulties.  Reading it to demand heightened means-ends review of virtually all regulation of private property would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulationsa task for which they are not well suited.  It would also empowerand might often requirecourts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies.  Pp. 1015.


(c) The Courts holding here does not require it to disturb any of its prior holdings.  Although it applied a substantially advances inquiry in Agins itself, see 447 U. S., at 261262, and arguably in Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 485492, it has never found a compensable taking based on such an inquiry.  Moreover, in most of the cases reciting the Agins formula, the Court has merely assumed its validity when referring to it in dicta.  See, e.g., Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U. S. 302, 334.  Although Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U. S. 825, 834, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 385, drew upon Agins language, the rule those cases established is entirely distinct from the substantially advances test: They involved a special application of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, which provides that the government may not require a person to give up the constitutional right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use in exchange for a discretionary benefit that has little or no relationship to the property.  Ibid. Pp. 1618.


(d) A plaintiff seeking to challenge a government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may proceed by alleging a physical taking, a Lucas-type total regulatory taking, a Penn Central taking, or a land-use exaction violating the Nollan and Dolan standards.  Because Chevron argued only a substantially advances theory, it was not entitled to summary judgment on its takings claim.  Pp. 1819.
363 F. 3d 846,  reversed and remanded.
OConnor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion.

04-37|"CLINGMAN, SECRETARY, OKLAHOMA STATE ELECTION BOARD, etal. v. BEAVER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 0437.Argued January 19, 2005Decided May 23, 2005
Under Oklahomas semiclosed primary law, a political party may invite only its own registered members and voters registered as Independents to vote in its primary.  When the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) notified the State Election Board it wanted to open its upcoming primary to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation, the Board agreed as to Independents, but not as to other parties members.  The LPO and several Oklahomans registered as Republicans and Democrats then sued for equitable relief, alleging that Oklahomas statute unconstitutionally burdens their First Amendment right to freedom of political association.  The District Court upheld the statute on the grounds that it did not severely burden respondents associational rights and that any burden imposed was justified by Oklahomas asserted interests in preserving parties as viable and identifiable interest groups and in ensuring that primary results accurately reflect party members voting.  Reversing, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the statute imposed a severe burden on respondents associational rights and was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
363 F.3d 1048, reversed and remanded.  
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court except as to Part IIA, concluding that Oklahomas semiclosed primary system does not violate the right to freedom of association.  Any burden it imposes is minor and justified by legitimate state interests.  Pp.34, 816.


(a)The First Amendment protects citizens right to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views.  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 574.  Regulations imposing severe burdens on associational rights must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, but when they impose lesser burdens, a States important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 358.  In Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 224, n.13, the Court left open the question whether a State may prevent a political party from inviting registered voters of other parties to vote in its primary.  Pp.34.  


(b)Oklahomas system does not severely burden associational rights.  The Court disagrees with respondents argument that the burden Oklahoma imposes is no less severe than the burden at issue in Tashjian, and thus the Court must apply strict scrutiny as it did in Tashjian.  Tashjian applied strict scrutiny without carefully examining the burden on associational rights.  Not every electoral law burdening associational rights is subject to strict scrutiny, which is appropriate only if the burden is severe, e.g., Jones, supra, at 582.  Requiring voters to register with a party before participating in its primary minimally burdens voters associational rights.  Moreover, Tashjian is distinguishable.  Oklahomas semiclosed primary imposes an even less substantial burden than did the Connecticut closed primary at issue in Tashjian.  Unlike that law, Oklahomas system does not require Independent voters to affiliate publicly with a party to vote in its primary, 479 U. S., at 216, n.7.  Although, like the earlier law, Oklahomas statute does not allow parties to broaden opportunities for joining  by their own act, but requires intervening action by potential voters, ibid., this burden is not severe, since many electoral regulations require that voters take some action to participate in the primary process.  Such minor barriers between voter and party do not compel strict scrutiny.  See Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 143.  To deem ordinary and widespread burdens like these severe would subject virtually every electoral regulation to strict scrutiny, hamper the ability of States to run efficient and equitable elections, and compel federal courts to rewrite state electoral codes.  The Constitution does not require that result.  Pp.810.  


(c)Oklahomas primary advances a number of regulatory interests this Court recognizes as important: It preserv[es] [political] parties as viable and identifiable interest groups, Nader v. Schaffer, 417 F.Supp. 837, 845 (D. Conn.), affd, 429 U. S. 989; enhances parties electioneering and party-building efforts, 417 F.Supp., at 848; and guards against party raiding and sore loser candidacies by spurned primary contenders, Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 735.  Pp.1014.


(d)The Court declines to consider respondents expansion of their challenge to include several of Oklahomas ballot access and voter registration laws.  Those claims were neither raised nor decided below, see, e.g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. ___, ___, and respondents have pointed to no unusual circumstances warranting their consideration now, see Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 645646.  Pp.1416.


Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, concluded in Part IIA that a voter unwilling to disaffiliate from another party in order to vote in the LPOs primary forms little association with the LPOnor the LPO with him.  See Tashjian, supra, at 235.  But even if Oklahomas system burdens an associational right, the burden is less severe than others this Court has upheld as constitutional.  The reasons underpinning Timmons, supra, show that Oklahomas system burdens the LPO only minimally.  As in Timmons, Oklahomas law does not regulate the LPOs internal processes, its authority to exclude unwanted members, or its capacity to communicate with the public.  And just as in Timmons, in which a Minnesota law conditioned a partys ability to nominate the candidate of its choice on the candidates willingness to disaffiliate from another party, Oklahoma conditions a partys ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the voters willingness to dissociate from his current party of choice.  If a party may be prevented from associating with its desired standard bearer because he refuses to disaffiliate from another party, it may also be prevented from associating with a voter who refuses to do the same.  Oklahomas system imposes an even slighter burden on voters than on the LPO.  Disaffiliation is not difficult: Other parties registered members who wish to vote in the LPO primary simply need to file a form changing their registration.  Voters are not locked in to an unwanted party affiliation, see Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51, 6061, because with only nominal effort they are free to vote in the LPO primary.  Pp.48.


Justice OConnor, joined by Justice Breyer except as to Part III, agreed with most of the Courts reasoning, but wrote separately to emphasize two points.  First, the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) and voters registered with another party have constitutionally cognizable interests in associating with one another through the LPOs primary, and these interests should not be minimized to dispose of this case.  Second, while the Court is correct that only Oklahomas semiclosed primary law is properly under review, that standing alone it imposes only a modest, nondiscriminatory burden on respondents associational rights, and that this burden is justified by the States legitimate regulatory interests, there are some grounds for concern that other Oklahoma laws governing party recognition and changes in party affiliation may unreasonably restrict voters ability to participate in the LPOs primary.  A realistic assessment of regulatory burdens on associational rights would, in an appropriate case, require examination of the cumulative effects of the States overall primary scheme; and any finding of a more severe burden would trigger more probing review of the States justifications.  Pp.111.
Thomas, J., delivered an opinion, which was for the Court except as to Part IIA.  Rehnquist, C.J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and OConnor and Breyer, JJ., joined except as to Part IIA.

04-5293|"DECK v. MISSOURI
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
No. 045293.Argued March 1, 2005Decided May 23, 2005
Petitioner Deck was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, but the Missouri Supreme Court set aside the sentence.  At his new sentencing proceeding, he was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain.  The trial court overruled counsels objections to the shackles, and Deck was again sentenced to death.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected Decks claim that his shackling violated, inter alia, the Federal Constitution.
Held:The Constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during a capital trials penalty phase, as it does during the guilt phase, unless that use is justified by an essential state interestsuch as courtroom securityspecific to the defendant on trial.  Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560, 568569.  Pp.310.
(a)The law has long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during a capital trials guilt phase, permitting shackling only in the presence of a special need.  In light of Holbrook, Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, early English cases, and lower court shackling doctrine dating back to the 19th century, it is now clear that this is a basic element of due process protected by the Federal Constitution.  Thus, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit using physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion, that restraints are justified by a state interest specific to the particular defendant on trial.  Pp.36.


(b)If the reasons motivating the guilt phase constitutional rulethe presumption of innocence, securing a meaningful defense, and maintaining dignified proceedingsapply with like force at the penalty phase, the same rule will apply there.  The latter two considerations obviously apply.  As for the first, while the defendants conviction means that the presumption of innocence no longer applies, shackles at the penalty phase threaten related concerns.  The jury, though no longer deciding between guilt and innocence, is deciding between life and death, which, given the sanctions severity and finality, is no less important, Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 732.  Nor is accuracy in making that decision any less critical.  Yet, the offenders appearance in shackles almost inevitably implies to a jury that court authorities consider him a danger to the community (which is often a statutory aggravator and always a relevant factor); almost inevitably affects adversely the jurys perception of the defendants character; and thereby inevitably undermines the jurys ability to weigh accurately all relevant considerations when determining whether the defendant deserves death.  The constitutional rule that courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other restraints visible to the jury during the penalty phase is not absolute.

			"|"DECK v. MISSOURI
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
No. 045293.Argued March 1, 2005Decided May 23, 2005
Petitioner Deck was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death, but the Missouri Supreme Court set aside the sentence.  At his new sentencing proceeding, he was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain.  The trial court overruled counsels objections to the shackles, and Deck was again sentenced to death.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected Decks claim that his shackling violated, inter alia, the Federal Constitution.
Held:The Constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during a capital trials penalty phase, as it does during the guilt phase, unless that use is justified by an essential state interestsuch as courtroom securityspecific to the defendant on trial.  Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560, 568569.  Pp.310.
(a)The law has long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during a capital trials guilt phase, permitting shackling only in the presence of a special need.  In light of Holbrook, Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, early English cases, and lower court shackling doctrine dating back to the 19th century, it is now clear that this is a basic element of due process protected by the Federal Constitution.  Thus, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit using physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination, in the exercise of its discretion, that restraints are justified by a state interest specific to the particular defendant on trial.  Pp.36.


(b)If the reasons motivating the guilt phase constitutional rulethe presumption of innocence, securing a meaningful defense, and maintaining dignified proceedingsapply with like force at the penalty phase, the same rule will apply there.  The latter two considerations obviously apply.  As for the first, while the defendants conviction means that the presumption of innocence no longer applies, shackles at the penalty phase threaten related concerns.  The jury, though no longer deciding between guilt and innocence, is deciding between life and death, which, given the sanctions severity and finality, is no less important, Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 732.  Nor is accuracy in making that decision any less critical.  Yet, the offenders appearance in shackles almost inevitably implies to a jury that court authorities consider him a danger to the community (which is often a statutory aggravator and always a relevant factor); almost inevitably affects adversely the jurys perception of the defendants character; and thereby inevitably undermines the jurys ability to weigh accurately all relevant considerations when determining whether the defendant deserves death.  The constitutional rule that courts cannot routinely place defendants in shackles or other restraints visible to the jury during the penalty phase is not absolute.  In the judges discretion, account may be taken of special circumstances in the case at hand, including security concerns, that may call for shackling in order to accommodate the important need to protect the courtroom and its occupants.  Pp. 610.

DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF
CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL
INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit
[May 23, 2005]
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari in this case to consider two questions: first, whether a federal court is bound by the International Court of Justices (ICJ) ruling that United States courts must reconsider petitioner Jos Medellns claim for relief under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U. S.T. 77, 100101, T.I.A.S. No.6820, without regard to procedural default doctrines; and second, whether a federal court should give effect, as a matter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation, to the ICJs judgment.  543 U. S. ___ (2004).  After we granted certiorari, Medelln filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in part upon a memorandum from President George W. Bush that was issued after we granted certiorari.  This state-court proceeding may provide Medelln with the very reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceeding.  The merits briefing in this case also has revealed a number of hurdles Medelln must surmount before qualifying for federal habeas relief in this proceeding, based on the resolution of the questions he has presented here.  For these reasons we dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  See Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Brown, 511 U. S. 117, 121122 (1994) (per curiam); The Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U. S. 180, 183184 (1959); Goins v. United States, 306 U. S. 622 (1939).


Medelln, a Mexican national, confessed to participating in the gang rape and murder of two girls in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal.  Medelln then filed a state habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time that Texas failed to notify him of his right to consular access as required by the Vienna Convention.  The state trial court rejected this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarily affirmed.


Medelln then filed this federal habeas corpus petition, again raising the Vienna Convention claim.  The District Court denied the petition.  Subsequently, while Medellns application to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a certificate of appealability was pending, see 28 U. S.C. 2253(c), the ICJ issued its decision in Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I.C.J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), in which the Republic of Mexico had alleged violations of the Vienna Convention with respect to Medelln and other Mexican nationals facing the death penalty in the United States.  The ICJ determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed individually enforceable rights, that the United States had violated those rights, and that the United States must provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals to determine whether the violations caused actual prejudice, without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.  Id.,  121122, 153.


The Court of Appeals denied Medellns application for a certificate of appealability.  It did so based on Medellns procedural default, see Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 375 (1998) (per curiam), and its prior holdings that the Vienna Convention did not create an individually enforceable right, see, e.g., United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243 F.3d 192, 195 (CA5 2001).  371 F.3d 270 (CA5 2004).  While acknowledging the existence of the ICJs Avena judgment, the court gave no dispositive effect to that judgment.


More than two months after we granted certiorari, and a month before oral argument in this case, President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United States would discharge its international obligations under the Avena judgment by having State courts give effect to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that decision.  George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9a.  Relying on this memorandum and the Avena judgment as separate bases for relief that were not available at the time of his first state habeas corpus action, Medelln filed a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus just four days before oral argument here.  That state proceeding may provide Medelln with the review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ required, and that Medelln now seeks in this proceeding.  This new development, as well as the factors discussed below, leads us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.[Footnote 1]


There are several threshold issues that could independently preclude federal habeas relief for Medelln, and thus render advisory or academic our consideration of the questions presented.  These issues are not free from doubt.


First, even accepting, arguendo, the ICJs construction of the Vienna Conventions consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding.  In Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339 (1994), this Court recognized that a violation of federal statutory rights ranked among the nonconstitutional lapses we have held not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding unless they meet the fundamental defect test announced in our decision in Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962).  512 U. S., at 349 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 355356 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In order for Medelln to obtain federal habeas relief, Medelln must therefore establish that Reed does not bar his treaty claim.


Second, with respect to any claim the state court adjudicated on the merits, habeas relief in federal court is available only if such adjudication was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1); see Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 2227 (2002) (per curiam).  The state habeas court, which disposed of the case before the ICJ rendered its judgment in Avena, arguably adjudicated on the merits three claims.  It found that the Vienna Convention did not create individual, judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural default rules barred Medellns consular access claim.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the state trial court found that Medelln fail[ed] to show that he was harmed by any lack of notification to the Mexican consulate concerning his arrest for capital murder; [Medelln] was provided with effective legal representation upon [his] request; and [his] constitutional rights were safeguarded.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.[Footnote 2]  Medelln would have to overcome the deferential standard with regard to all of these findings before obtaining federal habeas relief on his Vienna Convention claim.[Footnote 3]


Third, a habeas corpus petitioner generally cannot enforce a new rule of law.  Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).  Before relief could be granted, then, we would be obliged to decide whether or how the Avena judgment bears on our ordinary new rule jurisprudence.


Fourth, Medelln requires a certificate of appealability in order to pursue the merits of his claim on appeal.  28 U. S.C. 2253(c)(1).  A certificate of appealability may be granted only where there is a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.  2253(c)(2) (emphasis added).  To obtain the necessary certificate of appealability to proceed in the Court of Appeals, Medelln must demonstrate that his allegation of a treaty violation could satisfy this standard.  See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000).


Fifth, Medelln can seek federal habeas relief only on claims that have been exhausted in state court.  See 28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3).  To gain relief based on the Presidents memorandum or ICJ judgments, Medelln would have to show that he exhausted all available state-court remedies.[Footnote 4]


In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medelln with the review he seeks pursuant to the Avena judgment and the Presidents memorandum, and the potential for review in this Court once the Texas courts have heard and decided Medellns pending action, we think it would be unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hindrances to dispositive answers to the questions here presented.  Accordingly, we dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.
It is so ordered.
Of course Medelln, or the State of Texas, can seek certiorari in this Court from the Texas courts disposition of the state habeas corpus application.  In that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an opportunity to review the Texas courts treatment of the Presidents memorandum and Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I.C.J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31), unencumbered by the issues that arise from the procedural posture of this action.
The Federal District Court reviewing that finding observed:


Medellns allegations of prejudice are speculative.  The police officers informed Medelln of his right to legal representation before he confessed to involvement in the murders.  Medelln waived his right to advisement by an attorney.  Medelln does not challenge the voluntary nature of his confession.  There is no indication that, if informed of his consular rights, Medelln would not have waived those rights as he did his right to counsel.  Medelln fails to establish a causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation and [his] statements.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a85a (brackets in original).
In Breard v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per curiam), we addressed the claim that Virginia failed to notify a Paraguayan national of his Vienna Convention right to consular access.  In denying various writs, motions, and stay applications, we noted that the Vienna Convention arguably confers on an individual the right to consular assistance following arrest; that Virginias procedural default doctrine applied to the Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful Vienna Convention claimant likely must demonstrate prejudice.  Id., at 375377.  At the time of our Breard decision, however, we confronted no final ICJ adjudication.
On March 8, 2005, Medelln filed a successive state habeas action based on Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.071, 5(a)(1) (Vernon 2005), claiming that both the Presidents memorandum and the Avena judgment independently require the Texas court to grant review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim.  See Subsequent Application for Post-Conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex Parte Medelln, Trial Cause Nos. 67,5429 and 67,5430 (Tex. Crim. App.), p.6 (filed Mar. 24, 2005) (First, the Presidents determination requires this Court to comply with the Avena Judgment and remand Mr. Medellns case for the mandated review and reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim.  Second, the Avena Judgment on its own terms provides the rule of decision in Mr. Medellns case and should be given direct effect by this Court).

03-1116|"GRANHOLM, GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN, et al. v. HEALD et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 031116.Argued December 7, 2004Decided May 16, 2005
Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of wine through three-tier systems requiring separate licenses for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  These schemes allow in-state, but not out-of-state, wineries to make direct sales to consumers.  This differential treatment explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce by limiting the emerging and significant direct-sale business.  Influenced by an increasing number of small wineries and a decreasing number of wine wholesalers, direct sales have grown because small wineries may not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  In Nos. 031116 and 031120, Michigan residents, joined by an intervening out-of-state winery, sued Michigan officials, claiming that the States laws violate the Commerce Clause.  The State and an intervening in-state wholesalers association responded that the direct-shipment ban was a valid exercise of Michigans power under the Twenty-first Amendment.  The District Court sustained the scheme, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, rejecting the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes state liquor laws from Commerce Clause strictures and holding that there was no showing that the State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means.  In No. 031274, out-of-state wineries and their New York customers filed suit against state officials, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the States direct-shipment laws violate the Commerce Clause.  State liquor wholesalers and retailers representatives intervened in support of the State.  The District Court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that New Yorks laws fell within the ambit of its powers under the Twenty-first Amendment.

Held:Both States laws discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and that discrimination is neither authorized nor permitted by the Twenty-first Amendment.  Pp.830.
(a)This Court has long held that, in all but the narrowest circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they mandate differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99.  Laws such as those at issue contradict the principles underlying this rule by depriving citizens of their right to have access to other States markets on equal terms.  The Michigan systems discriminatory character is obvious.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, subject only to a licensing requirement, but out-of-state wineries, even if licensed, must go through a wholesaler and retailer.  The resulting price differential, plus the possible inability to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar small wineries from Michigans market.  New Yorks scheme also grants in-state wineries access to state consumers on preferential terms.  It allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, but requires an out-of-state winery to open a New York branch office and warehouse, which drives up its costs.  Out-of-state wineries are also ineligible for a farm winery license, which provides the most direct means of shipping to New York consumers.  Pp.812.


(b)Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment does not allow States to regulate direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of in-state producers.  The States position is inconsistent with this Courts precedents and the Amendments history.  Pp.1226.


(1)This Court invalidated many state liquor regulations before the Eighteenth Amendments ratification, finding either that the Commerce Clause prevented States from discriminating against imported liquor, Scott v. Donald, 165 U. S. 58, or that States could not pass facially neutral laws that placed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465.  While States could ban domestic liquor production, Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, such laws were ineffective because they could not regulate imported liquor in its original package, Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100.  To resolve this matter, Congress passed the Wilson Act, which empowered the States to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor.  After this Court narrowly construed the Act to permit regulation of the resale of imported liquor, not its direct shipment to consumers, Rhodes v. Iowa, 170 U. S. 412, Congress passed the Webb-Kenyon Act to close the direct-shipment loophole, see Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U. S. 311. The States argue that the Webb-Kenyon Act went further, removing any barrier to discriminatory state liquor regulations, but that reading conflicts with Clark Distillings description of the Webb-Kenyon Acts purpose, which was simply to extend the Wilson Act.  Nor does the statutes text compel a different response.  At the very least, it expresses no clear congressional intent to depart from the principle disfavoring discrimination against out-of-state goods.  Last, and most importantly, the Webb-Kenyon Act did not purport to repeal the Wilson Act, which expressly precludes state discrimination.  The Wilson Act reaffirmed, and the Webb-Kenyon Act did not displace, the Courts Commerce Clause cases striking down state laws that discriminated against out-of-state liquor.  States were required to regulate domestic and imported liquor on equal terms.  Pp.1221.


(2)A brief respite from these legal battles brought on by the Eighteenth Amendments ratification ended with the Twenty-first Amendment.  The States contend that 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment transfers to States the authority to discriminate against out-of-state goods, but the pre-Amendment history recited here provides strong support for the view that 2 only restored to the States the powers they had under the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon Acts.  The Twenty-first Amendments aim was to allow States to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation, importation, and use.  It did not give States the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against out-of-state goods, a privilege they never enjoyed.  Cases decided soon after the Twenty-first Amendments ratification did not take account of the underlying history and were inconsistent with this view, e.g., State Bd. of Equalization of Cal. v. Youngs Market Co., 299 U. S. 59, but the Courts reluctance to consider this history did not reflect a consensus that such evidence was irrelevant or that prior history was unsupportive of the principle that the Amendment did not authorize discrimination against out-of-state liquor.  More recent cases confirm that the Twenty-first Amendment does not supersede other provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, does not displace the rule that States may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers.  Pp.2123.


(3)This Court has held, in the modern 2 cases, (1) that state laws violating other provisions of the Constitution are not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, (2) that 2 does not abrogate Congress Commerce Clause powers with regard to liquor, e.g., Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, and (3) as most relevant here, that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the Commerce Clauses nondiscrimination principle, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 276.  Bacchus, which dealt with a Hawaii excise tax exempting some in-state alcoholic beverages, provides a particularly telling example of this last proposition, and this Court declines the States suggestion to overrule or limit that case.  The decision to invalidate the instant direct-shipment laws also does not call into question their three-tier systems constitutionality, see North Dakota v. United States, 495 U. S. 423, 432.  State policies are protected under the Twenty-first Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.  In contrast, the instant cases involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.  Pp.2326.


(c)Concluding that the States direct-shipment laws are not authorized by the Twenty-first Amendment does not end the inquiry, for this Court must still consider whether either States regime advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278.  The States provide little evidence for their claim that purchasing wine over the Internet by minors is a problem.  The 26 States now permitting direct shipments report no such problem, and the States can minimize any risk with less restrictive steps, such as requiring an adult signature on delivery.  The States tax evasion justification is also insufficient.  Increased direct shipment, whether in or out of state, brings the potential for tax evasion.  However, this argument is a diversion with regard to Michigan, which does not rely on in-state wholesalers to collect taxes on out-of-state wines.  New Yorks tax collection objectives can be achieved without discriminating against interstate commerce, e.g., by requiring a permit as a condition of direct shipping, which is what it does for in-state wineries.  Both States also benefit from federal laws that supply incentives for wineries to comply with state regulations.  Other rationalesfacilitating orderly market conditions, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring regulatory accountabilitycan also be achieved through the alternative of an evenhanded licensing requirement.

			"|"GRANHOLM, GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN, et al. v. HEALD et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 031116.Argued December 7, 2004Decided May 16, 2005
Michigan and New York regulate the sale and importation of wine through three-tier systems requiring separate licenses for producers, wholesalers, and retailers.  These schemes allow in-state, but not out-of-state, wineries to make direct sales to consumers.  This differential treatment explicitly discriminates against interstate commerce by limiting the emerging and significant direct-sale business.  Influenced by an increasing number of small wineries and a decreasing number of wine wholesalers, direct sales have grown because small wineries may not produce enough wine or have sufficient consumer demand for their wine to make it economical for wholesalers to carry their products.  In Nos. 031116 and 031120, Michigan residents, joined by an intervening out-of-state winery, sued Michigan officials, claiming that the States laws violate the Commerce Clause.  The State and an intervening in-state wholesalers association responded that the direct-shipment ban was a valid exercise of Michigans power under the Twenty-first Amendment.  The District Court sustained the scheme, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, rejecting the argument that the Twenty-first Amendment immunizes state liquor laws from Commerce Clause strictures and holding that there was no showing that the State could not meet its proffered policy objectives through nondiscriminatory means.  In No. 031274, out-of-state wineries and their New York customers filed suit against state officials, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the States direct-shipment laws violate the Commerce Clause.  State liquor wholesalers and retailers representatives intervened in support of the State.  The District Court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that New Yorks laws fell within the ambit of its powers under the Twenty-first Amendment.  Here, respondents in the Michigan cases and petitioners in the New York case are referred to as the wineries, while the opposing parties are referred to as the States.

03-388|"BATES et al. v. DOW AGROSCIENCES LLC
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 03388.Argued January 10, 2005Decided April 27, 2005
Petitioner Texas peanut farmers allege that their crops were severely damaged by the application of respondents (Dow) Strongarm pesticide, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered pursuant to its authority under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  Petitioners gave Dow notice of their intent to sue, claiming that Strongarms label recommended its use in all peanut-growing areas when Dow knew or should have known that it would stunt the growth of peanuts in their soil, which had pH levels of at least 7.0.  In response, Dow sought a declaratory judgment in the Federal District Court, asserting that FIFRA pre-empted petitioners claims.  Petitioners counterclaimed, raising several state-law claims sounding in strict liability, negligence, fraud, and breach of express warranty.  The District Court rejected one claim on state-law grounds and found the others barred by FIFRAs pre-emption provision, 7 U. S.C. 136v(b).  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit held that 136v(b) expressly pre-empted the state-law claims because a judgment against Dow would induce it to alter its product label.
Held: 
1.Under FIFRA, which was comprehensively amended in 1972, a manufacturer must obtain permission to market a pesticide by submitting a proposed label and supporting data to EPA, which will register the pesticide if it is efficacious, it will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment, and its label complies with the statutes misbranding prohibition.  A pesticide is misbranded if its label, for example, contains a statement that is false or misleading, 136(q)(1)(A), or lacks adequate instructions or warnings, 136(q)(1)(F), (G).  A State may regulate the sale and use of federally registered pesticides to the extent that regulation does not permit any sales or uses prohibited by FIFRA, 136v(a), but [s]uch State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under [FIFRA], 136v(b).  Though tort litigation against pesticide manufacturers was a common feature of the legal landscape in 1972, after this Court held in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, that the term requirement in the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 included common-law duties, and therefore pre-empted certain tort claims against cigarette companies, courts began holding that 136v(b) pre-empted claims such as petitioners.  Pp.49.


2.FIFRAs pre-emption provision applies only to state-law requirements for labeling or packaging.  136v(b).  While the Fifth Circuit was correct that requirements embraces both positive enactments and common-law duties, it erred in supposing that petitioners defective design, defective manufacture, negligent testing, and breach of express warranty claims were premised on requirements for labeling or packaging.  None of the common-law rules upon which these claims are based requires that manufacturers label or package their products in any particular way.  The Fifth Circuit reached a contrary conclusion by reasoning that a finding of liability on these claims would induce Dow to alter its label.  This was error because the prohibitions of 136v(b) apply only to requirements.  A requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motives an optional decision is not a requirement.  The proper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of the common-law duty at issue, not for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manufacturer to change its label.  Pp.913.


3.Petitioners fraud and negligent-failure-to-warn claims, by contrast, are based on common-law rules that qualify as requirements for labeling or packaging, since these rules set a standard for a products labeling that Dow is alleged to have violated.  While these common-law rules are subject to 136v(b), it does not automatically follow that they are pre-empted.  Unlike the pre-emption clause in Cipollone, 136v(b) prohibits only state-law labeling requirements that are in addition to or different from FIFRAs labeling requirements.  Thus, 136v(b) pre-empts any statutory or common-law rule that would impose a labeling requirement that diverges from those set out in FIFRA and its implementing regulations.  It does not pre-empt a state-law requirement that is equivalent to, and fully consistent with, FIFRAs labeling standards.  This parallel requirements reading of 136v(b) finds strong support in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470.  Thus, although FIFRA does not provide a federal remedy to those injured as a result of a manufacturers violation of FIFRAs labeling requirements, nothing in 136v(b) precludes States from providing such a remedy.  Dows contrary reading of 136v(b) fails to make sense of the phrase in addition to or different from.  Even if Dow offered a plausible alternative reading of 136v(b), this Court would have a duty to accept the reading disfavoring pre-emption.  See New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655.  The long history of tort litigation against manufacturers of poisonous substances adds force to the presumption against pre-emption, for Congress surely would have expressed its intention more clearly if it had meant to deprive injured parties of a long available form of compensation.  Moreover, this history emphasizes the importance of providing an incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care in distributing inherently dangerous items.  Finally, the policy objections raised against this Courts reading of 136v(b) are unpersuasive.  Pp.1320.


4.Under the parallel requirements reading of 136v(b), a state-law labeling requirement must be equivalent to its federal counterpart to avoid pre-emption.  State law need not, however, explicitly incorporate FIFRAs standards as an element of a cause of action.  Because this Court has not received sufficient briefing on whether the Texas law governing petitioners fraud and failure-to-warn claims is equivalent to FIFRAs misbranding standards and any relevant regulations, it is up to the Fifth Circuit to resolve the issue in the first instance.  Pp.2021.
332 F. 3d 323, vacated and remanded.

Reversing, the Third Circuit held, with regard to statutory tolling, that an untimely PCRA petition is not a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review that tolls AEDPAs limitations period under 28 U.

(a)Petitioner is not entitled to statutory tolling.  When this Court held in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U.

There are no grounds for treating the two differently.  Under the common understanding of properly filed that guided the Artuz Court, a petition filed after a time limit, which does not fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more properly filed than a petition filed after a time limit permitting no exception.

Petitioners counterargumentsthat condition[s] to filing are merely those conditions necessary to get a clerk to accept the petition, not conditions requiring judicial consideration; that a condition that must be applied on a claim-by-claim basis cannot be a condition to filing; and that this Courts interpretation is unfair to petitioners who try in good faith to exhaust their state remediesare rejected.

03-725|"PASQUANTINO et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 03725.Argued November 9, 2004Decided April 26, 2005
Petitioners carried out a scheme to smuggle large quantities of liquor into Canada from the United States to evade Canadas heavy alcohol import taxes.  They were convicted of violating the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U. S.C. 1343, for doing so.  That statute prohibits the use of interstate wires to effect any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed their convictions, rejecting petitioners argument that their prosecution contravened the common-law revenue rule, which bars courts from enforcing foreign sovereigns tax laws.  The Fourth Circuit also held that Canadas right to receive tax revenue was money or property within 1343s meaning.  
Held:A plot to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue violates the federal wire fraud statute.  Pp.321.
(a)Section 1343s plain terms criminalize a scheme such as petitioners.  Their smuggling operation satisfies both of the 1343 elements that are in dispute here.  First, Canadas right to uncollected excise taxes on the liquor petitioners imported into Canada is property within the statutes meaning.  That right is an entitlement to collect money from petitioners, the possession of which is something of value to the Canadian Government.  McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358.  Such valuable entitlements are property as that term ordinarily is employed.  Second, petitioners plot was a scheme or artifice to defraud Canada of its valuable entitlement to tax revenue, because petitioners routinely concealed imported liquor from Canadian officials and failed to declare those goods on customs forms.  See Durland v. United States, 161 U. S. 306, 313.  Pp.37. 


(b)The foregoing construction of 1343 does not derogate from the common-law revenue rule.  Pp.821.


(1)Relying on the canon of construction that [s]tatutes which invade the common law  are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except where a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident, United States v. Texas, 507 U. S. 529, 534, petitioners argue that, to avoid reading 1343 to derogate from the revenue rule, the Court should construe the otherwise-applicable statutory language to except frauds directed at evading foreign taxes.  Whether 1343 derogates from the revenue rule depends on whether reading the statute to reach this prosecution conflicts with a well-established revenue rule principle.  See United States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 276.  Thus, before concluding that Congress intended to exempt the present prosecution from 1343s broad reach, the Court must find that the revenue rule clearly barred such a prosecution as of 1952, the year Congress enacted the wire fraud statute.  See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 2223.  Pp.89.


(2)No common-law case decided as of 1952 clearly established that the revenue rule barred the United States from prosecuting a fraudulent scheme to evade foreign taxes.  Pp.917.


(i)The revenue rule has long been treated as a corollary of the rule that [t]he Courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.  The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66, 123.  It was first treated as such in cases prohibiting the enforcement of tax liabilities of one sovereign in the courts of another sovereign, such as suits to enforce tax judgments.  The revenue rules grounding in these cases shows that, at its core, it prohibited the collection of tax obligations of foreign nations.  The present prosecution is unlike these classic examples of actions traditionally barred by the revenue rule.  It is not a suit that recovers a foreign tax liability, but is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States to punish domestic criminal conduct.  Pp.911.


(ii)Cases applying the revenue rule to bar indirect enforcement of foreign revenue laws, in contrast to the direct collection of a tax obligation, cannot bear the weight petitioners place on them.  Many of them were decided after Congress passed the wire fraud statute.  Others come from foreign courts.  And, significantly, none involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a criminal statute to enforce the sovereigns own penal law.  Moreover, none of petitioners cases barred an action that had as its primary object the deterrence and punishment of fraudulent conducta substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax enforcement.  The main object of the action in each of them was the collection of money that would pay foreign tax claims.  The absence of such an object here means that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax collection is incidental and attenuated at best.  Thus, it cannot be said whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule.  Petitioners answer unpersuasively that the recovery of taxes is indeed the object of this suit because restitution of Canadas lost tax revenue is required under the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996.  Whether restitution is mandatory is irrelevant here because 1343 advances the Governments independent interest in punishing fraudulent domestic criminal conduct.  In any event, if awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contrary to the revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the later enacted restitution statute not to allow such awards, rather than to assume that it impliedly repealed 1343 as applied to this prosecution.  Pp.1114.


(iii)Also unavailing is petitioners argument that early English common-law cases holding unenforceable contracts executed to evade other nations revenue laws demonstrate that indirect enforcement of such laws is at the very core of the revenue rule, rather than at its margins.  Those early cases were driven by an interest in lessening the commercial disruption caused by high tariffs.  By the mid-20th century, however, that rationale was supplanted, and courts began to apply the revenue rule to tax obligations on the strength of the analogy between a countrys revenue laws and its penal ones.  Because the early English cases rested on a far different foundation from that on which the revenue rule came to rest, they say little about whether the wire fraud statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th century form.  Pp.1415.


(iv)Petitioners criminal prosecution enforces Canadian revenue law in an attenuated sense, but not in a sense that clearly would contravene the revenue rule.  That rule never proscribed all enforcement of foreign revenue law.  For example, at the same time they were enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of violating foreign revenue law, English courts also considered void foreign contracts that lacked tax stamps required under foreign revenue law.  The line the revenue rule draws between impermissible and permissible enforcement of foreign revenue law has therefore always been unclear.  The uncertainty persisted in American cases, which demonstrate that the extent to which the revenue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign revenue laws was unsettled as of 1952.  Pp.1517.


(3)The traditional rationales for the revenue rule do not plainly suggest that it barred this prosecution.  First, this prosecution poses little risk of causing the principal evil against which the revenue rule was traditionally thought to guard: judicial evaluation of the revenue policies of foreign sovereigns.  This action was brought by the Executive, the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations, United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 320.  Although a prosecution like this one requires a court to recognize foreign law to determine whether the defendant violated U. S. law, it may be assumed that by electing to prosecute, the Executive has assessed this prosecutions impact on this Nations relationship with Canada, and concluded that it poses little danger of causing international friction.  Petitioners broader argument that the revenue rule avoids giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws worries the Court little.  The present prosecution, if authorized by the wire fraud statute, embodies the policy choice of the two political branches of GovernmentCongress and the Executiveto free the interstate wires from fraudulent use, irrespective of the object of the fraud.  Such a reading of 1343 gives effect to that considered policy choice and therefore poses no risk of advancing Canadian policies illegitimately.  Finally, petitioners assertion that courts lack the competence to examine the validity of unfamiliar foreign tax schemes is not persuasive here.  Foreign law posed no unmanageable complexity in this case, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1 gives federal courts sufficient means to resolve any incidental foreign law issues that may arise in wire fraud prosecutions.  Pp.1720.


(4)The Courts interpretation does not give 1343 extraterritorial effect.  Petitioners offense was complete the moment they executed their scheme intending to defraud Canada of tax revenue inside the United States.  See Durland, supra, at 313.  Therefore, only domestic conduct is at issue here.  In any event, because 1343 punishes frauds executed in interstate or foreign commerce, it is not a statute that involves only domestic concerns.  Pp.2021. 
336 F.3d 321, affirmed.

03-750|"SMALL v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 03750.Argued November 3, 2004Decided April 26, 2005
Petitioner Small was convicted in a Japanese Court of trying to smuggle firearms and ammunition into that country.  He served five years in prison and then returned to the United States, where he bought a gun.  Federal authorities subsequently charged Small under 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), which forbids any person  convicted in any court  of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year  to  possess  any firearm.  (Emphasis added.)  Small pleaded guilty while reserving the right to challenge his conviction on the ground that his earlier conviction, being foreign, fell outside 922(g)(1)s scope.  The Federal District Court and the Third Circuit rejected this argument.  
Held: Section 922(g)(1)s phrase convicted in any court encompasses only domestic, not foreign, convictions.  Pp.29.  
(a)In considering the scope of the phrase convicted in any court it is appropriate to assume that Congress had domestic concerns in mind.  This assumption is similar to the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application, see, e.g., Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285.  The phrase convicted in any court describes one necessary portion of the gun possession activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.  Moreover, because foreign convictions may include convictions for conduct that domestic laws would permit, e.g., for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage, convictions from a legal system that are inconsistent with American understanding of fairness, and convictions for conduct that domestic law punishes far less severely, the key statutory phrase convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year somewhat less reliably identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue.  In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.  To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statutes language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations.  These considerations provide a convincing basis for applying the ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here.  Thus, the Court assumes a congressional intent that the phrase convicted in any court applies domestically, not extraterritorially, unless the statutory language, context, history, or purpose shows the contrary.  Pp.25.


(b)There is no convincing indication to the contrary here.  The statutes language suggests no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statutes language creates anomalies.  For example, in creating an exception allowing gun possession despite a conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime, 921(a)(20)(A) speaks of Federal or State antitrust or regulatory offenses.  If the phrase convicted in any court generally refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.  But if the phrase includes foreign convictions, the words Federal or State prevent the exception from applying where a foreign antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.  Such illustrative examples suggest that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase convicted in any court applies to foreign convictions.  Moreover, the statutes legislative history indicates no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  Although the statutory purpose of keeping guns from those likely to become a threat to society does offer some support for reading 922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions, the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter is reinforced by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have fewer than a dozen instances in which such a foreign conviction has served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.  Pp.58.

In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.  To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statutes language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations.  These considerations provide a convincing basis for applying the ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here.  Thus, the Court assumes a congressional intent that the phrase convicted in any court applies domestically, not extraterritorially, unless the statutory language, context, history, or purpose shows the contrary.  Pp.25.


(b)There is no convincing indication to the contrary here.  The statutes language suggests no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statutes language creates anomalies.  For example, in creating an exception allowing gun possession despite a conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime, 921(a)(20)(A) speaks of Federal or State antitrust or regulatory offenses.  If the phrase convicted in any court generally refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.  But if the phrase includes foreign convictions, the words Federal or State prevent the exception from applying where a foreign antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.  Such illustrative examples suggest that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase convicted in any court applies to foreign convictions.  Moreover, the statutes legislative history indicates no intent to reach beyond domestic convictions.  Although the statutory purpose of keeping guns from those likely to become a threat to society does offer some support for reading 922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions, the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter is reinforced by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have fewer than a dozen instances in which such a foreign conviction has served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03932.Argued January 12, 2005Decided April 19, 2005
Respondents filed a securities fraud class action, alleging that petitioners, Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and some of its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura), made, inter alia, misrepresentations about future Food and Drug Administration approval of a new asthmatic spray device, leading respondents to purchase Dura securities at an artificially inflated price.  In dismissing, the District Court found that the complaint failed adequately to allege loss causationi.e., a causal connection between the spray device misrepresentation and the economic loss, 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(4).  The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that a plaintiff can satisfy the loss causation requirement simply by alleging that a securitys price at the time of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation.
Held: 
1.An inflated purchase price will not by itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss needed to allege and prove loss causation.  The basic elements of a private securities fraud actionwhich resembles a common-law tort action for deceit and misrepresentationinclude, as relevant here, economic loss and loss causation.  The Ninth Circuit erred in following an inflated purchase price approach to showing causation and loss.  First, as a matter of pure logic, the moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss because the inflated purchase price is offset by ownership of a share that possesses equivalent value at that instant.  And the logical link between the inflated purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong, since other factors may affect the price.  Thus, the most logic alone permits this Court to say is that the inflated purchase price suggests that misrepresentation touches upon a later economic loss, as the Ninth Circuit found.  However, to touch upon a loss is not to cause a loss, as 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(4) requires.  The Ninth Circuits holding also is not supported by precedent.  The common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions that private securities fraud actions resemble require a plaintiff to show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted, but also that he suffered actual economic loss.  Nor can the holding below be reconciled with the views of other Courts of Appeals, which have rejected the inflated purchase price approach to showing loss causation.  Finally, the Ninth Circuits approach is inconsistent with an important securities law objective.  The securities laws make clear Congress intent to permit private securities fraud actions only where plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of cause and loss, but the Ninth Circuits approach would allow recovery where a misrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price, but does not proximately cause any economic loss.  Pp.39.


2.Respondents complaint was legally insufficient in respect to its allegation of loss causation.  While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and while the Court assumes that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes place any further requirement in respect to the pleading, the short and plain statement must give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47.  The complaint here contains only respondents allegation that their loss consisted of artificially inflated purchase prices.  However, as this Court has concluded here, such a price is not itself a relevant economic loss.  And the complaint nowhere else provides Dura with notice of what the relevant loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation.  Ordinary pleading rules are not meant to impose a great burden on a plaintiff, but it should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff suffering economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.  Allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause would bring about the very sort of harm the securities statutes seek to avoid, namely the abusive practice of filing lawsuits with only a faint hope that discovery might lead to some plausible cause of action.  Pp.911.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 031407.Argued December 1, 2004Decided April 4, 2005
Several years after petitioners deposited distributions from their pension plans into Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), they filed a joint petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  They sought to shield portions of their IRAs from their creditors by claiming them as exempt from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U. S.C. 522(d)(10)(E), which provides, inter alia, that a debtor may withdraw from the estate his right to receive  a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of  age.  Respondent Jacoway, the Bankruptcy Trustee, objected to the Rouseys exemption and moved for turnover of the IRAs to her.  The Bankruptcy Court sustained her objection and granted her motion, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) agreed.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, even if the Rouseys IRAs were similar plans or contracts to the plans specified in 522(d)(10)(E), their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment on account of age, but were instead savings accounts readily accessible at any time for any purpose.  
Held:The Rouseys can exempt IRA assets from the bankruptcy estate because the IRAs fulfill both of the 522(d)(10)(E) requirements at issue herethey confer a right to receive payment on account of age and they are similar plans or contracts to those enumerated in 522(d)(10)(E).  Pp.414.
(a)The Court reaffirms its suggestion in Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S. 753, 762763, that IRAs like the Rouseys can be exempted from the bankruptcy estate pursuant to 522(d)(10)(E).  Pp.45.


(b)The Rouseys IRAs provide a right to payment on account of  age within 522(d)(10)(E)s meaning.  The quoted phrase requires that the right to receive payment be because of age.  Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U. S. 434, 450451.  This meaning comports with the common, dictionary understanding of on account of, and 522(d)(10)(E)s context does not suggest another meaning.  The statutes governing IRAs persuade the Court that Jacoway is mistaken in arguing that there is no causal connection between that right and age or any other factor because the Rouseys IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.  Their right to receive payment of the entire balance is not in dispute.  Because their accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S.C. 408(a), they have a nonforfeitable right to the balance held in those accounts, 408(a)(4).  That right is restricted by a 10 percent tax penalty on any withdrawal made before age 59, 72(t).  Contrary to Jacoways contention, this 10 percent penalty is substantial.  It applies proportionally to any amounts withdrawn and prevents access to the 10 percent that the Rouseys would forfeit should they withdraw early.  It therefore effectively prevents access to the entire balance in their IRAs and limits their right to payment of the balance.  And because this condition is removed when the accountholder turns age 59, the Rouseys right to the balance of their IRAs is a right to payment on account of age.  Pp.58.


(c)The Rouseys IRAs are similar plan[s] or contract[s] to the stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, [or] annuity  plan[s] listed in 522(d)(10)(E).  To be similar, an IRA must be like, though not identical to, the listed plans or contracts, and consequently must share characteristics common to them.  Because the Bankruptcy Code does not define the listed plans, the Court looks to their ordinary meaning.  E.g., United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751, 757.  Dictionary definitions reveal that, although the listed plans are dissimilar to each other in some respects, their common feature is that they provide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation.  That the income the Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income that substitutes for wages lost upon retirement is demonstrated by the facts that (1) regulations require distribution to begin no later than the calendar year after the year the accountholder turns 70; (2) taxation of IRA money is deferred until the year in which it is distributed; (3) withdrawals before age 59 are subject to the 10 percent penalty; and (4) failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a 50 percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.  The Court rejects Jacoways argument that IRAs cannot be similar plans or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.  This argument is premised on her view that the 10 percent penalty is modest, a premise with which the Court does not agree.  The Court also rejects Jacoways contention that the availability of IRA withdrawals exempt from the early withdrawal penalty renders the Rouseys IRAs more like savings accounts.  Sections 522(d)(10)(E)(i) through (iii)which preclude the debtor from using the 522(d)(10)(E) exemption if an insider established his plan or contract; the right to receive payment is on account of age or length of service; and the plan does not qualify under specified Internal Revenue Code sections, including the section governing IRAsnot only suggest generally that the Rouseys IRAs are exempt, but also support the Courts conclusion that they are similar plan[s] or contract[s] under 522(d)(10)(E).

03-9685|"JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 039685.Argued January 18, 2005Decided April 4, 2005
Following petitioner Johnsons 1994 guilty plea on a federal drug charge, the District Court gave him an enhanced sentence as a career offender under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on two prior Georgia drug convictions.  On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he should not have received an enhanced sentence because one of the predicate Georgia convictions was invalid, but the Eleventh Circuit affirmed his sentence and this Court denied certiorari.  Two days later, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) went into effect, imposing, among other things, a 1-year statute of limitations on motions by prisoners seeking to modify their federal sentences.  The 1-year period runs from the latest of four alternative dates, the last of which is the date on which the facts supporting the claim  could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, 28 U. S.C. 2255, 6(4).  A fifth option supplied by the Courts of Appeals gave prisoners whose convictions became final before AEDPA a 1-year grace period running from that statutes effective date.  On April 25, 1997, one year and three days after his pre-AEDPA federal conviction became final and just after the 1-year grace period expired, Johnson pro se filed a motion in the District Court for an extension of time to attack his federal sentence under 2255.  Finding the AEDPA period expired, the court denied the motion, but without prejudice to Johnsons right to file a 2255 motion claiming any alternative limitation period under the statute.  On February 6, 1998, Johnson filed a habeas petition in a Georgia state court, claiming the constitutional invalidity of his guilty pleas in seven cases, one of which was the basis for one of the convictions on which his federal sentence enhancement rested.  Some three months after the state court entered an order of vacatur reversing all seven convictions, Johnson filed pro se a 2255 motion to vacate his enhanced federal sentence in light of the state-court vacatur.  He claimed, in effect, that his motion was timely because the order vacating the state judgment constituted previously undiscoverable facts supporting the claim that triggered a renewed limitation period under 2255, 6(4).  Although Johnson asserted that lack of education excused him from acting more promptly, and that he had filed the state petition as soon as he could get help from an inmate law clerk, the District Court denied the motion as untimely.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the state-court vacatur order was not a fact discovered by Johnson under the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations rule, but was more properly classified as a legal proposition or a court action obtained at Johnsons behest.
Held:In a case in which a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since been vacated, 2255, 6(4)s 1-year limitations period begins to run when the petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligence in state court after entry of judgment in the federal case in which the sentence was enhanced.  Pp.615.
(a)This Court agrees with Johnson that the state-court order vacating his prior conviction is a matter of fact supporting his 2255 claim, discovery of which triggers the refreshed 1-year limitations period under the fourth paragraph.  By pegging that period to notice of the state order eliminating the predicate required for enhancement, which is almost always necessary and always sufficient for relief, Johnsons argument improves on the Governments proposal that the relevant facts are those on which Johnson based his challenge to the validity of his state convictions.  Moreover, Johnsons argument is not vulnerable to the Eleventh Circuits point that an order vacating a conviction is legally expressive or operative language that may not be treated as a matter of fact within the statutes meaning.  This Court commonly speaks of the fact of a prior conviction, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, and an order vacating a predicate conviction is spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order entering it.  In either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proof or disproof like any other factual issue.  Nevertheless, Johnsons take on the statute does carry anomalies, one minor, one more serious.  It is strange to say that an order vacating a conviction has been discovered, the term used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speak about the date on which it could have been discovered with due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of a proceeding in which the 2255 petitioner was the moving party.  The more serious problem is Johnsons position that his 2255 petition is timely under paragraph four as long as he brings it within a year of learning he succeeded in attacking the prior conviction, no matter how long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding.  Neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to justify rejecting Johnsons basic argument.  The Courts job here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when AEDPAs drafters probably never thought about the present situation.  The answer to the question of how to implement the statutory mandate that a petitioner act with due diligence in discovering the crucial fact of a vacatur order that he himself seeks is that he take prompt action as soon as he is in a position to realize that he has an interest in challenging the prior conviction with its potential to enhance the later sentence.  The particular time when the course of the later federal prosecution clearly shows that diligence is in order is the date of judgment.  After the entry of judgment, the 2255 claims subject has come into being, the significance of inaction is clear, and very little litigation would be wasted, since most challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.  Thus, from the date the District Court entered judgment in his federal case, Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.  Had he done so, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the date he received notice of that vacatur.  Pp.614.


(b)However, Johnson did not show due diligence in seeking the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.  Although he knew the conviction subjected him to the enhancement, he failed to attack it by filing his state habeas petition until more than three years after entry of judgment in the federal case.  Indeed, even if this Court moved the burden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federal conviction or to AEDPAs effective date two days later, Johnson would still have delayed unreasonably, having waited over 21 months.  Johnson has offered no explanation for this delay, beyond that he was acting pro se and lacked the sophistication to understand the procedures.  But the Court has never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statutes clear policy calls for promptness.  On this record, Johnson fell far short of reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction.  Since there is every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced a state vacatur order well over a year before he filed his 2255 petition, the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations period is unavailable, and Johnson does not suggest that his motion was timely under any other provision.  Pp.1415.

He claimed, in effect, that his motion was timely because the order vacating the state judgment constituted previously undiscoverable facts supporting the claim that triggered a renewed limitation period under 2255, 6(4).  Although Johnson asserted that lack of education excused him from acting more promptly, and that he had filed the state petition as soon as he could get help from an inmate law clerk, the District Court denied the motion as untimely.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the state-court vacatur order was not a fact discovered by Johnson under the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations rule, but was more properly classified as a legal proposition or a court action obtained at Johnsons behest.
Held:In a case in which a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since been vacated, 2255, 6(4)s 1-year limitations period begins to run when the petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligence in state court after entry of judgment in the federal case in which the sentence was enhanced.  Pp.615.
(a)This Court agrees with Johnson that the state-court order vacating his prior conviction is a matter of fact supporting his 2255 claim, discovery of which triggers the refreshed 1-year limitations period under the fourth paragraph.  By pegging that period to notice of the state order eliminating the predicate required for enhancement, which is almost always necessary and always sufficient for relief, Johnsons argument improves on the Governments proposal that the relevant facts are those on which Johnson based his challenge to the validity of his state convictions.  Moreover, Johnsons argument is not vulnerable to the Eleventh Circuits point that an order vacating a conviction is legally expressive or operative language that may not be treated as a matter of fact within the statutes meaning.  This Court commonly speaks of the fact of a prior conviction, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, and an order vacating a predicate conviction is spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order entering it.  In either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proof or disproof like any other factual issue.  Nevertheless, Johnsons take on the statute does carry anomalies, one minor, one more serious.  It is strange to say that an order vacating a conviction has been discovered, the term used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speak about the date on which it could have been discovered with due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of a proceeding in which the 2255 petitioner was the moving party.  The more serious problem is Johnsons position that his 2255 petition is timely under paragraph four as long as he brings it within a year of learning he succeeded in attacking the prior conviction, no matter how long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding.  Neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to justify rejecting Johnsons basic argument.  The Courts job here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when AEDPAs drafters probably never thought about the present situation.  The answer to the question of how to implement the statutory mandate that a petitioner act with due diligence in discovering the crucial fact of a vacatur order that he himself seeks is that he take prompt action as soon as he is in a position to realize that he has an interest in challenging the prior conviction with its potential to enhance the later sentence.  The particular time when the course of the later federal prosecution clearly shows that diligence is in order is the date of judgment.  After the entry of judgment, the 2255 claims subject has come into being, the significance of inaction is clear, and very little litigation would be wasted, since most challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.  Thus, from the date the District Court entered judgment in his federal case, Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.  Had he done so, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the date he received notice of that vacatur.  Pp.614.


(b)However, Johnson did not show due diligence in seeking the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.  Although he knew the conviction subjected him to the enhancement, he failed to attack it by filing his state habeas petition until more than three years after entry of judgment in the federal case.  Indeed, even if this Court moved the burden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federal conviction or to AEDPAs effective date two days later, Johnson would still have delayed unreasonably, having waited over 21 months.  Johnson has offered no explanation for this delay, beyond that he was acting pro se and lacked the sophistication to understand the procedures.  But the Court has never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statutes clear policy calls for promptness.  On this record, Johnson fell far short of reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction.  Since there is every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced a state vacatur order well over a year before he filed his 2255 petition, the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations period is unavailable, and Johnson does not suggest that his motion was timely under any other provision.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 031160.Argued November 3, 2004Decided March 30, 2005
In revising its employee pay plan, respondent City granted raises to all police officers and police dispatchers in an attempt to bring their starting salaries up to the regional average.  Officers with less than five years service received proportionately greater raises than those with more seniority, and most officers over 40 had more than five years of service.  Petitioners, a group of older officers, filed suit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), claiming, inter alia, that they were adversely affected by the plan because of their age.  The District Court granted the City summary judgment.  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit ruled that disparate-impact claims are categorically unavailable under the ADEA, but it assumed that the facts alleged by petitioners would entitle them to relief under Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, which announced a disparate-impact theory of recovery for cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).
Held:The judgment is affirmed. 
351 F.3d 183, affirmed.
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding:


1.The ADEA authorizes recovery in disparate-impact cases comparable to Griggs.  Except for the substitution of age for race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the language of ADEA 4(a)(2) and Title VII 703(a)(2) is identical.  Unlike Title VII, however, ADEA 4(f)(1) significantly narrows its coverage by permitting any otherwise prohibited action where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age (hereinafter RFOA provision).  Pp.24.


2.Petitioners have not set forth a valid disparate-impact claim.  Two textual differences between the ADEA and Title VII make clear that the disparate-impact theorys scope is narrower under the ADEA than under Title VII.  One is the RFOA provision.  The other is the amendment to Title VII in the Civil Right Act of 1991, which modified this Courts Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, holding that narrowly construed the scope of liability on a disparate-impact theory.  Because the relevant 1991 amendments expanded Title VIIs coverage but did not amend the ADEA or speak to age discrimination, Wards Coves pre-1991 interpretation of Title VIIs identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.  Congress decision to limit the ADEAs coverage by including the RFOA provision is consistent with the fact that age, unlike Title VIIs protected classifications, not uncommonly has relevance to an individuals capacity to engage in certain types of employment.  Here, petitioners have done little more than point out that the pay plan is relatively less generous to older workers than to younger ones.  They have not, as required by Wards Cove, identified any specific test, requirement, or practice within the pay plan that has an adverse impact on older workers.  Further, the record makes clear that the Citys plan was based on reasonable factors other than age.  The Citys explanation for the differential between older and younger workers was its perceived need to make junior officers salaries competitive with comparable positions in the market.  Thus, the disparate impact was attributable to the Citys decision to give raises based on seniority and position.  Reliance on these factors is unquestionably reasonable given the Citys goal.  Pp.1114.


Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Part III that the ADEAs text, the RFOA provision, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations all support the conclusion that a disparate-impact theory is cognizable under the ADEA.  Pp.411.


Justice Scalia concluded that the reasoning in Part III of Justice Stevens opinion is a basis for deferring, pursuant to Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, to the EEOCs reasonable view that the ADEA authorizes disparate-impact claims.  Pp.15.


Justice OConnor, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas, concluded that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that disparate impact claims are not cognizable under the ADEA.  Pp.122.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 031696.Argued February 23, 2005Decided March 30, 2005
The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, at issue in this case, has been applied by this Court only twice, in Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, and in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462.  In Rooker, plaintiffs previously defeated in state court filed suit in a Federal District Court alleging that the adverse state-court judgment was unconstitutional and asking that it be declared null and void.  263 U. S., at 414415.  Noting preliminarily that the state court had acted within its jurisdiction, this Court explained that if the state-court decision was wrong, that did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding.  Id., at 415.  Federal district courts, Rooker recognized, are empowered to exercise only original, not appellate, jurisdictions.  Id., at 416.  Because Congress has empowered this Court alone to exercise appellate authority to reverse or modify a state-court judgment, ibid., the Court affirmed a decree dismissing the federal suit for lack of jurisdiction, id., at 415, 417.  In Feldman, two plaintiffs brought federal-court actions after the District of Columbias highest court denied their petitions to waive a court Rule requiring D.C. bar applicants to have graduated from an accredited law school.  Recalling Rooker, this Court observed that the District Court lacked authority to review a final judicial determination of the D.C. high court because such review can be obtained only in this Court.  460 U. S., at 476.  Concluding that the D.C. courts proceedings applying the accreditation Rule to the plaintiffs were judicial in nature, id., at 479482, this Court ruled that the Federal District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, id., at 482.  However, concluding also that, in promulgating the bar admission Rule, the D.C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially, id., at 485486, this Court held that 28 U. S.C. 1257 did not bar the District Court from addressing the validity of the Rule itself, so long as the plaintiffs did not seek review of the Rules application in a particular case, 460 U. S., at 486.  Since Feldman, this Court has never applied Rooker-Feldman to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.  However, the lower federal courts have variously interpreted the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to extend far beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases, overriding Congress conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law under 28 U. S.C. 1738.


In this case, two subsidiaries of petitioner Exxon Mobil Corporation formed joint ventures with respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) to produce polyethylene in Saudi Arabia.  When a dispute arose over royalties that SABIC had charged the joint ventures, SABIC preemptively sued the two subsidiaries in a Delaware state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalties were proper.  ExxonMobil and the subsidiaries then countersued in the Federal District Court, alleging that SABIC overcharged them.  Before the state-court trial, which ultimately yielded a jury verdict of over $400 million for the ExxonMobil subsidiaries, the District Court denied SABICs motion to dismiss the federal suit.  On interlocutory appeal, over eight months after the state-court jury verdict, the Third Circuit, on its own motion, raised the question whether subject-matter jurisdiction over the federal suit failed under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because ExxonMobils claims had already been litigated in state court.  The court did not question the District Courts subject-matter jurisdiction at the suits outset, but held that federal jurisdiction terminated when the Delaware court entered judgment on the jury verdict.
Held:The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which it acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.  Rooker-Feldman does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines allowing federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions.  Pp.1013.
(a)Rooker and Feldman exhibit the limited circumstances in which this Courts appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, 1257, precludes a federal district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate under a congressional grant of authority.  In both cases, the plaintiffs, alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon the District Court to overturn an injurious state-court judgment.  Because 1257, as long interpreted, vests authority to review a state-court judgment solely in this Court, e.g., Feldman, 460 U. S., at 476, the District Courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, see, e.g., Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 644, n.3.  When there is parallel state and federal litigation, Rooker-Feldman is not triggered simply by the entry of judgment in state court.  See, e.g., McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 282.  Comity or abstention doctrines may, in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the state-court litigation.  See, e.g., Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800.  But neither Rooker nor Feldman supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on the same or a related question while the case remains sub judice in a federal court.  Disposition of the federal action, once the state-court adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law.  Under 28 U. S.C. 1738, federal courts must give the same preclusive effect to a state-court judgment as another court of that State would give.  Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, 474 U. S. 518, 523.  Preclusion is not a jurisdictional matter.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.8(c).  In parallel litigation, a federal court may be bound to recognize the claim- and issue-preclusive effects of a state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate automatically on the entry of judgment in the state court.  Nor does 1257 stop a district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.  If a federal plaintiff presents an independent claim, even one that denies a state courts legal conclusion in a case to which the plaintiff was a party, there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under preclusion principles.  Pp.1012.  


(b)The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not preclude the federal court from proceeding in this case.  ExxonMobil has not repaired to federal court to undo the Delaware judgment in its favor, but appears to have filed its federal-court suit (only two weeks after SABIC filed in Delaware and well before any judgment in state court) to protect itself in the event it lost in state court on grounds (such as the state statute of limitations) that might not preclude relief in the federal venue.  Rooker-Feldman did not prevent the District Court from exercising jurisdiction when ExxonMobil filed the federal action, and it did not emerge to vanquish jurisdiction after ExxonMobil prevailed in the Delaware courts.  The Third Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by Rooker-Feldman, and consequently erred in ordering the federal action dismissed.  Pp.1213.

03-9046|"RHINES v. WEBER, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 039046.Argued January 12, 2005Decided March 30, 2005
After petitioner Rhines state conviction for first-degree murder and burglary became final and his state habeas petition was denied, he filed a federal habeas petition.  Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while his state petition was pending, see 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(2), he had more than 11 months before the limitations period expired.  However, by the time the District Court ruled that eight of his claims had not been exhausted in state court, the limitations period had run.  If the court had dismissed his mixed petition, Rhines would have been unable to refile after exhausting his claims, so the court decided to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims in state court, provided that he commenced the state proceedings within 60 days and returned to the District Court within 60 days of completing the exhaustion.  The Eighth Circuit, which had previously held that a district court has no authority to hold mixed petitions in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances, vacated the stay and remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims.
Held:A district court has discretion to stay a mixed petition to allow a petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state court in the first instance and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition.  Pp.38.
(a)Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, this Court held that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions but must give state courts the first opportunity to decide a petitioners claims; imposed a total exhaustion requirement; and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court.  Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 518519.  At the time, there was no statute of limitations on federal habeas petitions.  But that changed with AEDPA, which preserved Lundys total exhaustion requirement while imposing a 1-year limitations period, which is tolled during the pendency of a state, but not a federal, habeas petition.  As a result, petitioners such as Rhines run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for federal review of their unexhausted claims.  Even a petitioner who files early cannot control when a district court will resolve the exhaustion question.  The gravity and difficulty of this problem has led some district courts to adopt the stay-and-abeyance procedure at issue.  Pp.35.


(b)AEDPA does not deprive district courts of the authority to issue stays that are a proper exercise of their discretion, but it does circumscribe that discretion.  Any solution to this problem therefore must be compatible with AEDPAs purposes.  Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates AEDPAs objective of encouraging finality of state court judgments by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings, and it undermines AEDPAs goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioners incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court before filing his federal petition.  Thus, stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.  Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioners failure to present his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioners failure to exhaust his claims.  Even if good cause existed, the district court would abuse its discretion if it granted a stay when the unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.  Where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district courts discretion is still limited by AEDPAs timeliness concerns.  If a district court does not place reasonable time limits on a petitioners trip to state court and back, petitioners, especially capital petitioners, could frustrate AEDPAs finality goal by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not grant a stay at all.  On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that he engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics.  Such a petitioners interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.  For the same reason, if the court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, it should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and proceed with the exhausted ones if dismissing the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioners right to obtain federal relief.

			"|"RHINES v. WEBER, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 039046.Argued January 12, 2005Decided March 30, 2005
After petitioner Rhines state conviction for first-degree murder and burglary became final and his state habeas petition was denied, he filed a federal habeas petition.  Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while his state petition was pending, see 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(2), he had more than 11 months before the limitations period expired.  However, by the time the District Court ruled that eight of his claims had not been exhausted in state court, the limitations period had run.  If the court had dismissed his mixed petition, Rhines would have been unable to refile after exhausting his claims, so the court decided to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims in state court, provided that he commenced the state proceedings within 60 days and returned to the District Court within 60 days of completing the exhaustion.

02-1672|"JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BOARD OF EDUCATION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 021672.Argued November 30, 2004Decided March 29, 2005
After petitioner, the girls basketball coach at a public high school, discovered that his team was not receiving equal funding and equal access to athletic equipment and facilities, he complained unsuccessfully to his supervisors.  He then received negative work evaluations and ultimately was removed as the girls coach.  He brought this suit alleging that respondent school board (Board) had retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high schools athletic program, and that such retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.C. 1681(a), which provides that [n]o person  shall, on the basis of sex, be  subjected to discrimination under any education program  receiving Federal financial assistance.  The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that Title IXs private cause of action does not include claims of retaliation, and the Eleventh Circuit agreed and affirmed.  The appeals court also concluded that, under Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, the Department of Educations Title IX regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does not create a private cause of action, and that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, petitioner is not within the class of persons the statute protects.  
Held:Title IXs private right of action encompasses claims of retaliation against an individual because he has complained about sex discrimination.  Pp.315.
(a)When a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional discrimination on the basis of sex, in violation of Title IX.  This Court has held that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforce its prohibition on intentional sex discrimination, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 690693, and that that right includes actions for monetary damages by private persons, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, and encompasses intentional sex discrimination in the form of a recipients deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of a student by a teacher, Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U. S. 274, 290291, or by another student, Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 642.  In all of these cases, the Court relied on Title IXs broad language prohibiting a funding recipient from intentionally subjecting any person to discrimination on the basis of sex.  Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act.  It is a form of discrimination because the complainant is subjected to differential treatment.  Moreover, it is discrimination on the basis of sex because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.  The Eleventh Circuits conclusion that Title IX does not prohibit retaliation because it is silent on the subject ignores the import of this Courts repeated holdings construing discrimination under Title IX broadly to include conduct, such as sexual harassment, which the statute does not expressly mention.  The fact that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits retaliation is of limited use with respect to Title IX.  Title VII is a vastly different statute, which details the conduct that constitutes prohibited discrimination.  Because Congress did not list any specific discriminatory practices in Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice says nothing about whether it intended that practice to be covered.  Moreover, Congress enactment of Title IX just three years after Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229in which this Court interpreted 42 U. S.C. 1982s general prohibition of racial discrimination to include retaliation against a white man for advocating the rights of blacksprovides a realistic basis for presuming that Congress expected Title IX to be interpreted in conformity with Sullivan.  Pp.37.


(b)The Board cannot rely on this Courts holding in Sandoval, supra, at 285, that, because Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself prohibits only intentional discrimination, private parties could not obtain redress for disparate-impact discrimination based on the Justice Departments Title VI regulations forbidding federal funding recipients from adopting policies with such an impact.  Citing the Education Departments Title IX retaliation regulation, the Board contends that Jackson, like the Sandoval petitioners, seeks an impermissible extension of the statute when he argues that Title IXs private right of action encompasses retaliation.  This argument, however, entirely misses the point.  The Court does not here rely on the Education Department regulation at all, because Title IXs text itself contains the necessary prohibition: Retaliation against a person who speaks out against sex discrimination is intentional discrimination on the basis of sex within the statutes meaning.  Pp.79.


(c)Nor is the Court convinced by the Boards argument that, even if Title IXs private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not entitled to invoke it because he is an indirect victi[m] of sex discrimination.  The statute is broadly worded; it does not require that the victim of the retaliation also be the victim of the discrimination that is the subject of the original complaint.  Where the retaliation occurs because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the statutes on the basis of sex requirement is satisfied.  The complainant is himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the original complaint.  Cf. Sullivan, supra, at 237.  Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use of federal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also to provide individual citizens effective protection against those practices.  Cannon, supra, at 704.  This objective would be difficult to achieve if persons complaining about sex discrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation.  Pp.912.


(d)Nor can the Board rely on the principle that, because Title IX was enacted as an exercise of Congress Spending Clause powers, a private damages action is available only if the federal funding recipient had adequate notice that it could be held liable for the conduct at issue, see, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17.  Pennhurst does not preclude such an action where, as here, the funding recipient engages in intentional acts that clearly violate Title IX.  See, e.g., Davis, supra, at 642.  Moreover, the Board should have been put on notice that it could be held liable for retaliation by the fact that this Courts cases since Cannon have consistently interpreted Title IXs private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination; by Title IX itself, which expressly prohibits intentional conduct that violates clear statutory terms, Davis, 526 U. S., at 642; by the regulations implementing Title IX, which clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years; and by the holdings of all of the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue that Title IX covers retaliation.  The Board could not have realistically supposed that, given this context, it remained free to retaliate against those who reported sex discrimination.  Cf. id., at 644.  Pp.1214.


(e)To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove that the Board retaliated against him because he complained of sex discrimination.  At the present stage, the issue is not whether he will ultimately prevail, but whether he is entitled to offer evidence to support his claims.  P.15.
309 F.3d 1333, reversed and remanded.

03-855|"CITY OF SHERRILL, NEW YORK v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF NEW YORK et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 03855.Argued January 11, 2005Decided March 29, 2005
Respondent Oneida Indian Nation of New York (OIN or Tribe) is a direct descendant of the Oneida Indian Nation (Oneida Nation), whose aboriginal homeland, at the Nations birth, comprised some six million acres in what is now central New York State (State).  See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 664 (Oneida I).  In 1788, the State and the Oneida Nation entered into a treaty whereby the Oneidas ceded all their lands to the State, but retained a reservation of about 300,000 acres for their own use.  See County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 231 (Oneida II).  The Federal Government initially pursued a policy protective of the New York Indians.  In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act (Nonintercourse Act), barring sales of tribal land without the Governments acquiescence.  And in the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, the United States acknowledge[d] the Oneidas 300,000-acre reservation and guaranteed their free use and enjoyment of the reserved territory.  Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44, 45, Art.III.  Nevertheless, New York continued to purchase reservation land from the Oneidas.  Although the Washington administration objected, later administrations made not even a pretense of interfering with New Yorks purchases, and ultimately pursued a policy designed to open reservation lands to white settlers and to remove tribes westward.  Pressured by the removal policy, many Oneidas left the State.  Those who stayed continued to diminish in number and, during the 1840s, sold most of their remaining lands to New York.  By 1920, the New York Oneidas retained only 32 acres in the State.


Although early litigation over Oneida land claims trained on monetary recompense from the United States for past deprivations, the Oneidas ultimately shifted to suits against local governments.  In 1970, they filed a federal test case against two New York counties, alleging that the cession of 100,000 acres to the State in 1795 violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas right to possession.  They sought damages measured by the fair rental value, for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral land owned and occupied by the two counties.  The District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim.  This Court reversed in Oneida I, 414 U. S., at 675, 682, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked.  After the Oneidas prevailed in the lower courts, this Court held, inter alia, that the Oneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law, Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 236, but reserved [t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to present day Oneida Indians, id., at 253, n.27.


In 1997 and 1998, OIN purchased separate parcels of land in petitioner city of Sherrill, New York.  These properties, once contained within the historic Oneida Reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a tribal entity in 1805.  In that year, the Oneida Nation transferred the parcels to one of its members, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.  The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN reacquired them in open-market transactions.  For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided by the State and its county and municipal units.  According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the areas present-day population is non-Indian.  Nevertheless, because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are tax exempt and accordingly refused to pay property taxes assessed by Sherrill.  Sherrill initiated state-court eviction proceedings, and OIN brought this federal-court suit.  In contrast to Oneida I and II, which involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.  The District Court concluded that the parcels are not taxable, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  In this Court, OIN resists the payment of the property taxes on the ground that OINs acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Oneidas ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel, so that regulatory authority over the newly purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.
Held:Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central New York and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority over the area constantly exercised by the State and its counties and towns for 200 years, and the Oneidas long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice preclude the Tribe from unilaterally reviving its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.  The Oneidas long ago relinquished governmental reins and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.  Pp.1221.
(a)The Court rejects the theory of OIN and the United States that, because Oneida II recognized the Oneidas aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels at issue in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels.  The Oneidas sought only money damages in Oneida II, see 470 U. S., at 229, and the Court reserved the question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present-day Oneidas, id., at 253, n.27.  Substantive questions of rights and duties are very different from remedial questions.  Here, OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on parcels the Tribe purchased in the open market, properties that had been subject to state and local taxation for generations.  The appropriateness of such relief must be evaluated in light of the long history of state sovereign control over the territory.  From the early 1800s into the 1970s, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New Yorks governance of the land in question and the validity vel non of the Oneidas sales to the State.  Moreover, the properties here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago.  The longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area that is predominantly non-Indian in population and land use creates justifiable expectations.  E.g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 604605.  Similar justifiable expectations, grounded in two centuries of New Yorks exercise of regulatory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit heavy weight here.  The wrongs of which OIN complains occurred during the early years of the Republic, whereas, for the past two centuries, New York and its local units have continuously governed the territory.  The Oneidas did not seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by court decree until the 1970s.  And not until the 1990s did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for exemption of the parcels from local taxation.  This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.  Pp.1216.


(b)The distance from 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, and developments in Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.  This Court has long recognized that the passage of time can preclude relief.  For example, the doctrine of laches focuses on one sides inaction and the others legitimate reliance to bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief.  See, e.g., Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94.  Moreover, long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of States dominion and sovereignty over territory.  E.g., Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 651.  This Courts original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty cases do not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful point of reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to present and future sovereign control over territory, longstanding observances and settled expectations are prime considerations.  It has been two centuries since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties here or held them free from local taxation.  Parcel-by-parcel revival of their sovereign status, given the extraordinary passage of time, would dishonor the historic wisdom in the value of repose.  Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 262.  Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability of returning to Indian control land that generations earlier passed into numerous private hands.  See, e.g., Yankton Sioux Tribe v. United States, 272 U. S. 351, 357.  The unilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price, would have disruptive practical consequences similar to those that led the Yankton Sioux Court to initiate the impossibility doctrine: Sherrill and the surrounding area are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians, and a checkerboard of state and tribal jurisdictioncreated unilaterally at OINs behestwould seriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.  Hagen v. Utah, 510 U. S. 399, 421.  If OIN may unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove these parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent it from initiating a new generation of litigation to free the parcels from local zoning or other regulatory controls that protect all landowners in the area.  See Felix, 145 U. S., at 335.  Recognizing these practical concerns, Congress has provided, in 25 U. S.C. 465, a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that takes account of the interests of others with stakes in the areas governance and well being.  Section 465 provides the proper avenue for OIN to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the Oneidas 200 years ago.  Pp.1621.

			"|"CITY OF SHERRILL, NEW YORK v. ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF NEW YORK et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 03855.Argued January 11, 2005Decided March 29, 2005
Respondent Oneida Indian Nation of New York (OIN or Tribe) is a direct descendant of the Oneida Indian Nation (Oneida Nation), whose aboriginal homeland, at the Nations birth, comprised some six million acres in what is now central New York State (State).  See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 664 (Oneida I).  In 1788, the State and the Oneida Nation entered into a treaty whereby the Oneidas ceded all their lands to the State, but retained a reservation of about 300,000 acres for their own use.  See County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 231 (Oneida II).  The Federal Government initially pursued a policy protective of the New York Indians.  In 1790, Congress passed the first Indian Trade and Intercourse Act (Nonintercourse Act), barring sales of tribal land without the Governments acquiescence.  And in the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, the United States acknowledge[d] the Oneidas 300,000-acre reservation and guaranteed their free use and enjoyment of the reserved territory.  Act of Nov. 11, 1794, 7 Stat. 44, 45, Art.III.  Nevertheless, New York continued to purchase reservation land from the Oneidas.  Although the Washington administration objected, later administrations made not even a pretense of interfering with New Yorks purchases, and ultimately pursued a policy designed to open reservation lands to white settlers and to remove tribes westward.  Pressured by the removal policy, many Oneidas left the State.  Those who stayed continued to diminish in number and, during the 1840s, sold most of their remaining lands to New York.  By 1920, the New York Oneidas retained only 32 acres in the State.


Although early litigation over Oneida land claims trained on monetary recompense from the United States for past deprivations, the Oneidas ultimately shifted to suits against local governments.  In 1970, they filed a federal test case against two New York counties, alleging that the cession of 100,000 acres to the State in 1795 violated the Nonintercourse Act and thus did not terminate the Oneidas right to possession.  They sought damages measured by the fair rental value, for the years 1968 and 1969, of 872 acres of their ancestral land owned and occupied by the two counties.  The District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a federal claim.  This Court reversed in Oneida I, 414 U. S., at 675, 682, holding that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked.  After the Oneidas prevailed in the lower courts, this Court held, inter alia, that the Oneidas could maintain their claim to be compensated for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law, Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 236, but reserved [t]he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to present day Oneida Indians, id., at 253, n.27.


In 1997 and 1998, OIN purchased separate parcels of land in petitioner city of Sherrill, New York.  These properties, once contained within the historic Oneida Reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a tribal entity in 1805.  In that year, the Oneida Nation transferred the parcels to one of its members, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.  The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN reacquired them in open-market transactions.  For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided by the State and its county and municipal units.  According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the areas present-day population is non-Indian.  Nevertheless, because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are tax exempt and accordingly refused to pay property taxes assessed by Sherrill.  Sherrill initiated state-court eviction proceedings, and OIN brought this federal-court suit.  In contrast to Oneida I and II, which involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.  The District Court concluded that the parcels are not taxable, and the Second Circuit affirmed.  In this Court, OIN resists the payment of the property taxes on the ground that OINs acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Oneidas ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel, so that regulatory authority over the newly purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.
Held:Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central New York and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority over the area constantly exercised by the State and its counties and towns for 200 years, and the Oneidas long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice preclude the Tribe from unilaterally reviving its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.  The Oneidas long ago relinquished governmental reins and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.  Pp.1221.
(a)The Court rejects the theory of OIN and the United States that, because Oneida II recognized the Oneidas aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels at issue in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels.  The Oneidas sought only money damages in Oneida II, see 470 U. S., at 229, and the Court reserved the question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present-day Oneidas, id., at 253, n.27.  Substantive questions of rights and duties are very different from remedial questions.  Here, OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on parcels the Tribe purchased in the open market, properties that had been subject to state and local taxation for generations.  The appropriateness of such relief must be evaluated in light of the long history of state sovereign control over the territory.  From the early 1800s into the 1970s, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New Yorks governance of the land in question and the validity vel non of the Oneidas sales to the State.  Moreover, the properties here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago.  The longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area that is predominantly non-Indian in population and land use creates justifiable expectations.  E.g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 604605.  Similar justifiable expectations, grounded in two centuries of New Yorks exercise of regulatory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit heavy weight here.  The wrongs of which OIN complains occurred during the early years of the Republic, whereas, for the past two centuries, New York and its local units have continuously governed the territory.  The Oneidas did not seek to regain possession of their aboriginal lands by court decree until the 1970s.  And not until the 1990s did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for exemption of the parcels from local taxation.  This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.  Pp.1216.


(b)The distance from 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, and developments in Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.  This Court has long recognized that the passage of time can preclude relief.  For example, the doctrine of laches focuses on one sides inaction and the others legitimate reliance to bar long-dormant claims for equitable relief.  See, e.g., Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94.  Moreover, long acquiescence may have controlling effect on the exercise of States dominion and sovereignty over territory.  E.g., Ohio v. Kentucky, 410 U. S. 641, 651.  This Courts original-jurisdiction state-sovereignty cases do not dictate a result here, but they provide a helpful point of reference: When a party belatedly asserts a right to present and future sovereign control over territory, longstanding observances and settled expectations are prime considerations.  It has been two centuries since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties here or held them free from local taxation.  Parcel-by-parcel revival of their sovereign status, given the extraordinary passage of time, would dishonor the historic wisdom in the value of repose.  Oneida II, 470 U. S., at 262.  Finally, this Court has recognized the impracticability of returning to Indian control land that generations earlier passed into numerous private hands.  See, e.g., Yankton Sioux Tribe v. United States, 272 U. S. 351, 357.  The unilateral reestablishment of present and future Indian sovereign control, even over land purchased at the market price, would have disruptive practical consequences similar to those that led the Yankton Sioux Court to initiate the impossibility doctrine: Sherrill and the surrounding area are today overwhelmingly populated by non-Indians, and a checkerboard of state and tribal jurisdictioncreated unilaterally at OINs behestwould seriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.

03-1039|"BROWN, WARDEN v. PAYTON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031039.Argued November 10, 2004Decided March 22, 2005
In the penalty phase of respondent Paytons trial following his conviction on capital murder and related charges, his counsel presented witnesses who testified that, during the one year and nine months Payton had been incarcerated since his arrest, he had made a sincere commitment to God, participated in prison Bible study and a prison ministry, and had a calming effect on other prisoners.  The trial judge gave jury instructions that followed verbatim the text of a California statute, setting forth 11 different factors, labeled (a) through (k), to guide the jury in determining whether to impose a death sentence or life imprisonment.  The last such instruction, the so-called factor (k) instruction, directed jurors to consider [a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.  In his closing, the prosecutor offered jurors his incorrect opinion that factor (k) did not allow them to consider anything that happened after the crime.  Although he also told them several times that, in his view, they had not heard any evidence of mitigation, he discussed Paytons evidence in considerable detail and argued that the circumstances and facts of the case, coupled with Paytons prior violent acts, outweighed the mitigating effect of Paytons religious conversion.  When the defense objected to the argument, the court admonished the jury that the prosecutors comments were merely argument, but it did not explicitly instruct that the prosecutors interpretation was incorrect.  Finding the special circumstance of murder in the course of rape, the jury recommended that Payton be sentenced to death, and the judge complied.  The California Supreme Court affirmed.  Applying Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, which had considered the constitutionality of the identical factor (k) instruction, the state court held that, considering the context of the proceedings, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was required to disregard Paytons mitigating evidence.  The Federal District Court disagreed and granted Payton habeas relief, ruling also that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) did not apply.  The en banc Ninth Circuit affirmed and, like the District Court, held that AEDPA did not apply.  On remand from this Court in light of Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, the Ninth Circuit purported to decide the case under the deferential standard AEDPA mandates.  It again affirmed, concluding that the California Supreme Court had unreasonably applied Boyde in holding the factor (k) instruction was not unconstitutionally ambiguous in Paytons case.  The error, the court determined, was that the factor (k) instruction did not make it clear to the jury that it could consider the evidence concerning Paytons postcrime religious conversion and the prosecutor was allowed to urge this erroneous interpretation.
Held:The Ninth Circuits decision was contrary to the limits on federal habeas review imposed by AEDPA.  Pp.713.
(a)AEDPA provides that, when a habeas petitioners claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court, a federal court may not grant relief unless the state courts adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  A state-court decision is contrary to this Courts clearly established precedents if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in this Courts cases, or if it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decision of this Court but reaches a different result.  E.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405.  A state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Courts clearly established precedents if the state court applies such precedents to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner.  E.g., ibid.  These conditions have not been established.  P.7.


(b)In light of Boyde, the California Supreme Court cannot be said to have acted unreasonably in declining to distinguish between precrime and postcrime mitigating evidence.  The California Supreme Court read Boyde as establishing that factor (k)s text was broad enough to accommodate Paytons postcrime mitigating evidence, but the Ninth Circuit held that Boydes reasoning did not control in this case because Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence.  However, Boyde held that factor (k) directed consideration of any circumstance that might excuse the crime, see 494 U. S., at 382, and it is not unreasonable to believe that a postcrime character transformation could do so.  Pp.78.


(c)Even were the Court to assume that the California Supreme Court was incorrect in concluding that the prosecutors argument and remarks did not mislead the jury into believing it could not consider Paytons mitigation evidence, the state courts conclusion was not unreasonable, and is therefore just the type of decision that AEDPA shields on habeas review.  The state courts conclusion was an application of Boyde to similar but not identical facts.  Considering the whole context of the proceedings, it was not unreasonable for the state court to determine that the jury most likely believed that the mitigation evidence, while within the factor (k) instructions reach, was simply too insubstantial to overcome the arguments for imposing the death penalty; nor was it unreasonable for the state court to rely upon Boyde to support its analysis.  Pp.913.
346 F.3d 1204, reversed.

03-1423|"MUEHLER et al. v. MENA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031423.Argued December 8, 2004Decided March 22, 2005
Respondent Mena and others were detained in handcuffs during a search of the premises they occupied.  Petitioners were lead members of a police detachment executing a search warrant of these premises for, inter alia, deadly weapons and evidence of gang membership.  Mena sued the officers under 42 U. S.C. 1983, and the District Court found in her favor.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the use of handcuffs to detain Mena during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the officers questioning of Mena about her immigration status during the detention constituted an independent Fourth Amendment violation.
Held: 
1.Menas detention in handcuffs for the length of the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  That detention is consistent with Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, in which the Court held that officers executing a search warrant for contraband have the authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.  The Court there noted that minimizing the risk of harm to officers is a substantial justification for detaining an occupant during a search, id., at 702703, and ruled that an officers authority to detain incident to a search is categorical and does not depend on the quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure, id., at 705, n. 19.  Because a warrant existed to search the premises and Mena was an occupant of the premises at the time of the search, her detention for the duration of the search was reasonable under Summers.  Inherent in Summers authorization to detain is the authority to use reasonable force to effectuate the detention.  See Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 396.  The use of force in the form of handcuffs to detain Mena was reasonable because the governmental interest in minimizing the risk of harm to both officers and occupants, at its maximum when a warrant authorizes a search for weapons and a wanted gang member resides on the premises, outweighs the marginal intrusion.  See id., at 396397.  Moreover, the need to detain multiple occupants made the use of handcuffs all the more reasonable.  Cf. Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414.  Although the duration of a detention can affect the balance of interests, the 2- to 3-hour detention in handcuffs in this case does not outweigh the governments continuing safety interests.  Pp. 47.


2.The officers questioning of Mena about her immigration status during her detention did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights.  The Ninth Circuits holding to the contrary appears premised on the assumption that the officers were required to have independent reasonable suspicion in order to so question Mena.  However, this Court has held repeatedly that mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure.  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 434.  Because Menas initial detention was lawful and the Ninth Circuit did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the questioning, there was no additional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and, therefore, no additional Fourth Amendment justification for inquiring about Menas immigration status was required.  Cf. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. ___ , ___ (slip op., at 24).  Pp. 78.


3.Because the Ninth Circuit did not address Menas alternative argument that her detention extended beyond the time the police completed the tasks incident to the search, this Court declines to address it.  See, e.g., Pierce County v. Guillen, 537 U. S. 129, 148, n.10.  Pp.89.
332 F. 3d 1255, vacated and remanded.

The Ninth Circuits holding to the contrary appears premised on the assumption that the officers were required to have independent reasonable suspicion in order to so question Mena.  However, this Court has held repeatedly that mere police questioning does not constitute a seizure.  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 434.  Because Menas initial detention was lawful and the Ninth Circuit did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the questioning, there was no additional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and, therefore, no additional Fourth Amendment justification for inquiring about Menas immigration status was required.  Cf. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. ___ , ___ (slip op., at 24).  Pp. 78.


3.Because the Ninth Circuit did not address Menas alternative argument that her detention extended beyond the time the police completed the tasks incident to the search, this Court declines to address it.  See, e.g., Pierce County v. Guillen, 537 U. S. 129, 148, n.10.  Pp.89.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031601.Argued January 19, 2005Decided March 22, 2005
After petitioner City denied respondent Abrams permission to construct a radio tower on his property, he filed this action seeking, inter alia, injunctive relief under 332(c)(7)(B)(v) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U. S.C. 332(c)(7), as added by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), and money damages under 42 U. S.C. 1983.  Section 332(c)(7) imposes specific limitations on the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of wireless communications facilities, and provides, in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), that anyone adversely affected by any final action  by [such] a  government  may  commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The District Court held that 332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the Citys actions and, accordingly, ordered the City to grant respondents application for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondents request for damages under 1983.  The Ninth Circuit reversed on the latter point.
Held:An individual may not enforce 332(c)(7)s limitations on local zoning authority through a 1983 action.  The TCAby providing a judicial remedy different from 1983 in 332(c)(7) itselfprecluded resort to 1983.  Pp.513.
(a)Even after a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he belongs, see Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 285, the defendant may rebut the presumption that the right is enforceable under 1983 by, inter alia, showing a contrary congressional intent from the statutes creation of a comprehensive remedial scheme that is inconsistent with individual enforcement under 1983, Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 341.  The Courts cases demonstrate that the provision of an express, private means of redress in the statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress did not intend to leave open a remedy under 1983.  Pp.58.   


(b)Congress could not have meant the judicial remedy expressly authorized by 332(c)(7) to co-exist with an alternative remedy available under 1983, since enforcement of the former through the latter would distort the scheme of expedited judicial review and limited remedies created by 332(c)(7)(B)(v).  The TCA adds no remedies to those available under 1983, and limits relief in ways that 1983 does not.  In contrast to a 1983 action, TCA judicial review must be sought within 30 days after the governmental entity has taken final action, and, once the action is filed, the court must hear and decide it on an expedited basis.  332(c)(7)(B)(v).  Moreover, unlike 1983 remedies, TCA remedies perhaps do not include compensatory damages, and certainly do not include attorneys fees and costs.  The Court rejects Abramss arguments for borrowing 332(c)(7)(B)(v)s 30-day limitations period, rather than applying the longer statute of limitations authorized under 42 U. S.C. 1988 or 28 U. S.C. 1658, in 1983 actions asserting 332(c)(7)(B) violations.  Pp.812.


(c)In concluding that Congress intended to permit plaintiffs to proceed under 1983, the Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the TCAs so-called saving clause, which provides: This Act  shall not be construed to  impair  Federal  law.  Construing 332(c)(7), as this Court does, to create rights that may be enforced only through the statutes express remedy, does not impair 1983 because it leaves 1983s pre-TCA operation entirely unaffected.

03-184|"BALLARD et ux. v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 03184.Argued December 7, 2004Decided March 7, 2005
The Tax Courts Chief Judge appoints auxiliary officers, called special trial judges, to hear certain cases, 26 U. S.C. 7443A(a), (b), but ultimate decision, when tax deficiencies exceed $50,000, is reserved for the court itself, 7443A(b)(5), (c).  Tax Court Rule 183(b) governs the two-tiered proceedings in which a special trial judge hears the case, but the court renders the final decision.  Rule 183(b) directs that, after trial and submission of briefs, the special trial judge shall submit a report, including findings of fact and opinion, to the Chief Judge, [who] will assign the case to a Judge  of the Court.  In acting on the report, the assigned Tax Court judge must give [d]ue regard  to the circumstance that the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge had the opportunity to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, must presum[e] to be correct factfindings contained in the report, and may adopt the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udges report or may modify it or may reject it in whole or in part.  Rule 183(c).  Until 1983, such special trial judge reports were made public and included in the record on appeal.  Pursuant to a rule revision that year, those reports are now withheld from the public and excluded from the appellate record, and Tax Court judges do not disclose whether the final decision modi[fies] or reject[s] the special trial judges initial report.  Instead, the final decision invariably begins with a stock statement that the Tax Court judge agrees with and adopts the opinion of the [s]pecial [t]rial [j]udge.  Whether and how the final decision deviates from the special trial judges original report is never revealed.


Petitioners Claude Ballard, Burton Kanter, and another taxpayer received notices of deficiency from respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) charging them with failure to report certain payments on their individual tax returns and with tax fraud.  They filed petitions for redetermination in the Tax Court, where the Chief Judge assigned the consolidated case to Special Trial Judge Couvillion.  After trial, Judge Couvillion submitted a Rule 183(b) report to the Chief Judge, who issued an order assigning the case to Tax Court Judge Dawson for review [of that report], and if approved, for adoption.  Ultimately, Judge Dawson issued the Tax Courts decision, finding that the taxpayers had acted with intent to deceive the Commissioner, and holding them liable for underpaid taxes and substantial fraud penalties.  That decision, consisting wholly of a document labeled Opinion of the Special Trial Judge, declared: The Court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the Special Trial Judge, which is set forth below. 


Based on conversations between Kanters attorney and two Tax Court judges, the taxpayers came to believe that the decision was not in fact a reproduction of Judge Couvillions Rule 183(b) report.  According to a declaration submitted by Kanters attorney, Judge Couvillion had concluded that the taxpayers did not owe taxes with respect to some of the payments at issue and that the fraud penalty was not applicable.  The taxpayers therefore filed motions seeking access to Judge Couvillions initial report as submitted to the Chief Judge or, in the alternative, permission to place that report under seal in the appellate record.  Denying the requested relief, the Tax Court stated: Judge Dawson  and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agre[e] that  Judge Dawson adopted the findings of fact and opinion of  Judge Couvillion,  presumed [those] findings of fact  were correct, and  gave due regard to Judge Couvillions credibility findings.  The order added that any preliminary drafts of the special trial judges report were not subject to production because they relate to [the courts] internal deliberative processes.  On appeal, both the Eleventh Circuit in Ballards case and the Seventh Circuit in Kanters case rejected the taxpayers objection to the absence of the special trial judges Rule 183(b) report from the appellate record.  Proceeding to the merits, both Courts of Appeals affirmed the Tax Courts final decision in principal part.  
Held:The Tax Court may not exclude from the record on appeal Rule 183(b) reports submitted by special trial judges.  No statute authorizes, and Rule 183s current text does not warrant, the concealment at issue.  Pp.1023.
(a)Rule 183(c)s promulgation history confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that deference is due the trial judges factfindings under the [d]ue regard and presumed to be correct formulations.  Under Rule 183s precursor, the Tax Courts review of the special trial judges report was a transparent process.  The report was served on the parties, who were authorized to file objections to it, and the regular Tax Court judge reviewed the report independently, on the basis of the record and the parties objections.  Parties were therefore equipped to argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special trial judges findings the required measure of respect.  On adoption of the 1983 amendments, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging instances in which it rejected or modified special trial judge findings.  Instead, it appears that the Tax Court inaugurated a novel practice whereby the special trial judges report is treated essentially as an in-house draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular Tax Court judge and the special trial judge.  The regular Tax Court judge then issues a decision purporting to agre[e] with and adop[t] the opinion of the Special Trial Judge.


Nowhere in the Tax Courts current Rules is this joint enterprise described or authorized.  Notably, the Rules provide for only one special trial judge opinion:Rule 183(b) instructs that the special trial judges report, submitted to the Chief Judge before a regular Tax Court judge is assigned to the case, shall consist of findings of fact and opinion.  It is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c), tellingly captioned Action on the Report, instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject.  It is difficult to comprehend how a Tax Court judge would give [d]ue regard to, and presum[e] to be correct, an opinion he himself collaborated in producing.


The Tax Court, like all other decisionmaking tribunals, is obliged to follow its own Rules.  See, e.g., Service v. Dulles, 354 U. S. 363, 388.  Although the Tax Court is not without leeway in interpreting its Rules, it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 an unprovided-for collaborative process, and to interpret the formulations due regard and presumed to be correct, to convey something other than what those same words meant prior to the 1983 rule changes.  Pp. 1017.


(b)The Tax Courts practice of not disclosing the special trial judges original report, and of obscuring the Tax Court judges mode of reviewing that report, impedes fully informed appellate review of the Tax Courts decision.  In directing the regular judge to give due regard to the special trial judges credibility determinations and to presum[e]  correct the special trial judges factfindings, Rule 183(c) recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The officer who hears witnesses and sifts through evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a paper record.  Fraud cases, in particular, may involve critical credibility assessments, rendering the appraisals of the judge who presided at trial vital to the ultimate determination.  In the present cases, for example, the Tax Courts decision repeatedly draws outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard, Kanter, and other witnesses.  Absent access to the special trial judges Rule 183(b) report in this and similar cases, the appellate court will be at a loss to determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings made in that report were accorded [d]ue regard and were presumed  correct by the Tax Court judge, or (2) whether they were displaced without adherence to those standards.


The Tax Courts practice is extraordinary, for it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose a hearing officers initial report, see, e.g., 28 U. S.C. 636(b)(1)(C), and to make that report part of the record available to an appellate forum, see, e.g., 5 U. S.C. 557(c).  The Commissioner asserts a statutory analogy, however, 26 U. S.C. 7460(b), which instructs that when the full Tax Court reviews the decision of a single Tax Court judge, the initial one-judge decision shall not be part of the record.  This Court rejects the Commissioners endeavor to equate proceedings that differ markedly.  Full Tax Court review is designed for resolution of legal issues.  Review of that order is de novo.  In contrast, findings of fact are key to special trial judge reports.  Those findings, under the Tax Courts Rules, are not subject to de novo review.  Instead, they are measured against due regard and presumed correct standards.  Furthermore, all regular Tax Court members are equal in rank, each has an equal voice in the Tax Courts business, and the regular judge who issued the original decision is free to file a dissenting opinion recapitulating that judges initial opinion.  The special trial judge, who serves at the pleasure of the Tax Court, lacks the regular judges independence and the prerogative to publish dissenting views.


Given this Courts holding that the Tax Courts practice is not described and authorized by that courts Rules, this Court need not reach, and expresses no opinion on, the taxpayers further arguments based on due process and other statutory provisions.  Should the Tax Court some day amend its Rules to adopt the idiosyncratic procedure here rejected, the changed character of the Tax Court judges review of special trial judge reports would be subject to appellate review for consistency with the relevant federal statutes and due process.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 03287.Argued December 6, 2004Decided March 7, 2005
Respondents Dotson and Johnson are Ohio state prisoners.  After parole officials determined that Dotson was not eligible for parole and that Johnson was not suitable for parole, they brought separate actions for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming that Ohios parole procedures violate the Federal Constitution.  In each case, the Federal District Court concluded that a 1983 action does not lie and that the prisoner would have to seek relief through a habeas corpus suit.  The Sixth Circuit ultimately consolidated the cases and reversed, finding that the actions could proceed under 1983.
Held:State prisoners may bring a 1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of state parole procedures; they need not seek relief exclusively under the federal habeas corpus statutes.  Pp.310.
(a)Ohio argues unsuccessfully that respondents claims may only be brought in federal habeas (or similar state) proceedings because a state prisoner cannot use a 1983 action to challenge the fact or duration of his confinement, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489, and respondents lawsuits, in effect, collaterally attack their confinements duration.  That argument jumps from a true premise (that in all likelihood the prisoners hope their suits will help bring about earlier release) to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief).  This Courts case law makes clear that the connection between the constitutionality of the prisoners parole proceedings and release from confinement is too tenuous here to achieve Ohios legal door-closing objective.  From Preiser to Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, this Court has developed an exception from 1983s otherwise broad scope for actions that lie within the core of habeas corpus, Preiser, supra, at 487, i.e., where a state prisoner requests present or future release.  Section 1983 remains available for procedural challenges where success would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, but the prisoner cannot use 1983 to obtain relief where success would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477.  Here, respondents claims are cognizable under 1983, i.e., they do not fall within the implicit habeas exception.  They seek relief that will render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility (Dotson) and parole suitability (Johnson).  See Wolff, supra, at 554555.  Neither prisoner seeks an injunction ordering his immediate or speedier release into the community.  See, e.g., Preiser, supra, at 500.  And as in Wolff, a favorable judgment will not necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s].  Heck, supra, at 487.  Success for Dotson does not mean immediate release or a shorter stay in prison; it means at most new eligibility review, which may speed consideration of a new parole application.  Success for Johnson means at most a new parole hearing at which parole authorities may, in their discretion, decline to shorten his prison term.  Because neither prisoners claim would necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at the core of habeas corpus.  Preiser, supra, at 489.  Finally, the prisoners claims for future relief (which, if successful, will not necessarily imply the invalidity of confinement or shorten its duration) are yet more distant from that core.  See Balisok, supra, at 648.  Pp.38.


(b)Ohios additional arguments(1) that respondents 1983 actions cannot lie because a favorable judgment would necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] sentence[s], Heck, supra, at 487 (emphasis added), which sentences include particular state parole procedures; and (2) that a decision for them would violate principles of federal/state comity by opening the door to federal court without prior exhaustion of state-court remediesare not persuasive.

			"|"WILKINSON, DIRECTOR, OHIO DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND CORRECTION, et al. v. DOTSON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 03287.Argued December 6, 2004Decided March 7, 2005
Respondents Dotson and Johnson are Ohio state prisoners.  After parole officials determined that Dotson was not eligible for parole and that Johnson was not suitable for parole, they brought separate actions for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming that Ohios parole procedures violate the Federal Constitution.  In each case, the Federal District Court concluded that a 1983 action does not lie and that the prisoner would have to seek relief through a habeas corpus suit.  The Sixth Circuit ultimately consolidated the cases and reversed, finding that the actions could proceed under 1983.

03-9168|"SHEPARD v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 039168.Argued November 8, 2004Decided March 7, 2005
After petitioner Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), the Government sought to increase his sentence from a 37-month maximum to the 15-year minimum that 924(e), popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), mandates for such felons who have three prior convictions for violent felonies or drug offenses.  Shepards predicate felonies were Massachusetts burglary convictions entered upon guilty pleas.  This Court has held that only generic burglarymeaning, among other things, that it was committed in a building or enclosed spaceis a violent crime under the ACCA, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599, and that a court sentencing under the ACCA can look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after a jury trial was for generic burglary in States (like Massachusetts) with broader burglary definitions, id., at 602.  Refusing to consider the 15-year minimum, the District Court found that a Taylor investigation did not show that Shepard had three generic burglary convictions and rejected the Governments argument that the court should examine police reports and complaint applications in determining whether Shepards guilty pleas admitted and supported generic burglary convictions.  The First Circuit vacated, ruling that such reports and applications should be considered.  On remand, the District Court again declined to impose the enhanced sentence.  The First Circuit vacated.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 
348 F.3d 308, reversed and remanded.
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III, concluding that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a guilty plea to burglary under a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, to the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the defendant confirmed the factual basis for the plea, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.  Guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses, and Taylors reasoning controls the identification of generic convictions following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with nongeneric offenses.  The ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried and pleaded cases should be regarded differently, and nothing in Taylors rationale limits it to prior jury convictions.  This Court, then, must find the right analogs for applying Taylor to pleaded cases.  The Taylor Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify generic convictions in jury cases.  In cases tried without a jury, the closest analogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judges formal ruling of law and finding of fact; in pleaded cases, they would be the statement of factual basis for the charge shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.  A later court could generally tell from such material whether the prior plea had necessarily rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic.  Taylor, supra, at 602.  The Governments arguments for a wider evidentiary cast that includes documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges amount to a call to ease away from Taylors conclusion that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require confining generic conviction evidence to the convicting courts records approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a generic crime State.  That was the heart of the Taylor decision, and there is no justification for upsetting that precedent where the Court is dealing with statutory interpretation and where Congress has not, in the nearly 15 years since Taylor, taken any action to modify the statute.  Pp.59, 12.


Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part III that the rule in the Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n.6, and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, line of casesthat any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, absent a waiver by the defendantis also relevant to ACCA sentencing.  In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to show a generic crime is not established by the record of conviction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224.  Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Governments view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the prior pleas factual basis, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jurys standing between a defendant and the power of the State, and they guarantee a jurys finding of any disputed fact essential to increase a potential sentences ceiling.  The disputed fact here is too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.  The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels the Court to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea.  Pp. 1012.


Justice Thomas agreed that the Court should not broaden the scope of the evidence judges may consider under Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, because it would give rise to constitutional error, not constitutional doubt.  Both Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, and Taylor, which permit judicial factfinding that concerns prior convictions, have been eroded by this Courts subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.  Pp.13.
Souter, J., delivered an opinion, which was for the Court except as to Part III.  Stevens, Scalia, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined that opinion in full, and Thomas, J., joined except as to Part III.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  OConnor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kennedy and Breyer, JJ., joined.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 031395.Argued January 11, 2005Decided March 2, 2005
Respondent husband and wife filed suit against the United States and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), asserting estoppel and due process claims for the CIAs alleged failure to provide them with financial assistance it had promised in return for their espionage services during the Cold War.  The District Court denied the Governments motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, finding that respondents claims were not barred by the rule of Totten v. United States, 92 U. S. 105, prohibiting suits against the Government based on covert espionage agreements.  Affirming in relevant part, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that Totten posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents claims and thus the case could proceed to trial, subject to the Governments asserting the evidentiary state secrets privilege and the District Courts resolving that issue.
Held:Respondents suit is barred by the Totten rule.  In Totten, this Court concluded with no difficulty that the President had the authority to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, observed that the very essence of such a contract was that it was secret and had to remain so, and found that allowing a former spy to bring suit to enforce such a contract would be entirely incompatible with the contracts nature.  The Ninth Circuit was quite wrong in holding that Totten does not require dismissal of respondents claims.  It reasoned that Totten developed merely a contract rule, prohibiting breach-of-contract claims seeking to enforce an espionage agreements terms but not barring due process or estoppel claims.  However, Totten was not so limited.  It precludes judicial review in cases such as respondents where success depends on the existence of their secret espionage relationship with the Government.  Id., at 107.  The Ninth Circuit also claimed that Totten had been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary state secrets privilege, rather than a categorical bar to respondents claims, relying mainly on United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, in which widows of civilians killed in a military plane crash sought privileged military information in their wrongful death action against the Government.  While the Reynolds Court looked to Totten in invoking the well established state secrets privilege, it in no way signaled a retreat from Tottens broader holding that lawsuits premised on alleged espionage agreements are altogether forbidden.  The Court later credited Tottens more sweeping holding in Weinberger v. Catholic Action of Haw./Peace Ed. Project, 454 U. S. 139, 146147, thus confirming its continued validity.  Reynolds therefore cannot plausibly be read to have replaced Tottens categorical bar in the distinct class of cases that depend upon clandestine spy relationships.  Nor does Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, which addressed constitutional claims made by acknowledged (though covert) CIA employees, support respondents claim.  Only in the case of an alleged former spy is Tottens core concern implicated: preventing the existence of the plaintiffs relationship with the Government from being revealed.  The state secrets privilege and the use of in camera judicial proceedings simply cannot provide the absolute protection the Court found necessary in enunciating the Totten rule.  The possibility that a suit may proceed and an espionage relationship may be revealed is unacceptable.  Forcing the Government to litigate these claims would also make it vulnerable to graymail, i.e., individual lawsuits brought to induce the CIA to settle a case out of fear that litigation would reveal classified information that might undermine covert operations.  And requiring the Government to invoke the privilege on a case-by-case basis risks the perception that it is either confirming or denying relationships with individual plaintiffs.  Pp.510.

HUMAN SERVICES, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 021472.Argued November 9, 2004Decided March 1, 2005
The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Act) authorizes the Government and Indian tribes to enter into contracts in which tribes promise to supply federally funded services that a Government agency normally would provide, 25 U. S.C. 450(f); and requires the Government to pay, inter alia, a tribes contract support costs, which are reasonable costs that a federal agency would not have incurred, but which the tribe would incur in managing the program, 450j1(a)(2).  Here, each Tribe agreed to supply health services normally provided by the Department of Health and Human Services Indian Health Service, and the contracts included an annual funding agreement with a Government promise to pay contract support costs.  In each instance, the Government refused to pay the full amount promised because Congress had not appropriated sufficient funds.  In the first case, the Tribes submitted administrative payment claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, which the Department of the Interior (the appropriations manager) denied.  They then brought a breach-of-contract action.  The District Court found against them, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  In the second case, the Cherokee Nation submitted claims to the Department of the Interior, which the Board of Contract Appeals ordered paid.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.
Held:The Government is legally bound to pay the contract support costs at issue.  Pp.415.
(a)The Government argues that it is legally bound by its promises to pay the relevant costs only if Congress appropriated sufficient funds, which the Government contends Congress did not do in this instance.  It does not deny that it promised, but failed, to pay the costs; that, were these ordinary procurement contracts, its promises to pay would be legally binding; that each year Congress appropriated more than the amounts at issue; that those appropriations Acts had no relevant statutory restrictions; that where Congress makes such appropriations, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions; and that as long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay contracts, as it did here, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on grounds of insufficient appropriations.  Thus, in order to show that its promises were not legally binding, the Government must show something special about the promises at issue.  It fails to do so here.  Pp.45.


(b)The Act does not support the Governments initial argument that, because the Act creates a special contract with a unique nature differentiating it from standard Government procurement contracts, a tribe should bear the risk that a lump-sum appropriation will be insufficient to pay its contract.  In general, the Acts language runs counter to this view, strongly suggesting instead that Congress, in respect to a promises binding nature, meant to treat alike promises made under the Act and ordinary contractual promises.  The Act uses contract 426 times to describe the nature of the Governments promise, and contract normally refers to a promise  for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law  recognizes as a duty, Restatement (Second) of Contracts 1.  Payment of contract support costs is described in a provision containing a sample Contract, 25 U. S.C. 450l(c), and contractors are entitled to money damages under the Contract Disputes Act if the Government refuses to pay, 450m1(a).  Nor do the Acts general purposes support any special treatment.  The Government points to the statement that tribes need not spend funds in excess of the amount of funds awarded, 450l(c), but that kind of statement often appears in procurement contracts; and the statement that no [self-determination] contract  shall be construed to be a procurement contract, 450b(j), in context, seems designed to relieve tribes and the Government of technical burdens that may accompany procurement, not to weaken a contracts binding nature.  Pp.58.

One phrasethe Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe, 450j1(b)did not make the Governments promise nonbinding, since the relevant appropriations contained unrestricted funds sufficient to pay the claims at issue.  When this happens in an ordinary procurement contract case, the Government admits that the contractor is entitled to payment even if the agency has allocated the funds to another purpose.  That the Government used the unrestricted funds to satisfy important needse.g., the cost of running the Indian Health Servicedoes not matter, for there is nothing special in the Acts language or the contracts to convince the Court that anything but the ordinary rule applies here.  The other proviso phrasewhich subjects the Governments provision of funds under the Act to the availability of appropriations, ibid.also fails to help the Government.  Congress appropriated adequate unrestricted funds here, and the Government provides no convincing argument for a special, rather than ordinary, interpretation of the phrase.  Legislative history shows only that Executive Branch officials wanted discretionary authority to allocate a lump-sum appropriation too small to pay for all contracts, not that Congress granted such authority.  And other statutory provisions, e.g., 450j1(c)(2), to which the Government points, do not provide sufficient support.  Pp.812.


(d)Finally, the Government points to 314 of the later-enacted 1999 Appropriations Act, which states that amounts earmarked in committee reports for the  Indian Health Service  [for] payments to tribes  for contract support costs  are the total amounts available for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for such purposes.  The Court rejects the Governments claims that this statute merely clarifies earlier ambiguous appropriations language that was wrongly read as unrestricted.  Earlier appropriations statutes were not ambiguous, and restrictive language in Committee Reports is not legally binding.  Because no other restrictive language exists, the earlier statutes unambiguously provided unrestricted lump-sum appropriations.  Nor should 314 be interpreted to retroactively bar payment of claims arising under 1994 through 1997 contracts.  That would raise serious constitutional issues by undoing binding governmental contractual obligations.  Thus, the Court adopts the interpretation that Congress intended to forbid the Indian Health Service to use unspent appropriated funds to pay unpaid contract support costs.  So interpreted, 314 does not bar recovery here.  Pp.1315.

			"|"CHEROKEE NATION OF OKLAHOMA et al. v. LEAVITT, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND 
HUMAN SERVICES, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 021472.Argued November 9, 2004Decided March 1, 2005
The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Act) authorizes the Government and Indian tribes to enter into contracts in which tribes promise to supply federally funded services that a Government agency normally would provide, 25 U. S.C. 450(f); and requires the Government to pay, inter alia, a tribes contract support costs, which are reasonable costs that a federal agency would not have incurred, but which the tribe would incur in managing the program, 450j1(a)(2).  Here, each Tribe agreed to supply health services normally provided by the Department of Health and Human Services Indian Health Service, and the contracts included an annual funding agreement with a Government promise to pay contract support costs.  In each instance, the Government refused to pay the full amount promised because Congress had not appropriated sufficient funds.  In the first case, the Tribes submitted administrative payment claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, which the Department of the Interior (the appropriations manager) denied.  They then brought a breach-of-contract action.  The District Court found against them, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  In the second case, the Cherokee Nation submitted claims to the Department of the Interior, which the Board of Contract Appeals ordered paid.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.
Held:The Government is legally bound to pay the contract support costs at issue.  Pp.415.
(a)The Government argues that it is legally bound by its promises to pay the relevant costs only if Congress appropriated sufficient funds, which the Government contends Congress did not do in this instance.  It does not deny that it promised, but failed, to pay the costs; that, were these ordinary procurement contracts, its promises to pay would be legally binding; that each year Congress appropriated more than the amounts at issue; that those appropriations Acts had no relevant statutory restrictions; that where Congress makes such appropriations, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions; and that as long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay contracts, as it did here, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on grounds of insufficient appropriations.  Thus, in order to show that its promises were not legally binding, the Government must show something special about the promises at issue.  It fails to do so here.  Pp.45.


(b)The Act does not support the Governments initial argument that, because the Act creates a special contract with a unique nature differentiating it from standard Government procurement contracts, a tribe should bear the risk that a lump-sum appropriation will be insufficient to pay its contract.  In general, the Acts language runs counter to this view, strongly suggesting instead that Congress, in respect to a promises binding nature, meant to treat alike promises made under the Act and ordinary contractual promises.  The Act uses contract 426 times to describe the nature of the Governments promise, and contract normally refers to a promise  for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law  recognizes as a duty, Restatement (Second) of Contracts 1.  Payment of contract support costs is described in a provision containing a sample Contract, 25 U. S.C. 450l(c), and contractors are entitled to money damages under the Contract Disputes Act if the Government refuses to pay, 450m1(a).  Nor do the Acts general purposes support any special treatment.  The Government points to the statement that tribes need not spend funds in excess of the amount of funds awarded, 450l(c), but that kind of statement often appears in procurement contracts; and the statement that no [self-determination] contract  shall be construed to be a procurement contract, 450b(j), in context, seems designed to relieve tribes and the Government of technical burdens that may accompany procurement, not to weaken a contracts binding nature.  Pp.58.


(c)Neither of the phrases in an Act proviso renders the Governments promise nonbinding.

03-633|"ROPER, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI CORRECTIONAL CENTER v. SIMMONS
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri
No. 03633.Argued October 13, 2004Decided March 1, 2005
At age 17, respondent Simmons planned and committed a capital murder.  After he had turned 18, he was sentenced to death.  His direct appeal and subsequent petitions for state and federal postconviction relief were rejected.  This Court then held, in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, that the Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the execution of a mentally retarded person.  Simmons filed a new petition for state postconviction relief, arguing that Atkins reasoning established that the Constitution prohibits the execution of a juvenile who was under 18 when he committed his crime.  The Missouri Supreme Court agreed and set aside Simmons death sentence in favor of life imprisonment without eligibility for release.  It held that, although Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, rejected the proposition that the Constitution bars capital punishment for juvenile offenders younger than 18, a national consensus has developed against the execution of those offenders since Stanford.  
Held:The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed.  Pp.625.
(a)The Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments must be interpreted according to its text, by considering history, tradition, and precedent, and with due regard for its purpose and function in the constitutional design.  To implement this framework this Court has established the propriety and affirmed the necessity of referring to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society to determine which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and unusual.  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100101.  In 1988, in Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 818838, a plurality determined that national standards of decency did not permit the execution of any offender under age 16 at the time of the crime.  The next year, in Stanford, a 5-to-4 Court referred to contemporary standards of decency, but concluded the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments did not proscribe the execution of offenders over 15 but under 18 because 22 of 37 death penalty States permitted that penalty for 16-year-old offenders, and 25 permitted it for 17-year-olds, thereby indicating there was no national consensus.  492 U. S., at 370371.  A plurality also emphatically reject[ed] the suggestion that the Court should bring its own judgment to bear on the acceptability of the juvenile death penalty.  Id., at 377378.  That same day the Court held, in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 334, that the Eighth Amendment did not mandate a categorical exemption from the death penalty for mentally retarded persons because only two States had enacted laws banning such executions.  Three Terms ago in Atkins, however, the Court held that standards of decency had evolved since Penry and now demonstrated that the execution of the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment.  The Atkins Court noted that objective indicia of societys standards, as expressed in pertinent legislative enactments and state practice, demonstrated that such executions had become so truly unusual that it was fair to say that a national consensus has developed against them.  536 U. S., at 314315.  The Court also returned to the rule, established in decisions predating Stanford, that the Constitution contemplates that the Courts own judgment be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty.  Id., at 312.  After observing that mental retardation diminishes personal culpability even if the offender can distinguish right from wrong, id., at 318, and that mentally retarded offenders impairments make it less defensible to impose the death penalty as retribution for past crimes or as a real deterrent to future crimes, id., at 319320, the Court ruled that the death penalty constitutes an excessive sanction for the entire category of mentally retarded offenders, and that the Eighth Amendment places a substantive restriction on the States power to take such an offenders life, id., at 321.  Just as the Atkins Court reconsidered the issue decided in Penry, the Court now reconsiders the issue decided in Stanford.  Pp.610. 


(b)Both objective indicia of consensus, as expressed in particular by the enactments of legislatures that have addressed the question, and the Courts own determination in the exercise of its independent judgment, demonstrate that the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for juveniles.  Pp.1021.


(1)As in Atkins, the objective indicia of national consensus herethe rejection of the juvenile death penalty in the majority of States; the infrequency of its use even where it remains on the books; and the consistency in the trend toward abolition of the practiceprovide sufficient evidence that today society views juveniles, in the words Atkins used respecting the mentally retarded, as categorically less culpable than the average criminal, 536 U. S., at 316.  The evidence of such consensus is similar, and in some respects parallel, to the evidence in Atkins:30 States prohibit the juvenile death penalty, including 12 that have rejected it altogether and 18 that maintain it but, by express provision or judicial interpretation, exclude juveniles from its reach.  Moreover, even in the 20 States without a formal prohibition, the execution of juveniles is infrequent.  Although, by contrast to Atkins, the rate of change in reducing the incidence of the juvenile death penalty, or in taking specific steps to abolish it, has been less dramatic, the difference between this case and Atkins in that respect is counterbalanced by the consistent direction of the change toward abolition.  Indeed, the slower pace here may be explained by the simple fact that the impropriety of executing juveniles between 16 and 18 years old gained wide recognition earlier than the impropriety of executing the mentally retarded.  Pp.1013. 


(2)Rejection of the imposition of the death penalty on juvenile offenders under 18 is required by the Eighth Amendment.  Capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution.  Atkins, 536 U. S. at 319.  Three general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.  Juveniles susceptibility to immature and irresponsible behavior means their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.  Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 835.  Their own vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean juveniles have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment.  See Stanford, supra, at 395.  The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character.  The Thompson plurality recognized the import of these characteristics with respect to juveniles under 16.  487 U. S., at 833838.  The same reasoning applies to all juvenile offenders under 18.  Once juveniles diminished culpability is recognized, it is evident that neither of the two penological justifications for the death penaltyretribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders, e.g., Atkins, 536 U. S., at 319provides adequate justification for imposing that penalty on juveniles.  Although the Court cannot deny or overlook the brutal crimes too many juvenile offenders have committed, it disagrees with petitioners contention that, given the Courts own insistence on individualized consideration in capital sentencing, it is arbitrary and unnecessary to adopt a categorical rule barring imposition of the death penalty on an offender under 18.  An unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of course, even where the juvenile offenders objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death.  When a juvenile commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, but the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.  While drawing the line at 18 is subject to the objections always raised against categorical rules, that is the point where society draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood and the age at which the line for death eligibility ought to rest.  Stanford should be deemed no longer controlling on this issue.  Pp.1421. 


(c)The overwhelming weight of international opinion against the juvenile death penalty is not controlling here, but provides respected and significant confirmation for the Courts determination that the penalty is disproportionate punishment for offenders under 18.  See, e.g., Thompson, supra, at 830831, and n. 31.  The United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile penalty.  It does not lessen fidelity to the Constitution or pride in its origins to acknowledge that the express affirmation of certain fundamental rights by other nations and peoples underscores the centrality of those same rights within our own heritage of freedom.  Pp.2125.

03-636|"JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03636.Argued November 2, 2004Decided February 23, 2005
The California Department of Corrections (CDC) unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility is based on the asserted rationale that it prevents violence caused by racial gangs.  Petitioner Johnson, an African-American inmate who has been intermittently double-celled under the policys terms ever since his 1987 incarceration, filed this suit alleging that the policy violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.  The District Court ultimately granted defendant former CDC officials summary judgment on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the policys constitutionality should be reviewed under the deferential standard articulated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, not under strict scrutiny, and that the policy survived Turner scrutiny.
Held:Strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to the CDCs policy.  Pp.415.
(a)Because the CDCs policy is immediately suspect as an express racial classification, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 642, the Ninth Circuit erred in failing to apply strict scrutiny and thereby to require the CDC to demonstrate that the policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 227.  [A]ll racial classifications [imposed by government]  must be analyzed  under strict scrutiny, ibid., in order to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant [such] a highly suspect tool, Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493.  The CDCs claim that its policy should be exempt from this categorical rule because it is neutrali.e., because all prisoners are equally segregatedignores this Courts repeated command that racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally, Shaw, supra, at 651.  Indeed, the Court rejected the notion that separate can ever be equalor neutral50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and refuses to resurrect it today.  The Court has previously applied a heightened standard of review in evaluating racial segregation in prisons.  Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333.  The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here.  By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates may exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.  Shaw, supra, at 648.  Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without reliance on racial segregation.  In fact, the United States argues that it is possible to address prison security concerns through individualized consideration without using racial segregation, unless it is warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a serious threat of race-related violence.  As to transferees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated at least once, it is not clear why more individualized determinations are not possible.  Pp. 49.

			"|"JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03636.Argued November 2, 2004Decided February 23, 2005
The California Department of Corrections (CDC) unwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells for up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility is based on the asserted rationale that it prevents violence caused by racial gangs.  Petitioner Johnson, an African-American inmate who has been intermittently double-celled under the policys terms ever since his 1987 incarceration, filed this suit alleging that the policy violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.  The District Court ultimately granted defendant former CDC officials summary judgment on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the policys constitutionality should be reviewed under the deferential standard articulated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, not under strict scrutiny, and that the policy survived Turner scrutiny.
Held:Strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an equal protection challenge to the CDCs policy.  Pp.415.
(a)Because the CDCs policy is immediately suspect as an express racial classification, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 642, the Ninth Circuit erred in failing to apply strict scrutiny and thereby to require the CDC to demonstrate that the policy is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 227.  [A]ll racial classifications [imposed by government]  must be analyzed  under strict scrutiny, ibid., in order to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant [such] a highly suspect tool, Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 493.  The CDCs claim that its policy should be exempt from this categorical rule because it is neutrali.e., because all prisoners are equally segregatedignores this Courts repeated command that racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally, Shaw, supra, at 651.  Indeed, the Court rejected the notion that separate can ever be equalor neutral50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and refuses to resurrect it today.  The Court has previously applied a heightened standard of review in evaluating racial segregation in prisons.  Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333.  The need for strict scrutiny is no less important here.  By perpetuating the notion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates may exacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to counteract.  Shaw, supra, at 648.  Virtually all other States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems without reliance on racial segregation.  In fact, the United States argues that it is possible to address prison security concerns through individualized consideration without using racial segregation, unless it is warranted as a necessary and temporary response to a serious threat of race-related violence.  As to transferees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated at least once, it is not clear why more individualized determinations are not possible.  Pp. 49.


(b)The Court declines the CDCs invitation to make an exception to the categorical strict scrutiny rule and instead to apply Turners deferential review standard on the ground that the CDCs policy applies only in the prison context.  The Court has never applied the Turner standardwhich asks whether a regulation that burdens prisoners fundamental rights is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, 482 U.

03-814|"STEWART v. DUTRA CONSTRUCTION CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 03814.Argued November 1, 2004Decided February 22, 2005
As part of a project to extend the Massachusetts Turnpike, respondent Dutra Construction Company dug a trench beneath Boston Harbor using its dredge, the Super Scoop, a floating platform with a bucket that removes silt from the ocean floor and dumps it onto adjacent scows.  The Super Scoop has limited means of self-propulsion, but can navigate short distances by manipulating its anchors and cables.  When dredging the trench here, it typically moved once every couple of hours.  Petitioner, a marine engineer hired by Dutra to maintain the Super Scoops mechanical systems, was seriously injured while repairing a scows engine when the Super Scoop and the scow collided.  He sued Dutra under the Jones Act, alleging that he was a seaman injured by Dutras negligence, and under 5(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U. S.C. 905(b), which authorizes covered employees to sue a vessel owner as a third party for an injury caused by the owners negligence.  The District Court granted Dutra summary judgment on the Jones Act claim, and the First Circuit affirmed.  On remand, the District Court granted Dutra summary judgment on the LHWCA claim.  In affirming, the First Circuit noted that Dutra had conceded that the Super Scoop was a vessel under 905(b), but found that Dutras alleged negligence had been committed in its capacity as an employer and not as the vessels owner. 
Held:A dredge is a vessel under the LHWCA.  Pp.415.
(a)Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to remove the bar to negligence suits by seamen.  Although that Act does not define seaman, the maritime law backdrop at the time it was passed shows that seaman is a term of art with an established meaning under general maritime law.  The LHWCA, enacted in 1927 to provide scheduled compensation to land-based maritime workers but not to a master or member of a crew of any vessel, 33 U. S.C. 902(3)(G), works in tandem with the Jones Act: The Jones Act provides tort remedies to sea-based maritime workers and the LHWCA provides workers compensation to land-based maritime employees.  In McDermott Intl, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S. 337, and Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, this Court addressed the relationship a worker must have to a vessel in order to be a master or  member of its crew.  Now the Court turns to the other half of the LHWCAs equation: determining whether a watercraft is a vessel.  Pp.46.


(b)The LHWCA did not define vessel when enacted, but 1 and 3 of the Revised Statutes of 1873 specified that, in any Act passed after February 25, 1871, vessel includes every description of water-craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.  The LHWCA is such an Act.    Section 3s definition has remained virtually unchanged to the present and continues to supply the default definition of vessel throughout the U. S. Code.  Section 3 merely codified the meaning vessel had acquired in general maritime law.  In fact, prior to the passage of the Jones Act and the LHWCA, this Court and lower courts had treated dredges as vessels.  By the time those Acts became law in the 1920s, it was settled that 3 defined vessel for their purposes, and that a structures status as a vessel under 3 depended on whether the structure was an instrument of naval transportation.  See Ellis v. United States, 206 U. S. 246, 259.  Then as now, dredges served a waterborne transportation function: In performing their work they carried machinery, equipment, and a crew over water.  This Court has continued to treat 3 as defining vessel in the LHWCA and to construe 3 consistently with general maritime law.  Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U. S. 565.  Pp.610.


(c)Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U. S. 625, and Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19, did not adopt a definition of vesselhood narrower than 3.  Rather, they made a sensible distinction between watercraft temporarily stationed in a particular location and those permanently anchored to shore or the ocean floor.  A watercraft is not capable of being used for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored or otherwise rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.  By including special-purpose vessels like dredges, 3 sweeps broadly, but other prerequisites to qualifying for seaman status under the Jones Act provide some limits.  A worker seeking such status must prove that his duties contributed to the vessels function or mission and that his connection to the vessel was substantial in nature and duration.  Chandris, supra, at 376.  Pp.  1012.


(d)The First Circuit held that the Super Scoop is not a vessel because its primary purpose is not navigation or commerce and because it was not in actual transit at the time of Stewarts injury.  Neither prong of that test is consistent with 3s text or general maritime laws established meaning of vessel.  Section 3 requires only that a watercraft be used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water, not that it be used primarily for that purpose.  The Super Scoop was not only capable of being used to transport equipment and passengers over waterit was so used.   Similarly, requiring a watercraft to be in motion to qualify as a vessel under 3 is the sort of snapshot test rejected in Chandris.  That a vessel must be in navigation, Chandris, supra, at 373374, means not that a structures locomotion at any given moment matters, but that structures may lose their character as vessels if withdrawn from the water for an extended period.  The in navigation requirement is thus relevant to whether a craft is used, or capable of being used, for naval transportation.  The inquiry whether a craft is used, or capable of being used, for maritime transportation may involve factual issues for a jury, but here no relevant facts were in dispute.  Dutra conceded that the Super Scoop was only temporarily stationary while the scow was being repaired; it had not been taken out of service, permanently anchored, or otherwise rendered practically incapable of maritime transport.  Finally, Dutra conceded that the Super Scoop is a vessel under 905(b), which imposes LHWCA liability on vessel owners for negligence to longshoremen.  However, the LHWCA does not meaningfully define the term vessel in either 902(3)(G) or 905(b), and 1 U. S.C. 3 defines the term vessel throughout the LHWCA.  Pp.1315.
343 F.3d 10, reversed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Rehnquist, C.J., who took no part in the decision of the case.

03-8661|"SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTS
certiorari to the appeals court of massachusetts
No. 038661.Argued December 1, 2004Decided February 22, 2005
Petitioner was tried before a Massachusetts jury on charges related to a shooting, including unlawful possession of a firearm.  At the conclusion of the prosecutions case, petitioner moved for a not-guilty finding on the firearm count because the evidence [was] insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction, Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a).  The trial judge granted the motion, finding no evidence to support the requirement of the unlawful possession count that the firearm have a barrel shorter than 16 inches.  The prosecution rested, and the trial proceeded on the other counts.  Before closing argument, the prosecution argued that under Massachusetts precedent, the victims testimony that the defendant shot him with a pistol or revolver sufficed to establish barrel length.  The judge reversed her previous ruling, allowing the firearm count to go to the jury.  The jury convicted petitioner on all counts.  In affirming, the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated because the trial judges correction of her ruling had not subjected petitioner to a second prosecution or proceeding, and held that Rule 25 did not prohibit the judge from reconsidering her decision.  
Held:
1.Submitting the firearm count to the jury plainly subjected petitioner to further factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence, which are prohibited following a midtrial acquittal by the court, Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140, 145.  The ruling here met the definition of an acquittal consistently used in this Courts double-jeopardy cases.  In United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, this Court rejected reasoning identical to the Commonwealths claim that jeopardy did not terminate midtrial because the judges determination was legal rather than factual.  How Massachusetts characterizes the ruling is not binding on this Court.  Smalis, supra, at 144, n.5.  What matters is that, as the Massachusetts Rules authorize, the judge evaluated the [Commonwealths] evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.  Martin Linen, supra, at 572.  Pp.36.


2.The Double Jeopardy Clause forbade the judge to reconsider the acquittal later in the trial.  While the Clause may permit States to create a procedure for reconsidering a midtrial determination of insufficiency of proof, Massachusetts had no such procedure at the time of petitioners trial.  Its Rules allowed only clerical errors, or those arising from oversight or omission, to be corrected at any time.  Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 42.  A few Commonwealth cases have provided that interlocutory rulings are subject to reconsideration, but these cases, without more, do not extend that principle to a not-guilty finding under Rule 25, which purports not to be interlocutory but to end the case.  A seeming dismissal may induce a defendant to present a defense to the undismissed charges when he would be better advised to stand silent.  The Double Jeopardy Clause cannot be allowed to become a potential snare for those who reasonably rely on it.  If, after a facially unqualified midtrial acquittal on one count, the trial has proceeded to the defendants introduction of evidence on the remaining counts, the acquittal must be treated as final, unless the availability of reconsideration has been plainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of the evidence.

03-892|"COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. BANKS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 03892.Argued November 1, 2004Decided January 24, 2005*
Respondent Banks settled his federal employment discrimination suit against a California state agency and respondent Banaitis settled his Oregon state case against his former employer, but neither included fees paid to their attorneys under contingent-fee agreements as gross income on their federal income tax returns.  In each case petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a notice of deficiency, which the Tax Court upheld.  In Banks case, the Sixth Circuit reversed in part, finding that the amount Banks paid to his attorney was not includable as gross income.  In Banaitis case, the Ninth Circuit found that because Oregon law grants attorneys a superior lien in the contingent-fee portion of any recovery, that part of Banaitis settlement was not includable as gross income.  
Held:When a litigants recovery constitutes income, the litigants income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a contingent fee.  Pp.512.
(a)Two preliminary observations help clarify why this issue is of consequence.  First, taking the legal expenses as miscellaneous itemized deductions would have been of no help to respondents because the Alternative Minimum Tax establishes a tax liability floor and does not allow such deductions.  Second, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004which amended the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer, in computing adjusted gross income, to deduct attorneys fees such as those at issuedoes not apply here because it was passed after these cases arose and is not retroactive.  Pp.56.


(b)The Code defines gross income broadly to include all economic gains not otherwise exempted.  Under the anticipatory assignment of income doctrine, a taxpayer cannot exclude an economic gain from gross income by assigning the gain in advance to another party, e.g., Lucas v. Earl, 281 U. S. 111, because gains should be taxed to those who earn them, id., at 114.  The doctrine is meant to prevent taxpayers from avoiding taxation through arrangements and contracts devised to prevent income from vesting in the one who earned it.  Id., at 115.   Because the rule is preventative and motivated by administrative and substantive concerns, this Court does not inquire whether any particular assignment has a discernible tax avoidance purpose.  Pp.67.


(c)The Court agrees with the Commissioner that a contingent-fee agreement should be viewed as an anticipatory assignment to the attorney of a portion of the clients income from any litigation recovery.  In an ordinary case attribution of income is resolved by asking whether a taxpayer exercises complete dominion over the income in question.  However, in the context of anticipatory assignments, where the assignor may not have dominion over the income at the moment of receipt, the question is whether the assignor retains dominion over the income-generating asset.  Looking to such control preserves the principle that income should be taxed to the party who earns the income and enjoys the consequent benefits.  In the case of a litigation recovery the income-generating asset is the cause of action derived from the plaintiffs legal injury.  The plaintiff retains dominion over this asset throughout the litigation.  Respondents counterarguments are rejected.  The legal claims value may be speculative at the moment of the assignment, but the anticipatory assignment doctrine is not limited to instances when the precise dollar value of the assigned income is known in advance.  In these cases, the taxpayer retained control over the asset, diverted some of the income produced to another party, and realized a benefit by doing so.  Also rejected is respondents suggestion that the attorney-client relationship be treated as a sort of business partnership or joint venture for tax purposes.  In fact, that relationship is a quintessential principal-agent relationship, for the client retains ultimate dominion and control over the underlying claim.  The attorney can make tactical decisions without consulting the client, but the client still must determine whether to settle or proceed to judgment and make, as well, other critical decisions.  The attorney is an agent who is duty bound to act in the principals interests, and so it is appropriate to treat the full recovery amount as income to the principal. This rule applies regardless of whether the attorney-client contract or state law confers any special rights or protections on the attorney, so long as such protections do not alter the relationships fundamental principal-agent character.  The Court declines to comment on other theories proposed by respondents and their amici, which were not advanced in earlier stages of the litigation or examined by the Courts of Appeals.   Pp.710.


(d)This Court need not address Banks contention that application of the anticipatory assignment principle would be inconsistent with the purpose of statutory fee-shifting provisions, such as those applicable in his case brought under 42 U. S.C. 1981, 1983, and 2000(e) et seq.  He settled his case, and the fee paid to his attorney was calculated based solely on the contingent-fee contract.  There was no court-ordered fee award or any indication in his contract with his attorney or the settlement that the contingent fee paid was in lieu of statutory fees that might otherwise have been recovered.  Also, the American Jobs Creation Act redresses the concern for many, perhaps most, claims governed by fee-shifting statutes.  P. 11.

			"|"COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v. BANKS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 03892.Argued November 1, 2004Decided January 24, 2005*
Respondent Banks settled his federal employment discrimination suit against a California state agency and respondent Banaitis settled his Oregon state case against his former employer, but neither included fees paid to their attorneys under contingent-fee agreements as gross income on their federal income tax returns.  In each case petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a notice of deficiency, which the Tax Court upheld.  In Banks case, the Sixth Circuit reversed in part, finding that the amount Banks paid to his attorney was not includable as gross income.  In Banaitis case, the Ninth Circuit found that because Oregon law grants attorneys a superior lien in the contingent-fee portion of any recovery, that part of Banaitis settlement was not includable as gross income.  
Held:When a litigants recovery constitutes income, the litigants income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a contingent fee.  Pp.512.

03-9560|"MARLON LATODD HOWELL, aka MARLON COX,
PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
mississippi
[January 24, 2005]
Per Curiam.

Petitioner Marlon Howell contends that the Mississippi courts violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by refusing to require a jury instruction about a lesser included offense in his capital case.  He did not, however, raise this claim in the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which unsurprisingly did not address it.  As a result, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.


Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death for killing Hugh David Pernell.  Shortly after 5 a.m. on May 15, 2000, Pernell was delivering newspapers from his car when the occupants of another car motioned for him to stop.  The evidence at trial indicated that, when both cars had pulled over, petitioner got out of the trailing car and approached the drivers side of Pernells car.  After a brief conversation and perhaps some kind of scuffle, petitioner pulled out a pistol, shot Pernell through the heart, got back in the other car, and fled the scene.  See 860 So.2d 704, 712715, 738739 (Miss. 2003).  At trial, petitioner argued both that he was in another city at the time of the killing and that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Pernell was killed during an attempted robbery (which would deprive the State of an element of capital murder).  As part of his non-alibi defense, petitioner sought to supplement the States proposed jury instruction on capital murder with instructions on manslaughter and simple murder.  The trial court refused the additional instructions.  The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder and separately concluded that he should be sentenced to death.


On appeal to the State Supreme Court, one of petitioners 28 claims of error was the trial courts failure to give the defendant an instruction on the offense of simple murder or manslaughter.  App. 39.  In that argument, petitioner cited three cases from the State Supreme Court about lesser-included-offense instructions, and the only opinion whose original language he quoted was a noncapital case.  Ibid. (quoting, with modifications, Conner v. State, 632 So.2d 1239, 1254 (Miss. 1993) (a capital case), in turn quoting McGowan v. State, 541 So.2d 1027, 1028 (Miss. 1989) (a noncapital case), in turn quoting Harper v. State, 478 So.2d 1017, 1021 (Miss. 1985) (a noncapital case)).  Petitioner argued that, because the jury could have found and returned the lesser included offense of simple murder or manslaughter, the failure to give instructions on those offenses was error that left the jury no choice but either to turn [him] loose or convict him of [c]apital [m]urder.  App. 40.  In the course of affirming petitioners conviction and death sentence, the State Supreme Court found that [t]he facts of this case clearly do not support or warrant the instruction for manslaughter or simple murder.  860 So.2d, at 744.  The court cited and quoted a prior noncapital decision, which construed a state statute and concluded that an instruction should be refused if it would cause the jury to ignore the primary charge or if the evidence does not justify submission of a lesser-included offense.  Ibid. (quoting Presley v. State, 321 So.2d 309, 310311 (Miss. 1975)).  The court also cited Grace v. State, 375 So.2d 419 (Miss. 1979), an aggravated-assault case rejecting an instruction for simple assault.


Petitioner sought certiorari from this Court, arguing that his death sentence is unconstitutional under that rule of our capital jurisprudence set forth in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 638 (1980) ([I]f the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction, [the State] is constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option from the jury in a capital case).  See Pet. for Cert. 5.  We granted certiorari, but asked the parties to address the following additional question: Was petitioners federal constitutional claim properly raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 U. S.C. 1257?  542 U. S. ___ (2004).  Our answer to that question prevents us from reaching petitioners constitutional claim.


Congress has given this Court the power to review [f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had  where any  right  is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of  the United States.  28 U. S.C. 1257(a) (emphasis added).  Under that statute and its predecessors, this Court has almost unfailingly refused to consider any federal-law challenge to a state-court decision unless the federal claim was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we have been asked to review.  Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam); see also Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 218 (1983) (tracing this principle back to Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 391 (1836), and Owings v. Norwoods Lessee, 5 Cranch 344 (1809)).


Petitioners brief in the State Supreme Court did not properly present his claim as one arising under federal law.[Footnote 1]  In the relevant argument, he did not cite the Constitution or even any cases directly construing it, much less any of this Courts cases.  Instead, he argues that he presented his federal claim by citing Harveston v. State, 493 So.2d 365 (Miss. 1986), which cited (among other cases) Fairchild v. State, 459 So.2d 793 (Miss. 1984), which in turn cited Beck, but only by way of acknowledging that Mississippis general rule requiring lesser-included-offense instructions takes on constitutional proportions in capital cases.  459 So.2d, at 800.  Assuming it constituted adequate briefing of the federal question under state-law standards, petitioners daisy chainwhich depends upon a case that was cited by one of the cases that was cited by one of the cases that petitioner citedis too lengthy to meet this Courts standards for proper presentation of a federal claim.[Footnote 2]  As we recently explained in a slightly different context, [a] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief  by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim federal.  Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 32 (2004).  In the context of 1257, the same steps toward clarity are just as easy to take and are generally necessary to establish that a federal question was properly presented to a state court.  Petitioner did none of these things.


Petitioner also contends that he raised his federal claim by implication because the state-law rule on which he relied was identical, Tr. of Oral Arg. 17, or virtually identical, Brief for Petitioner 1718, to the constitutional rule articulated in Beck.  Assuming, without deciding, that identical standards might overcome a petitioners failure to identify his claim as federal, Mississippis rule regarding lesser-included-offense instructions is not identical to Beckor at least not identical to the Mississippi Supreme Courts interpretation of Beck.  Mississippis rule applies even when the jury is not choosing only between acquittal and death.  The Mississippi Supreme Courts interpretation of Beck, on the other hand, holds that case inapplicable where the jury has the additional option of life imprisonment, see Jackson v. State, 684 So.2d 1213, 1228 (1996)a conclusion that finds some support in our cases, see Hopkins v. Reeves, 524 U. S. 88, 98 (1998) (In Beck, the death penalty was automatically tied to conviction, and Becks jury was told that if it convicted the defendant of the charged offense, it was required to impose the death penalty); Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 646 (1991) (Our fundamental concern in Beck was that a jury  might  vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all).  Moreover, unlike Beck, see 447 U. S., at 638, n.14, Mississippis rule on lesser-included-offense instructions applies in noncapital cases (as shown by the cases petitioner did cite).  Thus, one opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court appears to have treated a claim under Beck as distinct from one arising under the Mississippi rule.  See Goodin v. State, 787 So.2d 639, 656 (2001) (Having found no [federal] constitutional flaws in the jury instruction given, we must now determine whether our practice entitles Goodin to a manslaughter instruction.  We have held that there must be some evidentiary support to grant an instruction for manslaughter).


Petitioner suggests that we need not treat his failure to present his federal claim in state court as jurisdictional.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, and n.1.  Notwithstanding the long line of cases clearly stating that the presentation requirement is jurisdictional, see, e.g., Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U. S. 176, 181, n.3 (1983); Cardinale v. Louisiana, 394 U. S. 437, 438439 (1969) (citing cases), a handful of exceptions (discussed in Gates, 462 U. S., at 219) have previously led us to conclude that this is an unsettled question.  Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 79 (1988).  As in prior cases, however, we need not decide today whether our requirement that a federal claim be addressed or properly presented in state court is jurisdictional or prudential, because even treating the rule as purely prudential, the circumstances here justify no exception.  Adams, 520 U. S., at 90 (citations omitted); accord, Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992); Bankers Life, supra, at 79; Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 87 (1985); Gates, supra, at 222.[Footnote 3]


Accordingly, we dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.
It is so ordered.
Petitioner argues not that the State Supreme Court actually addressed his federal claim, but rather that it had an adequate opportunity to address it.  Brief for Petitioner 19.
See, e.g., Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 89, n.3 (1997) (per curiam) (concluding that passing invocations of due process that fail to cite the Federal Constitution or any cases relying on the Fourteenth Amendment do not meet our minimal requirement that it must be clear that a federal claim was presented); Webb v. Webb, 451 U. S. 493, 496 (1981) (finding a reference to full faith and credit insufficient to raise a federal claim without a reference to the U. S. Constitution or to any cases relying on it); New York Central R. Co. v. New York, 186 U. S. 269, 273 (1902) ([I]t is well settled in this court that it must be made to appear that some provision of the Federal, as distinguished from the state, Constitution was relied upon, and that such provision must be set forth); Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County, 166 U. S. 648, 655 (1897) (a partys intent to invoke the Federal Constitution must be unmistakably declared, and the statutory requirement is not met if the purpose of the party to assert a Federal right is left to mere inference).
In Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U. S. 877, 883 (1986), the Court chose to reach a question that had not been presented in state court for two reasons that are inapplicable here: because the other party had no objection to reaching the question, and because the case had previously been remanded to the state court on other grounds.

04-394|"RICKY BELL, WARDEN v. GARY BRADFORD CONE
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04394.Decided January 24, 2005
Per Curiam.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a writ of habeas corpus to respondent Gary Bradford Cone after concluding that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance found by the jury at the sentencing phase of his trial was unconstitutionally vague, and that the Tennessee Supreme Court failed to cure any constitutional deficiencies on appeal.  359 F.3d 785, 799 (2004).  Because this result fails to accord to the state court the deference required by 28 U. S.C. 2254(d), we grant the petition for certiorari and respondents motion to proceed in forma pauperis and reverse.
I

Respondent killed Shipley Todd, 93, and his wife Cleopatra, 79, on August 10, 1980, in their home at the conclusion of a 2-day crime spree.  The killings were accomplished in a brutal and callous fashion: The elderly victims were repeatedly beaten about the head until they died, State v. Cone, 665 S. W. 2d 87, 9091 (Tenn. 1984), and their bodies were subsequently discovered horribly mutilated and cruelly beaten, id., at 90.  A Tennessee jury convicted respondent of, inter alia, two counts of murder in the first degree and two counts of murder in the first degree in the perpetration of a burglary.  At the conclusion of the penalty phase of respondents trial, the jury unanimously found four aggravating circumstances[Footnote 1] and concluded that they outweighed the mitigating evidence.  Respondent was sentenced to death.
The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed respondents convictions and sentence.  Id., at 96.  As relevant here, the court held that three of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury were clearly shown by the evidence.  Id., at 94.[Footnote 2]  With respect to the jurys finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, the court said:
The jury also found that the murders in question were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or depravity of mind as provided in [Tenn. Code Ann.] 392203(i)(5).  The evidence abundantly established that both of the elderly victims had been brutally beaten to death by multiple crushing blows to the skulls.  Blood was spattered throughout the house, and both victims apparently had attempted to resist, because numerous defensive wounds were found on their persons.  The only excuse offered in the entire record for this unspeakably brutal conduct by the accused was that these elderly victims had at some point ceased to cooperate with him in his ransacking of their home and in his effort to flee from arrest.  As previously stated, it was stipulated by counsel for [respondent] that there was no issue of self-defense even remotely suggested.  The deaths of the victims were not instantaneous, and obviously one had to be killed before the other.  The terror, fright and horror that these elderly helpless citizens must have endured was certainly something that the jury could have taken into account in finding this aggravating circumstance.  Id., at 9495.

Respondent twice sought relief from his conviction and sentence in collateral proceedings in state court, to no avail.  In his second amended petition for postconviction relief, respondent raised 52 independent claims of constitutional error, including a contention that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth Amendment.  The state trial court held each of respondents claims barred by Tenn. Code Ann. 4030111 (Lexis 1990), which limited the grounds that may be raised on collateral review to those not waived or previously determined in previous proceedings.  The trial court explained that respondents constitutional challenge to the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance, along with many other claims, was clearly [a] re-statemen[t] of previous grounds heretofore determined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Petition.  Cone v. State, No. P06874 (Tenn. Crim. Ct., Dec. 16, 1993), p. 6.  The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of relief on all grounds.  Cone v. State, 927 S. W. 2d 579, 582 (1995).  The State Supreme Court denied respondent permission to appeal.
II

In 1997, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.C. 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, again asserting a multitude of claims.  The District Court denied relief; it held respondents vagueness challenge to the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance to be procedurally barred by respondents failure to raise it on direct appeal in state court.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit subsequently held that respondent was entitled to relief on another ground and did not consider respondents challenges to the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. Cone v. Bell, 243 F.3d 961, 975 (2001).  We reversed that judgment.  Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002).
On remand, the same panel of the Sixth Circuit again granted respondent a writ of habeas corpus, this time with one judge dissenting, on the ground that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator was unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth Amendment.  The court first rejected petitioners argument that respondent procedurally defaulted the claim in state court.  Based on its understanding of state law, the court concluded that the State Supreme Courts statutorily mandated review of each death sentence, see Tenn. Code Ann. 392205(c)(1) (Lexis 1982), necessarily included the consideration of constitutional deficiencies in the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and therefore that the issue was fairly presented to the state court, even if respondent did not raise it himself.[Footnote 3]  359 F.3d, at 791793.  Judge Norris dissented on this point.  Id., at 806.


Turning to the merits, the Sixth Circuit held that the state courts affirmance of respondents sentence in light of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was contrary to the clearly established principles set forth in our decision in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980).  The Court of Appeals allowed that [n]o Supreme Court case has addressed the precise language at issue, 359 F.3d, at 795, and that no Supreme Court decision is on all fours with the instruction in Cones case,[Footnote 4] id., at 796, but nevertheless concluded, in light of Godfrey and the series of cases that followed it, Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988), Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639 (1990), and Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990) (per curiam), that federal law dictated the conclusion that the States especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator was unconstitutionally vague.[Footnote 5]  359 F.3d, at 797.  Lastly, the court rejected petitioners argument that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any deficiency in the aggravating circumstance on direct appeal by reviewing the jurys finding under the narrowed construction of the aggravator that it adopted in State v. Dicks, 615 S. W. 2d 126 (1981).  359 F.3d, at 797.
III

A federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim adjudicated by a state court if the state-court decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).  A state courts decision is contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases, or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant Supreme Court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to ours.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405 (2000).
The law governing vagueness challenges to statutory aggravating circumstances was summarized aptly in Walton v. Arizona, supra, overruled on other grounds, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002):
When a federal court is asked to review a state courts application of an individual statutory aggravating or mitigating circumstance in a particular case, it must first determine whether the statutory language defining the circumstance is itself too vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer.  If so, then the federal court must attempt to determine whether the state courts have further defined the vague terms and, if they have done so, whether those definitions are constitutionally sufficient, i.e., whether they provide some guidance to the sentencer.  Walton, supra, at 654.

These principles were plain enough at the time the State Supreme Court decided respondents appeal.  In Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976), we upheld the aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel on the express ground that a narrowing construction had been adopted by that States Supreme Court.  Id., at 255 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  And, in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), we refused to invalidate the aggravating circumstance that the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim, because there [was] no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt . . . an open-ended construction that is potentially applicable to any murder.  Id., at 201 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  See generally Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 774777 (1990) (reviewing cases).


Indeed, in Godfrey, 446 U. S. 420, the case on which the Court of Appeals relied in declaring the aggravating circumstance to be unconstitutionally vague, the controlling plurality opinion followed precisely this procedure.  Like the court below, the plurality looked first to the language of the aggravating circumstance found by the jury and concluded that there was nothing in these few words, standing alone, that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.  Id., at 428.  But the plurality did not stop there: It next evaluated whether the Georgia Supreme Court applied a constitutional construction of the aggravating circumstance on appeal.  Id., at 432.  Because the facts of the case did not resemble those in which the state court had previously applied a narrower construction of the aggravating circumstance and because the state court gave no explanation for its decision other than to say that the verdict was factually substantiated, the plurality concluded that it did not.  Id., at 432433.  As we have subsequently explained, this conclusion was the linchpin of the Courts holding: Had the Georgia Supreme Court applied a narrowing construction of the aggravator, we would have rejected the Eighth Amendment challenge to Godfreys sentence, notwithstanding the failure to instruct the jury on that narrowing construction.  Lambrix v. Singletary, 520 U. S. 518, 531 (1997).  See also Walton, 497 U. S., at 653654; Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 363365 (refusing to countenance the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmance of a death sentence based on a facially vague aggravating circumstance where that court had not adopted a narrowing construction of its aggravator when it affirmed the prisoners sentence).[Footnote 6]


In this case, however, the Sixth Circuit rejected the possibility that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any error in the jury instruction by applying a narrowing construction of the statutory heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator.  The court asserted that the State Supreme Court did not apply, or even mention, any narrowing interpretation or cite to [sic] Dicks, the case in which the State Supreme Court had adopted a narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance.  359 F.3d, at 797.  Instead, the court said, the [state] court simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels heinous, atrocious, or cruel, without more, applied to [respondents] crime.  Ibid.


We do not think that a federal court can presume so lightly that a state court failed to apply its own law.  As we have said before, 2254(d) dictates a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings, Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333 n.7 (1997), which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.  Woodford v. Viscotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam).  To the extent that the Court of Appeals rested its decision on the state courts failure to cite Dicks, it was mistaken.  Federal courts are not free to presume that a state court did not comply with constitutional dictates on the basis of nothing more than a lack of citation.  See Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U. S. 12, 16 (2003) (per curiam); Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam).


More importantly, however, we find no basis for the Court of Appeals statement that the state court simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels heinous, atrocious, or cruel, without more, applied to the murder.  359 F.3d, at 797.  The state courts opinion does not disclaim application of that courts established construction of the aggravating circumstance; the only thing that it states explicitly is that the evidence in this case supported the jurys finding of the statutory aggravator.  See Cone, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95 (stating that the aggravating circumstance was indisputably established by the record).  As we explain below, the State Supreme Court had construed the aggravating circumstance narrowly and had followed that precedent numerous times; absent an affirmative indication to the contrary, we must presume that it did the same thing here.  See Viscotti, supra, at 24 (stating the presumption that state courts know and follow the law); Lambrix, supra, at 532, n.4; Walton, supra, at 653.  That is especially true in a case such as this one, where the state court has recognized that its narrowing construction is constitutionally compelled and has affirmatively assumed the responsibility to ensure that the aggravating circumstance is applied constitutionally in each case.  See State v. Pritchett, 621 S. W. 2d 127, 139, 140 (Tenn. 1981).


Even absent such a presumption in the state courts favor, however, we would still conclude in this case that the state court applied the narrower construction of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance.  The State Supreme Courts reasoning in this case closely tracked its rationale for affirming the death sentences in other cases in which it expressly applied a narrowed construction of the same heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator.  Accord, Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 432 (holding that the circumstances of this case  do not satisfy the criteria [for torture] laid out by the Georgia Supreme Court itself in its cases construing the aggravating circumstance).  The facts the court relied on to affirm the jurys verdictthat the elderly victims attempted to resist, that their deaths were not instantaneous, that respondents actions towards them were unspeakably brutal and that they endured terror, fright and horror before being killed, 665 S.W. 2d, at 95match, almost exactly, the reasons the state court gave when it held the evidence in State v. Melson, 638 S.W. 2d 342, 367 (1982), to be sufficient to satisfy the torture prong of the narrowed heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance.  See also Pritchett, supra, at 139 (finding the evidence to be insufficient to satisfy a narrowed construction of the aggravator where the victims death was instantaneous); State v. Campbell, 664 S.W. 2d 281, 284 (Tenn. 1984) (holding that evidence of the aggravator was overwhelming where an elderly murder victim was beaten to death with a blunt object and his hands showed that he had attempted to defend himself).  Similarly, the state courts findings that respondents victims had been brutally beaten to death by multiple crushing blows to the skulls, that [b]lood was spattered throughout the house, and that the victims were helpless, 665 S.W. 2d, at 9495, accord with the reasons that the state court had previously found sufficient to support findings of depravity of mind.  See Melson, supra, at 367; State v. Groseclose, 615 S.W. 2d 142, 151 (Tenn. 1981); Strouth v. State, 999 S.W. 2d 759, 766 (Tenn. 1999).  In sum, a review of the state courts previous decisions interpreting and applying the narrowed construction of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator leaves little doubt that the State Supreme Court applied that same construction in respondents case.[Footnote 7]


The only remaining question is whether the narrowing construction that the Tennessee Supreme Court applied was itself unconstitutionally vague.  See Walton, 497 U. S., at 654; Godfrey, supra, at 428.  It was not.  In State v. Dicks, 615 S.W. 2d 126 (Tenn. 1981), the state court adopted the exact construction of the aggravator that we approved in Proffitt, 428 U. S., at 255: that the aggravator was directed at the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim, Dicks, supra, at 132.  See also Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 536 (1992).  In light of Proffitt, we think this interpretation of the aggravator, standing alone, would be sufficient to overcome the claim that the aggravating circumstance applied by the state court was contrary to clearly established federal law under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).


The State Supreme Courts subsequent application of this aggravating circumstance, as construed in Dicks, stands as further proof that it could be applied meaningfully to narrow the class of death-eligible offenders.   Later in the year that Dicks was decided, the court elaborated on the meaning of the aggravator:
Although the Tennessee aggravating circumstances [sic] [that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel], does not contain the phrase, an aggravated battery to the victim it is clear that a constitutional construction of this aggravating circumstance requires evidence that the defendant inflicted torture on the victim before death or that [the] defendant committed acts evincing a depraved state of mind; that the depraved state of mind or the torture inflicted must meet the test of heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  Pritchett, 621 S.W. 2d, at 139 (citation omitted).

With respect to the meaning of torture, the court held that the aggravator was not satisfied where the victim dies instantly, ibid., but that it was where the uncontradicted proof shows that [the victim] had defensive injuries to her arms and hands, proving that there was time for her to realize what was happening, to feel fear, and to try to protect herself, Melson, supra, at 367.  Accord, Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 364365 (approving the limitation of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance to killings in which the victim suffered some kind of torture or serious physical abuse prior to the murder).  As to depravity of mind, the court held the fact that the defendant fired a second shotgun blast into a victim after he was dead to be insufficient as a matter of law, see Pritchett, 621 S.W. 2d, at 139 (explaining that the depravity in such an action falls short of that exhibited by the defendant in Godfrey, supra), but concluded that, a killing wherein the victim is struck up to thirty times, causing an entire room to be covered with a spray of flying blood, and causing the victims brains to extrude through the gaping hole in her skull, sufficed, Melson, 638 S.W. 2d, at 367.[Footnote 8]  In light of these holdings, we are satisfied that the States aggravating circumstance, as construed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, ensured that there was a principled basis for distinguishing between those cases in which the death penalty was assessed and those cases in which it was not.  Arave v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993).


In sum, even assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the States statutory aggravating circumstance was facially vague, the court erred in presuming that the State Supreme Court failed to cure this vagueness by applying a narrowing construction on direct appeal.  The state court did apply such a narrowing construction, and that construction satisfied constitutional demands by ensuring that respondent was not sentenced to death in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  See Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 428.  The state courts affirmance of respondents sentence on this ground was therefore not contrary to  clearly established Federal law, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), and the Court of Appeals was without power to issue a writ of habeas corpus.  We reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
The jury found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) respondent had been convicted of one or more felonies involving the use or threat of violence to a person, (2) the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or depravity of mind, (3) respondent committed the murders for the purpose of preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution, and (4) respondent knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during the murder.  See State v. Cone, 665 S.W. 2d 87, 9495 (Tenn. 1984).
The state court rejected the jurys finding that respondent knowingly created a risk of death to two (2) or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during his act of murder, on the ground that the considerable threat respondent posed to others earlier in the day was not sufficiently close in time to the murders.  Based on the strength of the other aggravating circumstances before the jury, the court held this error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 95.
Petitioner argues that the Sixth Circuits conclusion in this regard is in tension with the decisions of other Courts of Appeals, which have held that a petitioner must raise his constitutional claim in state court in order to preserve it, notwithstanding the existence of a mandatory-review statute.  See Mumin v. Pruett, 125 F.3d 192, 197 (CA4 1997) (Virginia); Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d 1301, 1306 (CA9 1996) (Arizona); Kornahrens v. Evatt, 66 F.3d 1350, 1362 (CA4 1995) (South Carolina); Nave v. Delo, 62 F.3d 1024, 1039 (CA8 1995) (Missouri); Julius v. Johnson, 840 F.2d 1533, 1546 (CA11 1988) (Alabama).  We find it unnecessary to express a view on this point.  See 28 U. S.C. 2254(b)(2) (an application for habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding a petitioners failure to exhaust in state court).  We do emphasize that, as a general matter, the burden is on the petitioner to raise his federal claim in the state courts at a time when state procedural law permits its consideration on the merits, even if the state court could have identified and addressed the federal question without its having been raised.  See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 3032 (2004).
The jury was instructed with respect to this aggravated circumstance as follows:


Heinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil.


Atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile.


Cruel means designed to inflict a high degree of pain, utter indifference to, or enjoyment of, the suffering of others, pitiless.  359 F.3d, at 794.
The court recognized that these cases post-dated the Tennessee Supreme Courts 1984 decision on direct appeal, but, relying on Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 225 (1992) (which held that Cartwright did not announce a new rule of constitutional law because its resolution was dictated by Godfrey), concluded that these later cases were not only material, but controlling and required the conclusion that Tennessees heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague on its face.  359 F.3d, at 795.  We assume, without deciding, that the Court of Appeals was correct in this conclusion.
In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002), we held that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury, rather than a judge, to find the aggravating circumstance that renders a defendant death-eligible.  Id., at 609.  Because Ring does not apply retroactively, Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. ___ (2004) (slip op., at 10), this case does not present the question whether an appellate court may, consistently with Ring, cure the finding of a vague aggravating circumstance by applying a narrower construction.
We find additional support for this conclusion in the fact that respondents argument to the State Supreme Court relied squarely on a case in which that court had expressly formulated its narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance and had applied that construction to the benefit of the defendant.  See Brief for Appellant in No. 02C019403CR00052 (Sup. Ct. Tenn. 1983), p. 20 (arguing, based on State v. Pritchett, 621 S.W. 2d 127 (Tenn. 1981), that the State did not show . . . that the victims suffered).  Likewise, the two cases the State relied upon in response to respondents argument also expressly applied a narrowing construction of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator.  See Brief for Appellee in No. 02C019403CR00052 (Sup. Ct. Tenn. 1983), p.34 (citing Pritchett, supra, and State v. Melson, 638 S.W. 2d 342, 367 (Tenn. 1982)).
See also State v. Groseclose, 615 S. W. 2d 142, 151 (Tenn. 1981) (holding that raping and stabbing a victim, before killing her by locking her in a car trunk in the summer, satisfied the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance); Strouth v. State, 999 S. W. 2d 759, 766 (Tenn. 1999) (quoting the State Supreme Courts 1981 opinion denying rehearing, which held that cutting the throat of a victim already rendered unconscious demonstrated depravity of mind in that it was cold-blooded, intentional, conscienceless and pitiless); State v. Dicks, 615 S.W. 2d 126, 132 (Tenn. 1981) (affirming the jurys application of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator to the same crime).

ENFORCEMENT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 03674.Argued October 12, 2004Decided January 12, 2005
Title 8 U. S.C. 1231(b)(2) prescribes the procedure for selecting the country to which an alien ineligible to remain in the United States will be removed.  Petitioner had his refugee status in the United States terminated for a criminal conviction.  When he declined to designate a country to which he preferred to be removed, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed to Somalia, his country of birth, pursuant to 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv).  Petitioner filed a habeas petition to challenge the designation, claiming that Somalia had no functioning government and thus could not consent in advance to his removal, and that the Government was barred from removing him there absent such advance consent.  The District Court agreed, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv) does not require advance acceptance by the destination country.
Held:Section 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv) permits an alien to be removed to a country without the advance consent of that countrys government.  Pp.217.
(a)Section 1231(b)(2) provides four consecutive removal commands: (1) An alien shall be removed to the country of his choice (subparagraphs (A) to (C)), unless a condition eliminating that command is satisfied; (2) otherwise he shall be removed to the country of which he is a citizen (subparagraph (D)), unless a condition eliminating that command is satisfied; (3) otherwise he shall be removed to a country with which he has a lesser connection (subparagraph (E), clauses (i) to (vi), including the country of his birth (clause iv)); or (4) if that is impracticable, inadvisable or impossible, he shall be removed to another country whose government will accept him (subparagraph (E), clause (vii)).  Here, the question is whether the Attorney General was precluded from removing petitioner to Somalia under subparagraph (E), clause (iv), because Somalia had not consented.  Pp.26.


(b)In all of subparagraph (E), an acceptance requirement appears only in clause (vii), the fourth step of the process, which the Attorney General may invoke only after finding the third step impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.  Clauses (i) through (vi) contain not a word about acceptance by the destination country.  Including the word another in clause (vii) does not import the acceptance requirement into clauses (i)(vi).  Such a reading stretches the modifier too far, contrary to the grammatical rule of the last antecedent, Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26.  Subparagraph (E)s structure does not refute the inference derived from the last-antecedent rule.  Pp.69.


(c)Nor is an acceptance requirement manifest in 1231(b)(2)s structure.  First, the overlap between subparagraphs (D) and (E) is not so complete as to justify imposing an acceptance requirement at the third step in the name of preventing the Attorney General from circumventing the second step.  Second, the statute expressly countenances removal to a country notwithstanding its objections.  Subparagraph (C) provides that at the first step of the country-selection process, the Attorney General may refrain from removing an alien to the country of his choice if that country does not accept the alien; the Attorney General thus has discretion to override any lack of acceptance.  Finally, the existence of an acceptance requirement at the fourth step does not imply that such a requirement must exist at the third.  To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congress has not clearly set it forth would run counter to this Courts customary policy of deference to the President in foreign affairs, and would not be necessary to ensure appropriate consideration to conditions in the country of removal, since aliens facing persecution or other mistreatment have a number of available remedies.  Pp.1013.


(d)Contrary to petitioners argument, the acceptance requirement is neither settled judicial construction nor one which [the Court] would be justified in presuming Congress, by its silence, impliedly approved, United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 55, n.13, in its most recent reenactment of 1231(b)(2).  Pp.1316.
329 F.3d 630, affirmed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.J., and OConnor, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

03-878|"CLARK, FIELD OFFICE DIRECTOR, SEATTLE, 
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, 
et al. v. MARTINEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03878.Argued October 13, 2004Decided January 12, 2005
If an alien is found inadmissible and ordered removed, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) ordinarily must remove the alien from the country within 90 days.  8 U. S.C. 1231(a)(1)(A).  Here, Martinez, respondent in No. 03878, and Benitez, petitioner in No. 037434, Cuban nationals who are both inadmissible under 1182, were ordered removed, but were detained beyond the 90-day removal period.  Each filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his continued detention.  In Martinezs case, the District Court found that removal was not reasonably foreseeable and ordered that Martinez be released under appropriate conditions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In Benitezs case, the District Court also accepted that removal would not occur in the foreseeable future, but nonetheless denied the petition.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 
1.Under 1231(a)(6), the Secretary may detain inadmissible aliens beyond the 90-day removal period, but only for so long as is reasonably necessary to achieve removal.  Section 1231(a)(6)s operative language, may be detained beyond the removal period, applies equally to all aliens that are its subject, whether or not those aliens have been admitted to the country.  In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, this Court interpreted 1231(a)(6) to authorize the detention of aliens who have been admitted to the country only as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate their removal.  Id., at 689, 699.  This interpretation must apply to inadmissible aliens as well.  Even if the statutory purpose and constitutional concerns influencing the Zadvydas construction are not present for inadmissible aliens, that cannot justify giving the same statutory text a different meaning depending on the characteristics of the aliens involved.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, and Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, distinguished.  Moreover, contrary to the Governments argument, nothing in Zadvydas indicates that 1231(a)(6) authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.  Nor does 1182(d)(5) independently authorize continued detention of these aliens. Pp. 514.


2. In Zadvydas, the Court further held that the presumptive period during which an aliens detention is reasonably necessary to effectuate removal is six months, and that he must be conditionally released after that time if he can demonstrate that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.  533 U. S., at 701.  The Government having suggested no reason that the time reasonably necessary for removal is longer for an inadmissible alien, this same 6-month presumptive detention period applies in these cases. Because both Martinez and Benitez were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final, the Government has brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists, and the District Court in each case has determined that removal to Cuba is not reasonably foreseeable, the habeas petitions should have been granted.

IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, 
et al. v. MARTINEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 03878.Argued October 13, 2004Decided January 12, 2005
If an alien is found inadmissible and ordered removed, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) ordinarily must remove the alien from the country within 90 days.  8 U. S.C. 1231(a)(1)(A).  Here, Martinez, respondent in No. 03878, and Benitez, petitioner in No. 037434, Cuban nationals who are both inadmissible under 1182, were ordered removed, but were detained beyond the 90-day removal period.  Each filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his continued detention.  In Martinezs case, the District Court found that removal was not reasonably foreseeable and ordered that Martinez be released under appropriate conditions.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In Benitezs case, the District Court also accepted that removal would not occur in the foreseeable future, but nonetheless denied the petition.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 
1.Under 1231(a)(6), the Secretary may detain inadmissible aliens beyond the 90-day removal period, but only for so long as is reasonably necessary to achieve removal.  Section 1231(a)(6)s operative language, may be detained beyond the removal period, applies equally to all aliens that are its subject, whether or not those aliens have been admitted to the country.  In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, this Court interpreted 1231(a)(6) to authorize the detention of aliens who have been admitted to the country only as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate their removal.  Id., at 689, 699.  This interpretation must apply to inadmissible aliens as well.  Even if the statutory purpose and constitutional concerns influencing the Zadvydas construction are not present for inadmissible aliens, that cannot justify giving the same statutory text a different meaning depending on the characteristics of the aliens involved.  Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, and Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, distinguished.  Moreover, contrary to the Governments argument, nothing in Zadvydas indicates that 1231(a)(6) authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.  Nor does 1182(d)(5) independently authorize continued detention of these aliens. Pp. 514.


2. In Zadvydas, the Court further held that the presumptive period during which an aliens detention is reasonably necessary to effectuate removal is six months, and that he must be conditionally released after that time if he can demonstrate that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.  533 U. S., at 701.  The Government having suggested no reason that the time reasonably necessary for removal is longer for an inadmissible alien, this same 6-month presumptive detention period applies in these cases. Because both Martinez and Benitez were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final, the Government has brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists, and the District Court in each case has determined that removal to Cuba is not reasonably foreseeable, the habeas petitions should have been granted.

04-104|"UNITED STATES v. BOOKER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 04104.Argued October 4, 2004Decided January 12, 2005
Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the sentence authorized by the jury verdict in respondent Bookers drug case was 210-to-262 months in prison.  At the sentencing hearing, the judge found additional facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  Because these findings mandated a sentence between 360 months and life, the judge gave Booker a 30-year sentence instead of the 21-year, 10-month, sentence he could have imposed based on the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Seventh Circuit held that this application of the Guidelines conflicted with the Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, holding that [o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Relying on Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. ___, the court held that the sentence violated the Sixth Amendment and instructed the District Court either to sentence Booker within the sentencing range supported by the jurys findings or to hold a separate sentencing hearing before a jury.  In respondent Fanfans case, the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict under the Guidelines was 78 months in prison.  At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge found by a preponderance of the evidence additional facts authorizing a sentence in the 188-to-235-month range, which would have required him to impose a 15- or 16-year sentence instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone.  Relying on Blakelys majority opinion, statements in its dissenting opinions, and the Solicitor Generals brief in Blakely, the judge concluded that he could not follow the Guidelines and imposed a sentence based solely upon the guilty verdict in the case.  The Government filed a notice of appeal in the First Circuit and a petition for certiorari before judgment in this Court.
Held:The judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 04104 is affirmed, and the case is remanded.  The judgment of the District Court in No. 04105 is vacated, and the case is remanded.  
No. 04104, 375 F.3d 508, affirmed and remanded; and No. 04105, vacated and remanded.
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court in part, concluding that the Sixth Amendment as construed in Blakely applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  Pp.520.


(a)In addressing Washington States determinate sentencing scheme, the Blakely Court found that Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227; Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466; and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, made clear that the statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. 542 U. S., at ___.  As Blakelys dissenting opinions recognized, there is no constitutionally significant distinction between the Guidelines and the Washington procedure at issue in that case.  This conclusion rests on the premise, common to both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.  Were the Guidelines merely advisoryrecommending, but not requiring, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of factstheir use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.  However, that is not the case.  Title 18 U. S.C.A. 3553(b) directs that a court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range established by the Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited cases.  Because they are binding on all on judges, this Court has consistently held that the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws.  Further, the availability of a departure where the judge finds  an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described, 3553(b)(1), does not avoid the constitutional issue.  Departures are unavailable in most cases because the Commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible.  In those instances, the judge is legally bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range.  Bookers case illustrates this point.  The jury found him guilty of possessing at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, based on evidence that he had 92.5 grams.  Under those facts, the Guidelines required a possible 210-to-262-month sentence.  To reach Bookers actual sentencewhich was almost 10 years longerthe judge found that he possessed an additional 566 grams of crack.  Although, the jury never heard any such evidence, the judge found it to be true by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus, as in Blakely, the jurys verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.  The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.  542 U. S., at ___.  Finally, because there were no factors the Sentencing Commission failed to adequately consider, the judge was required to impose a sentence within the higher Guidelines range.  Pp.512.


(b)The Governments arguments for its position that Blakelys reasoning should not be applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are unpersuasive.  The fact that the Guidelines are promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, rather than Congress, is constitutionally irrelevant.  The Court has not previously considered the question, but the same Sixth Amendment principles apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Further, the Courts pre-Apprendi cases considering the Guidelines are inapplicable, as they did not consider the application of Apprendi to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Finally, separation of powers concerns are not present here, and were rejected in Mistretta.  In Mistretta the Court concluded that even though the Commission performed political rather than adjudicatory functions, Congress did not exceed constitutional limitations in creating the Commission.  488 U. S., at 393, 388.  That conclusion remains true regardless of whether the facts relevant to sentencing are labeled sentencing factors or elements of crimes.  Pp.1320.


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court in part, concluding that 18 U. S.C.A. 3553(b)(1), which makes the Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, is incompatible with todays Sixth Amendment jury trial holding and therefore must be severed and excised from the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act).  Section 3742(e), which depends upon the Guidelines mandatory nature, also must be severed and excised.  So modified, the Act makes the Guidelines effectively advisory, requiring a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 3553(a)(4), but permitting it to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns, see 3553(a).  Pp.226.


(a)Answering the remedial question requires a determination of what Congress would have intended in light of the Courts constitutional holding.  E.g., Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 767.  Here, the Court must decide which of two approaches is the more compatible with Congress intent as embodied in the Act: (1) retaining the Act (and the Guidelines) as written, with todays Sixth Amendment requirement engrafted onto it; or (2) eliminating some of the Acts provisions.  Evaluation of the constitutional requirements consequences in light of the Acts language, history, and basic purposes demonstrates that the requirement is not compatible with the Act as written and that some severance (and excision) is necessary.  Congress would likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the constitutional requirement engrafted onto it, but would likely have preferred the excision of the Acts mandatory language to the invalidation of the entire Act.  Pp.26. 


(b)Several considerations demonstrate that adding the Courts constitutional requirement onto the Act as currently written would so transform the statutory scheme that Congress likely would not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.  First, references to [t]he court in 3553(a)(1)which  requires [t]he court when sentencing to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendantand references to the judge in the Acts history must be read in context to mean the judge without the jury, not the judge working together with the jury.  That is made clear by 3661, which removes typical jury trial limitations on the information concerning the offender that the sentencing court  may receive.  Second, Congress basic statutory goal of diminishing sentencing disparity depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the real conduct underlying the crime of conviction.  In looking to real conduct, federal sentencing judges have long relied upon a probation officers presentence report, which is often unavailable until after the trial.  To engraft the Courts constitutional requirement onto the Act would destroy the system by preventing a sentencing judge from relying upon a presentence report for relevant factual information uncovered after the trial.  Third, the Act, read to include todays constitutional requirement, would create a system far more complex than Congress could have intended, thereby greatly complicating the tasks of the prosecution, defense, judge, and jury.  Fourth, plea bargaining would not significantly diminish the consequences of the Courts constitutional holding for the operation of the Guidelines, but would make matters worse, leading to sentences that gave greater weight not to real conduct, but rather to counsels skill, the prosecutors policies, the caseload, and other factors that vary from place to place, defendant to defendant, and crime to crime.  Fifth, Congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult to adjust sentences upward than to adjust them downward, yet that is what the engrafted system would create.  For all these reasons, the Act cannot remain valid in its entirety.  Severance and excision are necessary.  Pp.615.


(c)The entire Act need not be invalidated, since most of it is perfectly valid.  In order not to invalidat[e] more of the statute than is necessary, Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 652, the Court must retain those portions of the Act that are (1) constitutionally valid, ibid., (2) capable of functioning independently, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684, and (3) consistent with Congress basic objectives in enacting the statute, Regan, supra, at 653.  Application of these criteria demonstrates that only 3553(b)(1), which requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range (absent circumstances justifying a departure), and 3742(e), which provides for de novo review on appeal of departures, must be severed and excised.  With these two sections severed (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the rest of the Act satisfies the Courts constitutional requirement and falls outside the scope of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466.  The Act still requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals, see 3553(a)(4); to consider the Guidelines sentencing range established for  the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant, pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and to restitute victims, 3553(a)(1), (3)(7); and to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed training and medical care, 3553(a)(2).  Moreover, despite 3553(b)(1)s absence, the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range).  See 3742(a) and (b).  Excision of 3742(e), which sets forth appellate review standards, does not pose a critical problem.  Appropriate review standards may be inferred from related statutory language, the statutes structure, and the sound administration of justice.  Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 559560.  Here, these factors and the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures from the Guidelines imply a familiar and practical standard of review: review for unreasonable[ness].  See, e.g., 18 U. S.C. 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).  Finally, the Act without its mandatory provision and related language remains consistent with Congress intent to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities  [and] maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted, 28 U. S.C. 991(b)(1)(B), in that the Sentencing Commission remains in place to perform its statutory duties, see 994, the district courts must consult the Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing, see 18 U. S.C. 3553(a)(4), and the courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.  Thus, it is more consistent with Congress likely intent (1) to preserve the Acts important pre-existing elements while severing and excising 3553(b) and 3742(e) than (2) to maintain all of the Acts provisions and engraft todays constitutional requirement onto the statutory scheme.  Pp. 1522. 


(d) Other possible remediesincluding, e.g., the parties proposals that the Guidelines remain binding in cases other than those in which the Constitution prohibits judicial factfinding and that the Acts provisions requiring such factfinding at sentencing be excisedare rejected.  Pp.2224.


(e)On remand in respondent Bookers case, the District Court should impose a sentence in accordance with todays opinions, and, if the sentence comes before the Seventh Circuit for review, that court should apply the review standards set forth in this Courts remedial opinion.  In respondent Fanfans case, the Government (and Fanfan should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in todays opinions.  As these dispositions indicate, todays Sixth Amendment holding and the Courts remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act must be applied to all cases on direct review.  See, e.g., Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328.  That does not mean that every sentence will give rise to a Sixth Amendment violation or that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.  That is 
because reviewing courts are expected to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, e.g., whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the plain-error test.  It is also because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a 
sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.  Pp. 2425.

Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the sentence authorized by the jury verdict in respondent Bookers drug case was 210-to-262 months in prison.  At the sentencing hearing, the judge found additional facts by a preponderance of the evidence.  Because these findings mandated a sentence between 360 months and life, the judge gave Booker a 30-year sentence instead of the 21-year, 10-month, sentence he could have imposed based on the facts proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Seventh Circuit held that this application of the Guidelines conflicted with the Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.

In respondent Fanfans case, the maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict under the Guidelines was 78 months in prison.  At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge found by a preponderance of the evidence additional facts authorizing a sentence in the 188-to-235-month range, which would have required him to impose a 15- or 16-year sentence instead of the 5 or 6 years authorized by the jury verdict alone.  Relying on Blakelys majority opinion, statements in its dissenting opinions, and the Solicitor Generals brief in Blakely, the judge concluded that he could not follow the Guidelines and imposed a sentence based solely upon the guilty verdict in the case.  The Government filed a notice of appeal in the First Circuit and a petition for certiorari before judgment in this Court.

With these two sections severed (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the rest of the Act satisfies the Courts constitutional requirement and falls outside the scope of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466.  The Act still requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals, see 3553(a)(4); to consider the Guidelines sentencing range established for  the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant, pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and to restitute victims, 3553(a)(1), (3)(7); and to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed training and medical care, 3553(a)(2).  Moreover, despite 3553(b)(1)s absence, the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range).  See 3742(a) and (b).  Excision of 3742(e), which sets forth appellate review standards, does not pose a critical problem.  Appropriate review standards may be inferred from related statutory language, the statutes structure, and the sound administration of justice.  Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 559560.  Here, these factors and the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures from the Guidelines imply a familiar and practical standard of review: review for unreasonable[ness].  See, e.g., 18 U. S.C. 3742(e)(3) (1994 ed.).  Finally, the Act without its mandatory provision and related language remains consistent with Congress intent to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities  [and] maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted, 28 U. S.C. 991(b)(1)(B), in that the Sentencing Commission remains in place to perform its statutory duties, see 994, the district courts must consult the Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing, see 18 U. S.C. 3553(a)(4), and the courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.  Thus, it is more consistent with Congress likely intent (1) to preserve the Acts important pre-existing elements while severing and excising 3553(b) and 3742(e) than (2) to maintain all of the Acts provisions and engraft todays constitutional requirement onto the statutory scheme.  Pp. 1522. 


(d) Other possible remediesincluding, e.g., the parties proposals that the Guidelines remain binding in cases other than those in which the Constitution prohibits judicial factfinding and that the Acts provisions requiring such factfinding at sentencing be excisedare rejected.  Pp.2224.


(e)On remand in respondent Bookers case, the District Court should impose a sentence in accordance with todays opinions, and, if the sentence comes before the Seventh Circuit for review, that court should apply the review standards set forth in this Courts remedial opinion.  In respondent Fanfans case, the Government (and Fanfan should he so choose) may seek resentencing under the system set forth in todays opinions.  As these dispositions indicate, todays Sixth Amendment holding and the Courts remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act must be applied to all cases on direct review.  See, e.g., Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328.  That does not mean that every sentence will give rise to a Sixth Amendment violation or that every appeal will lead to a new sentencing hearing.  That is 
because reviewing courts are expected to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, e.g., whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the plain-error test.  It is also because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amendment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a 
sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.  Pp. 2425.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 031293.Argued November 30, 2004Decided January 11, 2005
Petitioners were convicted of conspiracy to launder money in violation of 18 U. S.C. 1956(h) after the District Court denied their request to instruct the jury that the Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the co-conspirators had committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding, in relevant part, that the jury instructions were proper because 1956(h) does not require proof of an overt act.
Held:Conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 1956(h), does not require proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Pp. 310.
(a)Section 1956(h) provides: Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in [1956] or section 1957 shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.  In United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, this Court held that the nearly identical language of the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U. S.C. 846, does not require proof of an over act.  The Shabani Court found instructive the distinction between 846 and the general conspiracy statute, 18 U. S.C. 371, which supersedes the common law rule by expressly including an overt-act requirement.  Shabani distilled the governing rule for conspiracy statutes: Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, and Singer v. United States, 323 U. S. 338, give Congress a formulary:by choosing a text modeled on 371, it gets an overt-act requirement; by choosing a text modeled on the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.C. 1 [which, like 21 U. S.C. 846, omits any express overt-act requirement], it dispenses with such a requirement.  513 U. S., at 14.  This rule dictates the outcome here as well:  Because 1956(h)s text does not expressly make the commission of an overt act an element of the conspiracy offense, the Government need not prove an overt act to obtain a conviction.  Pp. 35.


(b)Petitioners argument that Shabani is inapplicable because 1956(h) does not establish a new conspiracy offense, but merely increases the penalty for conviction of a money laundering conspiracy under 371, is untenable for two reasons: Section 1956(h)s text is sufficient to establish an offense and fails to provide any cross-reference to 371.  Had Congress intended to create the scheme petitioners envision, it would have done so in clearer terms.  Because 1956(h)s text is plain and unambiguous, the Court need not consider petitioners argument that the provisions legislative history supports their construction by virtue of its failure to indicate that Congress meant to create a new offense or to eliminate 371s overt-act requirement for money laundering conspiracies.  In any event, mere silence in the legislative history cannot justify reading an overt-act requirement into 1956(h).  See, e.g., United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496497.  Petitioners legislative history argument is particularly inapt here because Congress is presumed to have had knowledge of Nash and Singer when it enacted 1956(h).  Petitioners arguments as to 1956s text and structure as a whole(1) that had Congress intended 1956(h) to create a new conspiracy offense, it would have placed that offense with the three substantive money laundering offenses set forth in 1956(a); and (2) that by providing that [a] prosecution for [a money laundering] conspiracy offense  may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed offense under [1956(i)(1)], or in any other district where an act in furtherance of the  conspiracy took place, 1956(i)(2), Congress confirmed that proof of an overt act was required under 1956(h)are not persuasive.  Pp. 59.
349 F.3d 1320, affirmed. 
OConnor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.
Together with No. 031294, Hall v. United States, also on certiorari to the same court.
