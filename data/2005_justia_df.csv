1+04-1140+"041140.Argued November 8, 2005Decided December 7, 2005
In removing petitioner Martins state-court class action to federal court on diversity grounds, respondents (collectively, Franklin) acknowledged that the amount in controversy was not clear from the face of the state-court complaint, but argued that this requirement for federal diversity jurisdiction was nonetheless satisfied under precedent suggesting that punitive damages and attorneys fees could be aggregated in making the calculation."+67.0+0.164179104478+0.420833333333+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
2+04-1140+The District Court denied the Martins motion to remand to state court and eventually dismissed the case with prejudice.+19.0+0.157894736842+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3+04-1140+Reversing and remanding with instructions to remand to state court, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Martins that their suit failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement and rejected Franklins aggregation theory under decisions issued after the District Courts remand decision.+40.0+0.225+0.3+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4+04-1140+The latter court then denied the Martins motion for attorneys fees because Franklin had legitimate grounds for believing this case fell within federal-court jurisdiction.+24.0+0.208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
5+04-1140+Affirming, the Tenth Circuit disagreed with the Martins argument that attorneys fees should be granted on remand as a matter of course under 28 U. S.C. 1447(c), which provides that a remand order may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, but provides little guidance on when fees are warranted.+55.0+0.145454545455+0.3+-0.09375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
6+04-1140+The court noted that fee awards are left to the district courts discretion, subject to review only for abuse of discretion; pointed out that, under Circuit precedent, the key factor in deciding whether to award fees is the propriety of removal; and held that, because Franklin had relied on case law only subsequently held to be unsound, its basis for removal was objectively reasonable, and the fee denial was not an abuse of discretion.+74.0+0.108108108108+0.569047619048+0.0047619047619+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
7+04-1140+Held:Absent unusual circumstances, attorneys fees should not be awarded under 1447(c) when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.+22.0+0.181818181818+0.8+0.2+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
8+04-1140+Conversely, where no objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be awarded.+11.0+0.181818181818+0.6+-0.1+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
9+04-1140+This Court rejects the Martins argument for adopting a strong presumption in favor of awarding fees.+16.0+0.25+0.733333333333+0.433333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
10+04-1140+The reasons for adopting such a presumption in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (per curiam), are absent here.+24.0+0.166666666667+0.5+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
11+04-1140+Also rejected is Franklins argument that 1447(c) simply grants courts jurisdiction to award costs and attorneys fees when otherwise warranted.+20.0+0.2+0.357142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
12+04-1140+Were the statute strictly jurisdictional, there would be no need to limit awards to just costs; any award authorized by other provisions of law would presumably be just.+28.0+0.0714285714286+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
13+04-1140+The Court therefore gives the statute its natural reading: Section 1447(c) authorizes courts to award costs and fees, but only when such an award is just.+26.0+0.115384615385+0.633333333333+0.0333333333333+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
14+04-1140+That standard need not be defined narrowly, as the Solicitor General argues, by awarding fees only on a showing that the unsuccessful partys position was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.+30.0+0.133333333333+0.475+-0.0375+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+1.0

16+04-1140+The fact that a 1447(c) fee award is discretionary does not mean that there is no governing legal standard.+19.0+0.105263157895+0.295833333333+0.11875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0
17+04-1140+When applying fee-shifting statutes, the Court has found limits in the large objectives of the relevant Act.+17.0+0.117647058824+0.664285714286+0.307142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

19+04-1140+The appropriate test for awarding fees under 1447(c) should recognize Congress desire to deter removals intended to prolong litigation and impose costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied.+49.0+0.204081632653+0.532142857143+0.267142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
20+04-1140+In light of these large objectives, the standard for awarding fees should turn on the reasonableness of the removal.+19.0+0.105263157895+0.37619047619+0.204761904762+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0

82+04-631+(b)The Court rejects the Nations argument that it is entitled to prevail under Chickasaws categorical bar because the fairest reading of the Kansas statute is that the taxs legal incidence actually falls on the Tribe on the reservation.+38.0+0.157894736842+0.15+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

92+04-631+(c)Also rejected is the Nations alternative argument that the Bracker test must be applied irrespective of who bears the Kansas taxs legal incidence because the tax arises as a result of the on-reservation sale and delivery of fuel.+38.0+0.131578947368+0.2+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
93+04-631+The Nation presented a starkly different, and correct, interpretation of the statute in the Tenth Circuit, arguing that the balancing test is appropriate even though the taxs legal incidence is imposed on the Nations non-Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributors receipt of fuel outside the reservation.+48.0+0.104166666667+0.3375+0.175+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
94+04-631+The Nations argument here is rebutted by provisions of the Kansas statute demonstrating that the only taxable event occurs when the distributor first receives the fuel and by a final determination by the State reaching the same conclusion.+38.0+0.0789473684211+0.614583333333+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
95+04-631+The Nations theory that the existence of statutory deductions for certain postreceipt transactions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its ultimate tax liability without knowing whether, where, and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered suffers from several conceptual defects.+44.0+0.0909090909091+0.711904761905+-0.175396825397+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

106+04-631+(a)Limiting the Bracker test exclusively to on-reservation transactions between a nontribal entity and a tribe or tribal member is consistent with this Courts unique Indian tax immunity jurisprudence, which relies heavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty [giving] state law no role to play within a tribes territorial boundaries, Oklahoma Tax Commn v.

215+05-101+"The Ohio Supreme Courts interpretation of that section, as announced in its review of respondents case, directly contradicts the Sixth Circuits analysis:

224+05-101+The Sixth Circuit held that the Ohio Supreme Courts opinion should not be read to endorse transferred intent in respondents case because such a construction would likely constitute an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language, Bouie v.

340+03-1238+That argument, which in effect asks for a third category of activitiesthose that are integral and indispensable to a principal activity and thus not excluded from coverage by 4(a)(2), but are not themselves principal activities as defined by 4(a)(1)is foreclosed by Steiner, which made clear that 4 does not remove activities that are integral and indispensable to principal activities from FLSA coverage precisely because such activities are themselves principal activities.+70.0+0.1+0.580555555556+0.216666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

350+03-1238+And 790.7(g), n. 49, which provides that postdonning walking time is not necessarily excluded from 4(a)(1)s scope, does not mean that such time is always excluded and is insufficient to overcome clear statements in the regulations text that support the holding here.+42.0+0.0952380952381+0.642708333333+0.0640625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

358+03-1238+No limiting principle allows this Court to conclude that the waiting time here is such an activity without also leading to the logical (but untenable) conclusion that the walking time in Anderson would also be a principal activity unaffected by the Portal-to-Portal Act.+43.0+0.0697674418605+0.283333333333+0.0666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Claiming that federal mine inspectors negligence helped cause a mine accident, two injured workers (and a spouse) sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act), which authorizes private tort actions against the Government under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, 28 U.

375+04-759+The District Court dismissed in part on the ground that the allegations did not show that Arizona law would impose liability upon a private person in similar circumstances.+28.0+0.178571428571+0.3875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
376+04-759+The Ninth Circuit reversed, reasoning from two premises: (1) Where unique governmental functions are at issue, the Act waives sovereign immunity if a state or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred, and (2) federal mine inspections are such unique governmental functions since there is no private-sector analogue for mine inspections.+57.0+0.105263157895+0.8+-0.02+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

508+04-9949+Although we observed in a footnote that [t]he policy of the Rules was not to extend power indefinitely but to confine it within constant time periods, id., at 473474, n.2, that observation hardly transforms the Rules into the keys to the kingdom of subject-matter jurisdiction.+45.0+0.0666666666667+0.4375+-0.145833333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
509+04-9949+Rather, as we emphasized in the text, the District Judge could not use Rule 33 to sidestep a pre-existing basic principle of judicial processthat once a final judgment is issued and the court of appeals considers a case, a district court has no power to act on it further.+49.0+0.122448979592+0.541666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

521+04-9949+Robinson is correct not because the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, but because district courts must observe the clear limits of the Rules of Criminal Procedure when they are properly invoked.+31.0+0.193548387097+0.344444444444+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

523+04-9949+Despite its narrow and unremarkable holding, Robinson has created some confusion because of its observation that courts have uniformly held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.+34.0+0.0294117647059+0.4+-0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

534+04-9949+The resulting imprecision has obscured the central point of the Robinson casethat when the Government objected to a filing untimely under Rule 37, the courts duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.+32.0+0.09375+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
535+04-9949+The net effect of Robinson, viewed through the clarifying lens of Kontrick, is to admonish the Government that failure to object to untimely submissions entails forfeiture of the objection, and to admonish defendants that timeliness is of the essence, since the Government is unlikely to miss timeliness defects very often.+50.0+0.1+0.275+-0.154166666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

537+04-9949+For instance, in Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.

538+04-9949+As we pointedly noted in Kontrick, our holding in Carlisle did not characterize [Rule 29] as jurisdictional.+17.0+0.176470588235+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

542+04-9949+After Kontrick, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that Rule 33 motions are similarly nonjurisdictional.+16.0+0.0625+0.7+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
543+04-9949+By its terms, Rule 45(b)(2) has precisely the same effect on extensions of time under Rule 29 as it does under Rule 33, and as we noted in Kontrick, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) and Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) are both modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b).+49.0+0.122448979592+0.491666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

545+04-9949+Rule 33, like Rule 29 and Bankruptcy Rule 4004, is a claim-processing ruleone that is admittedly inflexible because of Rule 45(b)s insistent demand for a definite end to proceedings.+29.0+0.103448275862+0.55+-0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
546+04-9949+These claim-processing rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them, but do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.1125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
547+04-9949+Here, where the Government failed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the District Court had reached the merits, it forfeited that defense.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.3+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
548+04-9949+The Court of Appeals should therefore have proceeded to the merits.+11.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
549+04-9949+We finally add a word about the approach taken by the Court of Appeals.+14.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
550+04-9949+Although we find its disposition to have been in error, we fully appreciate that it is an error shared among the circuits, and that it was caused in large part by imprecision in our prior cases.+36.0+0.0277777777778+0.214285714286+0.107142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
551+04-9949+Our repetition of the phrase mandatory and jurisdictional has understandably led the lower courts to err on the side of caution by giving the limitations in Rules 33 and 45 the force of subject-matter jurisdiction.+35.0+0.0285714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
552+04-9949+Convinced, therefore, that Robinson and Smith governed this case, the Seventh Circuit felt bound to apply them, even though it expressed grave doubts in light of Kontrick.+27.0+0.222222222222+0.7+0.4+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

633+04-8384+It is too obvious to merit extended discussion that whether the exhaustion requirement  has been satisfied cannot turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely raised in petitioners brief in the state court.+43.0+0.0697674418605+0.611111111111+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

642+04-8384+It further cites the following federal cases, all of which concern alleged violations of federal due process rights in the context of prosecutorial misconduct: Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637 (1974); Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78 (1935); United States v. Valentine, 820 F.2d 565 (CA2 1987); United States v.

643+04-8384+This is not an instance where the habeas petitioner failed to apprise the state court of his claim that the  ruling of which he complained was not only a violation of state law, but denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.46875+-0.23125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

645+04-8384+Nor is this a case where a state court needed to look beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) to be aware of the federal claim.+29.0+0.0689655172414+0.327777777778+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

647+04-8384+The state-court brief was clear that the prosecutorial misconduct claim was based, at least in part, on a federal right.+20.0+0.1+0.413095238095+0.0214285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

649+04-8384+A second reason the Dye II panel denied relief was that the habeas petition filed in the United States District Court presented the prosecutorial misconduct claim in too vague and general a form.+33.0+0.121212121212+0.333333333333+-0.15+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

667+03-1500+Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U.

668+03-1500+Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a reasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State endorsed religion.+60.0+0.116666666667+0.425+-0.025+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

702+03-1500+Despite the Commandments religious message, an inquiry into the context in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also convey a secular moral message about proper standards of social conduct and a message about the historic relation between those standards and the law.+48.0+0.166666666667+0.133333333333+0.00666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0

After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in their courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) etal., sued under 42 U.

724+03-1693+The Counties then adopted nearly identical resolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentuckys precedent legal code.+24.0+0.208333333333+0.358333333333+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

727+03-1693+Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court followed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.

769+03-1693+(a)Stone is the Courts initial benchmark as its only case dealing with the constitutionality of displaying the Commandments.+18.0+0.222222222222+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
770+03-1693+It recognized that the Commandments are an instrument of religion and that, at least on the facts before the Court, their texts display could presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secular education explained their being there.+58.0+0.0689655172414+0.4+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

772+03-1693+But Stone did not purport to decide the constitutionality of every possible way the government might set out the Commandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, County of Allegheny v.

773+03-1693+Hence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression leading up to the Commandments third display, beginning with the first.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.166666666667+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

775+03-1693+(b)There are two obvious similarities between the display Stone rejected and the first one here: both set out the Commandments text as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation like blank tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an arguably secular display.+43.0+0.139534883721+0.376666666667+0.11+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
776+03-1693+Stone stressed the significance of integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall the broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point of reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and Christians.+49.0+0.224489795918+0.32+0.14+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
777+03-1693+They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods), regulate details of religious obligation (no graven images, sabbath breaking, or vain oath swearing), and unmistakably rest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, theft, etc.)+38.0+0.105263157895+0.208333333333+0.0208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

779+03-1693+Displaying that text is thus different from symbolic representation, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which could be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a sectarian conception of faith.+33.0+0.121212121212+0.55+0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

784+03-1693+(c)The Counties second display, unlike the first, did not hang the Commandments in isolation, but included the statement of the governments purpose expressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the Commandments to other documents whose references to God were highlighted as their sole common element.+50.0+0.12+0.291666666667+-0.035+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

824+04-277+There are two principal kinds of broadband service: cable modem service, which transmits data between the Internet and users computers via the network of television cable lines owned by cable companies, and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service, which uses high-speed wires owned by local telephone companies.+46.0+0.239130434783+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

826+04-277+The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, defines two categories of entities relevant here.+20.0+0.15+0.9+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
827+04-277+Information service providersthose offering  a capability for [processing] information via telecommunications, 47 U.

828+04-277+Conversely, telecommunications carriersi.e., those offering  telecommunications for a fee directly to the public  regardless of the facilities used, 153(46)are not subject to mandatory Title II regulation.+26.0+0.192307692308+0.266666666667+0.0611111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
829+04-277+These two classifications originated in the late 1970s, as the Commission developed rules to regulate data-processing services offered over telephone wires.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.45+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

831+04-277+Those rules defined such service as a pure or transparent transmission capability over a communications path enabling the consumer to transmit an ordinary-language message to another point without computer processing or storage of the information, such as via a telephone or a facsimile.+43.0+0.116279069767+0.5+0.0714285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
832+04-277+Under the 1996 Act, [i]nformation service is the analog to enhanced service, defined by the Computer II rules as computer-processing applications that act on the subscribers information, such as voice and data storage services, as well as protocol conversion, i.e., the ability to communicate between networks that employ different data-transmission formats.+51.0+0.117647058824+0.55+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
833+04-277+In the Declaratory Ruling under review, the Commission classified broadband cable modem service as an information service but not a telecommunications service under the 1996 Act, so that it is not subject to mandatory Title II common-carrier regulation.+38.0+0.157894736842+0.333333333333+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
834+04-277+The Commission relied heavily on its Universal Service Report, which earlier classified non-facilities-based ISPsthose that do not own the transmission facilities they use to connect the end user to the Internetsolely as information-service providers.+34.0+0.205882352941+0.5+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
835+04-277+Because Internet access is a capability for manipulating and storing information, the Commission concluded, it was an information service.+19.0+0.105263157895+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
836+04-277+However, the integrated nature of such access and the high-speed wire used to provide it led the Commission to conclude that cable companies providing it are not telecommunications service providers.+30.0+0.1+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
837+04-277+Adopting the Universal Service Reports reasoning, the Commission held that cable companies offering broadband Internet access, like non-facilities-based ISPs, do not offer the end user telecommunications service, but merely use telecommunications to provide end users with cable modem service.+39.0+0.230769230769+0.25+-0.25+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

841+04-277+In particular, the court held that the Commission could not permissibly construe the Communications Act to exempt cable companies providing cable modem service from mandatory Title II regulation.+28.0+0.142857142857+0.333333333333+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
842+04-277+Rather than analyzing the permissibility of that construction under the deferential framework of Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.

856+04-277+Because Portland held only that the best reading of 153(46) was that cable modem service was telecommunications service, not that this was the only permissible reading or that the Communications Act unambiguously required it, the Ninth Circuit erred in refusing to apply Chevron.+43.0+0.139534883721+0.766666666667+0.333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

861+04-277+Seen from the consumers point of view, the Commission concluded, the cable wire is used to access the World Wide Web, newsgroups, etc., rather than transparently to transmit and receive ordinary-language messages without computer processing or storage of the message.+40.0+0.125+0.4+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

870+04-277+It is common usage to describe what a company offers to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated finished product, even to the exclusion of discrete components that compose the product.+35.0+0.0857142857143+0.25+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

874+04-277+(2)The Commissions traditional distinction between basic and enhanced service also supports the conclusion that the Communications Act is ambiguous about whether cable companies offer telecommunications with cable modem service.+29.0+0.172413793103+0.4375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
875+04-277+Congress passed the Acts definitions against the background of this regulatory history, and it may be assumed that the parallel terms telecommunications service and information service substantially incorporated the meaning of basic and enhanced service.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
876+04-277+That history in at least two respects confirms that the term telecommunications service is ambiguous.+15.0+0.0666666666667+0.4+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
877+04-277+First, in the Computer II order establishing the terms basic and enhanced services, the Commission defined those terms functionally, based on how the consumer interacts with the provided information, just as the Commission did in the order under review.+39.0+0.0512820512821+0.229166666667+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
878+04-277+Cable modem service is not transparent in terms of its interaction with customer-supplied information; the transmission occurs only in connection with information processing.+23.0+0.130434782609+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
879+04-277+It was therefore consistent with the statutes terms for the Commission to assume that the parallel term telecommunications service in 153(46) likewise describes a pure or transparent communications path not necessarily separately present in an integrated information-processing service from the end-users perspective.+42.0+0.0952380952381+0.35+0.0928571428571+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
880+04-277+Second, the Commissions application of the basic/enhanced service distinction to non-facilities-based ISPs also supports the Courts conclusion.+17.0+0.235294117647+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
881+04-277+The Commission has historically not subjected non-facilities-based information-service providers to common carrier regulation.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.25+-0.15+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
882+04-277+That history suggests, in turn, that the Act does not unambiguously classify nonfacilities based ISPs as offerors of telecommunications.+19.0+0.157894736842+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
883+04-277+If the Act does not unambiguously classify such providers as offering telecommunications, it also does not unambiguously so classify facilities-based information-service providers such as cable companies; the relevant definitions do not distinguish the two types of carriers.+37.0+0.135135135135+0.633333333333+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
884+04-277+The Acts silence suggests, instead, that the Commission has the discretion to fill the statutory gap.+16.0+0.1875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

887+04-277+Respondents argue unpersuasively that the Commissions construction is unreasonable because it allows any communications provider to evade common-carrier regulation simply by bundling information service with telecommunications.+26.0+0.192307692308+0.357142857143+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0

889+04-277+The Commission classified cable modem service solely as an information service because the telecommunications input used to provide cable modem service is not separable from the services data-processing capabilities, but is part and parcel of that service and integral to its other capabilities, and therefore is not a telecommunications offering.+50.0+0.1+0.375+-0.125+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

891+04-277+It is plain, for example, that a local telephone company cannot escape regulation by packaging its telephone service with voice mail because such packaging offers a transparent transmission pathtelephone servicethat transmits information independent of the information-storage capabilities voice mail provides.+40.0+0.1+0.196428571429+-0.0228571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
892+04-277+By contrast, the high-speed transmission used to provide cable modem service is a functionally integrated component of Internet service because it transmits data only in connection with the further processing of information and is necessary to provide such service.+39.0+0.0769230769231+0.75+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

895+04-277+Their characterization of the information-service offering of Internet access as consisting only of access to a cable companys e-mail service, its Web page, and the ability it provides to create a personal Web page conflicts with the Commissions reasonable understanding of the nature of Internet service.+46.0+0.195652173913+0.633333333333+0.0666666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Respondent filed this suit under 42 U.

925+04-278+The District Court granted the towns motion to dismiss, but an en banc majority of the Tenth Circuit reversed, finding that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedural due process claim because a Colorado statute established the state legislatures clear intent to require police to enforce retraining orders, and thus its intent that the orders recipient have an entitlement to its enforcement.+61.0+0.16393442623+0.286111111111+-0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

945+04-278+Against that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indication than the Colorado statutes direction to use every reasonable means to enforce a restraining order or even to arrest  or  seek a warrant.+37.0+0.162162162162+0.3375+0.15+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
946+04-278+A Colorado officer would likely have some discretion to determine thatdespite probable cause to believe a restraining order has been violatedthe violations circumstances or competing duties counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance.+34.0+0.117647058824+0.666666666667+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
947+04-278+The practical necessity for discretion is particularly apparent in a case such as this, where the suspected violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown.+27.0+0.037037037037+0.3625+-0.0125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

949+04-278+That, however, would be an entitlement to nothing but procedure, which cannot be the basis for a property interest.+19.0+0.0526315789474+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

952+04-278+Her alleged interest stems not from common law or contract, but only from a States statutory scheme.+17.0+0.117647058824+0.533333333333+-0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

954+04-278+Although the statute spoke of protected person[s] such as respondent, it did so in connection with matters other than a right to enforcement.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.470238095238+0.0535714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
955+04-278+Most importantly, it spoke directly to the protected persons power to initiate contempt proceedings if the order was issued in a civil action, which contrasts tellingly with its conferral of a power merely to request initiation of criminal contempt proceedingsand even more dramatically with its complete silence about any power to request (much less demand) that an arrest be made.+60.0+0.1+0.401666666667+0.0583333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

958+04-278+Such a right would have no ascertainable monetary value and would arise incidentally, not out of some new species of government benefit or service, but out of a function that government actors have always performedarresting people when they have probable cause.+41.0+0.0975609756098+0.496753246753+0.140692640693+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

960+04-278+Here, as there, [t]he simple distinction between government action that directly affects a citizens legal rights  and action that is directed against a third party and affects the citizen only  incidentally, provides a sufficient answer to cases finding government-provided services to be entitlements.+43.0+0.093023255814+0.308163265306+0.0714285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

987+04-480+The Ninth Circuit affirmed.+4.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
988+04-480+It read Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.

989+04-480+Because the appeals court found respondents software to be capable of substantial noninfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the softwares decentralized architecture, the court held that they were not liable.+37.0+0.0810810810811+0.333333333333+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
990+04-480+It also held that they did not materially contribute to their users infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by respondents beyond providing the software in the first place.+38.0+0.0263157894737+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
991+04-480+Finally, the court held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicarious infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the softwares use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to supervise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement.+45.0+0.0888888888889+0.512142857143+0.0371428571429+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
992+04-480+Held:One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third-party action, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the devices lawful uses.+57.0+0.122807017544+0.344791666667+0.009375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

995+04-480+Despite offsetting considerations, the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents software.+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.5+0.15+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
996+04-480+When a widely shared product is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers, so that the only practical alternative is to go against the devices distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.+50.0+0.1+0.65+-0.0611111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

998+04-480+Although [t]he Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [anothers] infringement, Sony, 464 U.

1009+04-480+Because the VCR was capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses, the Court held that Sony was not liable.+18.0+0.111111111111+0.591666666667+0.208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1014+04-480+In this case, the Ninth Circuit misread Sony to mean that when a product is capable of substantial lawful use, the producer cannot be held contributorily liable for third parties infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distributors had specific knowledge of infringement at a time when they contributed to the infringement and failed to act upon that information.+69.0+0.0724637681159+0.2640625+-0.0890625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1028+04-480+The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.166666666667+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1031+04-480+First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.166666666667+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1033+04-480+Second, neither respondent attempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software.+19.0+0.0+0.1875+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1034+04-480+While the Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrelevant because respondents lacked an independent duty to monitor their users activity, this evidence underscores their intentional facilitation of their users infringement.+30.0+0.166666666667+0.475+-0.272222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1035+04-480+Third, respondents make money by selling advertising space, then by directing ads to the screens of computers employing their software.+20.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1037+04-480+Since the extent of the softwares use determines the gain to the distributors, the commercial sense of their enterprise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.+29.0+0.103448275862+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1038+04-480+This evidence alone would not justify an inference of unlawful intent, but its import is clear in the entire records context.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.504166666667+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1068+04-514+(b)Prominent among the reasons warranting the result here is that the Sixth Circuit did not release its amended opinion for more than five months after this Court denied rehearing.+29.0+0.0344827586207+0.5+0.5+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1069+04-514+The consequence of delay for the States criminal justice system was compounded by the Sixth Circuits failure to issue an order or otherwise give notice to the parties that it was reconsidering its earlier opinion.+35.0+0.0571428571429+0.45+-0.238888888889+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1070+04-514+The express terms of the Sixth Circuits stay state that the mandate would be stayed until this Court acted on the rehearing petition.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1071+04-514+Thus, once rehearing was denied, the stay dissolved by operation of law.+12.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1072+04-514+Tennessee, relying on the Sixth Circuits earlier orders and this Courts certiorari and rehearing denials could assume that the mandate would issue, especially since Thompson sought no additional stay and the Sixth Circuit gave no indication that it might be revisting its earlier decision.+44.0+0.0909090909091+0.666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1073+04-514+The latter point is important, for it is an open question whether a court may exercise its Rule 41(b) authority to extend the time to issue a mandate through mere inaction.+31.0+0.0645161290323+0.5+-0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1074+04-514+Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Court had, or have, any way to know whether the Sixth Circuit had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mistake.+32.0+0.0625+0.357142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1076+04-514+The scheduling of Thompsons execution and the resulting competency proceedings were steps taken in reliance on the assumption that the federal habeas case was final.+25.0+0.12+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1077+04-514+That assumption was all the more reasonable because the delay in issuing the mandate took place after this Court had denied certiorari, which usually signals the end of litigation.+29.0+0.0+0.45+0.15+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1118+03-1566+The interpretation also draws support from the contrast between 390uus language, which speaks in terms of joinder, and the broader phrasing of other statutes, e.g., the Tucker Act, that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone.+38.0+0.105263157895+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1206+04-563+(b)Under the Ninth Circuits comprehensive definition of conduct, transaction, or occurrence, virtually any new claim introduced in an amended habeas petition will relate back, for federal habeas claims, by their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, and commonly attack proceedings anterior thereto.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.313636363636+0.00909090909091+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1207+04-563+The majority of Circuits define conduct, transaction, or occurrence in federal habeas cases far less broadly, allowing relation back only when the claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely filed claims, and not when the new claims depend upon events separate in both time and type from the originally raised episodes.+57.0+0.0701754385965+0.463589015152+0.0633996212121+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1208+04-563+Under that view, Felixs own pretrial statements, newly raised in his amended petition, would not relate back because they were separated in time and type from the videotaped witness testimony.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.484848484848+0.245454545455+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1209+04-563+This Court is not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings Rule 15 governs, of any reading of conduct, transaction, or occurrence as capacious as the Ninth Circuits construction for habeas cases.+31.0+0.0967741935484+0.25+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1210+04-563+Decisions applying Rule 15(c)(2) in the civil context illustrate that Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the existence of a common core of operative facts uniting the original and newly asserted claims.+42.0+0.0714285714286+0.426136363636+0.0528409090909+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1211+04-563+The Court disagrees with Felixs assertion that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)s relation-back provision than was given the words conduct, transaction, or occurrence in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R.Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580581.+43.0+0.209302325581+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1212+04-563+There, the amended complaint invoked a legal theory not suggested in the original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.42+-0.0425+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1215+04-563+In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes, the videotaped witness testimony in his original petition and his own interrogation at a different time and place in his amended petition.+28.0+0.178571428571+0.783333333333+0.325+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1217+04-563+Felixs contention that the trial itself is the appropriate transaction or occurrence artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes those claims actionable in a habeas proceeding.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.833333333333+-0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1218+04-563+Although his self-incrimination claim did not ripen until the prosecutor introduced his pretrial statements at trial, the essential predicate for his Fifth Amendment claim was an extrajudicial event, i.e., an out-of-court police interrogation.+33.0+0.151515151515+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1219+04-563+The dispositive question in an adjudication of that claim would be the character of the police interrogation, specifically, did Felix answer voluntarily or were his statements coerced.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1223+04-563+Felixs and the Ninth Circuits approach is boundless by comparison, allowing a miscellany of claims for relief to be raised later rather than sooner and to relate back.+28.0+0.0714285714286+0.233333333333+-0.0666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1224+04-563+If claims asserted after the one-year period could be revived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim, AEDPAs limitation period would have slim significance.+33.0+0.121212121212+0.241071428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1226+04-563+Felixs argument that a firm check against petition amendments presenting new, discrete claims after AEDPAs limitation period has run is provided by Rule 15(a)which gives district courts discretion to deny petition amendments once a responsive pleading has been filedoverlooks a pleaders right to amend without leave of court any time before a responsive pleading is served.+56.0+0.142857142857+0.46341991342+0.074025974026+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1280+04-70+The First Circuit ruled that the girl, but not her family, had alleged the requisite amount, and then held that supplemental jurisdiction over the familys claims was improper because original jurisdiction is lacking in a diversity case if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.370833333333+0.00625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1281+04-70+Held:Where the other elements of jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satisfies 1332(a)s amount-in-controversy requirement, 1367 authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or controversy, even if those claims are for less than the requisite amount.+50.0+0.08+0.205952380952+-0.0880952380952+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1305+04-70+The contamination theorythat inclusion of a claim or party falling outside the district courts original jurisdiction contaminates every other claim in the complaintmakes sense with respect to the complete diversity requirement because a nondiverse partys presence eliminates the justification for a federal forum.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.39375+0.0875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1311+04-70+(e)In light of the statutes text and structure, 1367s only plausible reading is that a court has original jurisdiction over a civil action comprising the claims for which there is no jurisdictional defect.+33.0+0.151515151515+0.61+0.275+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Petitioners, a trucking company engaged in both interstate and intrastate hauling and a trucking association, asked Michigan courts to invalidate the States flat $100 annual fee imposed on trucks engaged in intrastate commercial hauling, see Mich.

1340+03-1230+478.2(1), claiming that it discriminates against interstate carriers and imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate trade because trucks carrying both interstate and intrastate loads engage in less intrastate business than trucks carrying only intrastate loads.+35.0+0.171428571429+0.533333333333+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1341+03-1230+The State Court of Claims rejected the claim, holding that, because the fee is regulatory and intended for the Michigan Motor Carrier Acts administration, it is not amenable to apportionment; that it is an appropriate exercise of the States police power; and that it does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrastate commerce.+57.0+0.105263157895+0.7+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1346+03-1230+Applying this Courts dormant Commerce Clause principles and precedents here, nothing in 478.2(1) offends the Commerce Clause.+17.0+0.294117647059+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1347+03-1230+The flat fee is imposed only on intrastate transactions.+9.0+0.222222222222+0.5625+-0.0125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1349+03-1230+It applies evenhandedly to all carriers making domestic journeys and does not reflect an effort to tax activity taking place outside of the State.+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1350+03-1230+Nothing in this Courts case law suggests that such a neutral, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause.+23.0+0.173913043478+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1351+03-1230+That is not surprising, since States impose numerous flat fees on local business and service providers, e.g., insurers and auctioneers.+20.0+0.15+0.28125+-0.09375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1352+03-1230+The Constitution neither displaces States authority to shelter their people from health and safety menaces nor unduly curtails their power to lay taxes to support state government.+27.0+0.0740740740741+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1353+03-1230+The record, moreover, shows no special circumstances suggesting that Michigans fee operates as anything other than an unobjectionable exercise of the States police power.+24.0+0.125+0.473214285714+-0.151785714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1354+03-1230+Neither does it show that the flat assessment unfairly discriminates against interstate truckers.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.5625+-0.2625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1355+03-1230+Because the costs the fee seeks to defray, e.g., those of regulating vehicular size and weight, would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than per-mile traveled, a per-truck, rather than a per-mile, assessment is likely fair.+40.0+0.05+0.85+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1357+03-1230+Nor is there any reason to infer that the States lump-sum levy on purely local activity erects an impermissible discriminatory roadblock.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1401+03-1234+First, the Michigan statute makes no reference to evidence of a Federal Permit, an insurance requirement, or an agent for receiving service of process.+24.0+0.125+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1403+03-1234+In addition, because Michigan imposed its separate fee before the SSRS existed and before it began to participate in the bingo card system, the fee does not represent an effort to circumvent the limitations imposed in connection with federal laws governing State Registration of Federal Permits.+46.0+0.152173913043+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1405+03-1234+The fact that Michigan appears to forgive the States $10 SSRS fee for trucks that comply with 478.2(2) can be seen as an effort to provide a modest, administratively efficient recompense to those motor carriers that choose Michigan as their base State, but such a subsidiary connection cannot transform the States fee into a requirement concerning the SSRS statutes subject matter.+61.0+0.147540983607+0.683333333333+-0.216666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1421+04-169+That prohibition may be enforced in suits filed by the Attorney General, 3730(a), and in qui tam actions brought by private individuals in the Governments name, 3730(b)(1).+27.0+0.111111111111+0.4375+0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1422+04-169+A 1986 amendment to the FCA created a private cause of action for an individual retaliated against by his employer for assisting an FCA investigation or proceeding, 3730(h), and revised the FCAs statute of limitations, 3731(b).+36.0+0.0833333333333+0.291666666667+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1423+04-169+Section 3731(b) provides that [a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought  more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed.+30.0+0.0333333333333+0.3+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1424+04-169+In 2001, respondent Wilson brought an FCA qui tam action against petitioners, along with an FCA retaliation claim.+18.0+0.222222222222+0.1+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1425+04-169+Petitioner Graham County Soil and Water Conservation District employed Wilson as a secretary.+13.0+0.307692307692+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1427+04-169+Petitioners successfully moved to dismiss the retaliation claim as untimely, on the ground that North Carolinas 3-year statute of limitations governed Wilsons FCA action and barred it.+27.0+0.148148148148+0.525+0.425+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1428+04-169+Reversing, the Fourth Circuit found it unnecessary to borrow a state limitations period because one was supplied by 3731(b)(1).+19.0+0.157894736842+0.45+-0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1429+04-169+Held:Section 3731(b)(1)s limitations period does not govern 3730(h) retaliation actions.+10.0+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1430+04-169+Instead, the most closely analogous state statute of limitations applies.+10.0+0.2+0.5+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1432+04-169+(a)To determine the applicable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by federal statute, this Court asks first whether the statute expressly supplies a limitations period.+28.0+0.107142857143+0.216666666667+0.175+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1433+04-169+If not, the most closely analogous state limitations period applies.+10.0+0.1+0.5+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1434+04-169+Pp.45.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1435+04-169+(b)Section 3730(h) is a subsection of 3730, but 3731(b)(1) is nonetheless ambiguous about whether a 3730(h) retaliation action is a civil action under section 3730 as that phrase is used in 3731(b)(1).+32.0+0.0625+0.1+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1436+04-169+Another reasonable reading is that 3731(b)(1)s limitations period applies only to 3730(a) and (b) actions.+15.0+0.133333333333+0.8+0.1+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1437+04-169+Section 3731(b)(1) starts the limitations period running on the date on which the violation of section 3729 is committed, that is, on the date the false claim was actually submitted.+30.0+0.0333333333333+0.35+-0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1438+04-169+That language casts doubt on whether 3731(b)(1) specifies a limitations period for retaliation actions.+14.0+0.214285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1439+04-169+For even a well-pleaded retaliation complaint need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if 3731(b)(1) is applicable.+28.0+0.0714285714286+0.3+-0.233333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1440+04-169+By contrast, the section naturally applies to well-pleaded 3370(a) and (b) actions.+12.0+0.0+0.4+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1441+04-169+Those actions require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim and therefore necessarily specify when 3731(b)(1)s time limit begins.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.8+-0.2+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1442+04-169+At a minimum this anomaly shows that 3731(b)(1) is ambiguous about whether action under section 3730 means all actions arising under that section.+23.0+0.0+0.1+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1443+04-169+Pp.57.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1444+04-169+(c)Two considerations show that the better way to resolve this ambiguity is to read the 6-year period to govern only 3370(a) and (b) actions.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.75+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1445+04-169+First, the very next subsection, 3730(c), uses the similarly unqualified phrase action brought under section 3730 to refer only to 3370(a) and (b) actions.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.366666666667+0.07+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1446+04-169+Second, reading 3731(b)(1) to apply only to those actions is in keeping with the default rule that Congress generally drafts statutes of limitations to begin when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.+36.0+0.0833333333333+0.333333333333+0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1447+04-169+Where, as here, there are two plausible constructions, this Court should adopt the construction that starts the time limit running when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.+28.0+0.0714285714286+0.3+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1448+04-169+This approach resolves 3731(b)(1)s ambiguity in petitioners favor.+8.0+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1449+04-169+Reading 3731(b)(1) to exclude retaliation actions will generally start the limitations period running when the cause of action accrues, for the likely analogous state statutes virtually all start when the retaliatory action occurs.+33.0+0.181818181818+0.425+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1450+04-169+However, under the reading favored by Wilson and the Government, the limitations period would begin at best on the date an actual or suspected FCA violation occurred, which would precede the retaliatory conduct.+33.0+0.121212121212+0.433333333333+0.6+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1466+04-340+They initially sought mandamus in California state court, but that action was stayed when they filed suit in Federal District Court asserting, inter alia, facial and as-applied challenges to the ordinance under the Fifth Amendments Takings Clause.+37.0+0.135135135135+0.0333333333333+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1467+04-340+Although the District Court granted the city summary judgment, the Ninth Circuit abstained from ruling on the facial challenge under Railroad Commn of Tex.+24.0+0.208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1471+04-340+Ultimately, the California courts rejected petitioners various state-law takings claims, and they returned to the Federal District Court, advancing a series of federal takings claims that depended on issues identical to those previously resolved in the state courts.+38.0+0.131578947368+0.555555555556+-0.0555555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1484+04-340+In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that is functionally identical to the federal question, but to avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-law determination that may moot the federal controversy.+45.0+0.133333333333+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1488+04-340+Because the Ninth Circuit invoked Pullman abstention after determining that a ripe federal question existed as to the petitioners facial takings challenge, they were entitled to insulate from preclusive effect that one federal issue while they returned to state court to resolve their mandamus petition.+45.0+0.155555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

On April 4, 2001, petitioner Dodd filed a pro se motion under 28 U. S.C. 2255, claiming that his conviction for knowingly and intentionally engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U. S.C. 841 and 846, should be set aside because it was contrary to Richardson v. United States, 526 U. S. 813, 815, which held that a jury must agree unanimously that a defendant is guilty of each of the specific violations that together constitute the continuing criminal enterprise."+90.0+0.133333333333+0.585+-0.18+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1520+04-5286+The District Court held that, because Richardson had been decided more than one year before Dodd filed his motion, the motion was untimely under 2255, 6(3), which provides that 2255s 1-year limitation period begins to run on the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.+71.0+0.0985915492958+0.405194805195+0.241558441558+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1521+04-5286+On appeal, Dodd argued that 6(3)s limitation period began to run on April 19, 2002, the date the Eleventh Circuit recognized Richardsons retroactive application to cases on collateral review.+29.0+0.241379310345+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
1522+04-5286+The Eleventh Circuit held that the period began to run on June 1, 1999, the date that this Court initially decided Richardson.+22.0+0.136363636364+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1523+04-5286+"Held: 
1.The 1-year limitation period under 6(3) begins to run on the date on which this Court initially recognized the right asserted in an applicants motion, not the date on which that right was made retroactive."+36.0+0.0555555555556+0.357142857143+0.190476190476+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1524+04-5286+The text of 6(3) unequivocally identifies one, and only one, date from which the limitation period is measured: the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.+32.0+0.0625+0.511904761905+0.0952380952381+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1525+04-5286+This Court presumes that a legislature says what it means and means what it says in a statute.+18.0+0.0555555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1526+04-5286+Dodds reliance on 6(3)s second clause to identify the operative date is misplaced.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.1+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1527+04-5286+That clause merely limits the subsections applicability to cases in which applicants assert rights newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.+29.0+0.137931034483+0.477272727273+-0.181818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1528+04-5286+Thus, 6(3)s datethe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Courtdoes not apply at all unless the conditions in the second clause are satisfied.+29.0+0.0689655172414+0.383928571429+0.196428571429+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1529+04-5286+This result may make it difficult for applicants filing second or successive 2255 motions to obtain relief, since this Court rarely announces a new rule of constitutional law and makes it retroactive within a year, but the Court is not free to rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted.+49.0+0.0612244897959+0.630909090909+-0.0527272727273+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1564+04-5462+Their duty to make all reasonable efforts to learn what they could about the offense the prosecution was going to use certainly included obtaining the Commonwealths own readily available file to learn what it knew about the crime, to discover any mitigating evidence it would downplay, and to anticipate the details it would emphasize.+54.0+0.0555555555556+0.642857142857+0.353571428571+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1635+03-9659+Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and the trial court must determine if the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination, id., at 98, in light of all relevant circumstances, id., at 9697.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.8+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1636+03-9659+Since this case is on review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U.

1641+03-9659+If a prosecutors proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination.+29.0+0.103448275862+0.477777777778+0.111111111111+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1642+03-9659+The details of two panel member comparisons bear out this Courts observation, id., at 343, that the prosecutions reason for exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared to apply equally to some white jurors.+36.0+0.166666666667+0.227777777778+-0.0555555555556+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1643+03-9659+There are strong similarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a black venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death penalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but the differences seem far from significant, particularly when reading Fieldss voir dire testimony in its entirety.+47.0+0.148936170213+0.629166666667+0.151388888889+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1644+03-9659+Upon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors explanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death if rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his testimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack veniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were not struck.+61.0+0.0983606557377+0.866666666667+0.366666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1645+03-9659+The prosecutions reason that Fieldss brother had prior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to enquire about the matter.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.333333333333+0.0277777777778+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1646+03-9659+The prosecutions proffered reasons for striking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably unlikely.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.644444444444+-0.0555555555556+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1647+03-9659+The fact that the reason for striking him, that he thought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to suffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were selected is evidence of pretext.+38.0+0.0526315789474+0.777777777778+0.477777777778+1.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1648+03-9659+The suggestion of pretext is not, moreover, mitigated by Macalusos explanation that Warren was struck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10 remaining peremptory challenges.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1649+03-9659+Were that the explanation for striking Warren and later accepting similar panel members, prosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was examined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.+32.0+0.21875+0.36+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1650+03-9659+Macalusos explanation also weakens any suggestion that the States acceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not in play.+23.0+0.130434782609+0.433333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1651+03-9659+When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had used 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members; and the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel opposed capital punishment.+39.0+0.102564102564+0.416666666667+-0.233333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1652+03-9659+Because the prosecutors had to exercise prudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel member willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the early-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.+35.0+0.2+0.591666666667+0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1653+03-9659+The Fifth Circuits substituted reason for the elimination, Warrens general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a matter of fact and law.+23.0+0.130434782609+0.55+-0.225+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1654+03-9659+As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about general ambivalence, and Warrens answer to several questions was that he could impose the death penalty.+23.0+0.173913043478+0.25+0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1655+03-9659+As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give the reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess the reasons plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it does not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis.+52.0+0.0576923076923+0.733333333333+0.133333333333+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1656+03-9659+Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason he gave, the Fifth Circuits substitution of a reason for excluding Warren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors burden of stating a racially neutral explanation for their own actions.+37.0+0.135135135135+0.775+0.4+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1657+03-9659+Comparing Warrens strike with the treatment of panel members with similar views supports a conclusion that race was significant in determining who was challenged and who was not.+28.0+0.107142857143+0.6375+0.1875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1668+03-9659+Prosecutors gave a bland description of the death penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking about the individuals feelings on the subject, but used a script describing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53% of the black venire members.+45.0+0.177777777778+0.4+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1670+03-9659+Black venire members were more likely to receive that script regardless of their expressions of certainty or ambivalence about the death penalty, and the States chosen explanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members who received it: two received it after clearly stating their opposition to the death penalty and two received it even though they unambiguously favored that penalty.+63.0+0.0952380952381+0.564285714286+0.0809523809524+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1674+03-9659+The explanation that the prosecutors first object was to use the graphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more persuasive than the States explanation, and the reasonable inference is that race was the major consideration when the prosecution chose to follow the graphic script.+57.0+0.105263157895+0.452380952381+0.120833333333+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1711+04-495+When OSP first became operational, no official policy governing placement there was in effect, and the procedures used to assign inmates to the facility were inconsistent and undefined, resulting in haphazard and erroneous placements.+34.0+0.0882352941176+0.577777777778+-0.283333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1712+04-495+In an effort to establish guidelines for the selection and classification of OSP inmates, Ohio issued its Policy 11107.+19.0+0.157894736842+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1713+04-495+Relevant here are two versions of the policy: the Old Policy and the New Policy.+15.0+0.2+0.518181818182+0.212121212121+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1714+04-495+Because assignment problems persisted after the Old Policy took effect, Ohio promulgated the New Policy to provide more guidance regarding the factors to be considered in placement decisions and to afford inmates more procedural protection against erroneous placement.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.450909090909+0.147272727273+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1715+04-495+Under the New Policy, a prison official conducts a classification review either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e.g., organized crime, or (2) during the incarceration if the inmate engages in specified conduct, e.g., leads a prison gang.+47.0+0.148936170213+0.512987012987+0.175324675325+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1716+04-495+The New Policy also provides for a three-tier review process after a recommendation that an inmate be placed in OSP.+20.0+0.15+0.454545454545+0.136363636364+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1717+04-495+Among other things, the inmate must receive notice of the factual basis leading to consideration for OSP placement and a fair opportunity for rebuttal at a hearing, although he may not call witnesses.+33.0+0.0909090909091+0.6375+0.2875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1718+04-495+In addition, the inmate is invited to submit objections prior to the final level of review.+16.0+0.125+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1719+04-495+Although a subsequent reviewer may overturn an affirmative recommendation for OSP placement at any level, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process terminates.+31.0+0.161290322581+0.533333333333+0.141666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1720+04-495+Ohio also provides for a placement review within 30 days of an inmates initial assignment to OSP, and annual review thereafter.+21.0+0.238095238095+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1721+04-495+A class of current and former OSP inmates filed this suit for equitable relief under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Old Policy, which was then in effect, violated the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.24375+-0.00625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1722+04-495+On the eve of trial, Ohio promulgated its New Policy and represented that it contained the procedures to be followed in the future.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.289772727273+0.0681818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1723+04-495+After extensive evidence was presented, the District Court made findings and conclusions and issued a detailed remedial order.+18.0+0.166666666667+0.541666666667+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1724+04-495+First, relying on Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, the court found that inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.+24.0+0.208333333333+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1725+04-495+Second, it found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford many of them notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give them sufficient notice of the grounds for their retention at OSP; and failing to give them sufficient opportunity to understand the reasoning and evidence used to retain them at OSP.+60.0+0.116666666667+0.302083333333+0.177083333333+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1726+04-495+Third, it held that, although the New Policy provided more procedural safeguards than the Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedural due process requirements.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.305909090909+0.122272727273+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1727+04-495+The court therefore ordered modifications to the New Policy, including substantive modifications narrowing the grounds that Ohio could consider in recommending assignment to OSP, and various specific procedural modifications.+29.0+0.172413793103+0.359848484848+0.0454545454545+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1728+04-495+The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Courts conclusion that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding OSP placement and upheld the lower courts procedural modifications in their entirety, but set aside the far-reaching substantive modifications on the ground they exceeded the District Courts authority.+45.0+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1729+04-495+Held:The procedures by which Ohios New Policy classifies prisoners for placement at its Supermax facility provide prisoners with sufficient protection to comply with the Due Process Clause.+27.0+0.222222222222+0.414772727273+0.00568181818182+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1732+04-495+Such an interest may arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin, which requires a determination whether OSP assignment imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.568055555556+0.0597222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1734+04-495+The Court is satisfied that assignment to OSP imposes such a hardship compared to any plausible baseline from which to measure the Ohio prison system.+25.0+0.16+0.666666666667+0.333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1735+04-495+For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not permitted from cell to cell; his cells light may be dimmed, but is on for 24 hours; and he may exercise only one hour per day in a small indoor room.+51.0+0.078431372549+0.55+0.0375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1736+04-495+Save perhaps for the especially severe limitations on all human contact, these conditions likely would apply to most solitary confinement facilities, but here there are two added components.+28.0+0.142857142857+0.65+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1738+04-495+Unlike the 30-day placement in segregated confinement at issue in Sandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and, after an initial 30-day review, is reviewed just annually.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1739+04-495+Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole consideration.+12.0+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1740+04-495+Taken together these conditions impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context.+14.0+0.285714285714+0.5375+0.1875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1743+04-495+Evaluating the sufficiency of particular prison procedures requires consideration of three distinct factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the governments interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.+74.0+0.162162162162+0.458333333333+-0.097619047619+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1745+04-495+Applying those factors demonstrates that Ohios New Policy provides a sufficient level of process.+14.0+0.357142857143+0.454545454545+0.136363636364+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1746+04-495+First, the inmates interest in avoiding erroneous placement at OSP, while more than minimal, must nonetheless be evaluated within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties.+31.0+0.161290322581+0.486666666667+0.07+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1747+04-495+The liberty of prisoners in lawful confinement is curtailed by definition, so their procedural protections are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from all confinement.+35.0+0.0571428571429+0.419047619048+0.233333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1748+04-495+Second, the risk of an erroneous placement is minimized by the New Policys requirements.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.351515151515+-0.121212121212+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1749+04-495+Ohio provides multiple levels of review for any decision recommending OSP placement, with power to overturn the recommendation at each level.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1750+04-495+In addition, Ohio reduces the risk of erroneous placement by providing for a placement review within 30 days of an inmates initial assignment to OSP.+25.0+0.2+0.3+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1751+04-495+Notice of the factual basis for a decision and a fair opportunity for rebuttal are among the most important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.+27.0+0.185185185185+0.75+0.275+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1754+04-495+Third, in the context of prison management and the specific circumstances of this case, Ohios interest is a dominant consideration.+20.0+0.2+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1755+04-495+Ohios first obligation must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the public, and the prisoners themselves.+20.0+0.1+0.2+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1757+04-495+Prison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison gangs, provides the backdrop of the States interest.+17.0+0.176470588235+1.0+-0.875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1758+04-495+Another component of Ohios interest is the problem of scarce resources.+11.0+0.181818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1759+04-495+The high cost of maintaining an inmate at OSP would make it difficult to fund more effective education and vocational assistance programs to improve prisoners lives.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.648+0.212+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1760+04-495+Courts must give substantial deference to prison management decisions before mandating additional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards when correctional officials conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behavior.+29.0+0.241379310345+1.0+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1761+04-495+Were Ohio required to provide other attributes of an adversary hearing before ordering transfer to OSP, both the States immediate objective of controlling the prisoner and its greater objective of controlling the prison could be defeated.+36.0+0.111111111111+0.26875+0.09375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1762+04-495+Where, as here, the inquiry draws more on the experience of prison administrators, and where the States interest implicates the safety of other inmates and prison personnel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenholtz and Hewitt provide the appropriate model.+41.0+0.19512195122+0.458333333333+0.291666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1763+04-495+If an inmate were to demonstrate that the New Policy did not in practice operate in the fashion described, any cognizable injury could be the subject of an appropriate future challenge.+31.0+0.0967741935484+0.35321969697+0.117424242424+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1764+04-495+In light of the foregoing, the procedural modifications ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Sixth Circuit were in error.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.7+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1781+04-603+Federal-question jurisdiction is usually invoked by plaintiffs pleading a cause of action created by federal law, but this Court has also long recognized that such jurisdiction will lie over some state-law claims that implicate significant federal issues, see, e.g., Smith v.

1791+04-603+The Government has a strong interest in promptly collecting delinquent taxes, and the IRSs ability to satisfy its claims from delinquents property requires clear terms of notice to assure buyers like Darue that the IRS has good title.+38.0+0.210526315789+0.572222222222+0.411111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1792+04-603+Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a federal-law issue, federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.85+0.175+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1797+04-603+There, in finding federal jurisdiction unavailable for a state tort claim resting in part on an allegation that the defendant drug company had violated a federal branding law, the Court noted that Congress had not provided a private federal cause of action for such violations.+45.0+0.111111111111+0.325+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1800+04-603+Accordingly, Merrell Dow should be read in its entirety as treating the absence of such cause as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the sensitive judgments about congressional intent, required by 1331.+33.0+0.151515151515+0.575+0.121875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1815+04-637+"04637.Argued April 19, 2005Decided June 13, 2005
Respondent Stumpf and his accomplice Wesley committed an armed robbery that left Mr. Stout wounded and Mrs. Stout dead."+26.0+0.230769230769+0.2+-0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1817+04-637+In Ohio state court proceedings, Stumpf pleaded guilty to, among other things, aggravated murder and one of three capital murder specifications charged in his indictment.+25.0+0.16+0.6875+-0.3125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1818+04-637+This left Stumpf eligible for the death penalty.+8.0+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1819+04-637+In a contested penalty hearing before a three-judge panel, Stumpfs principal mitigation arguments were that he had participated in the robbery at Wesleys urging, that Wesley had killed Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpfs minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence.+43.0+0.232558139535+0.1+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1820+04-637+The State, however, claimed that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout, and that he therefore was the principal offender in her murder.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1821+04-637+In the alternative, the State noted that even an accomplice can be sentenced to death under Ohio law if he acted with the specific intent to cause death, and the State argued that such intent could be inferred from the circumstances of the robbery regardless of who actually shot Mrs. Stout.+51.0+0.0980392156863+0.241666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0

1823+04-637+At Wesleys subsequent jury trial, however, the State presented evidence that Wesley had admitted to shooting Mrs. Stout.+18.0+0.222222222222+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1824+04-637+But Wesley argued that the prosecutor had taken a contrary position in Stumpfs trial, and Wesley was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.+27.0+0.148148148148+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
1825+04-637+After Wesleys trial, Stumpf moved to withdraw his own plea or vacate his death sentence, arguing that the evidence endorsed by the State in Wesleys trial cast doubt on Stumpfs conviction and sentence.+33.0+0.212121212121+1.0+0.6+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1826+04-637+This time, however, the prosecutor emphasized other evidence confirming Stumpf as the shooter and again raised, in the alternative, the aider-and-abettor theory.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1827+04-637+The court denied Stumpfs motion, and Ohios appellate courts affirmed.+10.0+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1828+04-637+Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Stumpf habeas relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed on two grounds.+17.0+0.235294117647+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1829+04-637+First, the Sixth Circuit found that Stumpf had not understood that specific intent to cause death was a necessary element of the aggravated murder charge, and that his guilty plea therefore had not been knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.+38.0+0.131578947368+0.671666666667+0.11+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1830+04-637+Second, the court found that the conviction and sentence could not stand because the State had secured convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theories.+30.0+0.1+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1831+04-637+"Held: 
1.The Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that Stumpf was uninformed of the aggravated murder charges specific intent element."+19.0+0.157894736842+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1832+04-637+While a guilty plea is invalid if the defendant has not been informed of the crimes elements, Stumpfs attorneys represented at his plea hearing that they had explained the elements to their client, and Stumpf confirmed that the representation was true.+41.0+0.121951219512+0.883333333333+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1833+04-637+This Court has never held that the judge must himself explain a crimes elements to the defendant.+17.0+0.0588235294118+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1834+04-637+Rather, constitutional requirements may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the charges nature and the crimes elements were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel.+29.0+0.137931034483+0.825+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1835+04-637+Stumpf argues that his plea was so inconsistent with his denial of having shot Mrs. Stout that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the aggravated murder charges specific intent element.+34.0+0.117647058824+0.708333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
1836+04-637+But that argument fails because Stumpfs conviction did not require a showing that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout.+18.0+0.166666666667+0.3+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1837+04-637+Ohio law also considers aiders and abettors who act with specific intent to cause death liable for aggravated murder.+19.0+0.157894736842+0.3125+-0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1838+04-637+Stumpf and Wesley entered the Stout home with guns, intending to commit armed robbery, and Stumpf admitted shooting Mr. Stout.+20.0+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1839+04-637+Taken together, these facts could show that the two men had agreed to kill both Stouts, which in turn could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of who shot Mrs. Stout.+33.0+0.121212121212+1.0+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1840+04-637+Stumpfs claim that he and his attorneys were confused about the relevance and timing of defenses that they planned to make is not supported by the record.+27.0+0.037037037037+0.7+-0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1841+04-637+Finally, the pleas validity may not be collaterally attacked on the ground that Stumpf made what he now claims was a bad deal.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.833333333333+-0.35+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1843+04-637+2.The Sixth Circuit was also wrong to hold that prosecutorial inconsistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases required voiding Stumpfs guilty plea.+22.0+0.227272727273+0.633333333333+-0.366666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1844+04-637+The precise identity of the triggerman was immaterial to Stumpfs aggravated murder conviction, and Stumpf has never explained how the prosecutions postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affected the knowing, voluntary, and intelligent nature of his plea.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.85+0.6+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1845+04-637+P.11.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1846+04-637+3.The prosecutors use of allegedly inconsistent theories may have a more direct effect on Stumpfs sentence, however, for it is arguable that the sentencing panels conclusion about his role was material to its sentencing determination.+35.0+0.142857142857+0.333333333333+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1847+04-637+The opinion below leaves some ambiguity as to the overlap between how the lower court resolved Stumpfs due process challenge to his conviction and how it resolved his challenge to his sentence.+32.0+0.0625+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1848+04-637+It is not clear whether the Court of Appeals would have found Stumpf entitled to resentencing had it not also considered the conviction invalid.+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.383333333333+-0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1849+04-637+Likewise, the parties briefing here, and the question on which this Court granted certiorari, largely focused on the conviction.+19.0+0.0526315789474+0.428571428571+0.214285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1850+04-637+In these circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the merits of Stumpfs sentencing claim before giving the Sixth Circuit the opportunity to consider in the first instance the question of how the prosecutors conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases related to Stumpfs death sentence in particular.+51.0+0.117647058824+0.355555555556+0.138888888889+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1862+04-6964+During jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, three of whom were black.+22.0+0.136363636364+0.433333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1863+04-6964+The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospective black jurors, resulting in an all-white jury.+20.0+0.1+0.433333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1864+04-6964+Defense counsel objected to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstitutionally based on race.+16.0+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1865+04-6964+The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain his strikes, but instead simply found that petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination under the governing state precedent, People v. Wheeler, which required a showing of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was based on group bias.+56.0+0.142857142857+0.463492063492+-0.0222222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1866+04-6964+The judge explained that, although the case was close, his review of the record convinced him that the prosecutors strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.9+0.4+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1867+04-6964+The California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the State Supreme Court reinstated it, stressing that Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, permits state courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the sufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.+47.0+0.191489361702+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
1868+04-6964+Reviewing Batson, Wheeler, and their progeny, the court concluded that Wheelers strong likelihood standard is entirely consistent with Batson.+19.0+0.263157894737+0.327777777778+0.227777777778+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
1869+04-6964+Under Batson, the court held, a state court may require the objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit an inference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were more likely than not based on race.+46.0+0.0652173913043+0.546666666667+0.186666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1870+04-6964+Applying that standard, the court acknowledged that the exclusion of all three black prospective jurors looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial judges ruling.+24.0+0.125+0.216666666667+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
1871+04-6964+Held: Californias more likely than not standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in jury selection.+28.0+0.178571428571+0.5+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
1872+04-6964+This narrow but important issue concerns the scope of the first of three steps Batson enumerated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie case and (2) the State has satisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes, e.g., 476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial court must decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful racial discrimination, Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.

1873+04-6964+Batson does not permit California to require at step one that the objector show that it is more likely than not the other partys peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.+34.0+0.147058823529+0.46875+0.08125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1874+04-6964+The Batson Court held that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.+37.0+0.108108108108+0.4+-0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1876+04-6964+The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case, the defendant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial group, the prosecutors exercise of peremptory challenges to remove members of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges permit those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire members on account of race.+66.0+0.0757575757576+0.591666666667+0.0916666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

1878+04-6964+The Court assumed that the trial judge would have the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the prosecutors explanation, before deciding whether it was more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improperly motivated.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.8+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1879+04-6964+The Court did not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judgeon the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certaintythat the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination.+51.0+0.0196078431373+0.708333333333+0.0208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
1880+04-6964+Instead, a defendant satisfies Batsons first step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.+25.0+0.16+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1881+04-6964+The facts of this case illustrate that Californias standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson.+20.0+0.15+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0
1882+04-6964+The permissible inferences of discrimination, which caused the trial judge to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious that all three black prospective jurors were removed, were sufficient to establish a prima facie case.+44.0+0.136363636364+0.433333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1896+03-1388+The petitioners, disabled individuals and their companions who purchased tickets for round-trip NCL cruises from Houston, sued NCL under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S.C. 12181 et seq., which prohibits discrimination based on disability in places of public accommodation, 12182(a), and in specified public transportation services, 12184(a), and requires covered entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures to accommodate disabled persons, 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A), and to remove architectural barriers, and communication barriers that are structural in nature where such removal is readily achievable, 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C).+95.0+0.147368421053+0.333333333333+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1897+03-1388+Though holding Title III generally applicable, the District Court found that the petitioners claims regarding physical barriers to access could not go forward because the federal agencies charged with promulgating ADA architectural and structural guidelines had not done so for cruise ships.+42.0+0.190476190476+0.321428571429+0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1899+03-1388+The Fifth Circuit held that Title III does not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters because of a presumption, which the court derived from, e.g., Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.

1900+03-1388+Emphasizing that Title III does not contain a specific provision mandating its application to such vessels, the court sustained the dismissal of the petitioners barrier-removal claims and reversed on their remaining claims.+32.0+0.15625+0.3125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1903+03-1388+Justice Kennedy delivered an opinion concluding that except insofar as Title III regulates a vessels internal affairs, the statute is applicable to foreign-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters.+29.0+0.172413793103+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1904+03-1388+"Parts IIA1 and IIB2 of that opinion held for the Court: 


(a)Although Title IIIs public accommodation and specified public transportation definitions, 12181(7)(A),(B)(I),(L), 12181(10), do not expressly mention cruise ships, there is no doubt that the NCL ships in question fall within both definitions under conventional principles of interpretation."+48.0+0.1875+0.163492063492+-0.047619047619+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1905+03-1388+The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title III inapplicable because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating coverage for foreign-flag ships in U. S.waters.+26.0+0.192307692308+0.383333333333+-0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1906+03-1388+This Courts cases, particularly Benz and McCulloch, do hold, in some circumstances, that a general statute will not apply to certain aspects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporarily in U.

1913+03-1388+A Title III barrier-removal requirement that would bring a vessel into noncompliance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea or any other international legal obligation would create serious difficulties for the vessel and would have a substantial impact on its operation, and thus would not be readily achievable.+52.0+0.134615384615+0.290277777778+-0.00972222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1922+03-1388+In Benz and McCulloch, the Court held the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) inapplicable to labor relations between a foreign vessel and its foreign crew not because foreign ships are generally exempt from the NLRA, but because that particular application of the NLRA would interfere with matters that concern only the ships internal operations.+54.0+0.222222222222+0.315476190476+-0.022619047619+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1933+03-1388+(b)Plainly, most of the Title III violations alleged belowthat NCL required disabled passengers to pay higher fares and special surcharges; maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessible to them; required them, but not other passengers, to waive any potential medical liability and to travel with companions; reserved the right to remove them from ships if they endangered other passengers comfort; and, more generally, failed to make reasonable modifications necessary to ensure their full enjoyment of the services offeredhave nothing to do with a ships internal affairs.+88.0+0.125+0.446008403361+0.0819327731092+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1934+03-1388+However, the petitioners allegations concerning physical barriers to access on boarde.g., their assertion that most of NCLs cabins, including the most attractive ones in the most desirable locations, are not accessible to disabled passengerswould appear to involve requirements that might be construed as relating to internal ship affairs.+48.0+0.125+0.414732142857+0.2390625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1935+03-1388+The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels.+25.0+0.16+0.576666666667+0.17+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1937+03-1388+(c)Because Title III does not require structural modifications that conflict with international legal obligations or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Title III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifications that interfere with cruise ships internal affairs.+51.0+0.156862745098+0.291666666667+0.108333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1939+03-1388+Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to invoke that rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes a particular barrier-removal requirement entailing a permanent and significant structural modification interfering with a foreign ships internal affairs.+40.0+0.15+0.286666666667+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1940+03-1388+Conversely, where it is not obvious that a particular physical modification relates to a vessels basic architecture and construction, but it is clear the modification would conflict with an international legal obligation, the court may simply hold the modification not readily achievable, without resort to the clear statement rule.+49.0+0.102040816327+0.2925+0.0466666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1942+03-1388+(d)The holding that the clear statement rule operates only when a ships internal affairs are affected does not implicate the Courts holding in Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.

1945+03-1388+Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part IIIA that if Title III imposed a requirement that interfered with a foreign-flag cruise ships internal affairs, the clear statement rule would come into play, but that requirement would still apply to domestic ships, and Title III requirements having nothing to do with internal affairs would continue to apply to domestic and foreign ships alike.+69.0+0.188405797101+0.118055555556+-0.00416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1947+03-1388+If the rule restricts some NLRA applications to foreign ships (e.g., labor relations with foreign crews in Benz and McCulloch), but not others (e.g., labor relations with American longshoremen in Ariadne Shipping), it follows that its case-by-case application is also required under Title III.+44.0+0.272727272727+0.0833333333333+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
1948+03-1388+The clear statement rule, if it is invoked, would restrict some applications of Title III to foreign ships (e.g., certain structural barrier modification requirements), but not others (e.g., the statutes prohibition on discriminatory ticket pricing).+35.0+0.171428571429+0.359920634921+0.0630952380952+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1952+03-1388+An all-or-nothing approach would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of interpretive caution into a trap for an unwary Congress, requiring nullification of the entire statute, or of some arbitrary set of applications larger than the domain the rule protects.+42.0+0.119047619048+0.527083333333+3.46944695195e-18+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

1954+03-1388+Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer, agreed that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships and allows them to resist modifications that would conflict with international legal obligations, but would give no wider berth to the internal affairs clear statement rule in determining Title IIIs application to respondents ships.+55.0+0.181818181818+0.145833333333+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

In a state-law defamation action filed by attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., a California trial court found that petitioner Tory, assisted by petitioner Craft and others, had, inter alia, falsely claimed that Cochran owed him money, picketed Cochrans office with signs containing insults and obscenities, and pursued Cochran while chanting similar threats and insults, in order to coerce Cochran into paying Tory money to desist from such libelous and slanderous activity."+78.0+0.230769230769+0.4+-0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2034+03-1488+Because Tory indicated that he would continue to engage in the activity absent a court order, the court permanently enjoined petitioners and their agents from, among other things, picketing, displaying signs, and making oral statements about Cochran and his firm in any public forum.+44.0+0.113636363636+0.280555555556+-0.108333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2041+03-1488+Cochrans counsel argues that the injunction is still necessary, valid, and enforceable, and no source of California law says that it automatically became invalid upon Cochrans death.+27.0+0.148148148148+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0

2043+03-1488+Given this uncertainty, the injunction here continues significantly to restrain petitioners speech, thus presenting an ongoing federal controversy.+18.0+0.111111111111+0.875+0.375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.

As Enron Corporations financial difficulties became public, petitioner, Enrons auditor, instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant to its document retention policy."+29.0+0.241379310345+0.0222222222222+-0.0666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2109+04-368+Petitioner was indicted under 18 U.

2110+04-368+The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the District Courts jury instructions properly conveyed the meaning of corruptly persuades and official proceeding in 1512(b); that the jury need not find any consciousness of wrongdoing in order to convict; and that there was no reversible error.+51.0+0.078431372549+0.7+-0.333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2113+04-368+(a)This Courts traditional restraint in assessing federal criminal statutes reach, see, e.g., United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600, is particularly appropriate here, where the act underlying the convictionpersua[sion]is by itself innocuous.+34.0+0.176470588235+0.6+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2114+04-368+Even persuad[ing] a person with intent to  cause that person to withhold testimony or documents from the Government is not inherently malign.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2115+04-368+Under ordinary circumstances, it is not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to comply with a valid document retention policy, even though the policy, in part, is created to keep certain information from others, including the Government.+39.0+0.0769230769231+0.535714285714+-0.0178571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2116+04-368+Thus, 1512(b)s knowingly  corruptly persuades phrase is key to what may or may not lawfully be done in the situation presented here.+22.0+0.0454545454545+0.666666666667+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2117+04-368+The Government suggests that knowingly does not modify corruptly persuades, but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.+20.0+0.05+0.633333333333+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2118+04-368+[K]nowledge and knowingly are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness, and corrupt and corruptly with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil.+21.0+0.047619047619+0.9125+-0.4625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2119+04-368+Joining these meanings together makes sense both linguistically and in the statutory scheme.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2121+04-368+And limiting criminality to persuaders conscious of their wrongdoing sensibly allows 1512(b) to reach only those with the level of culpability usually required to impose criminal liability.+27.0+0.037037037037+0.575+-0.1375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2125+04-368+Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.+10.0+0.0+0.75+0.15625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2126+04-368+For example, the jury was told that, even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could convict.+22.0+0.0+0.466666666667+0.366666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2127+04-368+The instructions also diluted the meaning of corruptly such that it covered innocent conduct.+14.0+0.0714285714286+0.6+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2128+04-368+The District Court based its instruction on the Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction for 1503, which defined corruptly as knowingly and dishonestly, with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity of a proceeding.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.541666666667+-0.266666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2129+04-368+However, the court agreed with the Governments insistence on excluding dishonestly and adding the term impede to the phrase subvert or undermine, so the jury was told to convict if it found petitioner intended to subvert, undermine, or impede governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy.+53.0+0.0754716981132+0.5+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

2131+04-368+[D]ishonest[y] was no longer necessary to a finding of guilt, and it was enough for petitioner to have simply impede[d] the Governments factfinding ability.+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.619047619048+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2132+04-368+Impede has broader connotations than subvert or even undermine, and many of these connotations do not incorporate any corrupt[ness] at all.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.5+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2133+04-368+Under the dictionary definition of impede, anyone who innocently persuades another to withhold information from the Government get[s] in the way of the progress of the Government.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.7+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2134+04-368+With regard to such innocent conduct, the corruptly instructions did no limiting work whatsoever.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.733333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2135+04-368+The instructions also led the jury to believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the persua[sion] to destroy documents and any particular proceeding.+27.0+0.037037037037+0.166666666667+-0.0166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2136+04-368+In resisting any nexus element, the Government relies on 1512(e)(1), which states that an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.+31.0+0.0645161290323+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2204+04-163+Beginning with Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, however, the Court recognized that government regulation of private property may be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.+36.0+0.194444444444+0.3875+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2205+04-163+Regulatory actions generally will be deemed per se takings for Fifth Amendment purposes (1) where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property, see Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, or (2) where regulations completely deprive an owner of all economically beneficial us[e] of her property, Lucas v.

2206+04-163+Outside these two categories (and the special context of land-use exactions discussed below), regulatory takings challenges are governed by Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124.+32.0+0.21875+0.331493506494+0.123376623377+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2207+04-163+Penn Central identified several factorsincluding the regulations economic impact on the claimant, the extent to which it interferes with distinct investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government actionthat are particularly significant in determining whether a regulation effects a taking.+40.0+0.075+0.325+0.175+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2208+04-163+Because the three inquiries reflected in Loretto, Lucas, and Penn Central all aim to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to a direct appropriation of or ouster from private property, each of them focuses upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon property rights.+47.0+0.148936170213+0.341666666667+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2212+04-163+It prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process test, which has no proper place in the Courts takings jurisprudence.+22.0+0.181818181818+0.2375+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2213+04-163+The formula unquestionably was derived from due process precedents, since Agins supported it with citations to Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183, 185, and Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, 395.+37.0+0.216216216216+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2214+04-163+Although Agins reliance on those precedents is understandable when viewed in historical context, the language the Court selected was imprecise.+20.0+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2215+04-163+It suggests a means-ends test, asking, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is effective in achieving some legitimate public purpose.+22.0+0.136363636364+0.413888888889+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2216+04-163+Such an inquiry is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been taken for Fifth Amendment purposes.+20.0+0.15+0.4375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2217+04-163+In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the substantially advances inquiry reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights or how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.352083333333+-0.00833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2218+04-163+Thus, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.+49.0+0.122448979592+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2219+04-163+Moreover, the Agins formulas application as a takings test would present serious practical difficulties.+14.0+0.285714285714+0.333333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2220+04-163+Reading it to demand heightened means-ends review of virtually all regulation of private property would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulationsa task for which they are not well suited.+38.0+0.131578947368+0.6875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2227+04-163+Moreover, in most of the cases reciting the Agins formula, the Court has merely assumed its validity when referring to it in dicta.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2288+04-37+And just as in Timmons, in which a Minnesota law conditioned a partys ability to nominate the candidate of its choice on the candidates willingness to disaffiliate from another party, Oklahoma conditions a partys ability to welcome a voter into its primary on the voters willingness to dissociate from his current party of choice.+54.0+0.148148148148+0.6+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2295+04-37+First, the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma (LPO) and voters registered with another party have constitutionally cognizable interests in associating with one another through the LPOs primary, and these interests should not be minimized to dispose of this case.+38.0+0.131578947368+0.416666666667+0.325+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2296+04-37+Second, while the Court is correct that only Oklahomas semiclosed primary law is properly under review, that standing alone it imposes only a modest, nondiscriminatory burden on respondents associational rights, and that this burden is justified by the States legitimate regulatory interests, there are some grounds for concern that other Oklahoma laws governing party recognition and changes in party affiliation may unreasonably restrict voters ability to participate in the LPOs primary.+71.0+0.140845070423+0.586111111111+0.130555555556+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2297+04-37+A realistic assessment of regulatory burdens on associational rights would, in an appropriate case, require examination of the cumulative effects of the States overall primary scheme; and any finding of a more severe burden would trigger more probing review of the States justifications.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.388888888889+0.344444444444+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

There are several threshold issues that could independently preclude federal habeas relief for Medelln, and thus render advisory or academic our consideration of the questions presented."+28.0+0.142857142857+0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2383+04-5928+First, even accepting, arguendo, the ICJs construction of the Vienna Conventions consular access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding.+28.0+0.142857142857+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
2384+04-5928+In Reed v. Farley, 512 U.

In light of the possibility that the Texas courts will provide Medelln with the review he seeks pursuant to the Avena judgment and the Presidents memorandum, and the potential for review in this Court once the Texas courts have heard and decided Medellns pending action, we think it would be unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hindrances to dispositive answers to the questions here presented."+68.0+0.132352941176+0.45+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2555+03-388+While these common-law rules are subject to 136v(b), it does not automatically follow that they are pre-empted.+17.0+0.0588235294118+0.333333333333+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2556+03-388+Unlike the pre-emption clause in Cipollone, 136v(b) prohibits only state-law labeling requirements that are in addition to or different from FIFRAs labeling requirements.+23.0+0.173913043478+0.8+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2557+03-388+Thus, 136v(b) pre-empts any statutory or common-law rule that would impose a labeling requirement that diverges from those set out in FIFRA and its implementing regulations.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2560+03-388+Thus, although FIFRA does not provide a federal remedy to those injured as a result of a manufacturers violation of FIFRAs labeling requirements, nothing in 136v(b) precludes States from providing such a remedy.+33.0+0.0909090909091+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

2585+03-9627+Reversing, the Third Circuit held, with regard to statutory tolling, that an untimely PCRA petition is not a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review that tolls AEDPAs limitations period under 28 U.

Texas, 507 U.

2650+03-725+Moreover, none of petitioners cases barred an action that had as its primary object the deterrence and punishment of fraudulent conducta substantial domestic regulatory interest entirely independent of foreign tax enforcement.+31.0+0.129032258065+0.19+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2651+03-725+The main object of the action in each of them was the collection of money that would pay foreign tax claims.+21.0+0.047619047619+0.186111111111+0.0472222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2652+03-725+The absence of such an object here means that the link between this prosecution and foreign tax collection is incidental and attenuated at best.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.23125+0.215625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2653+03-725+Thus, it cannot be said whether Congress in 1952 would have considered this prosecution within the revenue rule.+18.0+0.111111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2654+03-725+Petitioners answer unpersuasively that the recovery of taxes is indeed the object of this suit because restitution of Canadas lost tax revenue is required under the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996.+33.0+0.121212121212+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2656+03-725+In any event, if awarding restitution to foreign sovereigns were contrary to the revenue rule, the proper resolution would be to construe the later enacted restitution statute not to allow such awards, rather than to assume that it impliedly repealed 1343 as applied to this prosecution.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.18125+-0.03125+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2658+03-725+(iii)Also unavailing is petitioners argument that early English common-law cases holding unenforceable contracts executed to evade other nations revenue laws demonstrate that indirect enforcement of such laws is at the very core of the revenue rule, rather than at its margins.+41.0+0.19512195122+0.295+0.035+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2660+03-725+By the mid-20th century, however, that rationale was supplanted, and courts began to apply the revenue rule to tax obligations on the strength of the analogy between a countrys revenue laws and its penal ones.+35.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2661+03-725+Because the early English cases rested on a far different foundation from that on which the revenue rule came to rest, they say little about whether the wire fraud statute derogated from the revenue rule in its mid-20th century form.+40.0+0.15+0.48+0.0025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2665+03-725+For example, at the same time they were enforcing domestic contracts that had the purpose of violating foreign revenue law, English courts also considered void foreign contracts that lacked tax stamps required under foreign revenue law.+36.0+0.166666666667+0.1+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2667+03-725+The uncertainty persisted in American cases, which demonstrate that the extent to which the revenue rule barred indirect recognition of foreign revenue laws was unsettled as of 1952.+28.0+0.142857142857+0.0625+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2672+03-725+Although a prosecution like this one requires a court to recognize foreign law to determine whether the defendant violated U.

2673+03-725+Petitioners broader argument that the revenue rule avoids giving domestic effect to politically sensitive and controversial policy decisions embodied in foreign revenue laws worries the Court little.+27.0+0.222222222222+0.515+0.0675+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2675+03-725+Such a reading of 1343 gives effect to that considered policy choice and therefore poses no risk of advancing Canadian policies illegitimately.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.5+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2701+03-750+(a)In considering the scope of the phrase convicted in any court it is appropriate to assume that Congress had domestic concerns in mind.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.3+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2702+03-750+This assumption is similar to the legal presumption that Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application, see, e.g., Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 285.+32.0+0.15625+0.3+-0.0125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2703+03-750+The phrase convicted in any court describes one necessary portion of the gun possession activity that is prohibited as a matter of domestic law.+24.0+0.125+0.55+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2704+03-750+Moreover, because foreign convictions may include convictions for conduct that domestic laws would permit, e.g., for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage, convictions from a legal system that are inconsistent with American understanding of fairness, and convictions for conduct that domestic law punishes far less severely, the key statutory phrase convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year somewhat less reliably identifies dangerous individuals for the purposes of U. S. law where foreign convictions, rather than domestic convictions, are at issue.+92.0+0.119565217391+0.334523809524+-0.0202380952381+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2705+03-750+In addition, it is difficult to read the statute as asking judges or prosecutors to refine its definitional distinctions where foreign convictions are at issue.+25.0+0.08+0.5625+-0.3125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2706+03-750+To somehow weed out inappropriate foreign convictions that meet the statutory definition is not consistent with the statutes language; it is not easy for those not versed in foreign laws to accomplish; and it would leave those previously convicted in a foreign court (say of economic crimes) uncertain about their legal obligations.+52.0+0.134615384615+0.253125+-0.0604166666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2707+03-750+These considerations provide a convincing basis for applying the ordinary assumption about the reach of domestically oriented statutes here.+19.0+0.0526315789474+0.75+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2708+03-750+Thus, the Court assumes a congressional intent that the phrase convicted in any court applies domestically, not extraterritorially, unless the statutory language, context, history, or purpose shows the contrary.+29.0+0.172413793103+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2712+03-750+To the contrary, if read to include foreign convictions, the statutes language creates anomalies.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.125+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2713+03-750+For example, in creating an exception allowing gun possession despite a conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime, 921(a)(20)(A) speaks of Federal or State antitrust or regulatory offenses.+29.0+0.137931034483+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2714+03-750+If the phrase convicted in any court generally refers only to domestic convictions, this language causes no problem.+18.0+0.111111111111+0.533333333333+0.0166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2715+03-750+But if the phrase includes foreign convictions, the words Federal or State prevent the exception from applying where a foreign antitrust or regulatory conviction is at issue.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.125+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2716+03-750+Such illustrative examples suggest that Congress did not consider whether the generic phrase convicted in any court applies to foreign convictions.+21.0+0.238095238095+0.208333333333+-0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2718+03-750+Although the statutory purpose of keeping guns from those likely to become a threat to society does offer some support for reading 922(g)(1) to include foreign convictions, the likelihood that Congress, at best, paid no attention to the matter is reinforced by the empirical fact that, according to the Government, since 1968, there have fewer than a dozen instances in which such a foreign conviction has served as a predicate for a felon-in-possession prosecution.+74.0+0.0945945945946+0.358333333333+0.141666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

2731+03-932+"03932.Argued January 12, 2005Decided April 19, 2005
Respondents filed a securities fraud class action, alleging that petitioners, Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and some of its managers and directors (hereinafter Dura), made, inter alia, misrepresentations about future Food and Drug Administration approval of a new asthmatic spray device, leading respondents to purchase Dura securities at an artificially inflated price."+57.0+0.19298245614+0.419886363636+-0.0909090909091+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2732+03-932+In dismissing, the District Court found that the complaint failed adequately to allege loss causationi.e., a causal connection between the spray device misrepresentation and the economic loss, 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(4).+31.0+0.193548387097+0.258333333333+-0.0666666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2733+03-932+The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that a plaintiff can satisfy the loss causation requirement simply by alleging that a securitys price at the time of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation.+32.0+0.0625+0.357142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2734+03-932+"Held: 
1.An inflated purchase price will not by itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss needed to allege and prove loss causation."+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.55+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2735+03-932+The basic elements of a private securities fraud actionwhich resembles a common-law tort action for deceit and misrepresentationinclude, as relevant here, economic loss and loss causation.+26.0+0.192307692308+0.34+0.14+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2736+03-932+The Ninth Circuit erred in following an inflated purchase price approach to showing causation and loss.+16.0+0.0625+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2737+03-932+First, as a matter of pure logic, the moment the transaction takes place, the plaintiff has suffered no loss because the inflated purchase price is offset by ownership of a share that possesses equivalent value at that instant.+38.0+0.0526315789474+0.5+0.154761904762+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2738+03-932+And the logical link between the inflated purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong, since other factors may affect the price.+25.0+0.08+0.311666666667+0.151666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2739+03-932+Thus, the most logic alone permits this Court to say is that the inflated purchase price suggests that misrepresentation touches upon a later economic loss, as the Ninth Circuit found.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.233333333333+0.233333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2740+03-932+However, to touch upon a loss is not to cause a loss, as 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(4) requires.+18.0+0.0555555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2741+03-932+The Ninth Circuits holding also is not supported by precedent.+10.0+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2742+03-932+The common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions that private securities fraud actions resemble require a plaintiff to show not only that had he known the truth he would not have acted, but also that he suffered actual economic loss.+38.0+0.105263157895+0.41875+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2743+03-932+Nor can the holding below be reconciled with the views of other Courts of Appeals, which have rejected the inflated purchase price approach to showing loss causation.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2744+03-932+Finally, the Ninth Circuits approach is inconsistent with an important securities law objective.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.7+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2745+03-932+The securities laws make clear Congress intent to permit private securities fraud actions only where plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of cause and loss, but the Ninth Circuits approach would allow recovery where a misrepresentation leads to an inflated purchase price, but does not proximately cause any economic loss.+52.0+0.115384615385+0.506944444444+0.105555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2748+03-932+While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and while the Court assumes that neither the Rules nor the securities statutes place any further requirement in respect to the pleading, the short and plain statement must give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47.+80.0+0.125+0.530612244898+0.0387755102041+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2749+03-932+The complaint here contains only respondents allegation that their loss consisted of artificially inflated purchase prices.+16.0+0.0625+0.733333333333+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2750+03-932+However, as this Court has concluded here, such a price is not itself a relevant economic loss.+17.0+0.0588235294118+0.533333333333+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2751+03-932+And the complaint nowhere else provides Dura with notice of what the relevant loss might be or of what the causal connection might be between that loss and the misrepresentation.+30.0+0.1+0.55+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2752+03-932+Ordinary pleading rules are not meant to impose a great burden on a plaintiff, but it should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff suffering economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.+46.0+0.0652173913043+0.483333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2753+03-932+Allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause would bring about the very sort of harm the securities statutes seek to avoid, namely the abusive practice of filing lawsuits with only a faint hope that discovery might lead to some plausible cause of action.+51.0+0.0980392156863+0.516666666667+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Several years after petitioners deposited distributions from their pension plans into Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), they filed a joint petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code."+34.0+0.205882352941+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2764+03-1407+They sought to shield portions of their IRAs from their creditors by claiming them as exempt from the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.

2767+03-1407+The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, even if the Rouseys IRAs were similar plans or contracts to the plans specified in 522(d)(10)(E), their IRAs gave them no right to receive payment on account of age, but were instead savings accounts readily accessible at any time for any purpose.+48.0+0.104166666667+0.436904761905+0.077380952381+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2779+03-1407+The statutes governing IRAs persuade the Court that Jacoway is mistaken in arguing that there is no causal connection between that right and age or any other factor because the Rouseys IRAs provide a right to payment on demand.+39.0+0.102564102564+0.482142857143+0.14880952381+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

2781+03-1407+Because their accounts qualify as IRAs under 26 U. S.C. 408(a), they have a nonforfeitable right to the balance held in those accounts, 408(a)(4).+24.0+0.125+0.535714285714+0.285714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2782+03-1407+That right is restricted by a 10 percent tax penalty on any withdrawal made before age 59, 72(t).+18.0+0.0555555555556+0.535714285714+0.285714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2783+03-1407+Contrary to Jacoways contention, this 10 percent penalty is substantial.+10.0+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2784+03-1407+It applies proportionally to any amounts withdrawn and prevents access to the 10 percent that the Rouseys would forfeit should they withdraw early.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.3+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2785+03-1407+It therefore effectively prevents access to the entire balance in their IRAs and limits their right to payment of the balance.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.653571428571+0.295238095238+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2786+03-1407+And because this condition is removed when the accountholder turns age 59, the Rouseys right to the balance of their IRAs is a right to payment on account of age.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.535714285714+0.285714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2789+03-1407+To be similar, an IRA must be like, though not identical to, the listed plans or contracts, and consequently must share characteristics common to them.+25.0+0.04+0.45+-0.15+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2790+03-1407+Because the Bankruptcy Code does not define the listed plans, the Court looks to their ordinary meaning.+17.0+0.117647058824+0.5+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2792+03-1407+Dictionary definitions reveal that, although the listed plans are dissimilar to each other in some respects, their common feature is that they provide income that substitutes for wages earned as salary or hourly compensation.+34.0+0.0294117647059+0.4375+-0.2125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2793+03-1407+That the income the Rouseys will derive from their IRAs is likewise income that substitutes for wages lost upon retirement is demonstrated by the facts that (1) regulations require distribution to begin no later than the calendar year after the year the accountholder turns 70; (2) taxation of IRA money is deferred until the year in which it is distributed; (3) withdrawals before age 59 are subject to the 10 percent penalty; and (4) failure to take the requisite minimum distributions results in a 50 percent tax penalty on funds improperly remaining in the account.+95.0+0.0842105263158+0.211111111111+-0.161111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2794+03-1407+The Court rejects Jacoways argument that IRAs cannot be similar plans or contracts because the Rouseys have complete access to them.+21.0+0.285714285714+0.4+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2795+03-1407+This argument is premised on her view that the 10 percent penalty is modest, a premise with which the Court does not agree.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.9+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2796+03-1407+The Court also rejects Jacoways contention that the availability of IRA withdrawals exempt from the early withdrawal penalty renders the Rouseys IRAs more like savings accounts.+26.0+0.192307692308+0.4+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Following petitioner Johnsons 1994 guilty plea on a federal drug charge, the District Court gave him an enhanced sentence as a career offender under the federal Sentencing Guidelines based on two prior Georgia drug convictions."+42.0+0.261904761905+0.366666666667+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2807+03-9685+On appeal, Johnson argued for the first time that he should not have received an enhanced sentence because one of the predicate Georgia convictions was invalid, but the Eleventh Circuit affirmed his sentence and this Court denied certiorari.+38.0+0.0789473684211+0.333333333333+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
2808+03-9685+Two days later, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) went into effect, imposing, among other things, a 1-year statute of limitations on motions by prisoners seeking to modify their federal sentences.+35.0+0.142857142857+0.391666666667+0.158333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2809+03-9685+The 1-year period runs from the latest of four alternative dates, the last of which is the date on which the facts supporting the claim  could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence, 28 U. S.C. 2255, 6(4).+40.0+0.1+0.397916666667+0.15625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

2811+03-9685+On April 25, 1997, one year and three days after his pre-AEDPA federal conviction became final and just after the 1-year grace period expired, Johnson pro se filed a motion in the District Court for an extension of time to attack his federal sentence under 2255.+46.0+0.152173913043+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2812+03-9685+Finding the AEDPA period expired, the court denied the motion, but without prejudice to Johnsons right to file a 2255 motion claiming any alternative limitation period under the statute.+29.0+0.137931034483+0.535714285714+0.285714285714+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2813+03-9685+On February 6, 1998, Johnson filed a habeas petition in a Georgia state court, claiming the constitutional invalidity of his guilty pleas in seven cases, one of which was the basis for one of the convictions on which his federal sentence enhancement rested.+43.0+0.186046511628+1.0+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2814+03-9685+Some three months after the state court entered an order of vacatur reversing all seven convictions, Johnson filed pro se a 2255 motion to vacate his enhanced federal sentence in light of the state-court vacatur.+35.0+0.142857142857+0.7+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2815+03-9685+He claimed, in effect, that his motion was timely because the order vacating the state judgment constituted previously undiscoverable facts supporting the claim that triggered a renewed limitation period under 2255, 6(4).+32.0+0.09375+0.208333333333+0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2816+03-9685+Although Johnson asserted that lack of education excused him from acting more promptly, and that he had filed the state petition as soon as he could get help from an inmate law clerk, the District Court denied the motion as untimely.+41.0+0.0975609756098+0.25+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2817+03-9685+The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the state-court vacatur order was not a fact discovered by Johnson under the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations rule, but was more properly classified as a legal proposition or a court action obtained at Johnsons behest.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.18+0.16+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2818+03-9685+Held:In a case in which a prisoner collaterally attacks his federal sentence on the ground that a state conviction used to enhance that sentence has since been vacated, 2255, 6(4)s 1-year limitations period begins to run when the petitioner receives notice of the order vacating the prior conviction, provided that he has sought it with due diligence in state court after entry of judgment in the federal case in which the sentence was enhanced.+74.0+0.0810810810811+0.1875+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2819+03-9685+Pp.615.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2820+03-9685+(a)This Court agrees with Johnson that the state-court order vacating his prior conviction is a matter of fact supporting his 2255 claim, discovery of which triggers the refreshed 1-year limitations period under the fourth paragraph.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.0833333333333+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2821+03-9685+By pegging that period to notice of the state order eliminating the predicate required for enhancement, which is almost always necessary and always sufficient for relief, Johnsons argument improves on the Governments proposal that the relevant facts are those on which Johnson based his challenge to the validity of his state convictions.+52.0+0.134615384615+0.95+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2822+03-9685+Moreover, Johnsons argument is not vulnerable to the Eleventh Circuits point that an order vacating a conviction is legally expressive or operative language that may not be treated as a matter of fact within the statutes meaning.+37.0+0.108108108108+0.75+0.525+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2823+03-9685+This Court commonly speaks of the fact of a prior conviction, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, and an order vacating a predicate conviction is spoken of as a fact just as sensibly as the order entering it.+42.0+0.0952380952381+0.318181818182+-0.0545454545455+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2824+03-9685+In either case, a claim of such a fact is subject to proof or disproof like any other factual issue.+20.0+0.05+0.402777777778+-0.0972222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2825+03-9685+Nevertheless, Johnsons take on the statute does carry anomalies, one minor, one more serious.+14.0+0.0714285714286+0.455555555556+0.0388888888889+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2826+03-9685+It is strange to say that an order vacating a conviction has been discovered, the term used by paragraph four, and stranger still to speak about the date on which it could have been discovered with due diligence, when the fact happens to be the outcome of a proceeding in which the 2255 petitioner was the moving party.+58.0+0.0172413793103+0.2625+-0.0875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2827+03-9685+The more serious problem is Johnsons position that his 2255 petition is timely under paragraph four as long as he brings it within a year of learning he succeeded in attacking the prior conviction, no matter how long he may have slumbered before starting the successful proceeding.+47.0+0.0425531914894+0.430952380952+0.116666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2828+03-9685+Neither anomaly is serious enough, however, to justify rejecting Johnsons basic argument.+12.0+0.166666666667+0.430555555556+-0.111111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2829+03-9685+The Courts job here is to find a sensible way to apply paragraph four when AEDPAs drafters probably never thought about the present situation.+24.0+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2830+03-9685+The answer to the question of how to implement the statutory mandate that a petitioner act with due diligence in discovering the crucial fact of a vacatur order that he himself seeks is that he take prompt action as soon as he is in a position to realize that he has an interest in challenging the prior conviction with its potential to enhance the later sentence.+66.0+0.0757575757576+0.496428571429+0.0678571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2831+03-9685+The particular time when the course of the later federal prosecution clearly shows that diligence is in order is the date of judgment.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.238888888889+0.0888888888889+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2832+03-9685+After the entry of judgment, the 2255 claims subject has come into being, the significance of inaction is clear, and very little litigation would be wasted, since most challenged federal convictions are in fact sustained.+35.0+0.0571428571429+0.373333333333+-0.00208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
2833+03-9685+Thus, from the date the District Court entered judgment in his federal case, Johnson was obliged to act diligently to obtain the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.+28.0+0.178571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2834+03-9685+Had he done so, the 1-year limitation period would have run from the date he received notice of that vacatur.+20.0+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2835+03-9685+Pp.614.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2836+03-9685+(b)However, Johnson did not show due diligence in seeking the state-court order vacating his predicate conviction.+16.0+0.25+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2837+03-9685+Although he knew the conviction subjected him to the enhancement, he failed to attack it by filing his state habeas petition until more than three years after entry of judgment in the federal case.+34.0+0.0588235294118+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2838+03-9685+Indeed, even if this Court moved the burden of diligence ahead to the date of finality of the federal conviction or to AEDPAs effective date two days later, Johnson would still have delayed unreasonably, having waited over 21 months.+39.0+0.102564102564+0.4+0.3+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2839+03-9685+Johnson has offered no explanation for this delay, beyond that he was acting pro se and lacked the sophistication to understand the procedures.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2840+03-9685+But the Court has never accepted pro se representation alone or procedural ignorance as an excuse for prolonged inattention when a statutes clear policy calls for promptness.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.216666666667+0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2841+03-9685+On this record, Johnson fell far short of reasonable diligence in challenging the state conviction.+15.0+0.2+0.725+0.2+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2842+03-9685+Since there is every reason to believe that prompt action would have produced a state vacatur order well over a year before he filed his 2255 petition, the fourth paragraph of the 2255 limitations period is unavailable, and Johnson does not suggest that his motion was timely under any other provision.+51.0+0.0588235294118+0.158333333333+-0.00833333333333+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2868+03-1160+The other is the amendment to Title VII in the Civil Right Act of 1991, which modified this Courts Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.

2874+03-1160+The Citys explanation for the differential between older and younger workers was its perceived need to make junior officers salaries competitive with comparable positions in the market.+27.0+0.111111111111+0.166666666667+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, at issue in this case, has been applied by this Court only twice, in Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, and in District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462."+47.0+0.212765957447+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2897+03-1696+Noting preliminarily that the state court had acted within its jurisdiction, this Court explained that if the state-court decision was wrong, that did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding.+44.0+0.0909090909091+0.475+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2903+03-1696+Recalling Rooker, this Court observed that the District Court lacked authority to review a final judicial determination of the D.C. high court because such review can be obtained only in this Court.+32.0+0.1875+0.76+0.04+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2906+03-1696+However, concluding also that, in promulgating the bar admission Rule, the D.C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially, id., at 485486, this Court held that 28 U.

2908+03-1696+However, the lower federal courts have variously interpreted the Rooker-Feldman doctrine to extend far beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases, overriding Congress conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law under 28 U.

2913+03-1696+On interlocutory appeal, over eight months after the state-court jury verdict, the Third Circuit, on its own motion, raised the question whether subject-matter jurisdiction over the federal suit failed under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because ExxonMobils claims had already been litigated in state court.+43.0+0.162790697674+0.433333333333+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2915+03-1696+Held:The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which it acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.55+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

After petitioner Rhines state conviction for first-degree murder and burglary became final and his state habeas petition was denied, he filed a federal habeas petition."+32.0+0.21875+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2953+03-9046+Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while his state petition was pending, see 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(2), he had more than 11 months before the limitations period expired.+42.0+0.166666666667+0.65+0.55+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2954+03-9046+However, by the time the District Court ruled that eight of his claims had not been exhausted in state court, the limitations period had run.+25.0+0.12+0.7+-0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2955+03-9046+If the court had dismissed his mixed petition, Rhines would have been unable to refile after exhausting his claims, so the court decided to hold his federal petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims in state court, provided that he commenced the state proceedings within 60 days and returned to the District Court within 60 days of completing the exhaustion.+62.0+0.0806451612903+0.416666666667+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2956+03-9046+The Eighth Circuit, which had previously held that a district court has no authority to hold mixed petitions in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances, vacated the stay and remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims.+45.0+0.111111111111+0.472222222222+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2957+03-9046+Held:A district court has discretion to stay a mixed petition to allow a petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state court in the first instance and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition.+40.0+0.075+0.194444444444+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2959+03-9046+(a)Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, this Court held that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions but must give state courts the first opportunity to decide a petitioners claims; imposed a total exhaustion requirement; and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court.+58.0+0.137931034483+0.395833333333+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2961+03-9046+At the time, there was no statute of limitations on federal habeas petitions.+13.0+0.0769230769231+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2962+03-9046+But that changed with AEDPA, which preserved Lundys total exhaustion requirement while imposing a 1-year limitations period, which is tolled during the pendency of a state, but not a federal, habeas petition.+32.0+0.15625+0.75+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2963+03-9046+As a result, petitioners such as Rhines run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for federal review of their unexhausted claims.+22.0+0.0909090909091+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2964+03-9046+Even a petitioner who files early cannot control when a district court will resolve the exhaustion question.+17.0+0.117647058824+0.3+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2965+03-9046+The gravity and difficulty of this problem has led some district courts to adopt the stay-and-abeyance procedure at issue.+19.0+0.105263157895+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2967+03-9046+(b)AEDPA does not deprive district courts of the authority to issue stays that are a proper exercise of their discretion, but it does circumscribe that discretion.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2968+03-9046+Any solution to this problem therefore must be compatible with AEDPAs purposes.+12.0+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2969+03-9046+Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates AEDPAs objective of encouraging finality of state court judgments by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings, and it undermines AEDPAs goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioners incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court before filing his federal petition.+55.0+0.181818181818+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2970+03-9046+Thus, stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.+11.0+0.0+0.514285714286+0.109523809524+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2971+03-9046+Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioners failure to present his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioners failure to exhaust his claims.+41.0+0.0975609756098+0.479166666667+0.177083333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2972+03-9046+Even if good cause existed, the district court would abuse its discretion if it granted a stay when the unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.478571428571+0.242857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2973+03-9046+Where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district courts discretion is still limited by AEDPAs timeliness concerns.+17.0+0.117647058824+0.321428571429+0.214285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2974+03-9046+If a district court does not place reasonable time limits on a petitioners trip to state court and back, petitioners, especially capital petitioners, could frustrate AEDPAs finality goal by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.+36.0+0.222222222222+0.533333333333+0.0666666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2975+03-9046+And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not grant a stay at all.+22.0+0.181818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2976+03-9046+On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that he engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics.+55.0+0.0363636363636+0.5875+0.0430555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2977+03-9046+Such a petitioners interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.+23.0+0.217391304348+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
2978+03-9046+For the same reason, if the court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, it should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and proceed with the exhausted ones if dismissing the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioners right to obtain federal relief.+45.0+0.0666666666667+0.496428571429+-0.0285714285714+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

2991+02-1672+He brought this suit alleging that respondent school board (Board) had retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high schools athletic program, and that such retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.

2993+02-1672+The appeals court also concluded that, under Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.

2997+02-1672+This Court has held that Title IX implies a private right of action to enforce its prohibition on intentional sex discrimination, Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.

3001+02-1672+It is a form of discrimination because the complainant is subjected to differential treatment.+14.0+0.0714285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3002+02-1672+Moreover, it is discrimination on the basis of sex because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.2+-0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3003+02-1672+The Eleventh Circuits conclusion that Title IX does not prohibit retaliation because it is silent on the subject ignores the import of this Courts repeated holdings construing discrimination under Title IX broadly to include conduct, such as sexual harassment, which the statute does not expressly mention.+46.0+0.152173913043+0.415833333333+0.0791666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3004+02-1672+The fact that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly prohibits retaliation is of limited use with respect to Title IX.+24.0+0.125+0.142857142857+-0.0714285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3005+02-1672+Title VII is a vastly different statute, which details the conduct that constitutes prohibited discrimination.+15.0+0.133333333333+0.6+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3006+02-1672+Because Congress did not list any specific discriminatory practices in Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice says nothing about whether it intended that practice to be covered.+30.0+0.133333333333+0.308333333333+-0.105555555556+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3007+02-1672+Moreover, Congress enactment of Title IX just three years after Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229in which this Court interpreted 42 U.

3009+02-1672+(b)The Board cannot rely on this Courts holding in Sandoval, supra, at 285, that, because Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 itself prohibits only intentional discrimination, private parties could not obtain redress for disparate-impact discrimination based on the Justice Departments Title VI regulations forbidding federal funding recipients from adopting policies with such an impact.+57.0+0.122807017544+0.625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3010+02-1672+Citing the Education Departments Title IX retaliation regulation, the Board contends that Jackson, like the Sandoval petitioners, seeks an impermissible extension of the statute when he argues that Title IXs private right of action encompasses retaliation.+36.0+0.25+0.336904761905+0.128571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0

3027+02-1672+Moreover, the Board should have been put on notice that it could be held liable for retaliation by the fact that this Courts cases since Cannon have consistently interpreted Title IXs private cause of action broadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination; by Title IX itself, which expressly prohibits intentional conduct that violates clear statutory terms, Davis, 526 U. S., at 642; by the regulations implementing Title IX, which clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years; and by the holdings of all of the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue that Title IX covers retaliation.+113.0+0.12389380531+0.338020833333+0.0765625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3054+03-855+Although the Washington administration objected, later administrations made not even a pretense of interfering with New Yorks purchases, and ultimately pursued a policy designed to open reservation lands to white settlers and to remove tribes westward.+36.0+0.138888888889+0.390909090909+0.0272727272727+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3058+03-855+Although early litigation over Oneida land claims trained on monetary recompense from the United States for past deprivations, the Oneidas ultimately shifted to suits against local governments.+27.0+0.259259259259+0.3875+-0.0375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3065+03-855+These properties, once contained within the historic Oneida Reservation, were last possessed by the Oneidas as a tribal entity in 1805.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3066+03-855+In that year, the Oneida Nation transferred the parcels to one of its members, who sold the land to a non-Indian in 1807.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3067+03-855+The properties thereafter remained in non-Indian hands until OIN reacquired them in open-market transactions.+14.0+0.214285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3068+03-855+For two centuries, governance of the area in which the properties are located has been provided by the State and its county and municipal units.+25.0+0.04+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3069+03-855+According to the 2000 census, over 99% of the areas present-day population is non-Indian.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3070+03-855+Nevertheless, because the parcels lie within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the Oneidas, OIN maintained that the properties are tax exempt and accordingly refused to pay property taxes assessed by Sherrill.+34.0+0.147058823529+0.75+0.375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3072+03-855+In contrast to Oneida I and II, which involved demands for monetary compensation, OIN sought equitable relief prohibiting, currently and in the future, the imposition of property taxes.+28.0+0.214285714286+0.2625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3074+03-855+In this Court, OIN resists the payment of the property taxes on the ground that OINs acquisition of fee title to discrete parcels of historic reservation land revived the Oneidas ancient sovereignty piecemeal over each parcel, so that regulatory authority over the newly purchased properties no longer resides in Sherrill.+50.0+0.2+0.227272727273+0.0681818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3075+03-855+Held:Given the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of central New York and its inhabitants, the regulatory authority over the area constantly exercised by the State and its counties and towns for 200 years, and the Oneidas long delay in seeking judicial relief against parties other than the United States, standards of federal Indian law and federal equity practice preclude the Tribe from unilaterally reviving its ancient sovereignty, in whole or in part, over the parcels at issue.+76.0+0.131578947368+0.401609848485+-0.00482954545455+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
3076+03-855+The Oneidas long ago relinquished governmental reins and cannot regain them through open-market purchases from current titleholders.+17.0+0.176470588235+0.4+-0.025+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3078+03-855+(a)The Court rejects the theory of OIN and the United States that, because Oneida II recognized the Oneidas aboriginal title to their ancient reservation land and because the Tribe has now acquired the specific parcels at issue in the open market, it has unified fee and aboriginal title and may now assert sovereign dominion over the parcels.+57.0+0.19298245614+0.3125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3079+03-855+The Oneidas sought only money damages in Oneida II, see 470 U. S., at 229, and the Court reserved the question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present-day Oneidas, id., at 253, n.27.+37.0+0.162162162162+0.7+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3081+03-855+Here, OIN seeks declaratory and injunctive relief recognizing its present and future sovereign immunity from local taxation on parcels the Tribe purchased in the open market, properties that had been subject to state and local taxation for generations.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.159722222222+-0.0277777777778+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3082+03-855+The appropriateness of such relief must be evaluated in light of the long history of state sovereign control over the territory.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.533333333333+0.116666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3083+03-855+From the early 1800s into the 1970s, the United States largely accepted, or was indifferent to, New Yorks governance of the land in question and the validity vel non of the Oneidas sales to the State.+36.0+0.111111111111+0.394372294372+0.150216450216+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3084+03-855+Moreover, the properties here involved have greatly increased in value since the Oneidas sold them 200 years ago.+18.0+0.0555555555556+0.75+0.8+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3085+03-855+The longstanding assumption of jurisdiction by the State over an area that is predominantly non-Indian in population and land use creates justifiable expectations.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3087+03-855+Similar justifiable expectations, grounded in two centuries of New Yorks exercise of regulatory jurisdiction, until recently uncontested by OIN, merit heavy weight here.+23.0+0.217391304348+0.401136363636+-0.0159090909091+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3090+03-855+And not until the 1990s did OIN acquire the properties in question and assert its unification theory to ground its demand for exemption of the parcels from local taxation.+29.0+0.103448275862+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3091+03-855+This long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.+43.0+0.139534883721+0.466666666667+-0.0944444444444+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3093+03-855+(b)The distance from 1805 to the present day, the Oneidas long delay in seeking equitable relief against New York or its local units, and developments in Sherrill spanning several generations, evoke the doctrines of laches, acquiescence, and impossibility, and render inequitable the piecemeal shift in governance this suit seeks unilaterally to initiate.+52.0+0.134615384615+0.259090909091+-0.0689393939394+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

In the penalty phase of respondent Paytons trial following his conviction on capital murder and related charges, his counsel presented witnesses who testified that, during the one year and nine months Payton had been incarcerated since his arrest, he had made a sincere commitment to God, participated in prison Bible study and a prison ministry, and had a calming effect on other prisoners."+70.0+0.142857142857+0.275+0.065+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3128+03-1039+Although he also told them several times that, in his view, they had not heard any evidence of mitigation, he discussed Paytons evidence in considerable detail and argued that the circumstances and facts of the case, coupled with Paytons prior violent acts, outweighed the mitigating effect of Paytons religious conversion.+50.0+0.12+0.34+-0.14+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0

3132+03-1039+Applying Boyde v. California, 494 U.

3149+03-1039+The California Supreme Court read Boyde as establishing that factor (k)s text was broad enough to accommodate Paytons postcrime mitigating evidence, but the Ninth Circuit held that Boydes reasoning did not control in this case because Boyde concerned precrime, not postcrime, mitigation evidence.+43.0+0.186046511628+0.40625+0.03125+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3178+03-1423+The use of force in the form of handcuffs to detain Mena was reasonable because the governmental interest in minimizing the risk of harm to both officers and occupants, at its maximum when a warrant authorizes a search for weapons and a wanted gang member resides on the premises, outweighs the marginal intrusion.+53.0+0.0943396226415+0.6+0.2+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3210+03-1601+The District Court held that 332(c)(7)(B)(v) provided the exclusive remedy for the Citys actions and, accordingly, ordered the City to grant respondents application for a conditional-use permit, but refused respondents request for damages under 1983.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3256+03-184+Denying the requested relief, the Tax Court stated: Judge Dawson  and Special Trial Judge Couvillion agre[e] that  Judge Dawson adopted the findings of fact and opinion of  Judge Couvillion,  presumed [those] findings of fact  were correct, and  gave due regard to Judge Couvillions credibility findings.+45.0+0.266666666667+0.473214285714+0.116071428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3263+03-184+(a)Rule 183(c)s promulgation history confirms the clear understanding, from the start, that deference is due the trial judges factfindings under the [d]ue regard and presumed to be correct formulations.+29.0+0.137931034483+0.379166666667+-0.0125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3264+03-184+Under Rule 183s precursor, the Tax Courts review of the special trial judges report was a transparent process.+18.0+0.222222222222+0.571428571429+0.357142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3265+03-184+The report was served on the parties, who were authorized to file objections to it, and the regular Tax Court judge reviewed the report independently, on the basis of the record and the parties objections.+35.0+0.0571428571429+0.100961538462+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3266+03-184+Parties were therefore equipped to argue to an appellate court that the Tax Court failed to give the special trial judges findings the required measure of respect.+27.0+0.148148148148+0.435714285714+-0.0714285714286+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
3267+03-184+On adoption of the 1983 amendments, however, the Tax Court stopped acknowledging instances in which it rejected or modified special trial judge findings.+23.0+0.0869565217391+0.571428571429+0.357142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3268+03-184+Instead, it appears that the Tax Court inaugurated a novel practice whereby the special trial judges report is treated essentially as an in-house draft to be worked over collaboratively by the regular Tax Court judge and the special trial judge.+40.0+0.125+0.379945054945+0.178571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3271+03-184+Notably, the Rules provide for only one special trial judge opinion:Rule 183(b) instructs that the special trial judges report, submitted to the Chief Judge before a regular Tax Court judge is assigned to the case, shall consist of findings of fact and opinion.+43.0+0.093023255814+0.543956043956+0.242857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3272+03-184+It is the Rule 183(b) report, not some subsequently composed collaborative report, that Rule 183(c), tellingly captioned Action on the Report, instructs the Tax Court judge to review and adopt, modify, or reject.+33.0+0.0606060606061+0.075+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3273+03-184+It is difficult to comprehend how a Tax Court judge would give [d]ue regard to, and presum[e] to be correct, an opinion he himself collaborated in producing.+27.0+0.111111111111+1.0+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3276+03-184+Although the Tax Court is not without leeway in interpreting its Rules, it is unreasonable to read into Rule 183 an unprovided-for collaborative process, and to interpret the formulations due regard and presumed to be correct, to convey something other than what those same words meant prior to the 1983 rule changes.+52.0+0.0769230769231+0.21875+-0.0625+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3279+03-184+(b)The Tax Courts practice of not disclosing the special trial judges original report, and of obscuring the Tax Court judges mode of reviewing that report, impedes fully informed appellate review of the Tax Courts decision.+35.0+0.171428571429+0.660714285714+0.366071428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3280+03-184+In directing the regular judge to give due regard to the special trial judges credibility determinations and to presum[e]  correct the special trial judges factfindings, Rule 183(c) recognizes a well-founded, commonly accepted understanding: The officer who hears witnesses and sifts through evidence in the first instance will have a comprehensive view of the case that cannot be conveyed full strength by a paper record.+64.0+0.140625+0.425444793302+0.127040816327+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3282+03-184+In the present cases, for example, the Tax Courts decision repeatedly draws outcome-influencing conclusions regarding the credibility of Ballard, Kanter, and other witnesses.+23.0+0.173913043478+0.1875+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3283+03-184+Absent access to the special trial judges Rule 183(b) report in this and similar cases, the appellate court will be at a loss to determine (1) whether the credibility and other findings made in that report were accorded [d]ue regard and were presumed  correct by the Tax Court judge, or (2) whether they were displaced without adherence to those standards.+60.0+0.1+0.44880952381+0.077380952381+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
3284+03-184+The Tax Courts practice is extraordinary, for it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decisionmaking both to disclose a hearing officers initial report, see, e.g., 28 U.

3285+03-184+The Commissioner asserts a statutory analogy, however, 26 U.

3314+03-287+After parole officials determined that Dotson was not eligible for parole and that Johnson was not suitable for parole, they brought separate actions for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.

3317+03-287+Held:State prisoners may bring a 1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of state parole procedures; they need not seek relief exclusively under the federal habeas corpus statutes.+31.0+0.129032258065+0.55+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3319+03-287+(a)Ohio argues unsuccessfully that respondents claims may only be brought in federal habeas (or similar state) proceedings because a state prisoner cannot use a 1983 action to challenge the fact or duration of his confinement, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489, and respondents lawsuits, in effect, collaterally attack their confinements duration.+54.0+0.185185185185+0.5+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0
3320+03-287+That argument jumps from a true premise (that in all likelihood the prisoners hope their suits will help bring about earlier release) to a faulty conclusion (that habeas is their sole avenue for relief).+34.0+0.147058823529+0.466666666667+0.116666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3321+03-287+This Courts case law makes clear that the connection between the constitutionality of the prisoners parole proceedings and release from confinement is too tenuous here to achieve Ohios legal door-closing objective.+31.0+0.129032258065+0.227777777778+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3322+03-287+From Preiser to Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U. S. 641, this Court has developed an exception from 1983s otherwise broad scope for actions that lie within the core of habeas corpus, Preiser, supra, at 487, i.e., where a state prisoner requests present or future release.+45.0+0.2+0.184375+0.040625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3323+03-287+Section 1983 remains available for procedural challenges where success would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, but the prisoner cannot use 1983 to obtain relief where success would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.

After petitioner Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), the Government sought to increase his sentence from a 37-month maximum to the 15-year minimum that 924(e), popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), mandates for such felons who have three prior convictions for violent felonies or drug offenses."+69.0+0.159420289855+0.658333333333+-0.183333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3351+03-9168+This Court has held that only generic burglarymeaning, among other things, that it was committed in a building or enclosed spaceis a violent crime under the ACCA, Taylor v. United States, 495 U.

3352+03-9168+Refusing to consider the 15-year minimum, the District Court found that a Taylor investigation did not show that Shepard had three generic burglary convictions and rejected the Governments argument that the court should examine police reports and complaint applications in determining whether Shepards guilty pleas admitted and supported generic burglary convictions.+51.0+0.235294117647+0.3+-0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3358+03-9168+Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III, concluding that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a guilty plea to burglary under a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, to the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the defendant confirmed the factual basis for the plea, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.+82.0+0.109756097561+0.628571428571+-0.0342857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3359+03-9168+Guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses, and Taylors reasoning controls the identification of generic convictions following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with nongeneric offenses.+29.0+0.206896551724+0.366666666667+-0.166666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3360+03-9168+The ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried and pleaded cases should be regarded differently, and nothing in Taylors rationale limits it to prior jury convictions.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3363+03-9168+In cases tried without a jury, the closest analogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judges formal ruling of law and finding of fact; in pleaded cases, they would be the statement of factual basis for the charge shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.+72.0+0.0972222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3366+03-9168+The Governments arguments for a wider evidentiary cast that includes documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges amount to a call to ease away from Taylors conclusion that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require confining generic conviction evidence to the convicting courts records approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a generic crime State.+62.0+0.145161290323+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3367+03-9168+That was the heart of the Taylor decision, and there is no justification for upsetting that precedent where the Court is dealing with statutory interpretation and where Congress has not, in the nearly 15 years since Taylor, taken any action to modify the statute.+44.0+0.0909090909091+0.25+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3369+03-9168+Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part III that the rule in the Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n.6, and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, line of casesthat any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, absent a waiver by the defendantis also relevant to ACCA sentencing.+77.0+0.155844155844+0.545909090909+0.0822727272727+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3370+03-9168+In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to show a generic crime is not established by the record of conviction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224.+51.0+0.0980392156863+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3371+03-9168+Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Governments view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the prior pleas factual basis, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jurys standing between a defendant and the power of the State, and they guarantee a jurys finding of any disputed fact essential to increase a potential sentences ceiling.+80.0+0.1+0.433333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3372+03-9168+The disputed fact here is too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.+40.0+0.15+0.383333333333+0.0466666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
3373+03-9168+The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels the Court to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea.+31.0+0.0645161290323+0.222222222222+-0.111111111111+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3392+03-1395+The District Court denied the Governments motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, finding that respondents claims were not barred by the rule of Totten v. United States, 92 U.

3393+03-1395+Affirming in relevant part, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that Totten posed no bar to reviewing some of respondents claims and thus the case could proceed to trial, subject to the Governments asserting the evidentiary state secrets privilege and the District Courts resolving that issue.+44.0+0.136363636364+0.616666666667+0.116666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3395+03-1395+In Totten, this Court concluded with no difficulty that the President had the authority to bind the United States to contracts with secret agents, observed that the very essence of such a contract was that it was secret and had to remain so, and found that allowing a former spy to bring suit to enforce such a contract would be entirely incompatible with the contracts nature.+66.0+0.0454545454545+0.475+-0.0857142857143+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3401+03-1395+The Ninth Circuit also claimed that Totten had been recast simply as an early expression of the evidentiary state secrets privilege, rather than a categorical bar to respondents claims, relying mainly on United States v.

The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Act) authorizes the Government and Indian tribes to enter into contracts in which tribes promise to supply federally funded services that a Government agency normally would provide, 25 U. S.C. 450(f); and requires the Government to pay, inter alia, a tribes contract support costs, which are reasonable costs that a federal agency would not have incurred, but which the tribe would incur in managing the program, 450j1(a)(2)."+81.0+0.135802469136+0.625+0.175+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3432+02-1472+Held:The Government is legally bound to pay the contract support costs at issue.+13.0+0.0769230769231+0.2+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3434+02-1472+(a)The Government argues that it is legally bound by its promises to pay the relevant costs only if Congress appropriated sufficient funds, which the Government contends Congress did not do in this instance.+33.0+0.181818181818+0.7+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0
3435+02-1472+It does not deny that it promised, but failed, to pay the costs; that, were these ordinary procurement contracts, its promises to pay would be legally binding; that each year Congress appropriated more than the amounts at issue; that those appropriations Acts had no relevant statutory restrictions; that where Congress makes such appropriations, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions; and that as long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay contracts, as it did here, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on grounds of insufficient appropriations.+102.0+0.0882352941176+0.394444444444+0.0291666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3436+02-1472+Thus, in order to show that its promises were not legally binding, the Government must show something special about the promises at issue.+23.0+0.0+0.385714285714+0.128571428571+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3439+02-1472+(b)The Act does not support the Governments initial argument that, because the Act creates a special contract with a unique nature differentiating it from standard Government procurement contracts, a tribe should bear the risk that a lump-sum appropriation will be insufficient to pay its contract.+45.0+0.133333333333+0.392857142857+0.183035714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0
3440+02-1472+In general, the Acts language runs counter to this view, strongly suggesting instead that Congress, in respect to a promises binding nature, meant to treat alike promises made under the Act and ordinary contractual promises.+35.0+0.0857142857143+0.577777777778+0.0777777777778+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3441+02-1472+The Act uses contract 426 times to describe the nature of the Governments promise, and contract normally refers to a promise  for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law  recognizes as a duty, Restatement (Second) of Contracts 1.+47.0+0.063829787234+0.325+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3442+02-1472+Payment of contract support costs is described in a provision containing a sample Contract, 25 U.

3444+02-1472+The Government points to the statement that tribes need not spend funds in excess of the amount of funds awarded, 450l(c), but that kind of statement often appears in procurement contracts; and the statement that no [self-determination] contract  shall be construed to be a procurement contract, 450b(j), in context, seems designed to relieve tribes and the Government of technical burdens that may accompany procurement, not to weaken a contracts binding nature.+71.0+0.0985915492958+0.5+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3447+02-1472+One phrasethe Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe, 450j1(b)did not make the Governments promise nonbinding, since the relevant appropriations contained unrestricted funds sufficient to pay the claims at issue.+45.0+0.0444444444444+0.65+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3448+02-1472+When this happens in an ordinary procurement contract case, the Government admits that the contractor is entitled to payment even if the agency has allocated the funds to another purpose.+30.0+0.0666666666667+0.5+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3449+02-1472+That the Government used the unrestricted funds to satisfy important needse.g., the cost of running the Indian Health Servicedoes not matter, for there is nothing special in the Acts language or the contracts to convince the Court that anything but the ordinary rule applies here.+45.0+0.111111111111+0.690476190476+0.169047619048+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3450+02-1472+The other proviso phrasewhich subjects the Governments provision of funds under the Act to the availability of appropriations, ibid.also fails to help the Government.+24.0+0.0833333333333+0.3375+-0.3125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3451+02-1472+Congress appropriated adequate unrestricted funds here, and the Government provides no convincing argument for a special, rather than ordinary, interpretation of the phrase.+23.0+0.0+0.60119047619+0.047619047619+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3452+02-1472+Legislative history shows only that Executive Branch officials wanted discretionary authority to allocate a lump-sum appropriation too small to pay for all contracts, not that Congress granted such authority.+29.0+0.206896551724+0.633333333333+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3453+02-1472+And other statutory provisions, e.g., 450j1(c)(2), to which the Government points, do not provide sufficient support.+16.0+0.1875+0.375+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3455+02-1472+(d)Finally, the Government points to 314 of the later-enacted 1999 Appropriations Act, which states that amounts earmarked in committee reports for the  Indian Health Service  [for] payments to tribes  for contract support costs  are the total amounts available for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for such purposes.+47.0+0.170212765957+0.55+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3456+02-1472+The Court rejects the Governments claims that this statute merely clarifies earlier ambiguous appropriations language that was wrongly read as unrestricted.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.633333333333+-0.333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3457+02-1472+Earlier appropriations statutes were not ambiguous, and restrictive language in Committee Reports is not legally binding.+16.0+0.1875+0.35+-0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3458+02-1472+Because no other restrictive language exists, the earlier statutes unambiguously provided unrestricted lump-sum appropriations.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.4375+0.03125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3459+02-1472+Nor should 314 be interpreted to retroactively bar payment of claims arising under 1994 through 1997 contracts.+17.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3460+02-1472+That would raise serious constitutional issues by undoing binding governmental contractual obligations.+12.0+0.166666666667+0.666666666667+-0.333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3461+02-1472+Thus, the Court adopts the interpretation that Congress intended to forbid the Indian Health Service to use unspent appropriated funds to pay unpaid contract support costs.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.4+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3505+03-633+(1)As in Atkins, the objective indicia of national consensus herethe rejection of the juvenile death penalty in the majority of States; the infrequency of its use even where it remains on the books; and the consistency in the trend toward abolition of the practiceprovide sufficient evidence that today society views juveniles, in the words Atkins used respecting the mentally retarded, as categorically less culpable than the average criminal, 536 U. S., at 316.+73.0+0.0958904109589+0.361111111111+-0.294444444444+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3506+03-633+The evidence of such consensus is similar, and in some respects parallel, to the evidence in Atkins:30 States prohibit the juvenile death penalty, including 12 that have rejected it altogether and 18 that maintain it but, by express provision or judicial interpretation, exclude juveniles from its reach.+47.0+0.106382978723+0.2875+-0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3507+03-633+Moreover, even in the 20 States without a formal prohibition, the execution of juveniles is infrequent.+16.0+0.0625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3508+03-633+Although, by contrast to Atkins, the rate of change in reducing the incidence of the juvenile death penalty, or in taking specific steps to abolish it, has been less dramatic, the difference between this case and Atkins in that respect is counterbalanced by the consistent direction of the change toward abolition.+51.0+0.0980392156863+0.258333333333+-0.12+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3509+03-633+Indeed, the slower pace here may be explained by the simple fact that the impropriety of executing juveniles between 16 and 18 years old gained wide recognition earlier than the impropriety of executing the mentally retarded.+36.0+0.0277777777778+0.451428571429+-0.16+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

3524+03-633+Although the Court cannot deny or overlook the brutal crimes too many juvenile offenders have committed, it disagrees with petitioners contention that, given the Courts own insistence on individualized consideration in capital sentencing, it is arbitrary and unnecessary to adopt a categorical rule barring imposition of the death penalty on an offender under 18.+54.0+0.12962962963+0.708333333333+-0.0875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3525+03-633+An unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of course, even where the juvenile offenders objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death.+47.0+0.0851063829787+0.28+0.02+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3579+03-636+Rather, it explicitly reaffirms that the necessities of prison security and discipline, Lee, supra, at 334, are a compelling government interest justifying only those uses of race that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities, see, e.g., Grutter v.

3580+03-636+Because Turners standard would allow prison officials to use race-based policies even when there are race-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the race-based policy does not in practice advance that goal, it is too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race.+48.0+0.0625+0.25625+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0

3638+03-814+That a vessel must be in navigation, Chandris, supra, at 373374, means not that a structures locomotion at any given moment matters, but that structures may lose their character as vessels if withdrawn from the water for an extended period.+40.0+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3701+03-892+Second, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004which amended the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer, in computing adjusted gross income, to deduct attorneys fees such as those at issuedoes not apply here because it was passed after these cases arose and is not retroactive.+46.0+0.108695652174+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3704+03-892+Under the anticipatory assignment of income doctrine, a taxpayer cannot exclude an economic gain from gross income by assigning the gain in advance to another party, e.g., Lucas v.

3705+03-892+The doctrine is meant to prevent taxpayers from avoiding taxation through arrangements and contracts devised to prevent income from vesting in the one who earned it.+26.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3707+03-892+Because the rule is preventative and motivated by administrative and substantive concerns, this Court does not inquire whether any particular assignment has a discernible tax avoidance purpose.+27.0+0.0740740740741+0.333333333333+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3709+03-892+(c)The Court agrees with the Commissioner that a contingent-fee agreement should be viewed as an anticipatory assignment to the attorney of a portion of the clients income from any litigation recovery.+31.0+0.161290322581+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3710+03-892+In an ordinary case attribution of income is resolved by asking whether a taxpayer exercises complete dominion over the income in question.+22.0+0.136363636364+0.45+-0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3711+03-892+However, in the context of anticipatory assignments, where the assignor may not have dominion over the income at the moment of receipt, the question is whether the assignor retains dominion over the income-generating asset.+34.0+0.0294117647059+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3712+03-892+Looking to such control preserves the principle that income should be taxed to the party who earns the income and enjoys the consequent benefits.+24.0+0.125+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3713+03-892+In the case of a litigation recovery the income-generating asset is the cause of action derived from the plaintiffs legal injury.+21.0+0.0952380952381+0.15+0.15+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

3716+03-892+The legal claims value may be speculative at the moment of the assignment, but the anticipatory assignment doctrine is not limited to instances when the precise dollar value of the assigned income is known in advance.+36.0+0.0833333333333+0.380952380952+0.211904761905+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3717+03-892+In these cases, the taxpayer retained control over the asset, diverted some of the income produced to another party, and realized a benefit by doing so.+26.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3718+03-892+Also rejected is respondents suggestion that the attorney-client relationship be treated as a sort of business partnership or joint venture for tax purposes.+23.0+0.217391304348+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
3719+03-892+In fact, that relationship is a quintessential principal-agent relationship, for the client retains ultimate dominion and control over the underlying claim.+21.0+0.0952380952381+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

4023+03-674+Petitioner filed a habeas petition to challenge the designation, claiming that Somalia had no functioning government and thus could not consent in advance to his removal, and that the Government was barred from removing him there absent such advance consent.+40.0+0.1+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4024+03-674+The District Court agreed, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv) does not require advance acceptance by the destination country.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4025+03-674+Held:Section 1231(b)(2)(E)(iv) permits an alien to be removed to a country without the advance consent of that countrys government.+19.0+0.0526315789474+0.75+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4027+03-674+(a)Section 1231(b)(2) provides four consecutive removal commands: (1) An alien shall be removed to the country of his choice (subparagraphs (A) to (C)), unless a condition eliminating that command is satisfied; (2) otherwise he shall be removed to the country of which he is a citizen (subparagraph (D)), unless a condition eliminating that command is satisfied; (3) otherwise he shall be removed to a country with which he has a lesser connection (subparagraph (E), clauses (i) to (vi), including the country of his birth (clause iv)); or (4) if that is impracticable, inadvisable or impossible, he shall be removed to another country whose government will accept him (subparagraph (E), clause (vii)).+111.0+0.027027027027+0.875+-0.111111111111+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4028+03-674+Here, the question is whether the Attorney General was precluded from removing petitioner to Somalia under subparagraph (E), clause (iv), because Somalia had not consented.+25.0+0.08+0.5+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4029+03-674+Pp.26.+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4030+03-674+(b)In all of subparagraph (E), an acceptance requirement appears only in clause (vii), the fourth step of the process, which the Attorney General may invoke only after finding the third step impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.+35.0+0.0285714285714+0.583333333333+-0.102777777778+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4031+03-674+Clauses (i) through (vi) contain not a word about acceptance by the destination country.+14.0+0.142857142857+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4032+03-674+Including the word another in clause (vii) does not import the acceptance requirement into clauses (i)(vi).+16.0+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4033+03-674+Such a reading stretches the modifier too far, contrary to the grammatical rule of the last antecedent, Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26.+25.0+0.2+0.522222222222+0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4034+03-674+Subparagraph (E)s structure does not refute the inference derived from the last-antecedent rule.+13.0+0.230769230769+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4036+03-674+(c)Nor is an acceptance requirement manifest in 1231(b)(2)s structure.+9.0+0.222222222222+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4037+03-674+First, the overlap between subparagraphs (D) and (E) is not so complete as to justify imposing an acceptance requirement at the third step in the name of preventing the Attorney General from circumventing the second step.+36.0+0.0277777777778+0.246666666667+0.08+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4038+03-674+Second, the statute expressly countenances removal to a country notwithstanding its objections.+12.0+0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4039+03-674+Subparagraph (C) provides that at the first step of the country-selection process, the Attorney General may refrain from removing an alien to the country of his choice if that country does not accept the alien; the Attorney General thus has discretion to override any lack of acceptance.+47.0+0.0425531914894+0.566666666667+-0.03+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4040+03-674+Finally, the existence of an acceptance requirement at the fourth step does not imply that such a requirement must exist at the third.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4041+03-674+To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congress has not clearly set it forth would run counter to this Courts customary policy of deference to the President in foreign affairs, and would not be necessary to ensure appropriate consideration to conditions in the country of removal, since aliens facing persecution or other mistreatment have a number of available remedies.+60.0+0.116666666667+0.52619047619+0.114285714286+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4043+03-674+(d)Contrary to petitioners argument, the acceptance requirement is neither settled judicial construction nor one which [the Court] would be justified in presuming Congress, by its silence, impliedly approved, United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 55, n.13, in its most recent reenactment of 1231(b)(2).+45.0+0.2+0.55+0.3+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

If an alien is found inadmissible and ordered removed, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) ordinarily must remove the alien from the country within 90 days."+33.0+0.0909090909091+0.666666666667+-0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4058+03-878+037434, Cuban nationals who are both inadmissible under 1182, were ordered removed, but were detained beyond the 90-day removal period.+20.0+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4064+03-878+"Held:

4065+03-878+Section 1231(a)(6)s operative language, may be detained beyond the removal period, applies equally to all aliens that are its subject, whether or not those aliens have been admitted to the country.+31.0+0.0645161290323+0.291666666667+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4066+03-878+In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, this Court interpreted 1231(a)(6) to authorize the detention of aliens who have been admitted to the country only as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate their removal.+35.0+0.0857142857143+0.8+-0.0166666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4069+03-878+Even if the statutory purpose and constitutional concerns influencing the Zadvydas construction are not present for inadmissible aliens, that cannot justify giving the same statutory text a different meaning depending on the characteristics of the aliens involved.+37.0+0.135135135135+0.241666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4072+03-878+Moreover, contrary to the Governments argument, nothing in Zadvydas indicates that 1231(a)(6) authorizes detention until it approaches constitutional limits.+19.0+0.210526315789+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4077+03-878+In Zadvydas, the Court further held that the presumptive period during which an aliens detention is reasonably necessary to effectuate removal is six months, and that he must be conditionally released after that time if he can demonstrate that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.+51.0+0.117647058824+0.62+0.0025+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4079+03-878+The Government having suggested no reason that the time reasonably necessary for removal is longer for an inadmissible alien, this same 6-month presumptive detention period applies in these cases.+29.0+0.0689655172414+0.625+-0.0833333333333+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4080+03-878+Because both Martinez and Benitez were detained well beyond six months after their removal orders became final, the Government has brought forward nothing to indicate that a substantial likelihood of removal subsists, and the District Court in each case has determined that removal to Cuba is not reasonably foreseeable, the habeas petitions should have been granted.+56.0+0.142857142857+0.8+-0.05+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4113+04-104+(a)In addressing Washington States determinate sentencing scheme, the Blakely Court found that Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227; Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466; and Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, made clear that the statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.+70.0+0.185714285714+0.418939393939+0.118181818182+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

4115+04-104+As Blakelys dissenting opinions recognized, there is no constitutionally significant distinction between the Guidelines and the Washington procedure at issue in that case.+23.0+0.173913043478+0.875+0.375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4116+04-104+This conclusion rests on the premise, common to both systems, that the relevant sentencing rules are mandatory and impose binding requirements on all sentencing judges.+25.0+0.04+0.7+0.05+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4117+04-104+Were the Guidelines merely advisoryrecommending, but not requiring, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of factstheir use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.+27.0+0.185185185185+0.416666666667+-0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

4120+04-104+3553(b) directs that a court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range established by the Guidelines, subject to departures in specific, limited cases.+27.0+0.037037037037+0.375297619048+0.0904761904762+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4121+04-104+Because they are binding on all on judges, this Court has consistently held that the Guidelines have the force and effect of laws.+23.0+0.0434782608696+0.25+0.25+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4122+04-104+Further, the availability of a departure where the judge finds  an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described, 3553(b)(1), does not avoid the constitutional issue.+52.0+0.0384615384615+0.583333333333+0.108333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4123+04-104+Departures are unavailable in most cases because the Commission will have adequately taken all relevant factors into account, and no departure will be legally permissible.+25.0+0.08+0.483333333333+0.358333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
4124+04-104+In those instances, the judge is legally bound to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range.+16.0+0.0625+0.2+0.2+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4125+04-104+Bookers case illustrates this point.+5.0+0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4126+04-104+The jury found him guilty of possessing at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, based on evidence that he had 92.5 grams.+22.0+0.0+0.7+-0.4+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4127+04-104+Under those facts, the Guidelines required a possible 210-to-262-month sentence.+10.0+0.2+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
4128+04-104+To reach Bookers actual sentencewhich was almost 10 years longerthe judge found that he possessed an additional 566 grams of crack.+21.0+0.142857142857+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4129+04-104+Although, the jury never heard any such evidence, the judge found it to be true by a preponderance of the evidence.+21.0+0.047619047619+0.575+0.175+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4130+04-104+Thus, as in Blakely, the jurys verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.+13.0+0.153846153846+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4131+04-104+The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.+11.0+0.181818181818+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

4133+04-104+Finally, because there were no factors the Sentencing Commission failed to adequately consider, the judge was required to impose a sentence within the higher Guidelines range.+26.0+0.0769230769231+0.533333333333+0.0208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0

4136+04-104+The fact that the Guidelines are promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, rather than Congress, is constitutionally irrelevant.+17.0+0.176470588235+1.0+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
4137+04-104+The Court has not previously considered the question, but the same Sixth Amendment principles apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.+19.0+0.105263157895+0.145833333333+0.0416666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4138+04-104+Further, the Courts pre-Apprendi cases considering the Guidelines are inapplicable, as they did not consider the application of Apprendi to the Sentencing Guidelines.+23.0+0.217391304348+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4140+04-104+In Mistretta the Court concluded that even though the Commission performed political rather than adjudicatory functions, Congress did not exceed constitutional limitations in creating the Commission.+26.0+0.153846153846+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4145+04-104+3553(b)(1), which makes the Federal Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, is incompatible with todays Sixth Amendment jury trial holding and therefore must be severed and excised from the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act).+32.0+0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4147+04-104+So modified, the Act makes the Guidelines effectively advisory, requiring a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 3553(a)(4), but permitting it to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns, see 3553(a).+34.0+0.0588235294118+0.625+0.291666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4152+04-104+Here, the Court must decide which of two approaches is the more compatible with Congress intent as embodied in the Act: (1) retaining the Act (and the Guidelines) as written, with todays Sixth Amendment requirement engrafted onto it; or (2) eliminating some of the Acts provisions.+46.0+0.0869565217391+0.75+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4153+04-104+Evaluation of the constitutional requirements consequences in light of the Acts language, history, and basic purposes demonstrates that the requirement is not compatible with the Act as written and that some severance (and excision) is necessary.+36.0+0.111111111111+0.608333333333+0.133333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4154+04-104+Congress would likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the constitutional requirement engrafted onto it, but would likely have preferred the excision of the Acts mandatory language to the invalidation of the entire Act.+40.0+0.125+0.84375+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4156+04-104+(b)Several considerations demonstrate that adding the Courts constitutional requirement onto the Act as currently written would so transform the statutory scheme that Congress likely would not have intended the Act as so modified to stand.+35.0+0.114285714286+0.7+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4157+04-104+First, references to [t]he court in 3553(a)(1)which  requires [t]he court when sentencing to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendantand references to the judge in the Acts history must be read in context to mean the judge without the jury, not the judge working together with the jury.+57.0+0.0701754385965+0.510416666667+-0.03125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4158+04-104+That is made clear by 3661, which removes typical jury trial limitations on the information concerning the offender that the sentencing court  may receive.+24.0+0.0416666666667+0.441666666667+-0.0333333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4159+04-104+Second, Congress basic statutory goal of diminishing sentencing disparity depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the real conduct underlying the crime of conviction.+31.0+0.161290322581+0.285+-0.06+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4160+04-104+In looking to real conduct, federal sentencing judges have long relied upon a probation officers presentence report, which is often unavailable until after the trial.+25.0+0.08+0.35+0.075+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4161+04-104+To engraft the Courts constitutional requirement onto the Act would destroy the system by preventing a sentencing judge from relying upon a presentence report for relevant factual information uncovered after the trial.+32.0+0.125+0.45+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
4162+04-104+Third, the Act, read to include todays constitutional requirement, would create a system far more complex than Congress could have intended, thereby greatly complicating the tasks of the prosecution, defense, judge, and jury.+33.0+0.0606060606061+0.53+0.22+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4163+04-104+Fourth, plea bargaining would not significantly diminish the consequences of the Courts constitutional holding for the operation of the Guidelines, but would make matters worse, leading to sentences that gave greater weight not to real conduct, but rather to counsels skill, the prosecutors policies, the caseload, and other factors that vary from place to place, defendant to defendant, and crime to crime.+62.0+0.112903225806+0.441666666667+-0.00208333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0
4164+04-104+Fifth, Congress would not have enacted sentencing statutes that make it more difficult to adjust sentences upward than to adjust them downward, yet that is what the engrafted system would create.+31.0+0.0322580645161+0.75+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4165+04-104+For all these reasons, the Act cannot remain valid in its entirety.+12.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4169+04-104+In order not to invalidat[e] more of the statute than is necessary, Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 652, the Court must retain those portions of the Act that are (1) constitutionally valid, ibid., (2) capable of functioning independently, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U. S. 678, 684, and (3) consistent with Congress basic objectives in enacting the statute, Regan, supra, at 653.+66.0+0.151515151515+0.4+0.158333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4170+04-104+Application of these criteria demonstrates that only 3553(b)(1), which requires sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range (absent circumstances justifying a departure), and 3742(e), which provides for de novo review on appeal of departures, must be severed and excised.+43.0+0.116279069767+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4171+04-104+With these two sections severed (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated), the rest of the Act satisfies the Courts constitutional requirement and falls outside the scope of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466.+38.0+0.184210526316+0.252272727273+0.0681818181818+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4172+04-104+The Act still requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals, see 3553(a)(4); to consider the Guidelines sentencing range established for  the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant, pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and to restitute victims, 3553(a)(1), (3)(7); and to impose sentences that reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and effectively provide the defendant with needed training and medical care, 3553(a)(2).+94.0+0.106382978723+0.315+0.161666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4173+04-104+Moreover, despite 3553(b)(1)s absence, the Act continues to provide for appeals from sentencing decisions (irrespective of whether the trial judge sentences within or outside the Guidelines range).+27.0+0.111111111111+0.025+-0.00625+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4178+04-104+Here, these factors and the past two decades of appellate practice in cases involving departures from the Guidelines imply a familiar and practical standard of review: review for unreasonable[ness].+29.0+0.137931034483+0.25+0.0416666666667+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+1.0+1.0+0.0

4180+04-104+Finally, the Act without its mandatory provision and related language remains consistent with Congress intent to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities  [and] maintai[n] sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted, 28 U.

4181+04-104+Thus, it is more consistent with Congress likely intent (1) to preserve the Acts important pre-existing elements while severing and excising 3553(b) and 3742(e) than (2) to maintain all of the Acts provisions and engraft todays constitutional requirement onto the statutory scheme.+42.0+0.142857142857+0.6875+0.2875+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

Petitioners were convicted of conspiracy to launder money in violation of 18 U.

4212+03-1293+(a)Section 1956(h) provides: Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in [1956] or section 1957 shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.+40.0+0.0+0.229166666667+-0.0833333333333+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4213+03-1293+In United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, this Court held that the nearly identical language of the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U. S.C. 846, does not require proof of an over act.+34.0+0.147058823529+0.4+0.1+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4214+03-1293+The Shabani Court found instructive the distinction between 846 and the general conspiracy statute, 18 U. S.C. 371, which supersedes the common law rule by expressly including an overt-act requirement.+30.0+0.166666666667+0.5+-0.125+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4215+03-1293+Shabani distilled the governing rule for conspiracy statutes: Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, and Singer v. United States, 323 U. S. 338, give Congress a formulary:by choosing a text modeled on 371, it gets an overt-act requirement; by choosing a text modeled on the Sherman Act, 15 U. S.C. 1 [which, like 21 U. S.C. 846, omits any express overt-act requirement], it dispenses with such a requirement.+70.0+0.171428571429+0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4217+03-1293+This rule dictates the outcome here as well:  Because 1956(h)s text does not expressly make the commission of an overt act an element of the conspiracy offense, the Government need not prove an overt act to obtain a conviction.+39.0+0.153846153846+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4220+03-1293+(b)Petitioners argument that Shabani is inapplicable because 1956(h) does not establish a new conspiracy offense, but merely increases the penalty for conviction of a money laundering conspiracy under 371, is untenable for two reasons: Section 1956(h)s text is sufficient to establish an offense and fails to provide any cross-reference to 371.+51.0+0.078431372549+0.418181818182+-0.287878787879+1.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4222+03-1293+Because 1956(h)s text is plain and unambiguous, the Court need not consider petitioners argument that the provisions legislative history supports their construction by virtue of its failure to indicate that Congress meant to create a new offense or to eliminate 371s overt-act requirement for money laundering conspiracies.+47.0+0.148936170213+0.370562770563+-0.13152958153+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4223+03-1293+In any event, mere silence in the legislative history cannot justify reading an overt-act requirement into 1956(h).+17.0+0.176470588235+0.5+-0.5+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0

4225+03-1293+Petitioners legislative history argument is particularly inapt here because Congress is presumed to have had knowledge of Nash and Singer when it enacted 1956(h).+24.0+0.208333333333+0.333333333333+0.166666666667+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
4226+03-1293+Petitioners arguments as to 1956s text and structure as a whole(1) that had Congress intended 1956(h) to create a new conspiracy offense, it would have placed that offense with the three substantive money laundering offenses set forth in 1956(a); and (2) that by providing that [a] prosecution for [a money laundering] conspiracy offense  may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed offense under [1956(i)(1)], or in any other district where an act in furtherance of the  conspiracy took place, 1956(i)(2), Congress confirmed that proof of an overt act was required under 1956(h)are not persuasive.+99.0+0.0909090909091+0.609848484848+0.137121212121+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0+0.0
