certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 05669.Argued October 4, 2006Decided December 11, 2006
After the Interior Departments Minerals Management Service (MMS) issued administrative orders assessing petitioners for royalty underpayments on gas leases they held on Government lands, petitioners filed an administrative appeal, contending, inter alia, that the proceedings were barred by 28 U. S.C. 2415(a), which provides in relevant part: [E]very action for money damages brought by the United States or an  agency thereof which is founded upon any contract  , shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues or within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings. (Emphasis added.)  The Assistant Secretary of the Interior denied the appeals, ruling that 2415(a) did not govern the administrative order.  The District Court agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  
Held:Section 2415(a)s 6-year statute of limitations applies only to court actions, not to the administrative payment orders involved in this case.  Pp.516. 
(a)Unless otherwise defined, statutory terms are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning.  Read in this way, 2415(a)s text is quite clear:Its key termsaction and complaintare ordinarily used in connection with judicial, not administrative, proceedings.  See, e.g., Unexcelled Chem. Corp. v. United States, 345 U. S. 59, 66.  The phrase action for money damages reinforces this reading because the term damages is generally used to mean pecuniary compensation or indemnity recovered in court.  Moreover, the fact that 2415(a) distinguishes between judicial and administrative proceedings by providing that an action must commence within one year after final decisions have been rendered in applicable administrative proceedings shows that Congress knew how to identify administrative proceedings and manifestly had two separate concepts in mind when it enacted 2415(a).  Pp.56.


(b)Petitioners assertion that 2415(a)s term action is commonly used to refer to administrative, as well as judicial, proceedings, is not persuasive.  The numerous statutes and regulations cited to document this supposed usage actually undermine petitioners argument, since none of them uses the term action standing alone to refer to administrative proceedings.  Rather, each includes a modifier, referring to an administrative action, a civil or administrative action, or administrative enforcement actions.  Section 2415(a)s references to every action for money damages founded upon any contract (emphasis added) do not assist petitioners, as they do not broaden the ordinary meaning of the key term action.  Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens Council for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, and West v. Gibson, 527 U. S. 212, distinguished.  Pp.69.


(c)Petitioners suggestion that an MMS payment order constitutes a complaint under 2415(a) is also rejected.  Their examples of statutes and regulations employing the term complaint in the administrative context are unavailing, since such occasional usage of the term does not alter its primary meaning, which concerns the initiation of a civil action.  Moreover, an MMS payment order lacks the essential attributes of a complaint, which is a filing that commences a proceeding that may result in a legally binding order providing relief.  In contrast, an MMS order in and of itself imposes a legal obligation on the party to which it is issued.  Given that the failure to comply with such an order can result in fines of up to $10,000 a day, see 30 U. S.C. 1719(c), the order plays an entirely different role from that of a complaint.  Pp.910.


(d)Any remaining doubts are erased by the canon that statutes of limitations are construed narrowly against the government.  This canon is rooted in the traditional rule that time does not run against the King.  A corollary of this rule is that a sovereign that elects to subject itself to a statute of limitations is given the benefit of the doubt if the statutes scope is ambiguous.  Bowers v. New York & Albany Lighterage Co., 273 U. S. 346, distinguished.  Pp.1011.


(e)The Court disagrees with petitioners argument that interpreting 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions renders 2415(i)which specifies that [t]he provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States  from collecting any claim  by means of administrative offsetsuperfluous in contravention of the canon against reading a statute in a way that makes part of it redundant.  Under the Courts interpretation, 2415(i) is not mere surplusage, but clarifies that administrative offsets are not covered by 2415(a) even if they are viewed as an adjunct of a court action.  To accept petitioners argument, on the other hand, the Court would have to hold either that 2415(a) applied to administrative actions when it was enacted in 1966 or that it was extended to reach administrative actions when 2415(i) was added in 1982.  The clear meaning of 2415(a)s text, which has not been amended, refutes the first of these propositions, and accepting the latter would require the unrealistic conclusion that in 1982 Congress proceeded to enlarge 2415 to cover administrative proceedings by the oblique and cryptic route of inserting text expressly excluding a single administrative vehicle from the statutes reach.  Pp.1114.


(f)Although interpreting 2415(a) as applying only to judicial actions may result in certain peculiarities, petitioners alternative interpretation would itself result in disharmony.  For instance, MMS oil and gas lease payment orders are now prospectively subject to a 7-year statute of limitations except with respect to obligations arising out of leases of Indian land.  30 U. S.C. 1724(b)(1).  Given the exhortation that the Interior Secretary aggressively carry out his trust responsibility in the administration of Indian oil and gas, 1701(a)(4), it seems unlikely that Congress intended to impose a shorter, 6-year statute of limitations for payment orders regarding Indian lands.  Finally, while cogent, petitioners policy arguments as to why limiting 2415(a) to judicial actions frustrates the statutes purposes must be viewed in perspective.  For example, because there are always policy arguments against affording the sovereign special treatment, the relevant inquiry in a case like this is simply how far Congress meant to go when it enacted the statute of limitations in question.  Prior to 2415(a)s enactment, Government contract actions were not subject to any statute of limitations.  See Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U. S. 126, 132.  Absent congressional action changing this rule, it remains the law, and 2415(a) betrays no intent to change the rule as it applies to administrative proceedings.  Pp.1416.
410 F.3d 722, affirmed.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Roberts, C.J., and Breyer, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

05-785|"CAREY, WARDEN v. MUSLADIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05785.Argued October 11, 2006Decided December 11, 2006
At respondent Musladins murder trial, members of the victims family sat in the front row of the spectators gallery wearing buttons displaying the victims image.  The trial court denied Musladins motion to order the family members not to wear the buttons.  The California Court of Appeal upheld Musladins conviction, stating that he had to show actual or inherent prejudice to succeed on the buttons claim; citing Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560, as providing the test for inherent prejudice; and ruling that he had not satisfied that test.  The Federal District Court denied Musladins habeas petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1), as determined by this Court in Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S. 501, and Flynn, supra.
Held:The Ninth Circuit improperly concluded that the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by this Court.  Pp. 37.
(a)Because clearly established Federal law in 2254(d)(1) refers to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Courts decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision, Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412, federal habeas relief may be granted here if the California Court of Appeals decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of this Courts applicable holdings.  Pp. 34.


(b)This Court addressed the effect of courtroom practices on defendants fair-trial rights in Williams, in which the State compelled the defendant to stand trial in prison clothes, and Flynn, in which the State seated uniformed state troopers in the row of spectators seats immediately behind the defendant at trial.  In both cases, which dealt with government-sponsored practices, the Court noted that some practices are so inherently prejudicial that they must be justified by an essential state policy or interest.   E.g., Williams, supra, at 505.  Pp. 45.


(c)In contrast to state-sponsored courtroom practices, the effect on a defendants fair-trial rights of the spectator conduct to which Musladin objects is an open question in this Courts jurisprudence.  The Court has never addressed a claim that such private-actor courtroom conduct was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived a defendant of a fair trial or applied the test for inherent prejudice in Williams and Flynn to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of that testasking whether the practices furthered an essential state interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices.  Reflecting the lack of guidance from this Court, lower courts have diverged widely in their treatment of defendants spectator-conduct claims.  Given the lack of applicable holdings from this Court, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably appli[ed]  clearly established Federal law.  Pp. 57.
427 F.3d 653, vacated and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., Kennedy, J., and Souter, J., filed opinions concurring in the judgment.

05-547|"LOPEZ v. GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 05547.Argued October 3, 2006Decided December 5, 2006
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) lists as an aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance  including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18), 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), but does not define illicit trafficking.  Title 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(2) defines drug trafficking crime to include any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  Petitioner Lopez, a legal permanent resident alien, pleaded guilty to South Dakota charges of aiding and abetting another persons possession of cocaine, which state law treated as the equivalent of possessing the drug, a state felony.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began removal proceedings on the ground, inter alia, that Lopezs state conviction was for an aggravated felony.  The Immigration Judge ultimately ruled that despite the CSAs treatment of Lopezs crime as a misdemeanor, see 21 U. S.C. 844(a), it was an aggravated felony under the INA owing to its being a felony under state law.  The judge ordered Lopez removed in light of 8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3), which provides that the Attorney Generals discretion to cancel the removal of a person otherwise deportable does not reach a convict of an aggravated felony.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed the BIA.
Held:Conduct made a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the CSA is not a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act for INA purposes.  A state offense comes within the quoted phrase only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under the CSA.  The Government argues that possessions felonious character as a state crime is enough to turn it into an aggravated felony under the INA because the CSA punishes possession, albeit as a misdemeanor, while 924(c)(2) requires only that the offense be punishable, not that it be punishable as a federal felony, so that a prior conviction in state court will satisfy the felony element because the State treats possession that way.  This argument is incoherent with any commonsense conception of illicit trafficking, the term ultimately being defined.  Because the statutes in play do not define trafficking, the Court looks to the terms everyday meaning, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476, which ordinarily connotes some sort of commercial dealing.  Commerce, however, was no part of Lopezs South Dakota offense of helping someone else to possess, and certainly it is no element of simple possession, with which the State equates that crime.  Nor is the anomaly of the Governments reading limited to South Dakota cases: while federal law typically treats trafficking offenses as felonies and nontrafficking offenses as misdemeanors, several States deviate significantly from this pattern.  Reading 924(c) the Governments way, then, would often turn simple possession into trafficking, just what the English language counsels not to expect, and that result makes the Court very wary of the Governments position.  Although the Government might still be right, there would have to be some indication that Congress meant to define an aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in an unorthodox and unexpected way.  There are good reasons to think it was doing no such thing here.  First, an offense that necessarily counts as illicit trafficking under the INA is a drug trafficking crime under 924(c), i.e., a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, 924(c)(2).  To determine what felonies might qualify, the Court naturally looks to the definitions of crimes punishable as felonies under the CSA.  If Congress had meant the Court to look to state law, it would have found a much less misleading way to make its point.  The Governments argument to the contrary contravenes normal ways of speaking and writing, which demonstrate that felony punishable under the  Act means felony punishable as such under the Act or felony as defined by the Act, and does not refer to state felonies, so long as they would be punishable at all under the CSA.  The Governments argument is not supported by the INAs statement that the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.  8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43).  Rather than wrenching the expectations raised by normal English usage, this provision has two perfectly straightforward jobs to do.  First, it provides that a generic description of an offense  in this paragraph, one not specifically couched as a state offense or a federal one, covers either one, and, second, it confirms that a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.  Thus, if Lopezs state crime actually fell within the general term illicit trafficking, the state felony conviction would count as an aggravated felony, regardless of the existence of a federal felony counterpart; and a state offense of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base is an aggravated felony because it is a felony under the CSA, 21 U. S.C. 844(a).  Nothing in the provision in question suggests that Congress changed the meaning of felony punishable under the [CSA] when it took that phrase from Title 18 of the U. S. Code and incorporated it into Title 8s definition of aggravated felony.  Yet the Government admits that it has never begun a prosecution under 18 U. S. C. 924(c)(1)(A) where the underlying drug trafficking crime was a state felony but a federal misdemeanor.  This telling failure in the very context in which the phrase felony punishable under the [CSA] appears in the Code belies the Governments claim that its interpretation is the more natural one.  Finally, the Governments reading would render the law of alien removal, see 8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3), and the law of sentencing for illegal entry into the country, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2L1.2, dependent on varying state criminal classifications even when Congress has apparently pegged the immigration statutes to the classifications Congress itself chose.  Congress would not have incorporated its own statutory scheme of felonies and misdemeanors if it meant courts to ignore it whenever a State chose to punish a given act more heavily.  Pp.412.
417 F. 3d 934, reversed and remanded.
Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

Thus, if Lopezs state crime actually fell within the general term illicit trafficking, the state felony conviction would count as an aggravated felony, regardless of the existence of a federal felony counterpart; and a state offense of possessing more than five grams of cocaine base is an aggravated felony because it is a felony under the CSA, 21 U. S.C. 844(a).  Nothing in the provision in question suggests that Congress changed the meaning of felony punishable under the [CSA] when it took that phrase from Title 18 of the U. S. Code and incorporated it into Title 8s definition of aggravated felony.  Yet the Government admits that it has never begun a prosecution under 18 U. S. C. 924(c)(1)(A) where the underlying drug trafficking crime was a state felony but a federal misdemeanor.  This telling failure in the very context in which the phrase felony punishable under the [CSA] appears in the Code belies the Governments claim that its interpretation is the more natural one.  Finally, the Governments reading would render the law of alien removal, see 8 U. S.C. 1229b(a)(3), and the law of sentencing for illegal entry into the country, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2L1.2, dependent on varying state criminal classifications even when Congress has apparently pegged the immigration statutes to the classifications Congress itself chose.  Congress would not have incorporated its own statutory scheme of felonies and misdemeanors if it meant courts to ignore it whenever a State chose to punish a given act more heavily.  Pp.412.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05493.Argued October 3, 2006Decided November 13, 2006
In the penalty phase of respondents capital murder trial, he introduced mitigating evidence to show, inter alia, that he would lead a constructive life if incarcerated rather than executed, testifying that he had done so during a previous incarceration, when he had embraced Christianity.  Two prison chaplains and his Christian sponsors from that time testified on his behalf, and the parties closing arguments discussed this mitigating evidence and how the jury should consider it.  The trial judge told the jury to consider [a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime, an instruction known as factor (k) under Californias then-applicable statutory scheme.  Respondent was sentenced to death.  He contended, on direct review and in federal habeas proceedings, that factor (k) and the trial courts other instructions barred the jury from considering his forward-looking mitigation evidence in violation of his Eighth Amendment right to present all mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  The Federal District Court denied relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  On reconsideration in light of Brown v. Payton, 544 U. S. 133, the Ninth Circuit again invalidated respondents sentence. 
Held:The factor (k) instruction is consistent with the constitutional right to present mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings.  Pp.416.
(a)This Court has previously found that factor (k) does not preclude consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence, such as mitigating evidence about a defendants precrime background and character, Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377378, 386, or postcrime rehabilitation, Brown v. Payton, supra, at 135136, and found the proper inquiry to be whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence, Boyde, supra, at 380.  Pp.46. 


(b)That inquiry applies here.  Like Payton, this case involves forward-looking evidence and comes to the Court on federal habeas proceedings, but unlike Payton, it was filed before the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  The Ninth Circuit distinguished Payton on this ground, but erred in finding a reasonable probability that the jury did not consider evidence of respondents future potential.  414 F.3d 1094, 1138.  Pp.616.


(1)The Circuit adopted a narrow and unrealistic interpretation of factor (k), ruling that this instruction allows the jury to consider evidence that bears upon the commission of the crime by the defendant and excuses or mitigates his culpability for the offense, 414 F.3d 1094, 1134.  As Boyde and Payton explain, the jury is directed to consider any other circumstance that might excuse the crime.  Boyde, supra, at 382.  Just as precrime background and character (Boyde) and postcrime rehabilitation (Payton) may extenuat[e] the gravity of the crime, so may some likelihood of future good conduct count as a circumstance tending to make a defendant less deserving of the death penalty.  The Ninth Circuit failed to heed the full import of Paytons holding, which is significant even where AEDPA is inapplicable.  Moreover, since respondent sought to extrapolate future behavior from precrime conduct, his mitigation theory was more analogous to the good-character evidence Boyde found to fall within factor (k)s purview. Pp.68.


(2)This Courts interpretation of factor (k) is the one most consistent with the evidence presented to the jury, the parties closing arguments, and the trial courts other instructions.  It is improbable that the jury believed that the parties were engaged in an exercise in futility when respondent presented extensive forward-looking evidence in open court.  Both prosecution and defense arguments assumed the evidence was relevant.  The prosecutors remarks that the evidence was weak and his opinion about the weight it should be given confirmed to the jury that it should analyze respondents future potential.  Respondents personal pleas were consistent with a trial in which the jury would assess his future prospects in determining what sentence to impose.  This analysis is confirmed by defense counsels closing arguments.  The trial courts other instructions make it quite implausible that the jury would deem itself foreclosed from considering respondents full case in mitigation.  The judge told the jury to consider all of the evidence, which included respondents forward-looking mitigation case.  The sharp contrast between the aggravation instruction (only enumerated factors could be considered) and the mitigation one (listed factors were merely examples) also made clear that the jury was to take a broad view of mitigating evidence.  In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit cited juror queries as evidence of confusion.  Assuming that interpretation is correct, the courts conclusion that a juror likely ignored forward-looking evidence presupposes what it purports to establish, namely, that forward-looking evidence could not fall within factor (k).  Pp.816. 
414 F.3d 1094, reversed and remanded.

Nos. 06A375 (06532) and 06A379 (06533).Decided October 20, 2006
Per Curiam.

The State of Arizona and county officials from four of its counties seek relief from an interlocutory injunction entered by a two-judge motions panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Justice Kennedy has referred the applicants filings to the Court.  We construe the filings of the State and the county officials as petitions for certiorari; we grant the petitions; and we vacate the order of the Court of Appeals.
I

In 2004, Arizona voters approved Proposition 200.  The measure sought to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when they vote on election day.
The election procedures implemented to effect Proposition 200 do not necessarily result in the turning away of qualified, registered voters by election officials for lack of proper identification.  A voter who arrives at the polls on election day without identification may cast a conditional provisional ballot.  For that ballot to be counted, the voter is allowed five business days to return to a designated site and present proper identification.  In addition any voter who knows he or she cannot secure identification within five business days of the election has the option to vote before election day during the early voting period.  The State has determined that, because there is adequate time during the early voting period to compare the voters signatures on the ballot with their signatures on the registration rolls, voters need not present identification if voting early.


Arizona is a covered jurisdiction under 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  So it was required to preclear any new voting standard, practice, or procedure with either the United States Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia to ensure its new voting policy did not have the purpose [or] effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, 42 U. S.C. 1973c.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 461462 (2003).  On May 6, 2005, the United States Attorney General precleared the procedures Arizona adopted under Proposition 200. 


In the District Court the plaintiffs in this action are residents of Arizona; Indian tribes; and various community organizations.  In May 2006, these plaintiffs brought suit challenging Proposition 200s identification requirements.  On September 11, 2006, the District Court denied their request for a preliminary injunction, but it did not at that time issue findings of fact or conclusions of law.  These findings were important because resolution of legal questions in the Court of Appeals required evaluation of underlying factual issues.


The plaintiffs appealed the denial, and the Clerk of the Court of Appeals set a briefing schedule that concluded on November 21, two weeks after the upcoming November 7 election.  The plaintiffs then requested an injunction pending appeal from the Court of Appeals.  Pursuant to the Court of Appeals rules, the request for an injunction was assigned to a two-judge motions/screening panel.  See Rule 33 (CA9 2002).  On October 5, after receiving lengthy written responses from the State and the county officials but without oral argument, the panel issued a four-sentence order enjoining Arizona from enforcing Proposition 200s provisions pending disposition, after full briefing, of the appeals of the denial of a preliminary injunction.  The Court of Appeals offered no explanation or justification for its order.  Four days later, the court denied a motion for reconsideration.  The order denying the motion likewise gave no rationale for the courts decision.


Despite the time-sensitive nature of the proceedings and the pendency of a request for emergency relief in the Court of Appeals, the District Court did not issue its findings of fact and conclusions of law until October 12.  It then concluded that plaintiffs have shown a possibility of success on the merits of some of their arguments but the Court cannot say that at this stage they have shown a strong likelihood.  Order in NO. CV 061268PHXROS etc. (D.Ariz., Oct. 11, 2006), pp.78, App. to Application for Stay of Injunction, Tab 5 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The District Court then found the balance of the harms and the public interest counseled in favor of denying the injunction.
II

A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.  Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989).  Confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.  Voter fraud drives honest citizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust of our government.  Voters who fear their legitimate votes will be outweighed by fraudulent ones will feel disenfranchised.  [T]he right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizens vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 555 (1964).  Countering the States compelling interest in preventing voter fraud is the plaintiffs strong interest in exercising the fundamental political right to vote.  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330, 336 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the likely effects of Proposition 200 are much debated, the possibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the polls would caution any district judge to give careful consideration to the plaintiffs
challenges.
Faced with an application to enjoin operation of voter identification procedures just weeks before an election, the Court of Appeals was required to weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon issuance or nonissuance of an injunction, considerations specific to election cases and its own institutional procedures.  Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls.  As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.  So the Court of Appeals may have deemed this consideration to be grounds for prompt action.  Furthermore, it might have given some weight to the possibility that the nonprevailing parties would want to seek en banc review.  In the Ninth Circuit that procedure, involving voting by all active judges and an en banc hearing by a court of 15, can consume further valuable time.  These considerations, however, cannot be controlling here.  It was still necessary, as a procedural matter, for the Court of Appeals to give deference to the discretion of the District Court.  We find no indication that it did so, and we conclude this was error.
Although at the time the Court of Appeals issued its order the District Court had not yet made factual findings to which the Court of Appeals owed deference, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a), by failing to provide any factual findings or indeed any reasoning of its own the Court of Appeals left this Court in the position of evaluating the Court of Appeals bare order in light of the District Courts ultimate findings.  There has been no explanation given by the Court of Appeals showing the ruling and findings of the District Court to be incorrect.  In view of the impending election, the necessity for clear guidance to the State of Arizona, and our conclusion regarding the Court of Appeals issuance of the order we vacate the order of the Court of Appeals.


We underscore that we express no opinion here on the correct disposition, after full briefing and argument, of the appeals from the District Courts September 11 order or on the ultimate resolution of these cases.  As we have noted, the facts in these cases are hotly contested, and [n]o bright line separates permissible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements.  Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 359 (1997).  Given the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputes, our action today shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction suspending the voter identification rules.


The order of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Pursuant to this Courts Rule 45.3, the Clerk is directed to issue the judgment in these cases forthwith.
It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.

Allowing the election to proceed without enjoining the statutory provisions at issue will provide the courts with
a better record on which to judge their constitutionality.  At least two important factual issues remain largely unresolved: the scope of the disenfranchisement that the novel identification requirements will produce, and the prevalence and character of the fraudulent practices that allegedly justify those requirements.  Given the importance of the constitutional issues, the Court wisely takes action that will enhance the likelihood that they will be resolved correctly on the basis of historical facts rather than
speculation.

05-184|"HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 05184.Argued March 28, 2006Decided June 29, 2006
Pursuant to Congress Joint Resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks (AUMF), U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan.  During the hostilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002, transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Over a year later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year, he was charged with conspiracy to commit  offenses triable by military commission.  In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1) neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.


The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commissions proceedings, concluding that the Presidents authority to establish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Conventions full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a prisoner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.C. 801 et seq., and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  The D. C. Circuit reversed.  Although it declined the Governments invitation to abstain from considering Hamdans challenge, cf. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, the appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to relief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable.  The court also concluded that Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commissions jurisdiction, and that Hamdans trial before the commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva Conventions.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
415 F.3d 33, reversed and remanded.
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts V and VIDiv, concluding:


1.The Governments motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied.  DTA 1005(e)(1) provides that no court  shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider  an application for  habeas corpus filed by  an alien detained  at Guantanamo Bay.  Section 1005(h)(2) provides that 1005(e)(2) and (3)which give the D. C. Circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review the final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals and military commissionsshall apply with respect to any claim whose review is  pending on the DTAs effective date, as was Hamdans case.  The Governments argument that 1005(e)(1) and (h) repeal this Courts jurisdiction to review the decision below is rebutted by ordinary principles of statutory construction.  A negative inference may be drawn from Congress failure to include 1005(e)(1) within the scope of 1005(h)(2).  Cf., e.g., Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330.  If  Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.  Id., at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in Lindh.  The legislative history shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of 1005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having rejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within that directives scope.  Congress rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the Government urges weighs heavily against the Governments interpretation.  See Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621623.  Pp.720.


2.The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate under Councilman, which concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740.  Neither of the comity considerations Councilman identified weighs in favor of abstention here.  First, the assertion that military discipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces efficient operation, are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member.  Second, the view that federal courts should respect the balance Congress struck when it created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures is inapposite, since the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated system.  Rather than Councilman, the most relevant precedent is Ex parte Quirin, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because of (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Courts duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those questions without delay, 317 U. S. at 19.  The Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has conferred on them.  Pp.2025.


3.The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional Act.  Quirin held that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try offenders or offenses against the law of war.  317 U. S., at 28.  UCMJ Art. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: The jurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions  of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such  commissions.  10 U. S.C. 821.  Contrary to the Governments assertion, even Quirin did not view that authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions whenever he deems them necessary.  Rather, Quirin recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President already had to convene military commissionswith the express condition that he and those under his command comply with the law of war.  See 317 U. S., at 2829.  Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide specific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try Hamdan.  Assuming the AUMF activated the Presidents war powers, see Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, and that those powers include authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see, e.g., id., at 518, there is nothing in the AUMFs text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21.  Cf. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105.  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President convened Hamdans commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution and laws, including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, this Courts task is, as it was in Quirin, to decide whether Hamdans military commission is so justified.  Pp. 2530.


4.The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  Pp. 4972.


(a)The commissions procedures, set forth in Commission Order No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to close.  Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities, and other national security interests.  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officers discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client what took place therein.  Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdans commission permit the admission of any evidence that, in the presiding officers opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person.  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other protected information, so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is probative and that its admission without the accuseds knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial.  Pp. 4952.


(b)The Government objects to this Courts consideration of a procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.  These contentions are unsound.  First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commissions final decision under DTA 1005(e)(3).  Second, there is a basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdans trial will violate the law: He will be, and indeed already has been, excluded from his own trial.  Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a final decision is appropriate.  Pp. 5253. 


(c)Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdans commission trial are illegal.  The procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  Although this uniformity principle is not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-martial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be uniform insofar as practicable, 10 U. S.C. 836(b).  The practicability determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts to Hamdans commission.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.  And even if subsection (b)s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsections requirements are not satisfied here.  Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules here.  There is no suggestion, e.g., of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdans trial, any variance from the courts-martial rules.  The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present.  See 10 U. S.C.A. 839(c).  Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as practicable, the courts-martial rules must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b).  Pp. 5362. 


(d)The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The D. C. Circuit dismissed Hamdans challenge in this regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections.  Neither of these grounds is persuasive.  Pp. 6268.


(i)The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 789, n.14, suggesting that this Court lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for observing and enforcing prisoners rights under the Convention.  However, Eisentrager does not control here because, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 520521, compliance with which is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted.  Pp. 6365.


(ii)Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signatory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan.  The Court need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signatories. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, provides that, in a conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [i.e., signatories], each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, certain provisions protecting [p]ersons  placed hors de combat by  detention, including a prohibition on the passing of sentences  without previous judgment  by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees  recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.  The D.C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inapplicable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international in scope and thus not a conflict not of an international character.  That reasoning is erroneous.  That the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsignatory accepts and applies those terms.  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict in the territory of a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  Pp. 6568.


(iii)While Common Article 3 does not define its regularly constituted court phrase, other sources define the words to mean an ordinary military cour[t] that is established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.  The regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial established by congressional statute.  At a minimum, a military commission can be regularly constituted only if some practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice.  No such need has been demonstrated here.  Pp. 6970.


(iv)Common Article 3s requirements are general, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are requirements nonetheless.  The commission convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements.  P. 72.


(d)Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who would cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportunity, the Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevailing rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal punishment.  P. 72.


Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts V and VIDiv:


1.The Government has not charged Hamdan with an offense  that by the law of war may be tried by military commission, 10 U. S.C. 821.  Of the three sorts of military commissions used historically, the law-of-war type used in Quirin and other cases is the only model available to try Hamdan.  Among the preconditions, incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a tribunals exercise of jurisdiction are, inter alia, that it must be limited to trying offenses committed within the convening commanders field of command, i.e., within the theater of war, and that the offense charged must have been committed during, not before or after, the war.  Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in a theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.  More importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  Although the common law of war may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute, Quirin, 317 U. S., at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect to a particular offense must be plain and unambiguous, cf., e.g., Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 771.  That burden is far from satisfied here.  The crime of conspiracy has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventionsthe major treaties on the law of war.  Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international sources, including, e.g., the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit war crimes as such a violation.  Because the conspiracy charge does not support the commissions jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.  Pp. 3049. 


2.The phrase all the guarantees  recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is not defined, but it must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of the trial protections recognized by customary international law.  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees.  Moreover, various provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him.  Pp. 7072. 


Justice Kennedy, agreeing that Hamdans military commission is unauthorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U. S.C. 836 and 821, and the Geneva Conventions, concluded that there is therefore no need to decide whether Common Article 3 of the Conventions requires that the accused have the right to be present at all stages of a criminal trial or to address the validity of the conspiracy charge against Hamdan.  Pp.1719.

			"|"HAMDAN v. RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 05184.Argued March 28, 2006Decided June 29, 2006
Pursuant to Congress Joint Resolution authorizing the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks (AUMF), U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan.  During the hostilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002, transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Over a year later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year, he was charged with conspiracy to commit  offenses triable by military commission.  In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1) neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.


The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commissions proceedings, concluding that the Presidents authority to establish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Conventions full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a prisoner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S.C. 801 et seq., and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  The D. C. Circuit reversed.  Although it declined the Governments invitation to abstain from considering Hamdans challenge, cf. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, the appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to relief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable.  The court also concluded that Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commissions jurisdiction, and that Hamdans trial before the commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva Conventions.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
415 F.3d 33, reversed and remanded.
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts V and VIDiv, concluding:


1.The Governments motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied.  DTA 1005(e)(1) provides that no court  shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider  an application for  habeas corpus filed by  an alien detained  at Guantanamo Bay.  Section 1005(h)(2) provides that 1005(e)(2) and (3)which give the D. C. Circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review the final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals and military commissionsshall apply with respect to any claim whose review is  pending on the DTAs effective date, as was Hamdans case.  The Governments argument that 1005(e)(1) and (h) repeal this Courts jurisdiction to review the decision below is rebutted by ordinary principles of statutory construction.  A negative inference may be drawn from Congress failure to include 1005(e)(1) within the scope of 1005(h)(2).  Cf., e.g., Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330.  If  Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.  Id., at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in Lindh.  The legislative history shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of 1005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having rejected earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within that directives scope.  Congress rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the Government urges weighs heavily against the Governments interpretation.  See Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614, 621623.  Pp.720.


2.The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate under Councilman, which concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740.  Neither of the comity considerations Councilman identified weighs in favor of abstention here.  First, the assertion that military discipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces efficient operation, are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts, see id., at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member.  Second, the view that federal courts should respect the balance Congress struck when it created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures is inapposite, since the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated system.  Rather than Councilman, the most relevant precedent is Ex parte Quirin, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because of (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Courts duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those questions without delay, 317 U. S. at 19.  The Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has conferred on them.  Pp.2025.


3.The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional Act.  Quirin held that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try offenders or offenses against the law of war.  317 U. S., at 28.  UCMJ Art. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: The jurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions  of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such  commissions.  10 U. S.C. 821.  Contrary to the Governments assertion, even Quirin did not view that authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions whenever he deems them necessary.  Rather, Quirin recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President already had to convene military commissionswith the express condition that he and those under his command comply with the law of war.  See 317 U. S., at 2829.  Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide specific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try Hamdan.  Assuming the AUMF activated the Presidents war powers, see Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, and that those powers include authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see, e.g., id., at 518, there is nothing in the AUMFs text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21.  Cf. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 105.  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President convened Hamdans commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution and laws, including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, this Courts task is, as it was in Quirin, to decide whether Hamdans military commission is so justified.  Pp. 2530.


4.The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  Pp. 4972.


(a)The commissions procedures, set forth in Commission Order No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to close.  Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities, and other national security interests.  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officers discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client what took place therein.  Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdans commission permit the admission of any evidence that, in the presiding officers opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person.  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other protected information, so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is probative and that its admission without the accuseds knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial.  Pp. 4952.


(b)The Government objects to this Courts consideration of a procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, inter alia, that Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.  These contentions are unsound.  First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commissions final decision under DTA 1005(e)(3).  Second, there is a basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdans trial will violate the law: He will be, and indeed already has been, excluded from his own trial.  Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a final decision is appropriate.  Pp. 5253. 


(c)Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdans commission trial are illegal.  The procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  Although this uniformity principle is not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-martial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be uniform insofar as practicable, 10 U.

The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts to Hamdans commission.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.  And even if subsection (b)s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsections requirements are not satisfied here.

05-5966|"CLARK v. ARIZONA
certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona
No. 055966.Argued April 19, 2006Decided June 29, 2006
Petitioner Clark was charged with first-degree murder under an Arizona statute prohibiting [i]nten[tionally] or knowing[ly] killing a police officer in the line of duty.  At his bench trial, Clark did not contest that he shot the officer or that the officer died, but relied on his own undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident to deny that he had the specific intent to shoot an officer or knowledge that he was doing so.  Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew the victim was a police officer and testimony indicating that Clark had previously stated he wanted to shoot police and had lured the victim to the scene to kill him.  In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.  First, he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear and convincing evidence that, in the words of another state statute, at the time of the [crime, he] was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was wrong.  Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecutions evidence of the requisite mens rea, that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to kill an officer.


Ruling that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on insanity to dispute the mens rea, the trial court cited the Arizona Supreme Courts decision in State v. Mott, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.2d 1046, which refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent and held that Arizona does not allow evidence of a mental disorder short of insanity to negate the mens rea element of a crime.  As to his insanity, then, Clark presented lay testimony describing his increasingly bizarre behavior over the year before the shooting.  Other lay and expert testimony indicated, among other things, that Clark thought that aliens (some impersonating government agents) were trying to kill him and that bullets were the only way to stop them.  A psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia with delusions about aliens when he killed the officer, and concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer or understanding right from wrong and was thus insane at the time of the killing.  In rebuttal, the States psychiatrist gave his opinion that Clarks paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct before and after the shooting.  The judge then issued a first-degree murder verdict, finding that in light of that the facts of the crime, the expert evaluations, Clarks actions and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the observations of those who knew him, Clark had not established that his schizophrenia distorted his perception of reality so severely that he did not know his actions were wrong.


Clark moved to vacate the judgment and life sentence, arguing, among other things, that Arizonas insanity test and its Mott rule each violate due process.  He claimed that the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed its insanity standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first of the two parts of the traditional MNaghten insanity test.  The trial court denied the motion.  Affirming, the Arizona Court of Appeals held, among other things, that the States insanity scheme was consistent with due process.  The court read Mott as barring the trial courts consideration of evidence of Clarks mental illness and capacity directly on the element of mens rea.
Held:
1.Due process does not prohibit Arizonas use of an insanity test stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell whether an act charged as a crime was right or wrong.  Pp.615.


(a)The first part of the landmark English rule in MNaghtens Case asks about cognitive capacity: whether a mental defect leaves a defendant unable to understand what he was doing.  The second part presents an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense of insanity understood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental disease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand that his action was wrong.  Although the Arizona Legislature at first adopted the full MNaghten statement, it later dropped the cognitive incapacity part.  Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be adjudged insane unless he demonstrates that at the time of the crime, he was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that he did not know the criminal act was wrong.  Pp.67.


(b)Clark insists that the side-by-side MNaghten test represents the minimum that a government must provide, and he argues that eliminating the first part offends [a] principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202.  The claim entails no light burden, and Clark does not carry it.  History shows no deference to MNaghten that could elevate its formula to the level of fundamental principle, so as to limit the traditional recognition of a States capacity to define crimes and defenses.  See, e.g., Patterson, supra, at 210.  Even a cursory examination of the traditional Anglo-American approaches to insanity reveals significant differences among them, with four traditional strains variously combined to yield a diversity of American standards.  Although 17 States and the Federal Government have adopted recognizable versions of the MNaghten test with both its components, other States have adopted a variety of standards based on all or part of one or more of four variants.  The alternatives are multiplied further by variations in the prescribed insanity verdict.  This varied background makes clear that no particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process, and that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal offenses, is substantially open to state choice.  Pp.712.


(c)Nor does Arizonas abbreviation of the MNaghten statement raise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been shortchanged.  Although Arizonas former statement of the full MNaghten rule was constitutionally adequate, the abbreviated rule is no less so, for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it was under the more extended formulation, and evidence going to cognitive incapacity has the same significance under the short form as it had under the long.  Though Clark is correct that applying the moral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not necessarily require evaluation of a defendants cognitive capacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him, his argument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is itself enough to demonstrate moral incapacity, so that evidence bearing on whether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions is both relevant and admissible.  In practical terms, if a defendant did not know what he was doing when he acted, he could not have known that he was performing the wrongful act charged as a crime.  The Arizona appeals court acknowledged as much in this case.  Clark adopted this very analysis in the trial court, which apparently agreed when it admitted his cognitive incapacity evidence for consideration under the States moral incapacity formulation.  Clark can point to no evidence bearing on insanity that was excluded.  Pp.1215.


2.The Arizona Supreme Courts Mott rule does not violate due process. Pp.1538.


(a)Mott held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist about a defendants mental incapacity owing to mental disease or defect was admissible, and could be considered, only for its bearing on an insanity defense, but could not be considered on the element of mens rea.  Of the three categories of evidence that potentially bear on mens rea(1) everyday observation evidence either by lay or expert witnesses of what Clark did or said, which may support the professional diagnoses of disease and in any event is the kind of evidence that can be relevant to show what was on Clarks mind when he fired his gun; (2) mental-disease evidence, typically from professional psychologists or psychiatrists based on factual reports, professional observations, and tests about Clarks mental disease, with features described by the witness; and (3) capacity evidence, typically by the same experts, about Clarks capacity for cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form mens rea)Mott imposed no restriction on considering evidence of the first sort, but applies to the latter two.  Although the trial court seems to have applied the Mott restriction to all three categories of evidence Clark offered for the purpose of showing what he called his inability to form the required mens rea, his objection to Motts application does not turn on the distinction between lay and expert witnesses or the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.  Rather, the issue here is Clarks claim that the Mott rule violates due process.  Pp.1525.


(b)Clarks Mott challenge turns on the application of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, the presumption of sanity, and the principle that a criminal defendant is entitled to present relevant and favorable evidence on an element of the offense charged against him.  Pp.2530.


(i)The presumption of innocence is that a defendant is innocent unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense changed, including the mental element or mens rea.  The modern tendency is to describe the mens rea required to prove particular offenses in specific terms, as shown in the Arizona statute requiring the State to prove that in acting to kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on duty or knew that the victim was such an officer on duty.  As applied to mens rea (and every other element), the force of the presumption of innocence is measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendants state of mind was in fact what the charge states.  See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 361363.  Pp.2526.


(ii)The presumption of sanity dispenses with a requirement that the government include as an element of every criminal charge an allegation that the defendant had the capacity to form the mens rea necessary for conviction and criminal responsibility.  Unlike the presumption of innocence, the presumption of sanitys force varies across the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior law has recognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative branch in defining the presumptions strength through the kind of evidence and degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see Fisher v. United States, 328 U. S. 463, 466476.  There are two points where the sanity or capacity presumption may be placed in issue.  First, a State may allow a defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evidence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it can have on the governments burden to show mens rea.  Second, the sanity presumptions force may be tested in the consideration of an insanity defense raised by a defendant.  Insanity rules like MNaghten and the variants noted above are attempts to define or indicate the kinds of mental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal responsibility, see, e.g., Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 373, n.4, even if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the presumption of innocence by convincing the factfinder of all the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  The burden a defendant raising the insanity issue must carry defines the strength of the sanity presumption.  A State may, for example, place the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a preponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree.  See, e.g., Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 798.  Pp.2629.


(iii)A defendant has a due process right to present evidence favorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict him.  Evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental disease and lacks capacity to form mens rea is relevant to rebut evidence that he did in fact form the required mens rea at the time in question.  Thus, Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending to show mens rea, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.  However, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason for doing so.  For example, trial judges may exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.  Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U. S. ___, ___.  And if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be subject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.  Under state law, mental-disease and capacity evidence may be considered only for its bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendants burden as defined by the terms of that defense.  Such evidence is thus being channeled or restricted to one issue; it is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted satisfy due processs fundamental fairness standard.  Pp.2930.


(c)The reasons supporting the Arizona rule satisfy due process.  Pp.3038. 


(i)The first such reason is Arizonas authority to define its presumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an insanity definition and placing the burden of persuasion on criminal defendants claiming incapacity as an excuse.  Consistent with due process, a State can require defendants to bear that burden, see Leland, supra, at 797799, and Clark does not object to Arizonas decision to require persuasion to a clear and convincing degree before the presumption of sanity and normal responsibility is overcome.  If a State is to have this authority in practice as well as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the sanity presumption more easily when addressing a different issue during the criminal trial.  Yet just such an opportunity would be available if expert testimony of mental disease and incapacity could be considered for whatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the mens rea issue.  The sanity presumption would then be only as strong as the evidence a factfinder would accept as enough to raise a reasonable doubt about mens rea; once reasonable doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the standards established for the insanity defense would go by the boards.  What counts for due process is simply that a State wishing to avoid a second avenue for exploring capacity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the consideration of mental disease and incapacity evidence to the insanity defense.  Pp.3032.


(ii)Arizonas rule also serves to avoid confusion and misunderstanding on the part of jurors.  The controversial character of some categories of mental disease, the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead, and the danger of according greater certainty to capacity evidence than experts claim for it give rise to risks that may reasonably be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence to the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defendant has the burden of persuasion.  First, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate within the psychiatric profession about the very contours of the mental disease itself.  See, e.g., Jones, supra, at 364365, n.13.  Though mental-disease evidence is certainly not condemned wholesale, the consequence of this professional ferment is a general caution in treating psychological classifications as predicates for excusing otherwise criminal conduct.  Next, there is the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead jurors (when they are the factfinders) through the power of this kind of evidence to suggest that a defendant suffering from a recognized mental disease lacks cognitive, moral, volitional, or other capacity, when that may not be a sound conclusion at all.  Even when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defendants behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the classification may suggest something very significant about a defendants capacity, when in fact the classification tells little or nothing about the defendants ability to form mens rea or to exercise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that define legal sanity.  The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they reach opposite conclusions on whether his mental disease left him bereft of cognitive or moral capacity.  Finally, there are particular risks inherent in the opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease rendered a particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary for moral judgment or mens rea or otherwise incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of the conduct charged.  Unlike observational evidence bearing on mens rea, capacity evidence consists of judgment, and judgment is fraught with multiple perils.  Although such capacity judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense expert in this very case.  He testified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to understand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, but he admitted that no one knew exactly what was on Clarks mind at the time of the shooting.  Even when an expert is confident that his understanding of the mind is reliable, judgment addressing the basic categories of capacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are devised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility.  Pp.3338.


(d)For these reasons, there is also no cause to claim that channeling evidence on metal disease and capacity offends any principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental, Patterson, supra, at 202.  P. 38.

			"|"CLARK v. ARIZONA
certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona
No. 055966.Argued April 19, 2006Decided June 29, 2006
Petitioner Clark was charged with first-degree murder under an Arizona statute prohibiting [i]nten[tionally] or knowing[ly] killing a police officer in the line of duty.  At his bench trial, Clark did not contest that he shot the officer or that the officer died, but relied on his own undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident to deny that he had the specific intent to shoot an officer or knowledge that he was doing so.  Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew the victim was a police officer and testimony indicating that Clark had previously stated he wanted to shoot police and had lured the victim to the scene to kill him.  In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.

Pennsylvania houses its 40 most dangerous and recalcitrant inmates in a Long Term Segregation Unit (LTSU).  Inmates begin in level 2, which has the most severe restrictions, but may graduate to the less restrictive level 1.  Plaintiff-respondent Banks, a level 2 inmate, filed this federal-court action against defendant-petitioner, the Secretary of the Department of Corrections, alleging that a level 2 policy (Policy) forbidding inmates any access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs violates the First Amendment.  During discovery, Banks deposed Deputy Prison Superintendent Dickson and the parties introduced prison policy manuals and related documents into the record.  The Secretary then filed a summary judgment motion, along with a statement of undisputed facts and the deposition.  Rather than filing an opposition to the motion, Banks filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, relying on the undisputed facts, including those in the deposition.  Based on this record, the District Court granted the Secretarys motion and denied Banks.  Reversing the Secretarys summary judgment award, the Third Circuit held that the prison regulation could not be supported as a matter of law.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
399 F. 3d 134, reversed and remanded.
Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter, concluded that, based on the record before this Court, prison officials have set forth adequate legal support for the Policy, and Banks has failed to show specific facts that could warrant a determination in his favor.  Pp. 513.


(a)Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, and Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, contain the basic substantive legal standards covering this case.  While imprisonment does not automatically deprive a prisoner of constitutional protections, Turner, 482 U. S., at 93, the Constitution sometimes permits greater restriction of such rights in a prison than it would allow elsewhere, id., at 8485.  As Overton, supra, at 132, pointed out, courts also owe substantial deference to the professional judgment of prison administrators.  Under Turner, restrictive prison regulations are permissible if they are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  482 U. S., at 89.  Because this case is here on the Secretarys summary judgment motion, the Court examines the record to determine whether he has demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.  See, e.g.,  Fed . Rule Civ. Proc. 56.  If he has, the Court determines whether Banks has by affidavits or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, set forth specific facts showing  a genuine issue for trial, Rule 56(e).  Inferences about disputed facts must be drawn in Banks favor, but deference must be accorded prison authorities views with respect to matters of professional judgment.  Pp.56.


(b)The Secretary rested his motion primarily on the undisputed facts statement and Dicksons affidavit.  The first of his justifications for the Policythe need to motivate better behavior on the part of particularly difficult prisonerssufficiently satisfies Turners requirements.  The statement and affidavit set forth a valid, rational connection  between the Policy and legitimate penological interests, 482 U. S., at 89, 95.  Dickson noted that prison authorities are limited in what they can and cannot deny or give a level 2 inmate, who has already been deprived of most privileges, and that the officials believe that the specified items are legitimate as incentives for inmate growth.  The undisputed facts statement added that the Policy encourages progress and discourages backsliding by level 1 inmates.  These statements point to evidence that the regulations serve the function identified.  The articulated connections between newspapers and magazines, the deprivation of virtually the last privilege left to an inmate, and a significant incentive to improve behavior, are logical ones.  Thus, this factor supports the Policys reasonableness.  The second, third, and fourth Turner factorswhether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates, id., at 90; the impact that accommodating the asserted constitutional right [will] have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources, ibid.; and whether there are ready alternatives for furthering the governmental interest, ibid.add little to the first factors logical rationale here.  That two of these three factors seem to favor the Policy therefore does not help the Secretary.  The real task in this case is not balancing the Turner factors but determining whether the Secretarys summary judgment material shows not just a logical relation but a reasonable relation.  Given the deference courts must show to prison officials professional judgment, the material presented here is sufficient.  Overton provides significant support for this conclusion.  In both cases, the deprivations (family visits in Overton and access to newspapers, magazines, and photographs here) have an important constitutional dimension; prison officials have imposed the deprivation only upon those with serious prison-behavior problems; and those officials, relying on their professional judgment, reached an experience-based conclusion that the policies help to further legitimate prison objectives.  Unless there is more, the Secretarys supporting material brings the Policy within Turners scope.  Pp.610.


(c)Although summary judgment rules gave Banks an opportunity to respond to these materials, he did not do so in the manner the rules provide.  Instead, he filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Policy fell of its own weight.  Neither the cases he cites nor the statistics he notes support his argument.  In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Third Circuit placed too high an evidentiary burden on the Secretary and offered too little deference to the prison officials judgment.  Such deference does not make it impossible for those attacking prison policies to succeed.  A prisoner may be able to marshal substantial evidence, for example through depositions, that a policy is not reasonable or that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial.  And, as Overton noted, if faced with a de facto permanent ban involving a severe restriction, this Court might reach a different conclusion.  Pp.1013.


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that, using the framework set forth in Justice Thomas concurrence in Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 138, Pennsylvanias prison regulations are permissible.  That framework provides the least perilous approach for resolving challenges to prison regulations and is the approach most faithful to the Constitution.  Sentencing a criminal to a term of imprisonment may  carry with it the implied delegation to prison officials to discipline and otherwise supervise the criminal while he is incarcerated.  Id., at 140, n.  A term of imprisonment in Pennsylvania includes such an implied delegation.  Inmates are subject to Department of Corrections rules and disciplinary rulings, and the challenged regulations fall with the Departments discretion.  This conclusion is supported by the pluralitys Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, analysis.  The history of incarceration as punishment [also] supports the view that the sentenc[e]  terminated respondents unfettered right to magazines, newspapers, and photographs.  Overton, 539 U. S., at 142.  While Pennsylvania is free to alter its definition of incarceration to include the retention of unfettered access to such materials, it appears that the Commonwealth instead sentenced respondent against the backdrop of its traditional conception of imprisonment, which affords no such privileges.  Id.,  at 144145.  Pp.17.

05-204|"LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS etal. v. PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, etal.
appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of texas
No. 05204.Argued March 1, 2006Decided June 28, 2006
The 1990 census resulted in a 3-seat increase over the 27 seats previously allotted the Texas congressional delegation.  Although the Democratic Party then controlled 19 of those 27 seats, as well as both state legislative houses and the governorship, change was in the air: The Republican Party had received 47% of the 1990 statewide vote, while the Democrats had received only 51%.  Faced with a possible Republican ascent to majority status, the legislature drew a congressional redistricting plan that favored Democratic candidates.  The Republicans challenged the 1991 Plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but to no avail.


The 2000 census authorized two additional seats for the Texas delegation.  The Republicans then controlled the governorship and the State Senate, but did not yet control the State House of Representatives.  So constituted, the legislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in litigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with the U. S. Constitutions one-person, one-vote requirement.  Conscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional districts lies with the political branches of government, and hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another, the three-judge Federal District Court sought to apply only neutral redistricting standards when drawing Plan 1151C, including placing the two new seats in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct lines, and avoiding the pairing of incumbents.  Under Plan 1151C, the 2002 congressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in votes for statewide office in 2000, thus leaving the 1991 Democratic gerrymander largely in place.


In 2003, however, Texas Republicans gained control of both houses of the legislature and set out to increase Republican representation in the congressional delegation.  After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C.  In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide races against the Democrats 41%.  Soon after Plan 1374C was enacted, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of constitutional and statutory violations.  In 2004 the District Court entered judgment for appellees, but this Court vacated the decision and remanded for consideration in light of Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267.  On remand, the District Court, believing the scope of its mandate was limited to questions of political gerrymandering, again rejected appellants claims.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are remanded. 
399 F.Supp. 2d 756, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. 
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts IIA and III, concluding:


1.This Court held, in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 118127, that an equal protection challenge to a political gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversy, although it could not agree on what substantive standard to apply, compare id., at 127137, with id., at 161162.  That disagreement persists.  The Vieth plurality would have held such challenges nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority declined to do so, see 541 U. S., at 306, 317, 343, 355.  Justiciability is not revisited here.  At issue is whether appellants offer a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for determining whether a partisan gerrymander is unconstitutional.  P. 7.  


2.Texas redrawing of District 23s lines amounts to vote dilution violative of 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Pp.1736.


(a)Plan 1374Cs changes to District 23 served the dual goals of increasing Republican seats and protecting the incumbent Republican against an increasingly powerful Latino population that threatened to oust him, with the additional political nuance that he would be reelected in a district that had a Latino majority as to voting age population, though not a Latino majority as to citizen voting age population or an effective Latino voting majority.  The District 23 changes required adjustments elsewhere, so the State created new District 25 to avoid retrogression under 5 of the Act.  Pp.1718.


(b)A State violates 2 if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election  are not [as] equally open to  members of [a racial group as they are to] other members of the electorate.  42 U. S.C. 1973(b).  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 5051, identified three threshold conditions for establishing a 2 violation: (1) the racial group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) the group must be politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority must vot[e] sufficiently as a bloc to enable it  usually to defeat the minoritys preferred candidate.  The legislative history identifies factors that courts can use, once all three threshold requirements are met, in interpreting 2s totality of circumstances standard, including the States history of voting-related discrimination, the extent to which voting is racially polarized, and the extent to which the State has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group.  See id., at 4445.  Another relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.  Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1000.  The district courts determination whether the 2 requirements are satisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.  See Gingles, supra, at 7879.  Where the ultimate finding of dilution is based on a misreading of the governing law, however, there is reversible error.  De Grandy, supra, at 1022.  Pp.1820.


(c)Appellants have satisfied all three Gingles requirements as to District 23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the problem.  


The second and third Gingles factorsLatino cohesion, majority bloc votingare present, given the District Courts finding of racially polarized voting in the District 23 and throughout the State.  As to the first Gingles preconditionthat the minority group be large and compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member district, 478 U. S., at 50appellants have established that Latinos could have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines not been altered and that they do not have one now.  They constituted a majority of the citizen voting age population in District 23 under Plan 1151C.  The District Court suggested incorrectly that the district was not a Latino opportunity district in 2002 simply because the incumbent prevailed.  The fact that a group does not win elections does not resolve the vote dilution issue.  De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1014, n.11.  In old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration and overall population, the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in each successive election, the near victory of the Latino candidate of choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the incumbents continued election were the very reasons the State redrew the district lines.  Since the redistricting prevented the immediate success of the emergent Latino majority in District 23, there was a denial of opportunity in the real sense of that term.  Plan 1374Cs version of District 23, by contrast, is unquestionably not a Latino opportunity district.  That Latinos are now a bare majority of the districts voting-age population is not dispositive, since the relevant numbers must account for citizenship in order to determine the groups opportunity to elect candidates, and Latinos do not now have a citizen voting-age majority in the district.  


The States argument that it met its 2 obligations by creating new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district is rejected.  In a district line-drawing challenge, the first Gingles condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.  Id., at 1008.  The District Courts finding that the current plan contains six Latino opportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts, as proposed by appellant GI Forum, could not be drawn was not clearly erroneous.  However, the court failed to perform the required compactness inquiry between the number of Latino opportunity districts under the challengers proposal of reinstating Plan 1151C and the existing number of reasonably compact districts.  Ibid.  Section 2 does not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district, Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 999, but such a district cannot remedy a violation elsewhere in the State, see Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 916.  The lower court recognized there was a 300-mile gap between the two Latino communities in District 25, and a similarly large gap between the needs and interests of the two groups.  The courts conclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made the district compact, despite this combining of discrete communities of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed the issue only in the equal protection context, where compactness focuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant factor in drawing those lines.  See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916917.  Under 2, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the compactness inquiry considers the compactness of the minority population, not  the compactness of the contested district.  Vera, 517 U. S., at 997.  A district that reaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities is not reasonably compact.  Id., at 979.  The lower courts findings regarding the different characteristics, needs, and interests of the two widely scattered Latino communities in District 23 are well supported and uncontested.  The enormous geographical distances separating the two communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populationsnot either factor alonerenders District 25 noncompact for 2 purposes.  Therefore, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts, one fewer than Plan 1151C.  Pp.2029.


(d)The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a 2 violation.  The relevant proportionality inquiry, see De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1000, compares the percentage of total districts that are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population.  The States contention that proportionality should be decided on a regional basis is rejected in favor of appellants assertion that their claim requires a statewide analysis because they have alleged statewide vote dilution based on a statewide plan.  Looking statewide, there are 32 congressional districts.  The five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts amount to roughly 16% of the total, while Latinos make up 22% of Texas citizen voting-age population.  Latinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional representation.  Even deeming this disproportionality insubstantial would not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos in District 23.  The changes there undermined the progress of a racial group that has been subject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically active and cohesive.  Cf., e.g., id., at 1014.  Against this background, the Latinos diminishing electoral support for the incumbent indicates their belief he was unresponsive to their particularized needs.  In essence, the State took away their opportunity because they were about to exercise it.  Even accepting the District Courts finding that the States action was taken primarily for political, not racial, reasons, the redrawing of District 23s lines was damaging to its Latino voters.  The State not only made fruitless the Latinos mobilization efforts but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically active.  Although incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor in districting, see Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 740, not all of its forms are in the interests of the constituents.  If, as here, such protection means excluding some voters from the district simply because they are likely to vote against the officeholder, the change is to benefit the officeholder, not the voters.  This policy, whatever its validity in the political realm, cannot justify the effect on Latino voters.  See Gingles, supra, at 45.  Pp.2936.


(e)Because Plan 1374C violates 2 in its redrawing of District 23, appellants First Amendment and equal protection claims with respect to that district need not be addressed.  Their equal protection claim as to the drawing of District 25 need not be confronted because that district will have to be redrawn to remedy the District 23 violation.  Pp.3637.


Justice Kennedy concluded in Part II that because appellants have established no legally impermissible use of political classifications, they state no claim on which relief may be granted as to their contention that Texas statewide redistricting is an unconstitutional political gerrymander.  Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg joined Part IID.  Pp.715.


(a)Article I of the Constitution, 2 and 4, gives the States primary responsibility for apportionment of their  congressional  districts, Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 34, but 4 also permits Congress to set further requirements.  Neither the Constitution nor Congress has stated any explicit prohibition of mid-decade redistricting to change districts drawn earlier in conformance with a decennial census.  Although the legislative branch plays the primary role in congressional redistricting, courts have an important role when a districting plan violates the Constitution.  See, e.g., Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1.  That the federal courts sometimes must order legislative redistricting, however, does not shift the primary responsibility away from legislative bodies, see, e.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 540, who are free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their own, see, e.g., Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 44.  Judicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations.  Pp.710.


(b)Appellants claim unpersuasively that a decision to effect mid-decennial redistricting, when solely motivated by partisan objectives, presumptively violates equal protection and the First Amendment because it serves no legitimate public purpose and burdens one group because of its political opinions and affiliation.  For a number of reasons, that test is unconvincing.  There is some merit to the States assertion that partisan gain was not the sole motivation for replacing Plan 1151C: The contours of some contested district lines seem to have been drawn based on more mundane and local interests, and a number of line-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.  Moreover, a successful test for identifying unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering must do what appellants sole-motivation theory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the complainants representational rights.  See Vieth, supra, at 292295, 307308.  Appellants sole-intent standard is no more compelling when it is linked to the circumstance that Plan 1374C is mid-decennial legislation.  The Constitutions text and structure and this Courts cases indicate there is nothing inherently suspect about a legislatures decision to replace mid-decade a court-ordered plan with one of its own.  Even if there were, the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders.  Appellants test would leave untouched the 1991 Texas redistricting, which entrenched a party on the verge of minority status, while striking down the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the majority Republican Party capturing a larger share of the seats.  A test that treats these two similarly effective power plays in such different ways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.  Pp.1014.


(c)Appellants political gerrymandering theory that mid-decade redistricting for exclusively partisan purposes violates the one-person, one-vote requirement is rejected.  Although conceding that States operate under the legal fiction that their plans are constitutionally apportioned throughout a decade, see, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n.2, appellants contend that this fiction should not provide a safe harbor for a legislature that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan overriding a legal court-drawn plan.  This argument mirrors appellants attack on mid-decennial redistricting solely motivated by partisan considerations and is unsatisfactory for the same reasons.  Their further contention that the legislature intentionally sought to manipulate population variances when it enacted Plan 1374C is unconvincing because there is no District Court finding to that effect, and they present no specific evidence to support this serious allegation of bad faith.  Because they have not demonstrated that the legislatures decision to enact Plan 1374C constitutes a violation of the equal-population requirement, their subsidiary reliance on Larios v. Cox, 300 F.Supp. 2d 1320, summarily affd, 542 U. S. 947, is unavailing.  Pp.1416.


Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IV that the Dallas area redistricting does not violate 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Appellants allege that the Dallas changes dilute African-American voting strength because an African-American minority effectively controlled District 24 under Plan 1151C.  However, before Plan 1374C, District 24 had elected an Anglo Democrat to Congress in every election since 1978.  Since then, moreover, the incumbent has had no opposition in any of his primary elections, and African-Americans have consistently voted for him.  African-Americans were the second-largest racial group in the district after Anglos, but had only 25.7% of the citizen voting age population.  Even assuming that the first Gingles prong can accommodate appellants assertion that a 2 claim may be stated for a racial group that makes up less than 50% of the population, see, e.g., De Grandy, supra, at 1009, they must show they constitute a sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate of choice with the assistance of cross-over votes, Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 158.  The District Court committed no clear error in rejecting questionable evidence that African-Americans have the ability to elect their candidate of choice in favor of other evidence that an African-American candidate of choice would not prevail.  See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574.  That African-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to state a 2 claim.  If it did, it would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 491.  Id., at 480, 482, distinguished.  Appellants do not raise a district-specific political gerrymandering claim against District 24.  Pp. 3741.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that appellants have not provided a reliable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymanders, but noted that the question whether any such standard existsi.e., whether a challenge to such a gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversyhas not been argued in these cases.  The Chief Justice and Justice Alito therefore take no position on that question, which has divided the Court, see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, and join the pluralitys Part II disposition without specifying whether appellants have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted or failed to present a justiciable controversy.  Pp.12.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that appellants claims of unconstitutional political gerrymandering do not present a justiciable case or controversy, see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 271306 (plurality opinion), and that their vote-dilution claims premised on 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 lack merit for the reasons set forth in Justice Thomass opinion concurring in the judgment in Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 891946.  Reviewing appellants race-based equal protection claims, Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded that the District Court did not commit clear error in rejecting appellant GI Forums assertion that the removal of Latino residents from District 23 constituted intentional vote dilution.  Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, subjected the intentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district to strict scrutiny and held that standard satisfied because appellants conceded that the creation of this district was reasonably necessary to comply with 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is a compelling state interest, and did not argue that Texas did more than that provision required it to do.

			"|"LEAGUE OF UNITED LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS etal. v. PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, etal.
appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of texas
No. 05204.Argued March 1, 2006Decided June 28, 2006
The 1990 census resulted in a 3-seat increase over the 27 seats previously allotted the Texas congressional delegation.  Although the Democratic Party then controlled 19 of those 27 seats, as well as both state legislative houses and the governorship, change was in the air: The Republican Party had received 47% of the 1990 statewide vote, while the Democrats had received only 51%.  Faced with a possible Republican ascent to majority status, the legislature drew a congressional redistricting plan that favored Democratic candidates.  The Republicans challenged the 1991 Plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but to no avail.


The 2000 census authorized two additional seats for the Texas delegation.  The Republicans then controlled the governorship and the State Senate, but did not yet control the State House of Representatives.  So constituted, the legislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in litigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with the U. S. Constitutions one-person, one-vote requirement.  Conscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional districts lies with the political branches of government, and hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another, the three-judge Federal District Court sought to apply only neutral redistricting standards when drawing Plan 1151C, including placing the two new seats in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct lines, and avoiding the pairing of incumbents.  Under Plan 1151C, the 2002 congressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in votes for statewide office in 2000, thus leaving the 1991 Democratic gerrymander largely in place.


In 2003, however, Texas Republicans gained control of both houses of the legislature and set out to increase Republican representation in the congressional delegation.  After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C.  In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide races against the Democrats 41%.  Soon after Plan 1374C was enacted, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of constitutional and statutory violations.  In 2004 the District Court entered judgment for appellees, but this Court vacated the decision and remanded for consideration in light of Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267.  On remand, the District Court, believing the scope of its mandate was limited to questions of political gerrymandering, again rejected appellants claims.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are remanded. 
399 F.Supp. 2d 756, affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. 
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts IIA and III, concluding:


1.This Court held, in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 118127, that an equal protection challenge to a political gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversy, although it could not agree on what substantive standard to apply, compare id., at 127137, with id., at 161162.  That disagreement persists.  The Vieth plurality would have held such challenges nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority declined to do so, see 541 U. S., at 306, 317, 343, 355.  Justiciability is not revisited here.  At issue is whether appellants offer a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for determining whether a partisan gerrymander is unconstitutional.  P. 7.  


2.Texas redrawing of District 23s lines amounts to vote dilution violative of 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Pp.1736.


(a)Plan 1374Cs changes to District 23 served the dual goals of increasing Republican seats and protecting the incumbent Republican against an increasingly powerful Latino population that threatened to oust him, with the additional political nuance that he would be reelected in a district that had a Latino majority as to voting age population, though not a Latino majority as to citizen voting age population or an effective Latino voting majority.  The District 23 changes required adjustments elsewhere, so the State created new District 25 to avoid retrogression under 5 of the Act.  Pp.1718.


(b)A State violates 2 if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election  are not [as] equally open to  members of [a racial group as they are to] other members of the electorate.  42 U. S.C. 1973(b).  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 5051, identified three threshold conditions for establishing a 2 violation: (1) the racial group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; (2) the group must be politically cohesive; and (3) the white majority must vot[e] sufficiently as a bloc to enable it  usually to defeat the minoritys preferred candidate.  The legislative history identifies factors that courts can use, once all three threshold requirements are met, in interpreting 2s totality of circumstances standard, including the States history of voting-related discrimination, the extent to which voting is racially polarized, and the extent to which the State has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group.  See id., at 4445.  Another relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.  Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1000.  The district courts determination whether the 2 requirements are satisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.  See Gingles, supra, at 7879.  Where the ultimate finding of dilution is based on a misreading of the governing law, however, there is reversible error.  De Grandy, supra, at 1022.  Pp.1820.


(c)Appellants have satisfied all three Gingles requirements as to District 23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the problem.  


The second and third Gingles factorsLatino cohesion, majority bloc votingare present, given the District Courts finding of racially polarized voting in the District 23 and throughout the State.  As to the first Gingles preconditionthat the minority group be large and compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member district, 478 U. S., at 50appellants have established that Latinos could have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines not been altered and that they do not have one now.  They constituted a majority of the citizen voting age population in District 23 under Plan 1151C.  The District Court suggested incorrectly that the district was not a Latino opportunity district in 2002 simply because the incumbent prevailed.  The fact that a group does not win elections does not resolve the vote dilution issue.  De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1014, n.11.  In old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration and overall population, the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in each successive election, the near victory of the Latino candidate of choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the incumbents continued election were the very reasons the State redrew the district lines.  Since the redistricting prevented the immediate success of the emergent Latino majority in District 23, there was a denial of opportunity in the real sense of that term.  Plan 1374Cs version of District 23, by contrast, is unquestionably not a Latino opportunity district.  That Latinos are now a bare majority of the districts voting-age population is not dispositive, since the relevant numbers must account for citizenship in order to determine the groups opportunity to elect candidates, and Latinos do not now have a citizen voting-age majority in the district.  


The States argument that it met its 2 obligations by creating new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district is rejected.  In a district line-drawing challenge, the first Gingles condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.  Id., at 1008.  The District Courts finding that the current plan contains six Latino opportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts, as proposed by appellant GI Forum, could not be drawn was not clearly erroneous.  However, the court failed to perform the required compactness inquiry between the number of Latino opportunity districts under the challengers proposal of reinstating Plan 1151C and the existing number of reasonably compact districts.  Ibid.  Section 2 does not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district, Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 999, but such a district cannot remedy a violation elsewhere in the State, see Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 916.  The lower court recognized there was a 300-mile gap between the two Latino communities in District 25, and a similarly large gap between the needs and interests of the two groups.  The courts conclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made the district compact, despite this combining of discrete communities of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed the issue only in the equal protection context, where compactness focuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant factor in drawing those lines.  See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 916917.  Under 2, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the compactness inquiry considers the compactness of the minority population, not  the compactness of the contested district.  Vera, 517 U. S., at 997.  A district that reaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities is not reasonably compact.  Id., at 979.  The lower courts findings regarding the different characteristics, needs, and interests of the two widely scattered Latino communities in District 23 are well supported and uncontested.  The enormous geographical distances separating the two communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populationsnot either factor alonerenders District 25 noncompact for 2 purposes.  Therefore, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts, one fewer than Plan 1151C.  Pp.2029.


(d)The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a 2 violation.  The relevant proportionality inquiry, see De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1000, compares the percentage of total districts that are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population.  The States contention that proportionality should be decided on a regional basis is rejected in favor of appellants assertion that their claim requires a statewide analysis because they have alleged statewide vote dilution based on a statewide plan.  Looking statewide, there are 32 congressional districts.  The five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts amount to roughly 16% of the total, while Latinos make up 22% of Texas citizen voting-age population.  Latinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional representation.  Even deeming this disproportionality insubstantial would not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos in District 23.  The changes there undermined the progress of a racial group that has been subject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically active and cohesive.  Cf., e.g., id., at 1014.  Against this background, the Latinos diminishing electoral support for the incumbent indicates their belief he was unresponsive to their particularized needs.  In essence, the State took away their opportunity because they were about to exercise it.  Even accepting the District Courts finding that the States action was taken primarily for political, not racial, reasons, the redrawing of District 23s lines was damaging to its Latino voters.  The State not only made fruitless the Latinos mobilization efforts but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically active.  Although incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor in districting, see Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U. S. 725, 740, not all of its forms are in the interests of the constituents.  If, as here, such protection means excluding some voters from the district simply because they are likely to vote against the officeholder, the change is to benefit the officeholder, not the voters.  This policy, whatever its validity in the political realm, cannot justify the effect on Latino voters.  See Gingles, supra, at 45.  Pp.2936.


(e)Because Plan 1374C violates 2 in its redrawing of District 23, appellants First Amendment and equal protection claims with respect to that district need not be addressed.  Their equal protection claim as to the drawing of District 25 need not be confronted because that district will have to be redrawn to remedy the District 23 violation.  Pp.3637.


Justice Kennedy concluded in Part II that because appellants have established no legally impermissible use of political classifications, they state no claim on which relief may be granted as to their contention that Texas statewide redistricting is an unconstitutional political gerrymander.  Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg joined Part IID.  Pp.715.


(a)Article I of the Constitution, 2 and 4, gives the States primary responsibility for apportionment of their  congressional  districts, Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 34, but 4 also permits Congress to set further requirements.  Neither the Constitution nor Congress has stated any explicit prohibition of mid-decade redistricting to change districts drawn earlier in conformance with a decennial census.  Although the legislative branch plays the primary role in congressional redistricting, courts have an important role when a districting plan violates the Constitution.  See, e.g., Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1.  That the federal courts sometimes must order legislative redistricting, however, does not shift the primary responsibility away from legislative bodies, see, e.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535, 540, who are free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their own, see, e.g., Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37, 44.  Judicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations.  Pp.710.


(b)Appellants claim unpersuasively that a decision to effect mid-decennial redistricting, when solely motivated by partisan objectives, presumptively violates equal protection and the First Amendment because it serves no legitimate public purpose and burdens one group because of its political opinions and affiliation.  For a number of reasons, that test is unconvincing.  There is some merit to the States assertion that partisan gain was not the sole motivation for replacing Plan 1151C: The contours of some contested district lines seem to have been drawn based on more mundane and local interests, and a number of line-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.  Moreover, a successful test for identifying unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering must do what appellants sole-motivation theory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the complainants representational rights.  See Vieth, supra, at 292295, 307308.  Appellants sole-intent standard is no more compelling when it is linked to the circumstance that Plan 1374C is mid-decennial legislation.  The Constitutions text and structure and this Courts cases indicate there is nothing inherently suspect about a legislatures decision to replace mid-decade a court-ordered plan with one of its own.  Even if there were, the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders.  Appellants test would leave untouched the 1991 Texas redistricting, which entrenched a party on the verge of minority status, while striking down the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the majority Republican Party capturing a larger share of the seats.  A test that treats these two similarly effective power plays in such different ways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.  Pp.1014.


(c)Appellants political gerrymandering theory that mid-decade redistricting for exclusively partisan purposes violates the one-person, one-vote requirement is rejected.  Although conceding that States operate under the legal fiction that their plans are constitutionally apportioned throughout a decade, see, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 488, n.2, appellants contend that this fiction should not provide a safe harbor for a legislature that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan overriding a legal court-drawn plan.  This argument mirrors appellants attack on mid-decennial redistricting solely motivated by partisan considerations and is unsatisfactory for the same reasons.  Their further contention that the legislature intentionally sought to manipulate population variances when it enacted Plan 1374C is unconvincing because there is no District Court finding to that effect, and they present no specific evidence to support this serious allegation of bad faith.  Because they have not demonstrated that the legislatures decision to enact Plan 1374C constitutes a violation of the equal-population requirement, their subsidiary reliance on Larios v. Cox, 300 F.Supp. 2d 1320, summarily affd, 542 U. S. 947, is unavailing.  Pp.1416.


Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IV that the Dallas area redistricting does not violate 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Appellants allege that the Dallas changes dilute African-American voting strength because an African-American minority effectively controlled District 24 under Plan 1151C.  However, before Plan 1374C, District 24 had elected an Anglo Democrat to Congress in every election since 1978.  Since then, moreover, the incumbent has had no opposition in any of his primary elections, and African-Americans have consistently voted for him.  African-Americans were the second-largest racial group in the district after Anglos, but had only 25.7% of the citizen voting age population.  Even assuming that the first Gingles prong can accommodate appellants assertion that a 2 claim may be stated for a racial group that makes up less than 50% of the population, see, e.g., De Grandy, supra, at 1009, they must show they constitute a sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate of choice with the assistance of cross-over votes, Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 158.  The District Court committed no clear error in rejecting questionable evidence that African-Americans have the ability to elect their candidate of choice in favor of other evidence that an African-American candidate of choice would not prevail.  See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564, 574.  That African-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to state a 2 claim.  If it did, it would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.  See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 491.  Id., at 480, 482, distinguished.  Appellants do not raise a district-specific political gerrymandering claim against District 24.  Pp. 3741.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito, agreed that appellants have not provided a reliable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymanders, but noted that the question whether any such standard existsi.e., whether a challenge to such a gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversyhas not been argued in these cases.  The Chief Justice and Justice Alito therefore take no position on that question, which has divided the Court, see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, and join the pluralitys Part II disposition without specifying whether appellants have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted or failed to present a justiciable controversy.  Pp.12.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded that appellants claims of unconstitutional political gerrymandering do not present a justiciable case or controversy, see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 271306 (plurality opinion), and that their vote-dilution claims premised on 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 lack merit for the reasons set forth in Justice Thomass opinion concurring in the judgment in Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 891946.  Reviewing appellants race-based equal protection claims, Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded that the District Court did not commit clear error in rejecting appellant GI Forums assertion that the removal of Latino residents from District 23 constituted intentional vote dilution.  Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, subjected the intentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district to strict scrutiny and held that standard satisfied because appellants conceded that the creation of this district was reasonably necessary to comply with 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is a compelling state interest, and did not argue that Texas did more than that provision required it to do.

04-1170|"KANSAS v. MARSH
certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
No. 041170.Argued December 7, 2005Reargued April 25, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
Finding three aggravating circumstances that were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, a Kansas jury convicted respondent Marsh of, inter alia, capital murder and sentenced him to death.  Marsh claimed on direct appeal that Kan. Stat. Ann. 214624(e) establishes an unconstitutional presumption in favor of death by directing imposition of the death penalty when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise.  Agreeing, the Kansas Supreme Court concluded that 214624(e)s weighing equation violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and remanded for a new trial.
Held:
1.This Court has jurisdiction to review the Kansas Supreme Courts judgment under 28 U. S.C. 1257.  That provision authorizes review of a States final judgment when a state statutes validity is questioned on federal constitutional grounds, and it permits review even when the state-court proceedings are not complete where the federal claim has been finally decided and later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the cases outcome, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 481.  Although Marsh will be retried, the State Supreme Courts determination that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional is final and binding on the lower state courts.  Thus, the State will be unable to obtain further review of its law in this case.  This Court has deemed lower court decisions final for 1257 purposes in like circumstances, see, e.g.,  Florida v. Meyers, 466 U. S. 380 (per curiam).  Pp.34.


2.The State Supreme Courts judgment is not supported by adequate and independent state grounds.  Marsh maintains that the judgment was based on state law, the State Supreme Court having previously reviewed the statute in State v. Kleypas.  However, Kleypas itself rested on federal law.  In this case, the State Supreme Court chastised the Kleypas court for avoiding the constitutional issue, squarely found 214624(e) unconstitutional on its face, and overruled Kleypas in relevant part.  Pp.45.


3.Kansas capital sentencing statute is constitutional.  Pp.519.


(a)Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, requires approval of the Kansas statute.  There, the Court held that a state death penalty statute may give the defendant the burden to prove that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  A fortiori, Kansas death penalty statute, consistent with the Constitution, may direct imposition of the death penalty when the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including where the two are in equipoise.  Pp.59.


(b)Even if, as Marsh contends, Walton does not directly control here, general principles in this Courts death penalty jurisprudence lead to the same conclusion.  So long as a state system satisfies the requirements of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153that a system must rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants and must permit a jury to render a reasonable, individualized sentencing determinationa State has a range of discretion in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed.  The use of mitigation evidence is a product of the individual-sentencing requirement.  Defendants have the right to present sentencers with information relevant to the sentencing decision and sentencers are obliged to consider that information in determining the appropriate sentence.  The thrust of this Courts mitigation jurisprudence ends here, for the Court has never held that the Constitution requires a specific method for balancing aggravating and mitigating factors.  Pp.911.


(c)Kansas death penalty statute satisfies the constitutional mandates of Furman and its progeny because it rationally narrows the class of death-eligible defendants and permits a jury to consider any mitigating evidence relevant to its sentencing determination.  The States weighing equation merely channels a jurys discretion by providing criteria by which the jury may determine whether life or death is appropriate.  Its system provides the kind of guided discretion sanctioned in, e.g., Walton, supra.  Contrary to Marshs argument, 214624(e) does not create a general presumption in favor of the death penalty.  A life sentence must be imposed if the State fails to demonstrate the existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, if the State cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, or if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision in any respect.  Marshs contentions that an equipoise determination reflects juror confusion or inability to decide between life and death or that the jury may use equipoise as a loophole to shirk its constitutional duty to render a reasoned, moral sentencing decision rest on an implausible characterization of the Kansas statutethat a jurys determination that aggravators and mitigators are in equipoise is not a decision, much less a decision for death.  Weighing is not an end, but a means to reaching a decision.  Kansas instructions clearly inform the jury that a determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a decision for death.  Pp.1116.

			"|"KANSAS v. MARSH
certiorari to the supreme court of kansas
No. 041170.Argued December 7, 2005Reargued April 25, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
Finding three aggravating circumstances that were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, a Kansas jury convicted respondent Marsh of, inter alia, capital murder and sentenced him to death.  Marsh claimed on direct appeal that Kan. Stat. Ann. 214624(e) establishes an unconstitutional presumption in favor of death by directing imposition of the death penalty when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are in equipoise.  Agreeing, the Kansas Supreme Court concluded that 214624(e)s weighing equation violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and remanded for a new trial.
Held:
1.This Court has jurisdiction to review the Kansas Supreme Courts judgment under 28 U. S.C. 1257.  That provision authorizes review of a States final judgment when a state statutes validity is questioned on federal constitutional grounds, and it permits review even when the state-court proceedings are not complete where the federal claim has been finally decided and later review of the federal issue cannot be had, whatever the cases outcome, Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 481.  Although Marsh will be retried, the State Supreme Courts determination that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional is final and binding on the lower state courts.  Thus, the State will be unable to obtain further review of its law in this case.  This Court has deemed lower court decisions final for 1257 purposes in like circumstances, see, e.g.,  Florida v. Meyers, 466 U. S. 380 (per curiam).  Pp.34.


2.The State Supreme Courts judgment is not supported by adequate and independent state grounds.  Marsh maintains that the judgment was based on state law, the State Supreme Court having previously reviewed the statute in State v. Kleypas.  However, Kleypas itself rested on federal law.  In this case, the State Supreme Court chastised the Kleypas court for avoiding the constitutional issue, squarely found 214624(e) unconstitutional on its face, and overruled Kleypas in relevant part.  Pp.45.


3.Kansas capital sentencing statute is constitutional.  Pp.519.


(a)Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, requires approval of the Kansas statute.  There, the Court held that a state death penalty statute may give the defendant the burden to prove that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances.  A fortiori, Kansas death penalty statute, consistent with the Constitution, may direct imposition of the death penalty when the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mitigators do not outweigh aggravators, including where the two are in equipoise.  Pp.59.


(b)Even if, as Marsh contends, Walton does not directly control here, general principles in this Courts death penalty jurisprudence lead to the same conclusion.  So long as a state system satisfies the requirements of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153that a system must rationally narrow the class of death-eligible defendants and must permit a jury to render a reasonable, individualized sentencing determinationa State has a range of discretion in imposing the death penalty, including the manner in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are weighed.  The use of mitigation evidence is a product of the individual-sentencing requirement.  Defendants have the right to present sentencers with information relevant to the sentencing decision and sentencers are obliged to consider that information in determining the appropriate sentence.  The thrust of this Courts mitigation jurisprudence ends here, for the Court has never held that the Constitution requires a specific method for balancing aggravating and mitigating factors.  Pp.911.


(c)Kansas death penalty statute satisfies the constitutional mandates of Furman and its progeny because it rationally narrows the class of death-eligible defendants and permits a jury to consider any mitigating evidence relevant to its sentencing determination.  The States weighing equation merely channels a jurys discretion by providing criteria by which the jury may determine whether life or death is appropriate.  Its system provides the kind of guided discretion sanctioned in, e.g., Walton, supra.  Contrary to Marshs argument, 214624(e) does not create a general presumption in favor of the death penalty.  A life sentence must be imposed if the State fails to demonstrate the existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, if the State cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, or if the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision in any respect.  Marshs contentions that an equipoise determination reflects juror confusion or inability to decide between life and death or that the jury may use equipoise as a loophole to shirk its constitutional duty to render a reasoned, moral sentencing decision rest on an implausible characterization of the Kansas statutethat a jurys determination that aggravators and mitigators are in equipoise is not a decision, much less a decision for death.  Weighing is not an end, but a means to reaching a decision.  Kansas instructions clearly inform the jury that a determination that the evidence is in equipoise is a decision for death.  Pp.1116.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 041528.Argued February 28, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
Vermonts Act 64 stringently limits both the amounts that candidates for state office may spend on their campaigns and the amounts that individuals, organizations, and political parties may contribute to those campaigns.  Soon after Act 64 became law, the petitionersindividuals who have run for state office, citizens who vote in state elections and contribute to campaigns, and political parties and committees participating in state politicsbrought this suit against the respondents, state officials charged with enforcing the Act.  The District Court held that Act 64s expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, and that the Acts limits on political parties contributions to candidates were unconstitutional, but found the other contribution limits constitutional.  The Second Circuit held that all of the Acts contribution limits are constitutional, ruled that the expenditure limits may be constitutional because they are supported by compelling interests in preventing corruption or its appearance and in limiting the time state officials must spend raising campaign funds, and remanded for the District Court to determine whether the expenditure limits were narrowly tailored to those interests.
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.
382 F.3d 91, reversed and remanded.
Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Parts I, IIB3, III, and IV that both of Act 64s sets of limitations are inconsistent with the First Amendment.  Pp.68, 1029.


1.The expenditure limits violate the First Amendments free speech guarantees under Buckley.  Pp.68, 1011.


(a)In Buckley, the Court held, inter alia, that the Governments asserted interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption, 424 U. S., at 25, provided sufficient justification for the contribution limitations imposed on campaigns for federal office by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, id., at 2338, but that FECAs expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment, id., at 3959.  The Court explained that the difference between the two kinds of limitations is that expenditure limits impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do contribution limits.  Id., at 23.  Contribution limits, though a marginal restriction, nevertheless leave the contributor fre[e] to discuss candidates and issues.  Id., at 2021.  Expenditure limits, by contrast, impose [a] restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication, id., at 19, and thereby necessarily reduc[e] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached, ibid.  For over 30 years, in considering the constitutionality of a host of campaign finance statutes, this Court has adhered to Buckleys constraints, including those on expenditure limits.  See, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, 134.  Pp.68.


(b)The respondents argue unpersuasively that Buckley should be distinguished from the present cases on a ground they say Buckley did not consider: that expenditure limits help to protect candidates from spending too much time raising money rather than devoting that time to campaigning among ordinary voters.  There is no significant basis for that distinction.  Act 64s expenditure limits are not substantially different from those at issue in Buckley.  Nor is Vermonts primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits significantly different from Congress rationale for the Buckley limits: preventing corruption and its appearance.  The respondents say unpersuasively that, had the Buckley Court considered the time protection rationale for expenditure limits, the Court would have upheld those limits in the FECA.  The Buckley Court, however, was aware of the connection between expenditure limits and a reduction in fundraising time.  And, in any event, the connection seems perfectly obvious.  Under these circumstances, the respondents argument amounts to no more than an invitation so to limit Buckleys holding as effectively to overrule it.  That invitation is declined.  Pp.1011.


2.Act 64s contribution limits violate the First Amendment because those limits, in their specific details, burden protected interests in a manner disproportionate to the public purposes they were enacted to advance.  Pp.1129.


(a)In upholding the $1,000 contribution limit before it, the Buckley Court recognized, inter alia, that such limits, unlike expenditure limits, involv[e] little direct restraint on the contributors speech, 424 U. S., at 21, and are permissible as long as the government demonstrates that they are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest, id., at 25.  It found that the interest there advanced, prevent[ing] corruption and its appearance, was sufficiently important to justify the contribution limits, id., at 2526, and that those limits were closely drawn.  Although recognizing that, in determining whether a particular contribution limit was closely drawn, the amount, or level, of that limit could make a difference, see id., at 21, the Court added that such distinctions in degree become significant only when they  amount to differences in kind, id., at 30.  Pointing out that it had no scalpel to probe, whether, say, a $2,000 ceiling might not serve as well as $1,000, ibid., the Court found no indication that FECAs contribution limitations would have any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns, id., at 21.  Since Buckley, the Court has consistently upheld contribution limits in other statutes, but has recognized that such limits might sometimes work more harm to protected First Amendment interests than their anticorruption objectives could justify, see, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 395397.  Pp.1213. 


(b)Although the Court has no scalpel to probe, 424 U. S., at 30, with exactitude whether particular contribution limits are too low and normally defers to the legislature in that regard, it must nevertheless recognize the existence of some lower bound, as Buckley acknowledges.  While the interests served by contribution limits, preventing corruption and its appearance, directly implicate the integrity of our electoral process, McConnell, supra, at 136, that does not simply mean the lower the limit, the better.  Contribution limits that are too low also can harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders, thereby reducing democratic accountability.  Where there is strong indication in a particular case, i.e., danger signs, that such risks exist (both present in kind and likely serious in degree), courts, including appellate courts, must review the record independently and carefully with an eye toward assessing the statutes tailoring, i.e., toward assessing the restrictions proportionality.  See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 499.  Danger signs that Act 64s contribution limits may fall outside tolerable First Amendment limits are present here.  They are substantially lower than both the limits the Court has previously upheld and the comparable limits in force in other States.  Consequently, the record must be examined to determine whether Act 64s contribution limits are closely drawn to match the States interests.  Pp.1319. 


(c)The record demonstrates that, from a constitutional perspective, Act 64s contribution limits are too restrictive.  Five sets of factors, taken together, lead to the conclusion that those limits are not narrowly tailored.  First, the record suggests, though it does not conclusively prove, that Act 64s contribution limits will significantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns.  Second, Act 64s insistence that a political party and all of its affiliates together abide by exactly the same low $200 to $400 contribution limits that apply to individual contributors threatens harm to a particularly important political right, the right to associate in a political party.  See, e.g., California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 574.  Although the Court upheld federal limits on political parties contributions to candidates in Federal Election Commn v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm., 533 U. S. 431, the limits there at issue were far less problematic, for they were significantly higher than Act 64s limits, see, e.g., id., at 438439, and n.3, and they were much higher than the federal limits on contributions from individuals to candidates, see id., at 453.  Third, Act 64s treatment of volunteer services aggravates the problem.  Although the Act excludes uncompensated volunteer services from its contribution definition, it does not exclude the expenses volunteers incur, e.g., travel expenses, in the course of campaign activities.  The combination of very low contribution limits and the absence of an exception excluding volunteer expenses may well impede a campaigns ability effectively to use volunteers, thereby making it more difficult for individuals to associate in this way.  Cf. Buckley, supra, at 22.  Fourth, unlike the contribution limits upheld in Shrink, Act 64s limits are not adjusted for inflation, but decline in real value each year.  A failure to index limits means that limits already suspiciously low will almost inevitably become too low over time.  Fifth, nowhere in the record is there any special justification for Act 64s low and restrictive contribution limits.  Rather, the basic justifications the State has advanced in support of such limits are those present in Buckley.  Indeed, other things being equal, one might reasonably believe that a contribution of, say, $250 (or $450) to a candidates campaign was less likely to prove a corruptive force than the far larger contributions at issue in the other campaign finance cases the Court has considered.  Pp.1928.


(d)It is not possible to sever some of the Acts contribution limit provisions from others that might remain fully operative.  Doing so would require the Court to write words into the statute (inflation indexing), to leave gaping loopholes (no limits on party contributions), or to foresee which of many different possible ways the Vermont Legislature might respond to the constitutional objections to Act 64.  In these circumstances, the legislature likely would not have intended the Court to set aside the statutes contribution limits.  The legislature is free to rewrite those provisions to address the constitutional difficulties here identified.  Pp. 2829. 


Justice Breyer, joined by The Chief Justice in Parts IIB1 and IIB2, rejected the respondents argument that Buckley should, in effect, be overruled because subsequent experience has shown that contribution limits alone cannot effectively deter corruption or its appearance.  Stare decisis, the basic legal principle commanding judicial respect for a courts earlier decisions and their rules of law, prevents the overruling of Buckley.  Adherence to precedent is the norm; departure from it is exceptional, requiring special justification, Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212, especially where, as here, the principle at issue has become settled through iteration and reiteration over a long period.  There is no special justification here.  Subsequent case law has not made Buckley a legal anomaly or otherwise undermined its basic legal principles.  Cf. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443.  Nor is there any demonstration that circumstances have changed so radically as to undermine Buckleys critical factual assumptions.  The respondents have not shown, for example, any dramatic increase in corruption or its appearance in Vermont; nor have they shown that expenditure limits are the only way to attack that problem.  Cf. McConnell, supra.  Finally, overruling Buckley now would dramatically undermine the considerable reliance that Congress and state legislatures have placed upon it in drafting campaign finance laws.  And this Court has followed Buckley, upholding and applying its reasoning in later cases.  Pp.810.


Justice Alito agreed that Act 64s expenditure and contribution limits violate the First Amendment, but concluded that respondents backup argument asking this Court to revisit Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, need not be reached because they have failed to address considerations of stare decisis.  Pp.12.


Justice Kennedy agreed that Vermonts limitations on campaign expenditures and contributions violate the First Amendment, but concluded that, given his skepticism regarding this Courts campaign finance jurisprudence, see, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, 286287, 313, it is appropriate for him to concur only in the judgment.  Pp.13. 


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, agreed that Vermonts Act 64 is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the pluralitys rationale for striking down that statute.  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, provides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by stare decisis, and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful to the Amendment.  This Court erred in Buckley when it distinguished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.  See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410418.  Both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act 64 should be subjected to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.  See, e.g., Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Commn, 518 U. S. 604, 640641.  Pp.110.
Breyer, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., joined, and in which Alito, J., joined as to all but Parts IIB1 and IIB2.

S. 1, need not be reached because they have failed to address considerations of stare decisis.  Pp.12.


Justice Kennedy agreed that Vermonts limitations on campaign expenditures and contributions violate the First Amendment, but concluded that, given his skepticism regarding this Courts campaign finance jurisprudence, see, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, 286287, 313, it is appropriate for him to concur only in the judgment.  Pp.13. 


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, agreed that Vermonts Act 64 is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the pluralitys rationale for striking down that statute.  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, provides insufficient protection to political speech, the core of the First Amendment, is therefore illegitimate and not protected by stare decisis, and should be overruled and replaced with a standard faithful to the Amendment.  This Court erred in Buckley when it distinguished between contribution and expenditure limits, finding the former to be a less severe infringement on First Amendment rights.  See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 410418.  Both the contribution and expenditure restrictions of Act 64 should be subjected to strict scrutiny, which they would fail.  See, e.g., Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Commn, 518 U. S. 604, 640641.  Pp.110.
Breyer, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., joined, and in which Alito, J., joined as to all but Parts IIB1 and IIB2.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  Kennedy, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

05-18|"ARLINGTON CENTRAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION v. MURPHY et vir.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 0518.Argued April 19, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
After respondents prevailed in their Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) action to require petitioner school board to pay for their sons private school tuition, they sought fees for services rendered by an educational consultant during the proceedings, relying on an IDEA provision that permits a court to award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to prevailing parents, 20 U. S.C. 1415(i)(3)(B).  The District Court granted their motion in part.  Affirming, the Second Circuit noted that, under Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437, and West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, a cost- or fee-shifting provision will not be read to permit recovery of expert fees without explicit statutory authority, but concluded that a congressional Conference Committee Report relating to 1415(i)(3)(B) and a footnote in Casey referencing that Report showed that the IDEA authorized such reimbursement.
Held:Section 1415(i)(3)(B) does not authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.  Pp.312.
(a)The resolution of this question is guided by the fact that Congress enacted the IDEA pursuant to the Spending Clause.  While Congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States, any conditions it attaches to a States acceptance of such funds must be set out unambiguously.  Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17.  Fund recipients are bound only by those conditions that they accept voluntarily and knowingly, ibid., and States cannot knowingly accept conditions of which they are unaware or which they are unable to ascertain, ibid.  Thus, the question here is whether the IDEA furnishes clear notice regarding expert fees.  Pp.34.


(b)The Court begins with the IDEAs text, for if its language is plain, the courts function is to enforce it according to its terms.  Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U. S. 1, 6.  While 1415(i)(3)(B) provides for an award of reasonable attorneys fees, it does not even hint that acceptance of IDEA funds makes a State responsible for reimbursing prevailing parents for the services of experts.  Costs is a term of art that does not generally include expert fees.  The use of costs rather than expenses strongly suggests that 1415(i)(3)(B) was not meant to be an open-ended provision making States liable for all expenses.  Moreover, 1415(i)(3)(B) says not that a court may award costs but that it may award attorneys fees as part of the costs.  This language simply adds reasonable attorneys fees to the list of recoverable costs set out in 28 U. S.C. 1920, the general statute covering taxation of costs, which is strictly limited by 1821.  Thus, 1415(i)(3)(B)s text does not authorize an award of additional expert fees, and it certainly fails to present the clear notice required by the Spending Clause.  Other IDEA provisions point strongly in the same direction.  Of little significance here is a provision in the Handicapped Childrens Protection Act of 1986 requiring the General Accounting Office to collect data on awards to prevailing parties in IDEA cases, but making no mention of consultants or experts or their fees.  And the fact that the provision directed the GAO to compile data on the hours spent by consultants in IDEA cases does not mean that Congress intended for States to compensate prevailing parties for fees billed by these consultants.  Pp.48.


(c)Crawford Fitting Co. and Casey strongly reinforce the conclusion that the IDEA does not unambiguously authorize prevailing parents to recover expert fees.  Crawford Fitting Co.s reasoning supports the conclusion that the term costs in 1415(i)(3)(B), like costs in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), the provision at issue there, is defined by the categories of expenses enumerated in 28 U. S.C. 1920.  This conclusion is buttressed by the principle, recognized in Crawford Fitting Co., that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing witness fees as costs unless the statute refer[s] explicitly to witness fees.  482 U. S., at 445.  The conclusion that the IDEA does not authorize expert fee awards is confirmed even more dramatically by Casey, where the Court held that 42 U. S.C. 1988, a fee-shifting provision with wording virtually identical to that of 20 U. S.C. 1415(i)(3)(B), did not empower a district court to award expert fees to a prevailing party.  482 U. S., at 102.  The Second Circuit misunderstood the meaning of the Casey footnote on which it relied.  That footnote did not state that the Conference Committee Report set out the correct interpretation of 1415(i)(3)(B) or provided the clear notice required under the Spending Clause.  Its thrust was simply that attorneys fees, standing alone, is generally not understood as encompassing expert fees.  Pp.811.


(d)Respondents additional arguments are unpersuasive.  The IDEAs goals of ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education, 1400(d)(1)(A), and of safeguarding parents right to challenge adverse school decisions are too general to provide much support for their reading of the IDEA.  And the IDEAs legislative history is insufficient help, where everything other than that history overwhelmingly suggests that expert fees may not be recovered.  Pp.1112.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 05352.Argued April 18, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
Respondent hired attorney Low to represent him on a federal drug charge.  The District Court denied Lows application for admission pro hac vice on the ground that he had violated a professional conduct rule and then, with one exception, prevented respondent from meeting or consulting with Low throughout the trial.  The jury found respondent guilty.  Reversing, the Eighth Circuit held that the District Court erred in interpreting the disciplinary rule, that the courts refusal to admit Low therefore violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to paid counsel of his choosing, and that this violation was not subject to harmless-error review.  
Held:A trial courts erroneous deprivation of a criminal defendants choice of counsel entitles him to reversal of his conviction.  Pp.312.
(a)In light of the Governments concession of erroneous deprivation, the trial courts error violated respondents Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice.  The Court rejects the Governments contention that the violation is not complete unless the defendant can show that substitute counsel was ineffective within the meaning of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 691696i.e., that his performance was deficient and the defendant was prejudiced by itor the defendant can demonstrate that substitute counsels performance, while not deficient, was not as good as what his counsel of choice would have provided, creating a reasonable probability that  the result  would have been different, id., at 694.  To support these propositions, the Government emphasizes that the right to counsel is accorded to ensure that the accused receive a fair trial, Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U. S. 162, 166, and asserts that a trial is not unfair unless a defendant has been prejudiced.  The right to counsel of choice, however, commands not that a trial be fair, but that a particular guarantee of fairness be providedto wit, that the accused be defended by the counsel he believes to be best.  Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 61.  That right was violated here; no additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation complete.  Pp.37.  


(b)The Sixth Amendment violation is not subject to harmless-error analysis.  Erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice, with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as structural error.  Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 282.  It def[ies] analysis by harmless error standards because it affec[ts] the framework within which the trial proceeds and is not simply an error in the trial process itself.  Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 309310.  Different attorneys will pursue different strategies with regard to myriad trial matters, and the choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution, plea bargains, or decides to go to trial.  It is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings.  This inquiry is not comparable to that required to show that a counsels deficient performance prejudiced a defendant.  Pp.811.


(c)Nothing in the Courts opinion casts any doubt or places any qualification upon its previous holdings limiting the right to counsel of choice and recognizing trial courts authority to establish criteria for admitting lawyers to argue before them.  However broad a trial courts discretion may be, this Court accepts the Governments concession that the District Court erred.  Pp.1112.

05-83|"WASHINGTON v. RECUENCO
certiorari to the supreme court of washington
No. 0583.Argued April 17, 2006Decided June 26, 2006
After respondent threatened his wife with a handgun, he was convicted of second-degree assault based on the jurys finding that he had assaulted her with a deadly weapon.  A firearm qualifies as a deadly weapon under Washington law, but nothing in the verdict form specifically required the jury to find that respondent had engaged in assault with a firearm, as opposed to any other kind of deadly weapon.  Nevertheless, the state trial court applied a 3-year firearm enhancement to respondents sentence, rather than the 1-year enhancement that specifically applies to assault with a deadly weapon, based on the courts own factual findings that respondent was armed with a firearm.  This Court then decided Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, holding that [o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 490, and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, clarifying that the statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, id., at 303.  Because the trial court could not have subjected respondent to a firearm enhancement based only on the jurys finding that respondent was armed with a deadly weapon, the State conceded a Sixth Amendment Blakely violation before the Washington Supreme Court, but urged the court to find the Blakely error harmless.  In vacating respondents sentence and remanding for sentencing based solely on the deadly weapon enhancement, however, the court declared Blakely error to be structural error, which will always invalidate a conviction under Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 279.  
Held: 
1.Respondents argument that this Court lacks power to reverse because the Washington Supreme Courts judgment rested on adequate and independent state-law grounds is rejected.  It is far from clear that respondent is correct that at the time of his conviction, state law provided no procedure for a jury to determine whether a defendant was armed with a firearm, so that it is impossible to conduct harmless-error analysis on the Blakely error in his case.  The correctness of respondents interpretation, however, is not determinative of the question the State Supreme Court decided and on which this Court granted review, i.e., whether Blakely error can ever be deemed harmless.  If respondents reading of Washington law is correct, that merely suggests that he will be able to demonstrate that the Blakely violation in this particular case was not harmless.  See Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24.  But it does not mean that Blakely errorwhich is of the same nature, whether it involves a fact that state law permits to be submitted to the jury or notis structural, or that this Court is precluded from deciding that question.  Thus, the Court need not resolve this open question of Washington law.  Pp. 34.


2.Failure to submit a sentencing factor to the jury is not structural error.  If a criminal defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that most constitutional errors are subject to harmless-error analysis.  E.g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 8.  Only in rare cases has this Court ruled an error structural, thus requiring automatic reversal.  In Neder, the Court held that failure to submit an element of an offense to the jurythere, the materiality of false statements as an element of the federal crimes of filing a false income tax return, mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, see id., at 2025is not structural, but is subject to Chapmans harmless-error rule, id., at 720.  This case is indistinguishable from Neder.  Apprendi makes clear that [a]ny possible distinction between an element of a felony  and a sentencing factor was unknown  during the years surrounding our Nations founding.  530 U. S., at 478.  Accordingly, the Court has treated sentencing factors, like elements, as facts that have to be tried to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 483484.  The only difference between this case and Neder is that there the prosecution failed to prove the materiality element beyond a reasonable doubt, while here the prosecution failed to prove the armed with a firearm sentencing factor beyond a reasonable doubt.  Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be reconciled with Apprendis recognition that elements and sentencing factors must be treated the same.  Respondent attempts unpersuasively to distinguish Neder on the ground that the jury there returned a guilty verdict on the offenses for which the defendant was sentenced, whereas here the jury returned a guilty verdict only on the offense of second-degree assault, and an affirmative answer to the sentencing question whether respondent was armed with a deadly weapon.  Because Neders jury did not find him guilty of each of the elements of the offenses with which he was charged, its verdict is no more fairly described as a complete finding of guilt than is the verdict here.  See 527 U. S., at 31.  Pp. 59.

Accordingly, the Court has treated sentencing factors, like elements, as facts that have to be tried to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 483484.  The only difference between this case and Neder is that there the prosecution failed to prove the materiality element beyond a reasonable doubt, while here the prosecution failed to prove the armed with a firearm sentencing factor beyond a reasonable doubt.  Assigning this distinction constitutional significance cannot be reconciled with Apprendis recognition that elements and sentencing factors must be treated the same.  Respondent attempts unpersuasively to distinguish Neder on the ground that the jury there returned a guilty verdict on the offenses for which the defendant was sentenced, whereas here the jury returned a guilty verdict only on the offense of second-degree assault, and an affirmative answer to the sentencing question whether respondent was armed with a deadly weapon.  Because Neders jury did not find him guilty of each of the elements of the offenses with which he was charged, its verdict is no more fairly described as a complete finding of guilt than is the verdict here.  See 527 U. S., at 31.  Pp. 59.

04-1376|"FERNANDEZ-VARGAS v. GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 041376.Argued March 22, 2006Decided June 22, 2006
Immigration law has for some time provided that an order for removing an alien present unlawfully may be reinstated if he leaves and unlawfully reenters.  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to enlarge the class of illegal reentrants whose orders may be reinstated and limit the possible relief from a removal order available to them.  See 241(a)(5), 8 U. S.C. 1235(a)(5).  Petitioner Fernandez-Vargas, a Mexican citizen, illegally reentered the United States in 1982, after having been deported.  He remained undetected for over 20 years, fathering a son in 1989 and marrying the boys mother, a United States citizen, in 2001.  After he filed an application to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, the Government began proceedings to reinstate his 1981 deportation order under 241(a)(5), and deported him.  He petitioned the Tenth Circuit to review the reinstatement order, claiming that, because he illegally reentered the county before IIRIRAs effective date, 241(a)(5) did not bar his application for adjustment of status, and that 241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it did bar his adjustment application.  The court held that 241(a)(5) barred his application and followed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, in determining that the new law had no impermissibly retroactive effect in his case.
Held:Section 241(a)(5) applies to those who reentered the United States before IIRIRAs effective date and does not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before this Court.  Pp.516.
(a)Statutes are disfavored as retroactive when their application would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a partys liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.  Landgraf, supra, at 280.  A statute is not given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication.  United States v. St. Louis, S.F. & T. R. Co., 270 U. S. 1, 3.  In determining whether a statute has an impermissibly retroactive effect, the Court first looks to whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statutes proper reach, Landgraf, supra, at 280, and in the absence of express language tries to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal reach specifically intended by applying its normal rules of construction, Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 326.  If that effort fails, the Court asks whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive effect in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties [on the basis of] conduct arising before [its] enactment, Landgraf, supra, at 278.  If the answer is yes, the Court then applies the presumption against retroactivity by construing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in question.  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 316.  Pp.57.


(b)Common principles of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle 241(a)(5)s apparent application to any reentrant present in the country, whatever the date of return.  The statute does not expressly include in or exclude from 241(a)(5)s ambit individuals who illegally entered the country before IIRIRAs effective date.  Fernandez-Vargas argues that the fact that the old reinstatement provision applied to aliens who had unlawfully reentered  after having previously departed or been deported , whether before or after June 27, 1952 [the INAs effective date], on any ground described in  subsection (e), 242(f), while 241(a)(5) lacks language of temporal reach, shows that Congress no longer meant to cover preenactment reentrants.  But the old before-or-after clause, which was sandwiched between references to departure or deportation and grounds for deportation, most naturally referred not to an aliens illegal reentry but to the previous deportation or departure.  The better inference is that the clause was removed because, in 1996, application keyed to departures in 1952 or earlier was academic.  Applying 241(a)(5) only to deportations or departures after IIRIRAs effective date would exempt anyone who departed before that date but reentered after it.  That would be a strange result, since the statute was revised to expand the scope of the reinstatement authority and invest it with something closer to finality.  Fernandez-Vargas errs in suggesting that the new law is bereft of clarity and the Court should apply the presumption against retroactivity as a tool for interpreting the statute at the first Landgraf step.  It is not until a statute is shown to have no firm provision about temporal reach but to produce a retroactive effect when straightforwardly applied that the presumption has its work to do.  And IIRIRA has other provisions on temporal reach, which blunt Fernandez-Vargass argument that a negative inference in his favor may be drawn from removal of the before-or-after clause.  Pp.710.


(c)This facial reading is confirmed by two features of IIRIRA.  First, the provisions text shows that it applies here not because Fernandez-Vargas reentered at any particular time, but because he chose to remain after the new statute became effective.  While the law looks back to an alien [who] has reentered  illegally, 8 U. S.C. 1231(a)(5), the provision does not penalize an alien for the reentry; it establishes a process to remove him under a prior order any time after the reentry, ibid.  Thus, it is the conduct of remaining in the country after entry that is the predicate action; the law applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien could end at any time by voluntarily leaving.  It is therefore the aliens choice to continue his illegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the new laws effective date, that subjects him to the new and less generous regime, not a past act that is he helpless to undo.  INS v. St. Cyr, supra, distinguished.  Second, IIRIRAs effective date provision shows that Fernandez-Vargas had ample warning of the coming change in the law, but chose to remain until the old regime expired and 241(a)(5) took its place.  He had an opportunity to avoid the new laws application by leaving the country and ending his violation during the 6 months between IIRIRAs enactment and effective date.  For that matter, he could have married his sons mother and applied for adjustment of status during the period, in which case he would at least have had a claim that proven reliance on the law should be honored by applying the presumption against retroactivity.  Instead, he augmented his 15 years of unlawful presence by remaining in the country into the future subject to the new law.  And the presumption against retroactivity does not amount to a presumption of legal stasis for the benefit of continuous lawbreakers.  Pp.1115.
394 F.3d 881, affirmed.

05-259|"BURLINGTON NORTHERN & SANTAFE RAILWAY CO. v. WHITE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 05259.Argued April 17, 2006Decided June 22, 2006
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(a), and its anti-retaliation provision forbids discriminat[ion] against an employee or job applicant who, inter alia, has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in a Title VII proceeding or investigation, 2000e3(a).  Respondent White, the only woman in her department, operated the forklift at the Tennessee Yard of petitioner Burlington Northern & SantaFe Railway Co. (Burlington).  After she complained, her immediate supervisor was disciplined for sexual harassment, but she was removed from forklift duty to standard track laborer tasks.  She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), claiming that the reassignment was unlawful gender discrimination and retaliation for her complaint.  Subsequently, she was suspended without pay for insubordination.  Burlington later found that she had not been insubordinate, reinstated her, and awarded her backpay for the 37 days she was suspended.  The suspension led to another EEOC retaliation charge.  After exhausting her administrative remedies, White filed an action against Burlington in federal court claiming, as relevant here, that Burlingtons actions in changing her job responsibilities and suspending her for 37 days amounted to unlawful retaliation under Title VII.  A jury awarded her compensatory damages.  In affirming, the Sixth Circuit applied the same standard for retaliation that it applies to a substantive discrimination offense, holding that a retaliation plaintiff must show an adverse employment action, defined as a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.  The Circuits have come to different conclusions about whether the challenged action has to be employment or workplace related and about how harmful that action must be to constitute retaliation.
Held:
1.The anti-retaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace.  The language of the substantive and anti-retaliation provisions differ in important ways.  The terms hire, discharge, compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, employment opportunities, and status as an employee explicitly limit the substantive provisions scope to actions that affect employment or alter workplace conditions.  The anti-retaliation provision has no such limiting words.  This Court presumes that, where words differ as they do here, Congress has acted intentionally and purposely.  There is strong reason to believe that Congress intended the differences here, for the two provisions differ not only in language but also in purpose.  The anti-discrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their status, while the anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent an employer from interfering with an employees efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the Acts basic guarantees.  To secure the first objective, Congress needed only to prohibit employment-related discrimination.  But this would not achieve the second objective because it would not deter the many forms that effective retaliation can take, therefore failing to fully achieve the anti-retaliation provisions purpose of [m]aintaining unfettered access to statutory remedial mechanisms, Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 346.  Thus, purpose reinforces what the language says, namely, that the anti-retaliation provision is not limited to actions affecting employment terms and conditions.  Neither this Courts precedent nor the EEOCs interpretations support a contrary conclusion.  Nor is it anomalous to read the statute to provide broader protection for retaliation victims than for victims of discrimination.  Congress has provided similar protection from retaliation in comparable statutes.  And differences in the purpose of the two Title VII provisions remove any perceived anomaly, for they justify this difference in interpretation.  Pp.612.


2.The anti-retaliation provision covers only those employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or applicant.  This Court agrees with the Seventh and District of Columbia Circuits that the proper formulation requires a retaliation plaintiff to show that the challenged action well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.  Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1211, 1219.  The Court refers to material adversity to separate significant from trivial harms.  The anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent employer interference with unfettered access to Title VIIs remedial mechanisms by prohibiting employer actions that are likely to deter discrimination victims from complaining to the EEOC, the courts, and employers.  Robinson, supra, at 346.  The Court refers to a reasonable employees reactions because the provisions standard for judging harm must be objective, and thus judicially administrable.  The standard is phrased in general terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation may depend upon the particular circumstances.  Pp.1215.


3.Applying the standard to the facts of this case, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the jurys verdict on Whites retaliation claim.  Contrary to Burlingtons claim, a reassignment of duties can constitute retaliatory discrimination where both the former and present duties fall within the same job description.  Almost every job category involves some duties that are less desirable than others.  That is presumably why the EEOC has consistently recognized retaliatory work assignments as forbidden retaliation.  Here, the jury had considerable evidence that the track laborer duties were more arduous and dirtier than the forklift operator position, and that the latter position was considered a better job by male employees who resented White for occupying it.  Based on this record, a jury could reasonably conclude that the reassignment would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee.  Burlington also argues that the 37-day suspension without pay lacked statutory significance because White was reinstated with backpay.  The significance of the congressional judgment that victims of intentional discrimination can recover compensatory and punitive damages to make them whole would be undermined if employers could avoid liability in these circumstances.  Any insufficient evidence claim is unconvincing.  White received backpay, but many reasonable employees would find a month without pay a serious hardship.  White described her physical and emotional hardship to the jury, noting that she obtained medical treatment for emotional distress.  An indefinite suspension without pay could well act as a deterrent to the filing of a discrimination complaint, even if the suspended employee eventually receives backpay.  Thus, the jurys conclusion that the suspension was materially adverse was reasonable.  Pp.1518.
364 F.3d 789, affirmed.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.  Alito, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

05-416|"WOODFORD etal. v. NGO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05416.Argued March 22, 2006Decided June 22, 2006
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires a prisoner to exhaust any available administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions in federal court.  42 U. S.C. 1997e(a).  Respondent filed a grievance with California prison officials about his prison conditions, but it was rejected as untimely under state law.  He subsequently sued petitioner officials under 1983 in the Federal District Court, which granted petitioners motion to dismiss on the ground that respondent had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies under 1997e(a).  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondent had exhausted those remedies because none remained available to him.  
Held:The PLRAs exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Pp.521.
(a)Petitioners claim that a prisoner must complete the administrative review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in federal court, but respondent contends that 1997e(a) allows suit once administrative remedies are no longer available, regardless of the reason.  To determine the correct interpretation, the Court looks for guidance to both administrative and habeas corpus law, where exhaustion is an important doctrine.  Administrative law requires proper exhaustion of administrative remedies, which means using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly. Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1024.  Habeas law has substantively similar rules, though its terminology is different.  Pp.511.


(b)Given this background, the Court is persuaded that the PLRA requires proper exhaustion.  Pp.1117.

(2)Construing 1997e(a) to require proper exhaustion also serves the PLRAs goals.  It gives prisoners an effective incentive to make full use of the prison grievance process, thus providing prisons with a fair opportunity to correct their own errors.

And it improves the quality of those suits that are filed because proper exhaustion often results in creation of an administrative record helpful to the court.  In contrast, respondents interpretation would make the PLRAs exhaustion scheme totally ineffective, since exhaustions benefits can be realized only if the prison grievance system is given a fair opportunity to consider the grievance.  That cannot happen unless the grievant complies with the systems critical procedural rules.  Respondents arguments that his interpretation would filter out frivolous claims are unpersuasive.

(3)As interpreted by respondent, the PLRA exhaustion requirement would be unprecedented.  No statute or case purports to require exhaustion while at the same time allowing a party to bypass deliberately the administrative process by flouting the agencys procedural rules.  None of his models is apt.  He first suggests that the PLRA requirement was patterned on habeas law as it existed between 1963 and 1977 when, under Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438, a federal habeas claim could be procedurally defaulted only if the prisoner deliberately bypassed state remedies.  That would be fanciful, however.  The PLRA was enacted contemporaneously with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which gave federal habeas review a structure markedly different from what existed before 1977.  Furthermore, respondents interpretation would not duplicate that scheme, for it would permit a prisoner to bypass deliberately administrative review with no risk of sanction.  Respondent next suggests that the PLRA exhaustion requirement is patterned on 14(b) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and  706(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but neither provision is in any sense an exhaustion provision.

			"|"WOODFORD etal. v. NGO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05416.Argued March 22, 2006Decided June 22, 2006
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires a prisoner to exhaust any available administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions in federal court.  42 U. S.C. 1997e(a).  Respondent filed a grievance with California prison officials about his prison conditions, but it was rejected as untimely under state law.  He subsequently sued petitioner officials under 1983 in the Federal District Court, which granted petitioners motion to dismiss on the ground that respondent had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies under 1997e(a).  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that respondent had exhausted those remedies because none remained available to him.  
Held:The PLRAs exhaustion requirement requires proper exhaustion of administrative remedies.  Pp.521.
(a)Petitioners claim that a prisoner must complete the administrative review process in accordance with applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in federal court, but respondent contends that 1997e(a) allows suit once administrative remedies are no longer available, regardless of the reason.  To determine the correct interpretation, the Court looks for guidance to both administrative and habeas corpus law, where exhaustion is an important doctrine.  Administrative law requires proper exhaustion of administrative remedies, which means using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly. Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1024.  Habeas law has substantively similar rules, though its terminology is different.  Pp.511.


(b)Given this background, the Court is persuaded that the PLRA requires proper exhaustion.  Pp.1117.

05-7053|"DIXON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 057053.Argued April 25, 2006Decided June 22, 2006
Petitioner was charged with receiving a firearm while under indictment in violation of 18 U. S.C. 922(n) and with making false statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of 922(a)(6).  She admitted at trial that she knew she was under indictment when she purchased the firearms and knew that doing so was a crime, but claimed that she was acting under duress because her boyfriend had threatened to harm her and her daughters if she did not buy the guns for him.  Bound by Fifth Circuit precedent, the District Court declined her request for a jury instruction placing upon the Government the burden to disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, her duress defense.  Instead, the jury was instructed that petitioner had the burden to establish her defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  She was convicted, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.The jury instructions did not run afoul of the Due Process Clause.  The crimes of conviction require that petitioner have acted knowingly, 922(a)(6)which merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense, Bryan v. United States, 524 U. S. 184, 193or willfully, 924(a)(1)(D)which requires acting with knowledge that [the] conduct was unlawful, ibid.  Thus, the Government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew that she was making false statements and knew that she was breaking the law when she acquired a firearm while under indictment.  It clearly met its burden when petitioner testified to that effect.  Petitioner contends that she cannot have formed the necessary mens rea because she did not freely choose to commit the crimes.  However, while the duress defense may excuse conduct that would otherwise be punishable, see United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 409410, the existence of duress normally does not controvert any of the elements of the offense itself.  The fact that petitioners crimes are statutory offenses with no counterpart in the common law supports this conclusion.  The jury instructions were consistent with the requirement that the Government prove the mental states specified in 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(D) and did not run afoul of due process by placing the burden on petitioner to establish duress by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp.35.


2.Modern common law does not require the Government to bear the burden of disproving petitioners duress defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  The long-established common-law rule, which places the burden of proving that defense on the defendant, was not upset by Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469.  There, the Court interpreted a defendants insanity to controvert the necessary mens rea for a murder committed feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, id., at 474, and required the Government to prove the defendants sanity beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence tending to prove insanity also tended to disprove an essential element of the offense.  The duress evidence that petitioner adduced at trial does not contradict or tend to disprove any element of her statutory offenses.  She is also not helped by the resulting Davis rule, which was not constitutionally mandated, and which Congress overruled by statute, requiring a defendant to prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence.


Petitioners reliance on Davis also ignores the fact that federal crimes are solely creatures of statute, Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424, and thus the Court must effectuate the duress defense as Congress may have contemplated it in the context of these specific offenses, United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483, 490, n.3.  The Court can assume that, when passing the relevant 1968 Act, Congress was familiar with the long-established common-law rule and the rule of McKelvey v. United States, 260 U. S. 353, 357that the one relying on an affirmative defense must set it up and establish itand would have expected federal courts to apply a similar approach to any affirmative defense or excuse for violating the new law.  To accept petitioners contrary hypothesis that Davis dramatically upset well-settled law would require an overwhelming consensus among federal courts placing the burden on the Government, but conflict among the Circuits demonstrates that such consensus has never existed.  For a similar reason, no weight is due the 1962 Model Penal Code.  There is no evidence that Congress endorsed the Codes views or incorporated them into the 1968 Act.  In fact, when Congress amended the Act to add a mens rea requirement, it punished willful violations, a mental state not embraced by the Code.  Effectuating the affirmative defense as Congress may have contemplated it, the Court presumes that, in the context of the firearms offenses here and the long-established common-law rule, Congress intended petitioner to bear the burden of proving the duress defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp. 515. 
413 F. 3d 520, affirmed.
Stevens, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion.

04-1034|"RAPANOS et ux., etal. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 041034.Argued February 21, 2006Decided June 19, 2006
As relevant here, the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act) makes it unlawful to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters without a permit, 33 U. S.C. 1311(a), 1342(a), and defines navigable waters as the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas, 1362(7).  The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which issues permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, interprets the waters of the United States expansively to include not only traditional navigable waters, 33 CFR 328.3(a)(1), but also other defined waters, 328.3(a)(2), (3); [t]ributaries of such waters, 328.3(a)(5); and wetlands adjacent to such waters and tributaries, 328.3(a)(7).  [A]djacent wetlands include those bordering, contiguous [to], or neighboring waters of the United States even when they are separated from [such] waters  by man-made dikes  and the like.  328.3(c).


These cases involve four Michigan wetlands lying near ditches or man-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable waters.  In No. 041034, the United States brought civil enforcement proceedings against the Rapanos petitioners, who had backfilled three of the areas without a permit.  The District Court found federal jurisdiction over the wetlands because they were adjacent to waters of the United States and held petitioners liable for CWA violations.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit found federal jurisdiction based on the sites hydrologic connections to the nearby ditches or drains, or to more remote navigable waters.  In No. 041384, the Carabell petitioners were denied a permit to deposit fill in a wetland that was separated from a drainage ditch by an impermeable berm.  The Carabells sued, but the District Court found federal jurisdiction over the site.  Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the wetland was adjacent to navigable waters.
Held:The judgments are vacated, and the cases are remanded.
No. 041034, 376 F.3d 629, and No. 041384, 391 F.3d 704, vacated and remanded.
Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded:


1.The phrase the waters of the United States includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, [and] lakes, Websters New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed.), and does not include channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally, or channels that periodically provide drainage for rainfall.  The Corps expansive interpretation of that phrase is thus not based on a permissible construction of the statute.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843.  Pp.1221.


(a)While the meaning of navigable waters in the CWA is broader than the traditional definition found in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, see Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167 (SWANCC); United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, 133, the CWA authorizes federal jurisdiction only over waters.  The use of the definite article the and the plural number waters show plainly that 1362(7) does not refer to water in general, but more narrowly to water [a]s found in streams, oceans, rivers, [and] lakes, Websters New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed.).  Those terms all connote relatively permanent bodies of water, as opposed to ordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or intermittently flows.  Pp.1215.


(b)The Acts use of the traditional phrase navigable waters further confirms that the CWA confers jurisdiction only over relatively permanent bodies of water.  Traditionally, such waters included only discrete bodies of water, and the term still carries some of its original substance, SWANCC, supra, at 172.  This Courts subsequent interpretation of the waters of the United States in the CWA likewise confirms this limitation.  See, e.g., Riverside Bayview, supra, at 131.  And the CWA itself categorizes the channels and conduits that typically carry intermittent flows of water separately from navigable waters, including them in the definition of point sources, 33 U. S.C. 1362(14).  Moreover, only the foregoing definition of waters is consistent with CWAs stated policy to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States  to plan the development and use  of land and water resources .  1251(b).  In addition, the waters of the United States hardly qualifies as the clear and manifest statement from Congress needed to authorize intrusion into such an area of traditional state authority as land-use regulation; and to authorize federal action that stretches the limits of Congresss commerce power.  See SWANCC, supra, at 173.  Pp.1521.


2.A wetland may not be considered adjacent to remote waters of the United States based on a mere hydrologic connection.  Riverside Bayview rested on an inherent ambiguity in defining where the water ends and its abutting (adjacent) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps to rely on ecological considerations only to resolve that ambiguity in favor of treating all abutting wetlands as waters.  Isolated ponds are not waters of the United States in their own right, see SWANCC, supra, at 167, 171, and present no boundary-drawing problem justifying the invocation of such ecological factors.  Thus, only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the United States in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between the two, are adjacent to such waters and covered by the Act.  Establishing coverage of the Rapanos and Carabell sites requires finding that the adjacent channel contains a relatively permanent wate[r] of the United States, and that each wetland has a continuous surface connection to that water, making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.  Pp.2124.


3.Because the Sixth Circuit applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered waters, and because of the paucity of the record, the cases are remanded for further proceedings.  P.39.


Justice Kennedy concluded that the Sixth Circuit correctly recognized that a water or wetland constitutes navigable waters under the Act if it possesses a significant nexus to waters that are navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167, 172 (SWANCC), but did not consider all the factors necessary to determine that the lands in question had, or did not have, the requisite nexus.  United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, and SWANCC establish the framework for the inquiry here.  The nexus required must be assessed in terms of the Acts goals and purposes.  Congress enacted the law to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nations waters, 33 U. S.C. 1251(a), and it pursued that objective by restricting dumping and filling in waters of the United States, 1311(a), 1362(12).  The rationale for the Acts wetlands regulation, as the Corps has recognized, is that wetlands can perform critical functions related to the integrity of other waterssuch as pollutant trapping, flood control, and runoff storage.  33 C. F.R. 320.4(b)(2).  Accordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the statutory phrase navigable waters, if the wetlands, alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters understood as navigable in the traditional sense.  When, in contrast, their effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the term navigable waters.  Because the Corps theory of jurisdiction in these casesadjacency to tributaries, however remote and insubstantialgoes beyond the Riverside Bayview holding, its assertion of jurisdiction cannot rest on that case.  The breadth of the Corps existing standard for tributarieswhich seems to leave room for regulating drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and carrying only minor water-volumes toward itprecludes that standards adoption as the determinative measure of whether adjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the integrity of an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood.  Absent more specific regulations, the Corps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis when seeking to regulate wetlands based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries, in order to avoid unreasonable applications of the Act.  In the instant cases the record contains evidence pointing to a possible significant nexus, but neither the agency nor the reviewing courts considered the issue in these terms.  Thus, the cases should be remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.130.

And the CWA itself categorizes the channels and conduits that typically carry intermittent flows of water separately from navigable waters, including them in the definition of point sources, 33 U. S.C. 1362(14).  Moreover, only the foregoing definition of waters is consistent with CWAs stated policy to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States  to plan the development and use  of land and water resources .  1251(b).  In addition, the waters of the United States hardly qualifies as the clear and manifest statement from Congress needed to authorize intrusion into such an area of traditional state authority as land-use regulation; and to authorize federal action that stretches the limits of Congresss commerce power.  See SWANCC, supra, at 173.  Pp.1521.


2.A wetland may not be considered adjacent to remote waters of the United States based on a mere hydrologic connection.  Riverside Bayview rested on an inherent ambiguity in defining where the water ends and its abutting (adjacent) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps to rely on ecological considerations only to resolve that ambiguity in favor of treating all abutting wetlands as waters.  Isolated ponds are not waters of the United States in their own right, see SWANCC, supra, at 167, 171, and present no boundary-drawing problem justifying the invocation of such ecological factors.  Thus, only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the United States in their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between the two, are adjacent to such waters and covered by the Act.  Establishing coverage of the Rapanos and Carabell sites requires finding that the adjacent channel contains a relatively permanent wate[r] of the United States, and that each wetland has a continuous surface connection to that water, making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.  Pp.2124.


3.Because the Sixth Circuit applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered waters, and because of the paucity of the record, the cases are remanded for further proceedings.  P.39.


Justice Kennedy concluded that the Sixth Circuit correctly recognized that a water or wetland constitutes navigable waters under the Act if it possesses a significant nexus to waters that are navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 167, 172 (SWANCC), but did not consider all the factors necessary to determine that the lands in question had, or did not have, the requisite nexus.  United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121, and SWANCC establish the framework for the inquiry here.  The nexus required must be assessed in terms of the Acts goals and purposes.  Congress enacted the law to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nations waters, 33 U. S.C. 1251(a), and it pursued that objective by restricting dumping and filling in waters of the United States, 1311(a), 1362(12).  The rationale for the Acts wetlands regulation, as the Corps has recognized, is that wetlands can perform critical functions related to the integrity of other waterssuch as pollutant trapping, flood control, and runoff storage.  33 C. F.R. 320.4(b)(2).  Accordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come within the statutory phrase navigable waters, if the wetlands, alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters understood as navigable in the traditional sense.  When, in contrast, their effects on water quality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the zone fairly encompassed by the term navigable waters.  Because the Corps theory of jurisdiction in these casesadjacency to tributaries, however remote and insubstantialgoes beyond the Riverside Bayview holding, its assertion of jurisdiction cannot rest on that case.  The breadth of the Corps existing standard for tributarieswhich seems to leave room for regulating drains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact water and carrying only minor water-volumes toward itprecludes that standards adoption as the determinative measure of whether adjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the integrity of an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as traditionally understood.  Absent more specific regulations, the Corps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis when seeking to regulate wetlands based on adjacency to nonnavigable tributaries, in order to avoid unreasonable applications of the Act.  In the instant cases the record contains evidence pointing to a possible significant nexus, but neither the agency nor the reviewing courts considered the issue in these terms.  Thus, the cases should be remanded for further proceedings.  Pp.130.

04-9728|"SAMSON v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district
No. 049728.Argued February 22, 2006Decided June 19, 2006
Pursuant to a California statutewhich requires every prisoner eligible for release on state parole to agree in writing to be subject to search or seizure by a parole officer or other peace officer  , with or without a search warrant and with or without causeand based solely on petitioners parolee status, an officer searched petitioner and found methamphetamine.  The trial court denied his motions to suppress that evidence, and he was convicted of possession.  Affirming, the State Court of Appeal held that suspicionless searches of parolees are lawful under California law and that the search in this case was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it was not arbitrary, capricious, or harassing.
Held:The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee.  Pp.312.
(a)The totality of the circumstances must be examined to determine whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  United States v. Knights, 534 U. S. 112, 118.  Reasonableness is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individuals privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Id., at 118119.  Applying this approach in Knights, the Court found reasonable the warrantless search of a probationers apartment based on reasonable suspicion and a probation condition authorized by California law.  In evaluating the degree of intrusion into Knights privacy, the Court found his probationary status salient, id., at 118, observing that probation is on a continuum of possible punishments and that probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty of other citizens, id., at 119.  It also found probation searches necessary to promote legitimate governmental interests of integrating probationers back into the community, combating recidivism, and protecting potential victims.  Balancing those interests, the intrusion was reasonable.  However, because the search was predicated on both the probation search condition and reasonable suspicion, the Court did not address the reasonableness of a search solely predicated upon the probation condition.  Pp.35.


(b)Parolees, who are on the continuum of state-imposed punishments, have fewer expectations of privacy than probationers, because parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is.  The essence of parole is release from prison, before the completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner abides by certain rules during the balance of the sentence.  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 477.  Californias system is consistent with these observations.  An inmate electing to complete his sentence out of physical custody remains in the Department of Corrections legal custody for the remainder of his term and must comply with the terms and conditions of his parole.  The extent and reach of those conditions demonstrate that parolees have severely diminished privacy expectations by virtue of their status alone.  Additionally, as in Knights, the state laws parole search condition was clearly expressed to petitioner, who signed an order submitting to the condition and thus was unambiguously aware of it.  Examining the totality of the circumstances, petitioner did not have an expectation of privacy that society would recognize as legitimate.  The States interests, by contrast, are substantial.  A State has an overwhelming interest in supervising parolees because they are more likely to commit future criminal offenses.  Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U. S. 357, 365.  Similarly, a States interests in reducing recidivism, thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees, warrant privacy intrusions that would not otherwise be tolerated under the Fourth Amendment.  The Amendment does not render States powerless to address these concerns effectively.  Californias 60-to70-percent recidivism rate demonstrates that most parolees are ill prepared to handle the pressures of reintegration and require intense supervision.  The State Legislature has concluded that, given the States number of parolees and its high recidivism rate, an individualized suspicion requirement would undermine the States ability to effectively supervise parolees and protect the public from criminal acts by reoffenders.  Contrary to petitioners argument, the fact that some States and the Federal Government require a level of individualized suspicion before searching a parolee is of little relevance in determining whether Californias system is drawn to meet the States needs and is reasonable, taking into account a parolees substantially diminished expectation of privacy.  Nor is there merit to the argument that Californias law grants discretion without procedural safeguards.  The concern that the system gives officers unbridled discretion to conduct searches, thereby inflicting dignitary harms that arouse strong resentment in parolees and undermine their ability to reintegrate into society, is belied by the States prohibition on arbitrary, capricious, or harassing searches.  And petitioners concern that the law frustrates reintegration efforts by permitting intrusions into the privacy interests of third persons is unavailing because that concern would arise under a suspicion-based system as well.  Pp.512.
Affirmed.

05-5224|"DAVIS v. WASHINGTON
certiorari to the supreme court of washington
No. 055224.Argued March 20, 2006Decided June 19, 2006
In No. 055224, a 911 operator ascertained from Michelle McCottry that she had been assaulted by her former boyfriend, petitioner Davis, who had just fled the scene.  McCottry did not testify at Daviss trial for felony violation of a domestic no-contact order, but the court admitted the 911 recording despite Daviss objection, which he based on the Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause.  He was convicted.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the State Supreme Court, which concluded that, inter alia, the portion of the 911 conversation in which McCottry identified Davis as her assailant was not testimonial.


In No. 055705, when police responded to a reported domestic disturbance at the home of Amy and Hershel Hammon, Amy told them that nothing was wrong, but gave them permission to enter.  Once inside, one officer kept petitioner Hershel in the kitchen while the other interviewed Amy elsewhere and had her complete and sign a battery affidavit.  Amy did not appear at Hershels bench trial for, inter alia, domestic battery, but her affidavit and testimony from the officer who questioned her were admitted over Hershels objection that he had no opportunity to cross-examine her.  Hershel was convicted, and the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed in relevant part.  The State Supreme Court also affirmed, concluding that, although Amys affidavit was testimonial and wrongly admitted, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Held: 
1.The Confrontation Clause bars admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 5354.  These cases require the Court to determine which police interrogations produce statements that fall within this prohibition.  Without attempting to produce an exhaustive classification of all conceivable statements as either testimonial or nontestimonial, it suffices to decide the present cases to hold that statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.  Pp.67.


2.McCottrys statements identifying Davis as her assailant were not testimonial.  Pp.814.


(a)This case requires the Court to decide whether the Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay, and, if so, whether the 911 recording qualifies.  Crawford suggested the answer to the first question, noting that the Confrontation Clause  applies to witnesses against the accusedin other words, those who bear testimony.  Only testimonial statements cause a declarant to be a witness.  The Court is unaware of any early American case invoking the Confrontation Clause or the common-law right to confrontation that did not involve testimony as thus defined.  Well into the 20th century, this Courts jurisprudence was carefully applied only in the testimonial context, and its later cases never in practice dispensed with the Confrontation Clause requirements of unavailability and prior cross-examination in cases involving testimonial hearsay.  Pp.811.


(b)The question in Davis, therefore, is whether, objectively considered, the interrogation during the 911 call produced testimonial statements.  In contrast to Crawford, where the interrogation took place at a police station and was directed solely at establishing a past crime, a 911 call is ordinarily designed primarily to describe current circumstances requiring police assistance.  The difference is apparent here.  McCottry was speaking of events as they were actually happening, while Crawfords interrogation took place hours after the events occurred.  Moreover, McCottry was facing an ongoing emergency.  Further, the statements elicited were necessary to enable the police to resolve the present emergency rather than simply to learn what had happened in the past.  Finally, the difference in the level of formality is striking.  Crawford calmly answered questions at a station house, with an officer-interrogator taping and taking notes, while McCottrys frantic answers were provided over the phone, in an environment that was not tranquil, or even safe.  Thus, the circumstances of her interrogation objectively indicate that its primary purpose was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  She was not acting as a witness or testifying.  Pp.1114.


3.Amy Hammons statements were testimonial.  They were not much different from those in Crawford.  It is clear from the circumstances that Amys interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct.  There was no emergency in progress, she told the police when they arrived that things were fine, and the officer questioning her was seeking to determine not what was happening but what had happened.  Objectively viewed, the primary, if not sole, purpose of the investigation was to investigate a possible crime.  While the formal features of Crawfords interrogation strengthened her statements testimonial aspect, such features were not essential to the point.  In both cases, the declarants were separated from the defendants, the statements recounted how potentially criminal past events began and progressed, and the interrogation took place some time after the events were over.  For the same reasons the comparison to Crawford is compelling, the comparison to Davis is unpersuasive.  The statements in Davis were taken when McCottry was alone, unprotected by police, and apparently in immediate danger from Davis.  She was seeking aid, not telling a story about the past.  Pp.1417.


4.The Indiana courts may determine on remand whether a claim of forfeiture by wrongdoingunder which one who obtains a witnesss absence by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontationis properly raised in Hammon, and, if so, whether it is meritorious.  Absent such a finding, the Sixth Amendment operates to exclude Amy Hammons affidavit.  Pp.1819.
No. 055224, 154 Wash. 2d 291, 111 P.3d 844, affirmed; No. 055705, 829 N.E. 2d 444, reversed and remanded.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

05-6997|"DENVER A. YOUNGBLOOD, Jr. v. WEST VIRGINIA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia
No. 056997.Decided June 19, 2006
Per Curiam.
 In April 2001, the State of West Virginia indicted petitioner Denver A. Youngblood, Jr., on charges including abduction of three young women, Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy, and two instances of sexual assault upon Katara.  The cases went to trial in 2003 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, where a jury convicted Youngblood of two counts of sexual assault, two counts of brandishing a firearm, and one count of indecent exposure.  The conviction rested principally on the testimony of the three women that they were held captive by Youngblood and a friend of his, statements by Katara that she was forced at gunpoint to perform oral sex on Youngblood, and evidence consistent with a claim by Katara about disposal of certain physical evidence of their sexual encounter.  Youngblood was sentenced to a combined term of 26 to 60 years imprisonment, with 25 to 60 of those years directly attributable to the sexual-assault convictions.
  Several months after being sentenced, Youngblood moved to set aside the verdict.  He claimed that an investigator working on his case had uncovered new and exculpatory evidence, in the form of a graphically explicit note that both squarely contradicted the States account of the incidents and directly supported Youngbloods consensual-sex defense.  The note, apparently written by Kimberly and Wendy, taunted Youngblood and his friend for having been played for fools, warned them that the girls had vandalized the house where Youngblood brought them, and mockingly thanked Youngblood for performing oral sex on Katara.  The note was said to have been shown to a state trooper investigating the sexual-assault allegations against Youngblood; the trooper allegedly read the note but declined to take possession of it, and told the person who produced it to destroy it.  Youngblood argued that the suppression of this evidence violated the States federal constitutional obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, and in support of his argument he referred to cases citing and applying Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).
  The trial court denied Youngblood a new trial, saying that the note provided only impeachment, but not exculpatory, evidence.  The trial court did not discuss Brady or its scope, but expressed the view that the investigating trooper had attached no importance to the note, and because he had failed to give it to the prosecutor the State could not now be faulted for failing to share it with Youngbloods counsel.  See App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 2223 (Sept. 25, 2003)).
  A bare majority of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, but without examining the specific constitutional claims associated with the alleged suppression of favorable evidence.  217 W.Va. 535, 548, 618 S.E. 2d 544, 557 (2005) (per curiam).  Justice Davis, dissenting in an opinion that Justice Starcher joined, unambiguously characterized the troopers instruction to discard the new evidence as a Brady violation.  Id., at 550552, 618 S.E. 2d, at 559561.  The dissenters concluded that the note indicating that Youngblood engaged in consensual sex with Katara had been suppressed and was material, id., at 550, n.6, 618 S.E. 2d, at 559, n.6 (citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435, 437438 (1995)), both because it was at odds with the testimony provided by the States three chief witnesses (Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy) and also because it was entirely consistent with Youngbloods defense at trial that his sexual encounters with Katara were consensual, 217 W.Va., at 551552, 618 S.E. 2d, at 560561.  Youngblood then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.
  A Brady violation occurs when the government fails to disclose evidence materially favorable to the accused.  See 373 U. S., at 87.  This Court has held that the Brady duty extends to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence, United States v. Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 676 (1985), and Brady suppression occurs when the government fails to turn over even evidence that is known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor, Kyles, 514 U. S., at 438.  See id., at 437 ([T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the governments behalf in the case, including the police).  Such evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different, Strickler v. Greene, 527 U. S. 263, 280 (1999) (quoting Bagley, supra, at 682 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)), although a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendants acquittal, Kyles, 514 U. S., at 434.  The reversal of a conviction is required upon a showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.  Id., at 435.
  Youngblood clearly presented a federal constitutional Brady claim to the State Supreme Court, see Brief for Appellant in No. 31765 (Sup. Ct. App. W.Va.), pp. 4247, as he had to the trial court, see App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 6, 4445, 50, 51 (Sept. 25, 2003)); id., at 13, 17 (Sept. 29, 2003).  And, as noted, the dissenting justices discerned the significance of the issue raised.  If this Court is to reach the merits of this case, it would be better to have the benefit of the views of the full Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia on the Brady issue.  We, therefore, grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment of the State Supreme Court, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

			"|"DENVER A. YOUNGBLOOD, Jr. v. WEST VIRGINIA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia
No. 056997.Decided June 19, 2006
Per Curiam.
 In April 2001, the State of West Virginia indicted petitioner Denver A. Youngblood, Jr., on charges including abduction of three young women, Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy, and two instances of sexual assault upon Katara.  The cases went to trial in 2003 in the Circuit Court of Morgan County, where a jury convicted Youngblood of two counts of sexual assault, two counts of brandishing a firearm, and one count of indecent exposure.  The conviction rested principally on the testimony of the three women that they were held captive by Youngblood and a friend of his, statements by Katara that she was forced at gunpoint to perform oral sex on Youngblood, and evidence consistent with a claim by Katara about disposal of certain physical evidence of their sexual encounter.  Youngblood was sentenced to a combined term of 26 to 60 years imprisonment, with 25 to 60 of those years directly attributable to the sexual-assault convictions.
  Several months after being sentenced, Youngblood moved to set aside the verdict.  He claimed that an investigator working on his case had uncovered new and exculpatory evidence, in the form of a graphically explicit note that both squarely contradicted the States account of the incidents and directly supported Youngbloods consensual-sex defense.  The note, apparently written by Kimberly and Wendy, taunted Youngblood and his friend for having been played for fools, warned them that the girls had vandalized the house where Youngblood brought them, and mockingly thanked Youngblood for performing oral sex on Katara.  The note was said to have been shown to a state trooper investigating the sexual-assault allegations against Youngblood; the trooper allegedly read the note but declined to take possession of it, and told the person who produced it to destroy it.  Youngblood argued that the suppression of this evidence violated the States federal constitutional obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, and in support of his argument he referred to cases citing and applying Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963).
  The trial court denied Youngblood a new trial, saying that the note provided only impeachment, but not exculpatory, evidence.  The trial court did not discuss Brady or its scope, but expressed the view that the investigating trooper had attached no importance to the note, and because he had failed to give it to the prosecutor the State could not now be faulted for failing to share it with Youngbloods counsel.  See App. C to Pet. for Cert. (Tr. 2223 (Sept. 25, 2003)).
  A bare majority of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia affirmed, finding no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, but without examining the specific constitutional claims associated with the alleged suppression of favorable evidence.  217 W.Va. 535, 548, 618 S.E. 2d 544, 557 (2005) (per curiam).  Justice Davis, dissenting in an opinion that Justice Starcher joined, unambiguously characterized the troopers instruction to discard the new evidence as a Brady violation.  Id., at 550552, 618 S.E. 2d, at 559561.  The dissenters concluded that the note indicating that Youngblood engaged in consensual sex with Katara had been suppressed and was material, id., at 550, n.6, 618 S.E. 2d, at 559, n.6 (citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435, 437438 (1995)), both because it was at odds with the testimony provided by the States three chief witnesses (Katara, Kimberly, and Wendy) and also because it was entirely consistent with Youngbloods defense at trial that his sexual encounters with Katara were consensual, 217 W.Va., at 551552, 618 S.E. 2d, at 560561.  Youngblood then filed this petition for a writ of certiorari.

04-1131|"TERRY L. WHITMAN, PETITIONER v. DEPARTMENT
OF TRANSPORTATION etal.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
[June 5, 2006]
Per Curiam.

Terry Whitman, the petitioner, is an employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is subject to the agencys drug and alcohol testing program.  Without
first seeking to pursue grievance procedures under his
collective-bargaining agreement, he filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska, alleging the FAA tested him in a nonrandom manner, in violation of his constitutional rights and 49 U. S.C. 45104(8).


The FAA has its own procedural framework for the resolution of claims by its employees; and for this purpose it adopts certain sections of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), including Chapter 71 of Title 5, which sets forth the rules for grievances.  49 U. S.C. 40122(g)(2)(C).  The District Court held that, under the provisions of the CSRA, it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners claims.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that because 5 U. S.C. 7121(a)(1), as amended in 1994, does not expressly confer federal court jurisdiction over employment-related claims covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of federal employees collective bargaining agreements, his claims are precluded.  382 F.3d 938, 939 (2004).  This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment.  545 U. S. ___ (2005).


The Court of Appeals was correct to say that 5 U. S.C. 7121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction.  Another statute, howevera very familiar onegrants jurisdiction to the federal courts over all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 1331.  The question, then, is not whether 5 U. S.C. 7121 confers jurisdiction, but whether 7121 (or the CSRA as a whole) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642 (2002) (holding that even if [47 U. S.C.] 252(e)(6) does not confer jurisdiction, it at least does not divest the district courts of their authority under 28 U. S.C. 1331 to review the Commissions order for compliance with federal law), or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing remedies beyond those set out in the CSRA, cf. United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 443444 (1988); Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 140 (1967) (The question is phrased in terms of prohibition rather than authorization because  judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress).


In deciding the question of jurisdiction and preclusion, the Court would be required first to ascertain where Whitmans claims fit within the statutory scheme, as the CSRA provides different treatment for grievances depending on the nature of the claim.  It may be, for example, that the FAAs actions, as described by the petitioner, constitute a prohibited personnel practice.  See 5 U. S.C. 2302(b); 49 U. S.C. 40122(g)(2)(A).  Both the petitioner and the Government say they do not, but because the ultimate question may be jurisdictional, this concession ought not to be accepted out of hand.  See Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U. S. 645, 652 (1973) (Parties, of course, cannot confer jurisdiction; only Congress can do so).  The Court of Appeals did not decide whether the petitioners allegations state a prohibited personnel practice.  The proper course, then, is to remand for the Court of Appeals to address the matter, see National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999), as well as the ultimate issue of preclusion.  The various other issues raised before this Court, but not decided below, may also be addressed on remand, including: whether the petitioner has challenged final agency action; whether the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies; whether exhaustion is required given this statutory scheme and the Administrative Procedure Act, as interpreted in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U. S. 137 (1993); and whether the Government has forfeited its exhaustion-of-remedies argument.  It may be that a decision on these questions can obviate the need to decide a more difficult question of preclusion.


The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

04-433|"ANZA etal. v. IDEAL STEEL SUPPLY CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 04433.Argued March 27, 2006Decided June 5, 2006
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) prohibits certain conduct involving a pattern of racketeering activity, 18 U. S.C. 1962, and makes a private right of action available to [a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of RICOs substantive restrictions, 1964(c), provided that the alleged violation was the proximate cause of the injury, Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268.  Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) has stores in Queens and the Bronx.  Petitioner National Steel Supply, Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, has stores in the same locations and is Ideals principal competitor.  Ideal filed suit in the District Court, claiming that National failed to charge New Yorks sales tax to cash-paying customers, allowing it to reduce its prices without affecting its profit margin; and that it submitted fraudulent state tax returns to conceal the conduct, which involved committing mail and wire fraud, both forms of racketeering activity under RICO.  Ideal alleged that the Anzas violated 1962(c), which forbids conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprises affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  It also claimed that all the petitioners violated 1962(a)which makes it unlawful for a person to use or invest income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commercewhen they used funds generated by the fraudulent tax scheme to open Nationals Bronx location, causing Ideal to lose business and market share.  The District Court granted petitioners motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that Ideal had not shown reliance on petitioners misrepresentations, as required in RICO mail and wire fraud claims.  Vacating, the Second Circuit held, with regard to the 1962(c) claim, that a complaint alleging a pattern of racketeering activity designed to give a defendant a competitive advantage adequately pleaded probable cause even where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications made to a third party; and held that Ideal adequately pleaded its 1962(a) claim by alleging injury resulting from petitioners use and investment of racketeering proceeds. 
Held:
1.Ideal cannot maintain its 1962(c) claim.  Under Holmes, proximate cause for 1964(c) purposes requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.  503 U. S., at 268.  The direct victim of the alleged RICO violation is the State of New York, not Ideal.  Ideals claim is too attenuated to satisfy Holmes requirement of directness.  This result is confirmed by the directness requirements underlying premises, one of which is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.  Ideal claims lost sales because of Nationals decreased prices, but National could have lowered prices for reasons unrelated to the asserted tax fraud, and Ideals lost sales could have resulted from other factors as well.  The attenuated connection between Ideals injury and the Anzas injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in Holmes.  Further illustrating the absence of proximate cause is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.  A court would have to calculate the portion of Nationals price drop attributable to the pattern of racketeering activity and then calculate the portion of lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop, but Holmes proximate causation element was meant to prevent such intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrunning RICO litigation.  A direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.  Contrary to the Second Circuits rationale, a RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendants aim was to increase market share at a competitors expense.  Because Ideal has not satisfied that requirement, this Court has no occasion to address the substantial question whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud must show that it relied on the defendants misrepresentations.  Pp.49.


2.The Second Circuits judgment with respect to Ideals 1962(a) claim is vacated so that court can determine on remand whether petitioners alleged 1962(a) violation proximately caused Ideals asserted injuries.  Pp.910.

05-5992|"ZEDNER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 055992.Argued April 18, 2006Decided June 5, 2006
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) generally requires a federal criminal trial to begin within 70 days after a defendant is charged or makes an initial appearance.  18 U. S.C. 3161(c)(1).  Recognizing that criminal cases vary widely and that there are valid reasons for greater delay in particular cases, the Act includes a long and detailed list of periods of delay that are excluded in computing the time within which trial must start.  Section 3161(h)(8) permits a district court to grant a continuance and exclude the resulting delay if it makes on-the-record findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the publics and defendants interests in a speedy trial.  To promote compliance without needlessly subverting important criminal prosecutions, the Act provides that, if the trial does not begin on time and the defendant moves, before the trials start or entry of a guilty plea, to dismiss, the district court must dismiss the charges, though it may choose whether to do so with or without prejudice.


In April 1996, petitioner was indicted on charges arising from his attempt to open accounts using counterfeit United States bonds.  The District Court granted two ends-of-justice continuances, see 3161(h)(8).  When, at a November 8 status conference, petitioner requested another delay to January 1997, the court suggested that petitioner waive the application of the Act for all time, and produced a preprinted waiver form for petitioner to sign.  At a January 31, 1997, status conference, the court granted petitioner another continuance so that he could attempt to authenticate the bonds, but made no mention of the Act and no findings to support excluding the 91 days between January 31 and petitioners next court appearance on May 2 (1997 continuance).  Four years later, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to comply with the Act, which the District Court denied based on the waiver for all time.  In a 2003 trial, petitioner was convicted.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  Acknowledging that a defendants waiver of rights under the Act may be ineffective because of the public interest served by compliance with the Act, the court found an exception for situations when the defendant causes or contributes to the delay.  It also suggested that the District Court could have properly excluded the 91-day period based on the ends of justice, given the cases complexity and the defenses request for additional time to prepare.
Held:
1.Because a defendant may not prospectively waive the application of the Act, petitioners waiver for all time was ineffective.  Pp.912.


(a)The Act comprehensively regulates the time within which a trial must begin.  Section 3161(h), which details numerous categories of delay that are not counted in applying the Acts deadlines, conspicuously has no provision excluding periods of delay during which a defendant waives the Acts application.  It is apparent from the Acts terms that this was a considered omission.  Instead of allowing defendants to opt out, the Act demands that continuances fit within one of 3161(h)s specific exclusions.  In deciding whether to grant an ends-of-justice continuance, a court must consider a defendants need for reasonable time to obtain counsel, continuity of counsel, and effective preparation of counsel.  3161(h)(8)(B)(iv).  If a defendant could simply waive the Acts application in order to secure more time, no defendant would ever need to put such considerations before the court under the rubric of an ends-of-justice exclusion.  The Acts purposes also cut against exclusion on the grounds of mere consent or waiver.  Were the Act solely designed to protect a defendants right to a speedy trial, such an application might make sense, but the Act was also designed with the public interest firmly in mind.  This interpretation is entirely in accord with the Acts legislative history.  Pp.911.


(b)This Court rejects the District Courts reliance on 3162(a)(2), which provides that a defendant whose trial does not begin on time is deemed to have waived the right to move for dismissal if that motion is not filed prior to trial or entry of a guilty plea.  That section makes no mention of prospective waivers, and there is no reason to think that Congress wanted to treat prospective and retrospective waivers similarly.  Allowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the Act because, in many cases, the prosecution, defense, and court would all like to opt out, to the detriment of the public interest.  Section 3162(a)(2)s retrospective waiver does not pose a comparable danger.  Because the prosecution and court cannot know until the trial starts or the guilty plea is entered whether the defendant will forgo moving to dismiss, they retain a strong incentive to make sure the trial begins on time.  Pp.1112.


2.Petitioner is not estopped from challenging the excludability under the Act of the 1997 continuance.  Factors that typically inform the decision whether to apply the [estoppel] doctrine in a particular case include (1) whether a partys later position [is] clearly inconsistent with its earlier position; (2) whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that  earlier position; and (3) whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.  New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 750751.  None of the three possible positions taken by petitioner gives rise to an estoppel.  First, recognizing an estoppel based on petitioners promise not to move for dismissal under 3162(a)(2) would entirely swallow the Acts no-waiver policy.  Second, petitioners (mistaken) agreement that waivers are enforceable does not provide a ground for estoppel because petitioner did not succee[d] in persuading the District Court to accept the validity of prospective waivers.  On the contrary, the District Court requested the waiver and produced the form for petitioner to sign.  Even if the other factors favor estoppel, they do not predominate.  Finally, petitioners representation at the January 31 status conference that a continuance was needed to gather evidence of the bonds authenticity does not support estoppel because that position was not clearly inconsistent with the position that he now takes in seeking dismissal, i.e., that delay from that continuance was not excluded under the Act.  Nothing in the discussion at the conference suggests that the question presented by the continuance request was viewed as anything other than a case-management question laying entirely within the District Courts discretion.  Pp.1215.


3.When a district court makes no findings on the record to support a 3161(h)(8) continuance, harmless-error review is not appropriate.  The Government argues that an express finding need not be entered contemporaneously and could be supplied on remand.  But the Act requires express findings, see 3161(h)(8)(A), and at the very least implies that those findings must be put on the record by the time the district court rules on the motion to dismiss.

			"|"ZEDNER v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 055992.Argued April 18, 2006Decided June 5, 2006
The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Act) generally requires a federal criminal trial to begin within 70 days after a defendant is charged or makes an initial appearance.  18 U. S.C. 3161(c)(1).  Recognizing that criminal cases vary widely and that there are valid reasons for greater delay in particular cases, the Act includes a long and detailed list of periods of delay that are excluded in computing the time within which trial must start.  Section 3161(h)(8) permits a district court to grant a continuance and exclude the resulting delay if it makes on-the-record findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the publics and defendants interests in a speedy trial.  To promote compliance without needlessly subverting important criminal prosecutions, the Act provides that, if the trial does not begin on time and the defendant moves, before the trials start or entry of a guilty plea, to dismiss, the district court must dismiss the charges, though it may choose whether to do so with or without prejudice.


In April 1996, petitioner was indicted on charges arising from his attempt to open accounts using counterfeit United States bonds.  The District Court granted two ends-of-justice continuances, see 3161(h)(8).  When, at a November 8 status conference, petitioner requested another delay to January 1997, the court suggested that petitioner waive the application of the Act for all time, and produced a preprinted waiver form for petitioner to sign.  At a January 31, 1997, status conference, the court granted petitioner another continuance so that he could attempt to authenticate the bonds, but made no mention of the Act and no findings to support excluding the 91 days between January 31 and petitioners next court appearance on May 2 (1997 continuance).  Four years later, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to comply with the Act, which the District Court denied based on the waiver for all time.  In a 2003 trial, petitioner was convicted.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  Acknowledging that a defendants waiver of rights under the Act may be ineffective because of the public interest served by compliance with the Act, the court found an exception for situations when the defendant causes or contributes to the delay.  It also suggested that the District Court could have properly excluded the 91-day period based on the ends of justice, given the cases complexity and the defenses request for additional time to prepare.
Held:
1.Because a defendant may not prospectively waive the application of the Act, petitioners waiver for all time was ineffective.  Pp.912.


(a)The Act comprehensively regulates the time within which a trial must begin.  Section 3161(h), which details numerous categories of delay that are not counted in applying the Acts deadlines, conspicuously has no provision excluding periods of delay during which a defendant waives the Acts application.  It is apparent from the Acts terms that this was a considered omission.  Instead of allowing defendants to opt out, the Act demands that continuances fit within one of 3161(h)s specific exclusions.  In deciding whether to grant an ends-of-justice continuance, a court must consider a defendants need for reasonable time to obtain counsel, continuity of counsel, and effective preparation of counsel.  3161(h)(8)(B)(iv).  If a defendant could simply waive the Acts application in order to secure more time, no defendant would ever need to put such considerations before the court under the rubric of an ends-of-justice exclusion.  The Acts purposes also cut against exclusion on the grounds of mere consent or waiver.  Were the Act solely designed to protect a defendants right to a speedy trial, such an application might make sense, but the Act was also designed with the public interest firmly in mind.  This interpretation is entirely in accord with the Acts legislative history.  Pp.911.


(b)This Court rejects the District Courts reliance on 3162(a)(2), which provides that a defendant whose trial does not begin on time is deemed to have waived the right to move for dismissal if that motion is not filed prior to trial or entry of a guilty plea.  That section makes no mention of prospective waivers, and there is no reason to think that Congress wanted to treat prospective and retrospective waivers similarly.  Allowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the Act because, in many cases, the prosecution, defense, and court would all like to opt out, to the detriment of the public interest.  Section 3162(a)(2)s retrospective waiver does not pose a comparable danger.  Because the prosecution and court cannot know until the trial starts or the guilty plea is entered whether the defendant will forgo moving to dismiss, they retain a strong incentive to make sure the trial begins on time.  Pp.1112.


2.Petitioner is not estopped from challenging the excludability under the Act of the 1997 continuance.  Factors that typically inform the decision whether to apply the [estoppel] doctrine in a particular case include (1) whether a partys later position [is] clearly inconsistent with its earlier position; (2) whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that  earlier position; and (3) whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.  New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U. S. 742, 750751.  None of the three possible positions taken by petitioner gives rise to an estoppel.  First, recognizing an estoppel based on petitioners promise not to move for dismissal under 3162(a)(2) would entirely swallow the Acts no-waiver policy.  Second, petitioners (mistaken) agreement that waivers are enforceable does not provide a ground for estoppel because petitioner did not succee[d] in persuading the District Court to accept the validity of prospective waivers.  On the contrary, the District Court requested the waiver and produced the form for petitioner to sign.  Even if the other factors favor estoppel, they do not predominate.  Finally, petitioners representation at the January 31 status conference that a continuance was needed to gather evidence of the bonds authenticity does not support estoppel because that position was not clearly inconsistent with the position that he now takes in seeking dismissal, i.e., that delay from that continuance was not excluded under the Act.  Nothing in the discussion at the conference suggests that the question presented by the continuance request was viewed as anything other than a case-management question laying entirely within the District Courts discretion.  Pp.1215.


3.When a district court makes no findings on the record to support a 3161(h)(8) continuance, harmless-error review is not appropriate.  The Government argues that an express finding need not be entered contemporaneously and could be supplied on remand.  But the Act requires express findings, see 3161(h)(8)(A), and at the very least implies that those findings must be put on the record by the time the district court rules on the motion to dismiss.  Because the District Court made no such express findings, the 1997 continuance is not excluded from the speedy trial clock.  This error is not subject to harmless-error review.  Harmless-error review under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) presumptively applies to all errors where a proper objection is made, Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 7, but strong support for an implied repeal of Rule 52(a) in this context is provided by the Acts unequivocal provisions, which specify that a trial shall commence within 70 days, 3161(c)(1) (emphasis added), and that [n]o  period of delay from an ends-of-justice continuance shall be excludable from the time period unless the court sets forth its reasoning, 3161(h)(8)(A) (emphasis added).  Applying harmless-error review would also tend to undermine the detailed requirements of the provisions regulating ends-of-justice continuances.  Pp. 1518.


4.Because the 91-day continuance, which was not excluded from the speedy trial clock, exceeded the maximum 70-day delay, the Act was violated, and there is no need to address whether other periods of delay were not excludable.  The District Court may determine in the first instance whether the dismissal in this case should be with or without prejudice.  Pp.1819.

04-473|"GARCETTI etal. v. CEBALLOS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04473.Argued October 12, 2005Reargued March 21, 2006Decided May 30, 2006
Respondent Ceballos, a supervising deputy district attorney, was asked by defense counsel to review a case in which, counsel claimed, the affidavit police used to obtain a critical search warrant was inaccurate.  Concluding after the review that the affidavit made serious misrepresentations, Ceballos relayed his findings to his supervisors, petitioners here, and followed up with a disposition memorandum recommending dismissal.  Petitioners nevertheless proceeded with the prosecution.  At a hearing on a defense motion to challenge the warrant, Ceballos recounted his observations about the affidavit, but the trial court rejected the challenge.  Claiming that petitioners then retaliated against him for his memo in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Ceballos filed a 42 U. S.C. 1983 suit.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling, inter alia, that the memo was not protected speech because Ceballos wrote it pursuant to his employment duties.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that the memos allegations were protected under the First Amendment analysis in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, and Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138.  
Held:When public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, they are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.  Pp.514.
(a)Two inquiries guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded public employee speech.  The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  See Pickering, supra, at 568.  If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on the employers reaction to the speech.  See Connick, supra, at 147.  If the answer is yes, the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises.  The question becomes whether the government employer had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.  See Pickering, supra, at 568.  This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speakers expressions and employment.  Without a significant degree of control over its employees words and actions, a government employer would have little chance to provide public services efficiently.  Cf. Connick, supra, at 143.  Thus, a government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its employer role, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect its operations.  On the other hand, a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless still a citizen.  The First Amendment limits a public employers ability to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as private citizens.  See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597.  So long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.  See, e.g., Connick, supra, at 147.  Pp.58.


(b)Proper application of the Courts precedents leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employees expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.  Because Ceballos memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.  The dispositive factor here is not that Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, see, e.g., Givhan v. Western Line Consol. School Dist., 439 U. S. 410, 414, nor that the memo concerned the subject matter of his employment, see, e.g., Pickering, 391 U. S. at 573.  Rather, the controlling factor is that Ceballos expressions were made pursuant to his official duties.  That consideration distinguishes this case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline.  Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he was employed to do.  He did not act as a citizen by writing it.  The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.  Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employees professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.  It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.  Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 833.  This result is consistent with the Courts prior emphasis on the potential societal value of employee speech and on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations.  Ceballos proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Ninth Circuit, would commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role, mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business.  This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no support in the Courts precedents. The doctrinal anomaly the Court of Appeals perceived in compelling public employers to tolerate certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made pursuant to an employees assigned duties misconceives the theoretical underpinnings of this Courts decisions and is unfounded as a practical matter.  Pp.813.


(c)Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance, and various measures have been adopted to protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.  These include federal and state whistle-blower protection laws and labor codes and, for government attorneys, rules of conduct and constitutional obligations apart from the First Amendment.  However, the Courts precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.  Pp.1314.

certiorari to the supreme court of utah
No. 05502.Argued April 24, 2006Decided May 22, 2006
Responding to a 3 a.m. call about a loud party, police arrived at the house in question, heard shouting inside, proceeded down the driveway, and saw two juveniles drinking beer in the backyard.  Entering the yard, they saw through a screen door and windows an altercation in the kitchen between four adults and a juvenile, who punched one of the adults, causing him to spit blood in a sink.  An officer opened the screen door and announced the officers presence.  Unnoticed amid the tumult, the officer entered the kitchen and again cried out, whereupon the altercation gradually subsided.  The officers arrested respondents and charged them with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and related offenses.  The trial court granted their motion to suppress all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home on the ground that the warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court held that the injury caused by the juveniles punch was insufficient to trigger the emergency aid doctrine because it did not give rise to an objectively reasonable belief that an unconscious, semiconscious, or missing person feared injured or dead was in the home.  Furthermore, the court suggested the doctrine was inapplicable because the officers had not sought to assist the injured adult but had acted exclusively in a law enforcement capacity.  The court also held that the entry did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.
Held:Police may enter a home without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an occupant is seriously injured or imminently threatened with such injury.


Because the Fourth Amendments ultimate touchstone is reasonableness, the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.  For example, one exigency obviating the requirement is the need to render emergency assistance to occupants of private property who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.  Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 392.  This Court has repeatedly rejected respondents contention that, in assessing the reasonableness of an entry, consideration should be given to the subjective motivations of individual officers.  Because the officers subjective motivation is irrelevant, Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n.2, it does not matter here whether they entered the kitchen to arrest respondents and gather evidence or to assist the injured and prevent further violence.  Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 46, and Florida v. Wells, 495 U. S. 1, 4, distinguished.  Relying on this Courts holding in Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 753, that an important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists is the gravity of the underlying offense for which the arrest is being made, respondents further contend that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the officers intrusion into the home.  This contention is misplaced.  In Welsh, the only potential emergency confronting the officers was the need to preserve evidence of the suspects blood-alcohol level, an exigency the Court held insufficient under the circumstances to justify a warrantless entry into the suspects home.  Ibid.  Here, the officers were confronted with ongoing violence occurring within the home, a situation Welsh did not address.


The officers entry here was plainly reasonable under the circumstances.  Given the tumult at the house when they arrived, it was obvious that knocking on the front door would have been futile.  Moreover, in light of the fracas they observed in the kitchen, the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help and that the violence was just beginning.  Nothing in the Fourth Amendment required them to wait until another blow rendered someone unconscious, semiconscious, or worse before entering.  The manner of their entry was also reasonable, since nobody heard the first announcement of their presence, and it was only after the announcing officer stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again that the tumult subsided.  That announcement was at least equivalent to a knock on the screen door and, under the circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendments knock-and-announce rule.  Furthermore, once the announcement was made, the officers were free to enter; it would serve no purpose to make them stand dumbly at the door awaiting a response while those within brawled on, oblivious to their presence.

certiorari to the supreme judicial court of maine
No. 041527.Argued February 21, 2006Decided May 15, 2006
Petitioner company (Warren) asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to renew federal licenses for five of the hydroelectric dams it operates on a Maine river to generate power for its paper mill.  Each dam impounds water, which is then run through turbines and returned to the riverbed, passing around a section of the river.  Under protest, Warren applied for water quality certifications from respondent Maine Board of Environmental Protection pursuant to 401 of the Clean Water Act, which requires state approval of any activity which may result in any discharge into the [Nations] navigable waters.  FERC licensed the dams subject to compliance with those certifications, which require Warren to maintain a minimum stream flow and to allow passage for certain fish and eels.  After losing state administrative appeals, Warren filed suit in a state court, which rejected Warrens claim that its dams do not result in a discharge under 401.  The State Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.
Held: Because a dam raises a potential for a discharge, 401 is triggered and state certification is required.  Pp.315.
(a) The Clean Water Act does not define discharge, but provides that the term when used without qualification includes a discharge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants, 33 U. S.C. 1362(16).  But discharge is presumably broader, else superfluous, and since it is neither defined nor a term of art, it should be construed in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476.  When applied to water, discharge commonly means flowing or issuing out, Websters New International Dictionary 742.  This Court has consistently intended that meaning in prior water cases, including the only case focused on 401, PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cty. v. Washington Dept. of Ecology, 511 U. S. 700, in which no one questioned that the discharge of water from a dam fell within 401s ambit.  The Environmental Protection Agency and FERC have also regularly read discharge to cover releases from hydroelectric dams.  Pp.36.


(b) Warrens three arguments for avoiding this common reading are unavailing.  The canon noscitur a sociisa word is known by the company it keeps, Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575does not apply here.  Warren claims that since discharge is keeping company with discharge defined as adding one or more pollutants, see 1362(12), discharge standing alone must also require the addition of something foreign to the water.  This argument seems to assume that pairing a broad statutory term with a narrow one shrinks the broad one, but there is no such general usage of language this way.  Warren also relies on South Fla. Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe, 541 U. S. 95, but that case is not on point.  It addressed 402, not 401, and the two sections are not interchangeable, as they serve different purposes and use different language to reach them.  Thus, that something must be added in order to implicate 402 does not explain what suffices for a discharge under 401.  Finally, the Clean Water Acts legislative history, if it means anything, goes against Warrens reading of discharge.  Pp.612.


(c) Warrens arguments against reading discharge in its common sense also miss the forest for the trees.  Congress passed the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nations waters, 33 U. S.C. 1251(a), the national goal being to achieve water quality [providing] for the protection and propagation of fish  and  for recreation, 1251(a)(2).  To do this, the Act deals with pollution generally, see 1251(b), which it defines as the man-made or man-induced alteration of the [waters] chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity, 1362(19).  Because the alteration of water quality as thus defined is a risk inherent in limiting river flow and releasing water through turbines, changes in the rivers flow, movement, and circulation fall within a States legitimate legislative business.  State certifications under 401 are essential in the scheme to preserve state authority to address the broad range of pollution.  Reading 401 to give discharge its common and ordinary meaning preserves the state authority apparently intended.  Pp.1215.
2005 ME 27, 868 A.2d 210, affirmed.
Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined as to all but Part IIIC.

04-1704|"DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. etal. v. CUNO etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 041704.Argued March 1, 2006Decided May 15, 2006
The city of Toledo and State of Ohio sought to encourage DaimlerChrysler Corp. to expand its Toledo operations by offering it local property tax exemptions and a state franchise tax credit.  A group of plaintiffs including Toledo residents who pay state and local taxes sued in state court, alleging that the tax breaks violated the Commerce Clause.  The taxpayer plaintiffs claimed injury because the tax breaks depleted the state and local treasuries to which they contributed.  Defendants removed the action to District Court.  Plaintiffs moved to remand to state court because, inter alia, they doubted whether they satisfied either the constitutional or prudential limitations on standing in federal court.  The District Court declined to remand the case, concluding that plaintiffs had standing under the municipal taxpayer standing rule articulated in Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447.  On the merits, the court found that neither tax benefit violated the Commerce Clause.  Without addressing standing, the Sixth Circuit agreed as to the municipal tax exemption, but held that the state franchise tax credit violated the Commerce Clause.  Defendants sought certiorari to review the invalidation of the franchise tax credit, and plaintiffs sought certiorari to review the upholding of the property tax exemption.  This Court granted review to consider whether the franchise tax credit violates the Commerce Clause, and directed the parties to address the issue of standing.
Held:Plaintiffs have not established their standing to challenge the state franchise tax credit.  Because they have no standing to challenge that credit, the lower courts erred by considering their claims on the merits.  Pp.418.
1.State taxpayers have no standing under Article III to challenge state tax or spending decisions simply by virtue of their status as taxpayers.  Pp.413.


(a)Before this Court can address the merits of plaintiffs challenge, it has an obligation to assure itself that the merits question is presented in a proper Article III case or controversy.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560.  The case-or-controversy limitation is crucial in maintaining the tripartite allocation of power set forth in the Constitution.  Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 474.  Article III standing  enforces the  case-or-controversy requirement.  Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 11.  The requisite elements of standing are familiar: A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751.  Plaintiffs, as the parties now asserting federal jurisdiction, must carry the burden of establishing their standing.  Pp.46.


(b)Plaintiffs principal claim that the franchise tax credit depletes state funds to which they contribute through their taxes, and thus diminishes the total funds available for lawful uses and imposes disproportionate burdens on them, is insufficient to establish standing under Article III.  This Court has denied federal taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds simply because they are taxpayers.  See, e.g., Valley Forge Christian College, supra, at 476482.  The animating principle behind cases such as Valley Forge was announced in Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, in which the Court observed that a federal taxpayers interest in the moneys of the Treasury  is shared with millions of others; is comparatively minute and indeterminable; and the effect upon future taxation, of any payment out of the funds, so remote, fluctuating and uncertain, that no basis is afforded for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity.  Id., at 486487.  This rationale applies with undiminished force to state taxpayers who allege simply that a state fiscal decision will deplete the fisc and impose disproportionate burdens on them.  See Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 433434.  Because state budgets frequently have an array of tax and spending provisions that may be challenged on a variety of bases, affording state taxpayers standing to press such challenges simply because their tax burden gives them an interest in the state treasury would interpose the federal courts as virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of state fiscal administration, contrary to the more modest role Article III envisions for federal courts.  See Allen, supra,at 760761.  Pp.711.


(c)Also rejected is plaintiffs argument that they have state taxpayer standing on the ground that their Commerce Clause challenge is just like the Establishment Clause challenge this Court permitted in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 105106.  Flast allowed an Establishment Clause challenge by federal taxpayers to a congressional action under Art.I, 8.  Although Flast held out the possibility that specific [constitutional] limitations other than the Establishment Clause might support federal taxpayer standing, id., at 105, 85, only the Establishment Clause has been held to do so since Flast, see, e.g., Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 618.  Plaintiffs reliance on Flast is misguided: Whatever rights plaintiffs have under the Commerce Clause, they are fundamentally unlike the right not to contribute even three pence to support a religious establishment that was upheld in Flast, 392 U. S., at 103.  Indeed, plaintiffs compare the two Clauses at such a high level of generality that almost any constitutional constraint on government power could be likened to the Establishment Clause as interpreted in Flast.  Id., at 105.  And a finding that the Commerce Clause satisfies the Flast test because it often implicates governments fiscal decisions would leave no principled way of distinguishing other constitutional provisions that also constrain governments taxing and spending decisions.  See, e.g., Arkansas Writers Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221.  Yet such a broad application of Flasts exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing would be at odds with Flasts own promise that it would not transform federal courts into forums for taxpayers generalized grievances.  392 U. S., at 106.  Pp.1113.


2.Plaintiffs status as municipal taxpayers does not give them standing to challenge the state franchise tax credit at issue.


This Court has noted with approval the standing of municipal taxpayers to enjoin the illegal use of a municipal corporations funds.  See, e.g., Frothingham, supra, at 486487.  But plaintiffs attempts to leverage the notion of municipal taxpayer standing into standing to challenge the state tax credit are unavailing.  Pp.1318.


(a)Plaintiffs argue that because state law requires revenues from the franchise tax to be distributed to local governments, the award of a credit to DaimlerChrysler reduced such distributions and thus depleted the funds of local governments to which plaintiffs pay taxes.  But plaintiffs challenge is still to the state law and state decision, not those of plaintiffs municipality.  Their argument thus suffers from the same defects that the claim of state taxpayer standing exhibits.  Pp.1415. 


(b)Also rejected is plaintiffs claim that their standing to challenge the municipal property tax exemption supports jurisdiction over their challenge to the franchise tax credit under the supplemental jurisdiction recognized in Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715.  Gibbs held that federal-question jurisdiction over a claim may authorize a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims that may be viewed as part of the same case because they derive from a common nucleus of operative fact as the federal claim.  Id., at 725.  Plaintiffs assume that Gibbs stands for the proposition that federal jurisdiction extends to all claims sufficiently related to a claim within Article III to be part of the same case, regardless of the deficiency that would keep the former claims out of federal court if presented on their own.  This Courts general approach to the application of Gibbs has been markedly more cautious.  See, e.g., Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. ___, ___.  The Court has never applied Gibbs rationale to permit a federal court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that does not itself satisfy those elements of the Article III inquiry, such as constitutional standing, that serv[e] to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.  Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155.  There is no reason to read Gibbs language as broadly as plaintiffs urge, particularly since the Courts standing cases confirm that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press, see, e.g., Allen, supra, at 752.  If standing were commutative, as plaintiffs claim, the Courts insistence that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought, see, e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 185, would make little sense when all claims for relief derive from a common nucleus of operative fact, as they appear to have in cases like Laidlaw.


Such a reading of Gibbs would have remarkable implications.  The doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and political question all originate in Article IIIs case or controversy language, no less than standing does.  See, e.g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U. S. 803, 808.  Yet if Gibbs common nucleus formulation announced a new definition of case or controversy for all Article III purposes, a federal court would be free to entertain moot or unripe claims, or claims presenting a political question, if they derived from the same operative fact[s] as another federal claim suffering from none of these defects.  Plaintiffs reading of Gibbs, therefore, would amount to a significant revision of the Courts precedent interpreting Article III.  With federal courts thus deciding issues they would not otherwise be authorized to decide, the tripartite allocation of power that Article III is designed to maintain, Valley Forge, supra, at 474, would quickly erode, and the Courts emphasis on the standing requirements role in maintaining this separation would be rendered hollow rhetoric, see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 357.  Pp.1518.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 05130.Argued March 29, 2006Decided May 15, 2006
Petitioners operate popular Internet Web sites that allow private sellers to list goods they wish to sell.  Respondent sought to license its business method patent to petitioners, but no agreement was reached.  In respondents subsequent patent infringement suit, a jury found that its patent was valid, that petitioners had infringed the patent, and that damages were appropriate.  However, the District Court denied respondents motion for permanent injunctive relief.  In reversing, the Federal Circuit applied its general rule that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances.  401 F.3d 1323, 1339.  
Held:The traditional four-factor test applied by courts of equity when considering whether to award permanent injunctive relief to a prevailing plaintiff applies to disputes arising under the Patent Act.  That test requires a plaintiff to demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.  The decision to grant or deny such relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 05130.Argued March 29, 2006Decided May 15, 2006
Petitioners operate popular Internet Web sites that allow private sellers to list goods they wish to sell.  Respondent sought to license its business method patent to petitioners, but no agreement was reached.  In respondents subsequent patent infringement suit, a jury found that its patent was valid, that petitioners had infringed the patent, and that damages were appropriate.  However, the District Court denied respondents motion for permanent injunctive relief.  In reversing, the Federal Circuit applied its general rule that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances.  401 F.3d 1323, 1339.  
Held:The traditional four-factor test applied by courts of equity when considering whether to award permanent injunctive relief to a prevailing plaintiff applies to disputes arising under the Patent Act.  That test requires a plaintiff to demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.  The decision to grant or deny such relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court, reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.  These principles apply with equal force to Patent Act disputes.  [A] major departure from the long tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied.  Weinberger v.

SERVICES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 05260.Argued March 28, 2006Decided May 15, 2006
Petitioner Sereboffs are beneficiaries under a health insurance plan administered by respondent Mid Atlantic and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The plan provides for payment of covered medical expenses and has an Acts of Third Parties provision.  This provision requires a beneficiary who is injured as a result of an act or omission of a third party to reimburse Mid Atlantic for benefits it pays on account of those injuries, if the beneficiary recovers for those injuries from the third party.  The Sereboffs were involved in an automobile accident and suffered injuries.  The plan paid the couples medical expenses.  The Sereboffs sought compensatory damages for the accident from third parties in state court.  After the Sereboffs settled their tort suit, Mid Atlantic filed suit in District Court under 502(a)(3) of ERISA, seeking to collect from the Sereboffs tort recovery the medical expenses it had paid on the Sereboffs behalf.  The Sereboffs agreed to set aside from their tort recovery a sum equal to the amount Mid Atlantic claimed, and preserve this sum in an investment account pending the outcome of the suit.  The court found in Mid Atlantics favor and ordered the Sereboffs to turn over the amount set aside.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed in relevant part, and observed that the Courts of Appeals are divided on the question whether 502(a)(3) authorizes recovery in these circumstances.  This Court granted review to resolve this disagreement.  
Held:Mid Atlantics action properly sought equitable relief under 502(a)(3).  Pp.311.
(a)A fiduciary may bring a civil action under 502(a)(3)(B) to obtain  appropriate equitable relief  to enforce  the terms of the plan.  The only question here is whether the relief requested was equitable.  In Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, this Court construed 502(a)(3)(B) to authorize only those categories of relief that were typically available in equity, and thus rejected a claim that this Court found sought nothing other than compensatory damages.  Id., at 207208.  This Court elaborated on this construction of 502(a)(3) in Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. 204, which involved a provision in an ERISA plan similar to the Acts of Third Parties provision in the Sereboffs plan.  Relying on such a provision, Great-West sought equitable restitution of benefits it had paid when Knudson recovered in tort from a third party.  In considering whether 502(a)(3)(b) authorized such relief, this Court asked whether the restitutionary remedy Great-West sought would have been equitable in the days of the divided bench, id., at 212.  This Court found that it would not have been equitable, because the funds Great-West sought were not in Knudsons possession but had been placed in a trust under California law.  That impediment is not present here.  Mid Atlantic sought identifiable funds within the Sereboffs possession and controlthat part of the tort settlement due Mid Atlantic under the ERISA plan and set aside in the investment account.  Pp.35.


(b)This Courts case law from the days of the divided bench confirms that Mid Atlantics claim is equitable.  In Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U. S. 117, attorney Barnes promised two other attorneys one-third of the contingent fee he expected in a case, id., at 119.  Based on the familiar rul[e] of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing, id., at 121, the Court found that Barnes undertaking create[d] a lien upon the portion of the recovery due him from the client, ibid., which the other attorneys could follow  into [Barnes] hands as soon as [the fund] was identified, id., at 123.  The Acts of Third Parties provision in the Sereboffs plan, like Barnes promise, specifically identified a particular fund distinct from the Sereboffs general assets, and a particular share of that fund to which Mid Atlantic was entitled.  Thus, Mid Atlantic could rely on a familiar rul[e] of equity to collect for the medical bills it had paid by following a portion of the recovery into the [Sereboffs] hands as soon as [the settlement fund] was identified, and imposing on that portion a constructive trust or equitable lien.  Ibid.  


The Sereboffs object that Mid Atlantics suit would not have satisfied the strict tracing rules that they say accompanied equitable restitution at common law.  But Barnes confirms that no such tracing requirement applies to equitable liens imposed by agreement or assignment, like that in Barnes itself.  And Knudson did not endorse application of all restitutionary conditions, like the tracing rules the Sereboffs identify, to every action for an equitable lien under 502(a)(3).  Knudson simply held that equitable restitution was unavailable because the funds Great-West sought were not in Knudsons possession.  


The Sereboffs also argue that equitable relief is inappropriate, even under Barnes, because at the time they agreed to the plan terms, no fund existed in which they could grant Mid Atlantic an equitable interest.  But Barnes explicitly disapproved of a rule requiring identification at the time a contract is made of the fund to which a lien specified in the contract attached.  


The Sereboffs also claim that the rule announced in Barnes applies only to equitable liens claimed under an attorneys contingency fee arrangement.  But Barnes did not attach any particular significance to the identify of the parties seeking recovery, and other cases of this Court, not involving attorneys contingency fees, have applied the same familiar rul[e] of equity that Barnes did.  See, e.g., Walker v. Brown, 165 U. S. 654.  Pp.510.


(c)The Sereboffs contention that the lower courts erred in allowing enforcement of the Acts of Third Parties provision, without imposing limitations that would apply to an equitable subrogation action, is rejected.  Mid Atlantics claim is not considered equitable because it is a subrogation claim.  Rather, it is considered equitable because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement, of the sort epitomized by Barnes.  Pp.1011. 
407 F.3d 212, affirmed in relevant part.
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

04-1327|"HOLMES v. SOUTH CAROLINA
certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina
No. 041327.Argued February 22, 2006Decided May 1, 2006
At petitioners South Carolina trial for murder and related crimes, the prosecution relied heavily on forensic evidence that strongly supported petitioners guilt.  Petitioner sought to undermine the States forensic evidence by introducing expert testimony suggesting that the evidence had been contaminated and that the police had engaged in a plot to frame him.  Petitioner also sought to introduce evidence that another man, Jimmy McCaw White, had been in the victims neighborhood on the morning of the assault and that White had either acknowledged petitioners innocence or admitted to committing the crimes himself.  In Whites pretrial testimony, he denied making the incriminating statements and provided an alibi for the time of the assault.


The trial court excluded petitioners third-party guilt evidence citing the State Supreme Courts Gregory decision, which held such evidence admissible if it raises a reasonable inference as to the defendants own innocence, but inadmissible if it merely casts a bare suspicion or raises a conjectural inference as to anothers guilt.  Affirming the trial court, the State Supreme Court cited both Gregory and its later decision in Gay, and held that where there is strong forensic evidence of an appellants guilt, proffered evidence about a third partys alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellants own innocence.  Applying this standard, the court held that petitioner could not overcome the forensic evidence against him.  
Held:A criminal defendants federal constitutional rights are violated by an evidence rule under which the defendant may not introduce evidence of third-party guilt if the prosecution has introduced forensic evidence that, if believed, strongly supports a guilty verdict.  [S]tate and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.  United States v. Scheffer, 523 U. S. 303, 308.  This latitude, however, has limits.  Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.  Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690.  This right is abridged by evidence rules that infring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused and are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.  Scheffer, supra, at 308.


While the Constitution thus prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.  An application of this principle is found in rules regulating the admission of evidence proffered by criminal defendants to show that someone else committed the crime with which they are charged.  Such rules are widely accepted and are not challenged here.


In Gregory, the South Carolina Supreme Court adopted and applied a rule intended to be of this type.  In Gay and this case, however, that court radically changed and extended the Gregory rule by holding that, where there is strong evidence of a defendants guilt, especially strong forensic evidence, proffered evidence about a third partys alleged guilt may (or perhaps must) be excluded.  Under this rule, the trial judge does not focus on the probative value or the potential adverse effects of admitting the defense evidence of third-party guilt.  Instead, the critical inquiry concerns the strength of the prosecutions case: If the prosecutions case is strong enough, the evidence of third-party guilt is excluded even if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues.  Furthermore, as applied below, the rule seems to call for little, if any, examination of the credibility of the prosecutions witnesses or the reliability of its evidence.


By evaluating the strength of only one partys evidence, no logical conclusion can be reached regarding the strength of contrary evidence offered by the other side to rebut or cast doubt.  Because the rule applied below did not heed this point, the rule is arbitrary in the sense that it does not rationally serve the end that the Gregory rule and other similar third-party guilt rules were designed to further.  Nor has the State identified any other legitimate end served by the rule.  Thus, the rule violates a criminal defendants right to have a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.  Crane, supra, at 690.  Pp.411.
361 S.C. 333, 605 S.E. 2d 19, vacated and remanded.

04-1506|"ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES etal. v. AHLBORN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 041506.Argued February 27, 2006Decided May 1, 2006
Federal Medicaid law requires participating States to ascertain the legal liability of third parties  to pay for [an individual benefits recipients] care and services available under the [States] plan, 42 U. S.C. 1396a(a)(25)(A); to seek reimbursement for [medical] assistance to the extent of such legal liability, 1396a(a)(25)(B); to enact laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made  for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services, 1396a(a)(25)(H); to provide that, as a condition of [Medicaid] eligibility  , the individual is required  (A) to assign the State any rights  to payment for medical care from any third party;  (B) to cooperate with the State  in obtaining [such] payments  and  (C)  in identifying, and providing information to assist the State in pursuing, any third party who may be liable, 1396k(a)(1).  Finally, any amount collected by the State under an assignment made as described above shall be retained by the State  to reimburse it for [Medicaid] payments made on behalf of the recipient.  1396k(b).  [T]he remainder of such amount collected shall be paid to the recipient.  Ibid.  Acting pursuant to its understanding of these provisions, Arkansas passed laws under which, when a state Medicaid recipient obtains a tort settlement following payment of medical costs on her behalf, a lien is automatically imposed on the settlement in an amount equal to Medicaids costs.  When that amount exceeds the portion of the settlement representing medical costs, satisfaction of the States lien requires payment out of proceeds meant to compensate the recipient for damages distinct from medical costs, such as pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.


Following respondent Ahlborns car accident with allegedly negligent third parties, petitioner Arkansas Department of Health Services (ADHS) determined that Ahlborn was eligible for Medicaid and paid providers $215,645.30 on her behalf.  She filed a state-court suit against the alleged tortfeasors seeking damages for past medical costs and for other items including pain and suffering, loss of earnings and working time, and permanent impairment of her future earning ability.  The case was settled out of court for $550,000, which was not allocated between categories of damages.  ADHS did not participate or ask to participate in the settlement negotiations, and did not seek to reopen the judgment after the case was dismissed, but did intervene in the suit and assert a lien against the settlement proceeds for the full amount it had paid for Ahlborns care.  She filed this action in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the States lien violated federal law insofar as its satisfaction would require depletion of compensation for her injuries other than past medical expenses.  The parties stipulated, inter alia, that the settlement amounted to approximately one-sixth of the reasonable value of Ahlborns claim and that, if her construction of federal law was correct, ADHS would be entitled to only the portion of the settlement ($35,581.47) that constituted reimbursement for medical payments made.  In granting ADHS summary judgment, the court held that under Arkansas law, which it concluded did not conflict with federal law, Ahlborn had assigned ADHS her right to recover the full amount of Medicaids payments for her benefit.  The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that ADHS was entitled only to that portion of the settlement that represented payments for medical care.  
Held:Federal Medicaid law does not authorize ADHS to assert a lien on Ahlborns settlement in an amount exceeding $35,581.47, and the federal anti-lien provision affirmatively prohibits it from doing so.  Arkansas third-party liability provisions are unenforceable insofar as they compel a different conclusion.  Pp.923.
(a)Arkansas statute finds no support in the federal third-party liability provisions.  That ADHS cannot claim more than the portion of Ahlborns settlement that represents medical expenses is suggested by 1396k(a)(1)(A), which requires that Medicaid recipients, as a condition of eligibility, assign the State any rights  to payment for medical care from any third party (emphasis added), not their rights to payment for, e.g., lost wages.  The other statutory language ADHS relies on is not to the contrary, but reinforces the assignment provisions implicit limitation.  First, statutory context shows that 1396a(a)(25)(B)s requirement that States seek reimbursement for [medical] assistance to the extent of such legal liability refers to the legal liability of third parties  to pay for care and services available under the plan, 1396a(a)(25)(A) (emphases added).  Here, because the tortfeasors accepted liability for only one-sixth of Ahlborns overall damages, and ADHS has stipulated that only $35,581.47 of that sum represents compensation for medical expenses, the relevant liability extends no further than that amount.  Second, 1396a(a)(25)(H)s requirement that the State enact laws giving it the right to recover from liable third parties to the extent [it made] payment  for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual does not limit the States recovery only by the amount it paid out on the recipients behalf, since the rest of the provision makes clear that the State must be assigned the rights of [the recipient] to payment by any other party for such health care items or services.  (Emphasis added.)  Finally, 1396k(b)s requirement that, where the State actively pursues recovery from the third party, Medicaid be reimbursed fully from any amount collected by the State under an assignment before the remainder of such amount collected is remitted to the recipient does not show that the State must be paid in full from any settlement.  Rather, because the States assigned rights extend only to recovery of medical payments, what 1396k(b) requires is that the State be paid first out of any damages for medical care before the recipient can recover any of her own medical costs.  Pp.913.


(b)Arkansas statute squarely conflicts with the federal Medicaid laws anti-lien provision, 1396p(a)(1), which prohibits States from imposing liens against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid  on his behalf under the State plan.  Even if the States lien is assumed to be consistent with federal law insofar as it encumbers proceeds designated as medical payments, the anti-lien provision precludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.  ADHS attempt to avoid the anti-lien provision by characterizing the settlement proceeds as not Ahlborns property, but as the States, fails for two reasons.  First, because the settlement is not received from a third party, as required by the state statute, until Ahlborns chose in action has been reduced to proceeds in her possession, the assertion that any of the proceeds belonged to the State all along lacks merit.  Second, the States argument that Ahlborn lost her property rights in the proceeds the instant she applied for medical assistance is inconsistent with the creation of a statutory lien on those proceeds: ADHS would not need a lien on its own property.  Pp.1317. 


(c)The Court rejects as unpersuasive ADHS and the United States arguments that a rule permitting a lien on more than medical damages ought to apply here either because Ahlborn breached her duty to cooperate with ADHS or because there is an inherent danger of manipulation in cases where the parties to a tort case settle without judicial oversight or input from the State.  As 1396k(a)(1)(C) demonstrates, the duty to cooperate arises principally, if not exclusively, in proceedings initiated by the State to recover from third parties.  In any event, the aspersions cast upon Ahlborn are entirely unsupported; all the record reveals is that ADHS neither asked to be nor was involved in the settlement negotiations.  Whatever the bounds of the duty to cooperate, there is no evidence that it was breached here.  Although more colorable, the alternative argument that a rule of full reimbursement is needed generally to avoid the risk of settlement manipulation also fails.  The risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the States interest can be avoided either by obtaining the States advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.  Pp.1719. 


(d)Also rejected is ADHS contention that the Eighth Circuit accorded insufficient weight to two decisions by the Departmental Appeals Board (Board) of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rejecting appeals by two States from denial of reimbursement for costs they paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients who had settled tort claims.  Although HHS generally has broad regulatory authority in the Medicaid area, the Court declines to treat the Boards reasoning in those cases as controlling because they address a different question from the one posed here, make no mention of the anti-lien provision, and rest on a questionable construction of the federal third-party liability provisions.  Pp.1923. 
397 F.3d 620, affirmed.
Stevens, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

			"|"ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES etal. v. AHLBORN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 041506.Argued February 27, 2006Decided May 1, 2006
Federal Medicaid law requires participating States to ascertain the legal liability of third parties  to pay for [an individual benefits recipients] care and services available under the [States] plan, 42 U. S.C. 1396a(a)(25)(A); to seek reimbursement for [medical] assistance to the extent of such legal liability, 1396a(a)(25)(B); to enact laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made  for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services, 1396a(a)(25)(H); to provide that, as a condition of [Medicaid] eligibility  , the individual is required  (A) to assign the State any rights  to payment for medical care from any third party;  (B) to cooperate with the State  in obtaining [such] payments  and  (C)  in identifying, and providing information to assist the State in pursuing, any third party who may be liable, 1396k(a)(1).  Finally, any amount collected by the State under an assignment made as described above shall be retained by the State  to reimburse it for [Medicaid] payments made on behalf of the recipient.  1396k(b).  [T]he remainder of such amount collected shall be paid to the recipient.  Ibid.  Acting pursuant to its understanding of these provisions, Arkansas passed laws under which, when a state Medicaid recipient obtains a tort settlement following payment of medical costs on her behalf, a lien is automatically imposed on the settlement in an amount equal to Medicaids costs.  When that amount exceeds the portion of the settlement representing medical costs, satisfaction of the States lien requires payment out of proceeds meant to compensate the recipient for damages distinct from medical costs, such as pain and suffering, lost wages, and loss of future earnings.


Following respondent Ahlborns car accident with allegedly negligent third parties, petitioner Arkansas Department of Health Services (ADHS) determined that Ahlborn was eligible for Medicaid and paid providers $215,645.30 on her behalf.  She filed a state-court suit against the alleged tortfeasors seeking damages for past medical costs and for other items including pain and suffering, loss of earnings and working time, and permanent impairment of her future earning ability.  The case was settled out of court for $550,000, which was not allocated between categories of damages.  ADHS did not participate or ask to participate in the settlement negotiations, and did not seek to reopen the judgment after the case was dismissed, but did intervene in the suit and assert a lien against the settlement proceeds for the full amount it had paid for Ahlborns care.  She filed this action in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the States lien violated federal law insofar as its satisfaction would require depletion of compensation for her injuries other than past medical expenses.  The parties stipulated, inter alia, that the settlement amounted to approximately one-sixth of the reasonable value of Ahlborns claim and that, if her construction of federal law was correct, ADHS would be entitled to only the portion of the settlement ($35,581.47) that constituted reimbursement for medical payments made.  In granting ADHS summary judgment, the court held that under Arkansas law, which it concluded did not conflict with federal law, Ahlborn had assigned ADHS her right to recover the full amount of Medicaids payments for her benefit.  The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that ADHS was entitled only to that portion of the settlement that represented payments for medical care.  
Held:Federal Medicaid law does not authorize ADHS to assert a lien on Ahlborns settlement in an amount exceeding $35,581.47, and the federal anti-lien provision affirmatively prohibits it from doing so.  Arkansas third-party liability provisions are unenforceable insofar as they compel a different conclusion.  Pp.923.
(a)Arkansas statute finds no support in the federal third-party liability provisions.  That ADHS cannot claim more than the portion of Ahlborns settlement that represents medical expenses is suggested by 1396k(a)(1)(A), which requires that Medicaid recipients, as a condition of eligibility, assign the State any rights  to payment for medical care from any third party (emphasis added), not their rights to payment for, e.g., lost wages.  The other statutory language ADHS relies on is not to the contrary, but reinforces the assignment provisions implicit limitation.  First, statutory context shows that 1396a(a)(25)(B)s requirement that States seek reimbursement for [medical] assistance to the extent of such legal liability refers to the legal liability of third parties  to pay for care and services available under the plan, 1396a(a)(25)(A) (emphases added).  Here, because the tortfeasors accepted liability for only one-sixth of Ahlborns overall damages, and ADHS has stipulated that only $35,581.47 of that sum represents compensation for medical expenses, the relevant liability extends no further than that amount.  Second, 1396a(a)(25)(H)s requirement that the State enact laws giving it the right to recover from liable third parties to the extent [it made] payment  for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual does not limit the States recovery only by the amount it paid out on the recipients behalf, since the rest of the provision makes clear that the State must be assigned the rights of [the recipient] to payment by any other party for such health care items or services.  (Emphasis added.)  Finally, 1396k(b)s requirement that, where the State actively pursues recovery from the third party, Medicaid be reimbursed fully from any amount collected by the State under an assignment before the remainder of such amount collected is remitted to the recipient does not show that the State must be paid in full from any settlement.  Rather, because the States assigned rights extend only to recovery of medical payments, what 1396k(b) requires is that the State be paid first out of any damages for medical care before the recipient can recover any of her own medical costs.  Pp.913.


(b)Arkansas statute squarely conflicts with the federal Medicaid laws anti-lien provision, 1396p(a)(1), which prohibits States from imposing liens against the property of any individual prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid  on his behalf under the State plan.  Even if the States lien is assumed to be consistent with federal law insofar as it encumbers proceeds designated as medical payments, the anti-lien provision precludes attachment or encumbrance of the remainder of the settlement.  ADHS attempt to avoid the anti-lien provision by characterizing the settlement proceeds as not Ahlborns property, but as the States, fails for two reasons.  First, because the settlement is not received from a third party, as required by the state statute, until Ahlborns chose in action has been reduced to proceeds in her possession, the assertion that any of the proceeds belonged to the State all along lacks merit.  Second, the States argument that Ahlborn lost her property rights in the proceeds the instant she applied for medical assistance is inconsistent with the creation of a statutory lien on those proceeds: ADHS would not need a lien on its own property.  Pp.1317. 


(c)The Court rejects as unpersuasive ADHS and the United States arguments that a rule permitting a lien on more than medical damages ought to apply here either because Ahlborn breached her duty to cooperate with ADHS or because there is an inherent danger of manipulation in cases where the parties to a tort case settle without judicial oversight or input from the State.  As 1396k(a)(1)(C) demonstrates, the duty to cooperate arises principally, if not exclusively, in proceedings initiated by the State to recover from third parties.  In any event, the aspersions cast upon Ahlborn are entirely unsupported; all the record reveals is that ADHS neither asked to be nor was involved in the settlement negotiations.  Whatever the bounds of the duty to cooperate, there is no evidence that it was breached here.  Although more colorable, the alternative argument that a rule of full reimbursement is needed generally to avoid the risk of settlement manipulation also fails.  The risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the States interest can be avoided either by obtaining the States advance agreement to an allocation or, if necessary, by submitting the matter to a court for decision.  Pp.1719. 


(d)Also rejected is ADHS contention that the Eighth Circuit accorded insufficient weight to two decisions by the Departmental Appeals Board (Board) of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rejecting appeals by two States from denial of reimbursement for costs they paid on behalf of Medicaid recipients who had settled tort claims.  Although HHS generally has broad regulatory authority in the Medicaid area, the Court declines to treat the Boards reasoning in those cases as controlling because they address a different question from the one posed here, make no mention of the anti-lien provision, and rest on a questionable construction of the federal third-party liability provisions.

04-1544|"MARSHALL v. MARSHALL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 041544.Argued February 28, 2006Decided May 1, 2006
Among longstanding limitations on federal-court jurisdiction otherwise properly exercised are the so-called domestic relations and probate exceptions.  Neither is compelled by the text of the Constitution or federal statute.  Both are judicially created doctrines stemming in large measure from misty understandings of English legal history.  In view of lower federal-court decisions expansively interpreting the two exceptions, this Court reined in the domestic relations exception in Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S. 689, and endeavored similarly to curtail the probate exception in Markham v. Allen, 326 U. S. 490.


Petitioner, Vickie Lynn Marshall (Vickie), a.k.a. Anna Nicole Smith, is the surviving widow of J. Howard Marshall II (J. Howard), who died without providing for Vickie in his will.  According to Vickie, J. Howard intended to provide for her through a gift in the form of a catch-all trust.  Respondent, E. Pierce Marshall (Pierce), J. Howards son, was the ultimate beneficiary of J. Howards estate plan.  While the estate was subject to ongoing Texas Probate Court proceedings, Vickie filed for bankruptcy in California.  Pierce filed a proof of claim in the federal bankruptcy court, alleging that Vickie had defamed him when, shortly after J. Howards death, her lawyers told the press that Pierce had engaged in forgery, fraud, and overreaching to gain control of his fathers assets.  Pierce sought a declaration that his claim was not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Vickie answered, asserting truth as a defense.  She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected from J. Howard.  Vickies tortious interference counterclaim turned her objection to Pierces claim into an adversary proceeding, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3007, in which the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for Vickie on Pierces claim and, after a trial on the merits, entered judgment for Vickie on her counterclaim.  The court also held that both Vickies objection to Pierces claim and her counterclaim qualified as core proceedings under 28 U. S.C. 157, which meant that the court had authority to enter a final judgment disposing of those claims.  It awarded Vickie substantial compensatory and punitive damages.  Pierce then filed a post-trial motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting that Vickies tortious interference claim could be tried only in the Texas probate proceedings.  The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion.  Relying on Markham, the Bankruptcy Court observed that a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in probate property, so long as its final judgment does not interfere with the state courts possession of the property.  Subsequently, the Texas Probate Court declared that J. Howards estate plan was valid.


Back in the federal forum, Pierce sought district-court review of the Bankruptcy Courts judgment.  Among other things, the District Court held that the probate exception did not reach Vickies counterclaim.  Citing Markham, 326 U. S., at 494, the court said that the exception would bar federal jurisdiction only if such jurisdiction would interfere with the probate proceedings.  It would not do so, the court concluded, because: (1) success on Vickies counterclaim did not necessitate any declaration that J. Howards will was invalid, and (2) under Texas law, probate courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction to entertain claims of the kind Vickies counterclaim asserted.  The court also held that Vickies claim did not qualify as a core proceedin[g] over which a bankruptcy court may exercise plenary power, see 28 U. S.C. 157(b)(c). Accordingly, the District Court treated the Bankruptcy Courts judgment as proposed, rather than final, and undertook de novo review.  Adopting and supplementing the Bankruptcy Courts findings, the District Court determined that Pierce had tortiously interfered with Vickies expectancy by, inter alia, conspiring to suppress or destroy the inter vivos trust instrument J. Howard had directed his lawyers to prepare for Vickie, and to strip J. Howard of his assets by backdating, altering, and otherwise falsifying documents and presenting them to J. Howard under false pretenses.  The District Court awarded Vickie some $44.3 million in compensatory damages and, based on overwhelming evidence of Pierces willfulness, maliciousness, and fraud, an equal amount in punitive damages.


The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Although the Court of Appeals recognized that Vickies claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter, it nonetheless held that the probate exception bars federal jurisdiction in this case.  It read the exception broadly to exclude from the federal courts adjudicatory authority not only direct challenges to a will or trust, but also questions which would ordinarily be decided by a probate court in determining the validity of the decedents estate planning instrument, whether those questions involve fraud, undue influence, or tortious interference with the testators intent.  The court also held that a States vesting of exclusive jurisdiction over probate matters in a special court strips federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain any probate related matter, including claims respecting tax liability, debt, gift, and tort.  Noting that the Probate Court had ruled it had exclusive jurisdiction over all of Vickies claims, the Ninth Circuit held that ruling binding on the Federal District Court.  
Held:The Ninth Circuit had no warrant from Congress, or from this Courts decisions, for its sweeping extension of the probate exception recognized in those decisions.  Because this case does not fall within the exceptions scope, the District Court properly asserted jurisdiction over Vickies counterclaim against Pierce.  Pp. 818.
(a)Ankenbrandt addressed the domestic relations exceptions derivation and limits.  Among other things, the Court, 504 U. S., at 693695, traced the current exception to Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 584589, in which the Court had announced in dictawithout citation or discussionthat federal courts lack jurisdiction over suits for divorce or alimony.  Finding no Article III impediment to federal-court jurisdiction in domestic relations cases, 504 U. S., at 695697, the Ankenbrandt Court, id., at 698701, anchored the exception in the Judiciary Act of 1789, which, until 1948, provided circuit court diversity jurisdiction over all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.  The Barber majority, the Ankenbrandt Court acknowledged, 504 U. S., at 698, did not expressly tie its announcement of a domestic relations exception to the text of the diversity statute, but the Barber dissenters made the connection.  Because English chancery courts lacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees, the dissenters stated, United States courts similarly lacked authority to decree divorces or award alimony, 21 How., at 605.  The Ankenbrandt Court was content to rest [its] conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction not on the accuracy of [Barbers] historical justifications, but, rather, on Congress apparent acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdiction provisions in the years prior to 1948, 504 U. S., at 700.  Ankenbrandt further determined that Congress did not intend to terminate the exception in 1948 when it replace[d] the law/equity distinction with the phrase all civil actions.  Id., at 700.  The Ankenbrandt Court nevertheless emphasized that the exception covers only a narrow range of domestic relations issues.  Id., at 701.  Noting that some lower federal courts had applied the exception well beyond the circumscribed situations posed by Barber and its progeny, ibid., the Court clarified that only divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees remain outside federal jurisdictional bounds, id., at 703, 704.  While recognizing state tribunals special proficiency in handling issues arising in the granting of such decrees, id., at 704, the Court viewed federal courts as equally equipped to deal with complaints alleging torts, ibid.  Pp. 811. 


(b)This Court has recognized a probate exception, kin to the domestic relations exception, to otherwise proper federal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Markham, the Courts most recent and pathmarking pronouncement on the subject.  Among other things, the Markham Court first stated that, although a federal court has no jurisdiction to probate a will or administer an estate[,] it has [long] been established  that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to entertain suits in favor of creditors, legatees and heirs and other claimants against a decedents estate to establish their claims so long as the federal court does not interfere with the probate proceedings or assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court. 326 U. S., at 494.  The Court next described a probate exception of distinctly limited scope: [W]hile a federal court may not exercise its jurisdiction to disturb or affect the possession of property in the custody of a state court,  it may exercise its jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in such property where the final judgment does not undertake to interfere with the state courts possession save to the extent that the state court is bound by the judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the federal court.  Ibid.  The first of these quoted passages is not a model of clear statement, and some lower federal courts have read the words interfere with the probate proceedings to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedents estate, including an executors breach of fiduciary duty.  This Court reads Markhams enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe disturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.  Ibid.  Though that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, redundancy in this context is preferable to incoherence.  This Court therefore comprehends Markhams interference language as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising in rem jurisdiction over a res, a second court will not assume in rem jurisdiction over the same res.  See, e.g., Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, 294 U. S. 189, 195196.  Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedents estate; it also precludes federal courts from disposing of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.  But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.  Pp. 1115. 


(c)Vickies claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.  Provoked by Pierces claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickies claim alleges the widely recognized tort of interference with a gift or inheritance.  She seeks an in personam judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will.  Cf. Sutton v. English, 246 U. S. 199, 208.  Nor does she seek to reach a res in a state courts custody.  See Markham, 326 U. S., at 494.  Furthermore, no sound policy considerations militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover this case.  Cf. Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 703.  Trial courts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges.  State probate courts possess no special proficiency in handling such issues.  Cf. id., at 704.  P.15.  


(d)This Court rejects the Ninth Circuits alternate rationale that the Texas Probate Courts jurisdictional ruling bound the Federal District Court.  Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for interference with an expected gift or inheritance.  It is clear, under Erie R.Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, that Texas law governs the substantive elements of Vickies tortious interference claim.  But it is also clear that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to adjudicate a transitory tort.  See Tennessee Coal, Iron & R.Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354, 360.  Jurisdiction is determined by the law of the courts creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a [state] statute  , even though it created the right of action.  Ibid.  Directly on point, the Court has held that federal-court jurisdiction, having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, [can] not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.  McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 281.  Durfee v. Duke, 375 U. S. 106, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, is not to the contrary.  Durfee stands only for the proposition that a state courts final judgment determining its own jurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment.  See id., at 111, 115.  At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate Courts jurisdiction, but the federal courts jurisdiction to entertain Vickies tortious interference claim.  Under our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that genre.  Pp.1517.  


(e)The Ninth Circuit may address on remand the questions whether Vickies claim was core and Pierces arguments concerning claim and issue preclusion.  P.1718.
392 F.3d 1118, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

She also filed counterclaims, among them a claim that Pierce had tortiously interfered with a gift she expected from J. Howard.

The first of these quoted passages is not a model of clear statement, and some lower federal courts have read the words interfere with the probate proceedings to block federal jurisdiction over a range of matters well beyond probate of a will or administration of a decedents estate, including an executors breach of fiduciary duty.  This Court reads Markhams enigmatic words, in sync with the second above-quoted passage, to proscribe disturb[ing] or affect[ing] the possession of property in the custody of a state court.  Ibid.  Though that reading renders the first-quoted passage in part redundant, redundancy in this context is preferable to incoherence.  This Court therefore comprehends Markhams interference language as essentially a reiteration of the general principle that, when one court is exercising in rem jurisdiction over a res, a second court will not assume in rem jurisdiction over the same res.  See, e.g., Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, 294 U. S. 189, 195196.  Thus, the probate exception reserves to state probate courts the probate or annulment of a will and the administration of a decedents estate; it also precludes federal courts from disposing of property that is in the custody of a state probate court.  But it does not bar federal courts from adjudicating matters outside those confines and otherwise within federal jurisdiction.  Pp. 1115. 


(c)Vickies claim does not involve the administration of an estate, the probate of a will, or any other purely probate matter.  Provoked by Pierces claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, Vickies claim alleges the widely recognized tort of interference with a gift or inheritance.  She seeks an in personam judgment against Pierce, not the probate or annulment of a will.  Cf. Sutton v. English, 246 U. S. 199, 208.  Nor does she seek to reach a res in a state courts custody.  See Markham, 326 U. S., at 494.  Furthermore, no sound policy considerations militate in favor of extending the probate exception to cover this case.  Cf. Ankenbrandt, 504 U. S., at 703.  Trial courts, both federal and state, often address conduct of the kind Vickie alleges.  State probate courts possess no special proficiency in handling such issues.  Cf. id., at 704.  P.15.  


(d)This Court rejects the Ninth Circuits alternate rationale that the Texas Probate Courts jurisdictional ruling bound the Federal District Court.  Texas courts have recognized a state-law tort action for interference with an expected gift or inheritance.  It is clear, under Erie R.Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, that Texas law governs the substantive elements of Vickies tortious interference claim.  But it is also clear that Texas may not reserve to its probate courts the exclusive right to adjudicate a transitory tort.  See Tennessee Coal, Iron & R.Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354, 360.  Jurisdiction is determined by the law of the courts creation and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a [state] statute  , even though it created the right of action.  Ibid.  Directly on point, the Court has held that federal-court jurisdiction, having existed from the beginning of the Federal government, [can] not be impaired by subsequent state legislation creating courts of probate.  McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268, 281.  Durfee v. Duke, 375 U. S. 106, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, is not to the contrary.  Durfee stands only for the proposition that a state courts final judgment determining its own jurisdiction ordinarily qualifies for full faith and credit, so long as the jurisdictional issue was fully and fairly litigated in the court that rendered the judgment.  See id., at 111, 115.  At issue here, however, is not the Texas Probate Courts jurisdiction, but the federal courts jurisdiction to entertain Vickies tortious interference claim.  Under our federal system, Texas cannot render its probate courts exclusively competent to entertain a claim of that genre.  Pp.1517.  


(e)The Ninth Circuit may address on remand the questions whether Vickies claim was core and Pierces arguments concerning claim and issue preclusion.  P.1718.
392 F.3d 1118, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment."|
04-1477|"JONES v. FLOWERS etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas
No. 041477.Argued January 17, 2006Decided April 26, 2006
Petitioner Jones continued to pay the mortgage on his Arkansas home after separating from his wife and moving elsewhere in the same city.  Once the mortgage was paid off, the property taxeswhich had been paid by the mortgage companywent unpaid, and the property was certified as delinquent.  Respondent Commissioner of State Lands mailed Jones a certified letter at the propertys address, stating that unless he redeemed the property, it would be subject to public sale in two years.  Nobody was home to sign for the letter and nobody retrieved it from the post office within 15 days, so it was returned to the Commissioner, marked unclaimed.  Two years later, the Commissioner published a notice of public sale in a local newspaper.  No bids were submitted, so the State negotiated a private sale to respondent Flowers.  Before selling the house, the Commissioner mailed another certified letter to Jones, which was also returned unclaimed.  Flowers purchased the house and had an unlawful detainer notice delivered to the property.  It was served on Jones daughter, who notified him of the sale.  He filed a state-court suit against respondents, alleging that the Commissioners failure to provide adequate notice resulted in the taking of his property without due process.  Granting respondents summary judgment, the trial court concluded that Arkansas tax sale statute, which sets out the notice procedure used here, complied with due process.  The State Supreme Court affirmed.
Held:
1.When mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so.  Pp.412.


(a)This Court has deemed notice constitutionally sufficient if it was reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient when sent, see, e.g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314, but has never addressed whether due process requires further efforts when the government becomes aware prior to the taking that its notice attempt has failed.  Most Courts of Appeals and State Supreme Courts addressing this question have decided that the government must do more in such a case, and many state statutes require more than mailed notice in the first instance.  Pp.46.


(b)The means a State employs to provide notice must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.  Mullane, 399 U. S., at 315.  The adequacy of a particular form of notice is assessed by balancing the States interest against the individual interest sought to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 314.  Here, the evaluation concerns the adequacy of notice prior to the States extinguishing a property owners interest in a home.  It is unlikely that a person who actually desired to inform an owner about an impending tax sale of a house would do nothing when a certified letter addressed to the owner is returned unclaimed.  The sender would ordinarily attempt to resend the letter, if that is practical, especially given that it concerns the important and irreversible prospect of losing a house.  The State may have made a reasonable calculation of how to reach Jones, but it had good reason to suspect when the notice was returned that Jones was no better off than if no notice had been sent.  The government must consider unique information about an intended recipient regardless of whether a statutory scheme is reasonably calculated to provide notice in the ordinary case.  See Robinson v. Hanrahan, 409 U. S. 38, 40 (per curiam), and Covey v. Town of Somers, 351 U. S. 141, 146147.  It does not matter that the State in each of those cases was aware of the information before it calculated the best way to send notice.  Knowledge that notice was ineffective was one of the practicalities and peculiarities of the case taken into account, Mullane, supra, at 314315, and it should similarly be taken into account in assessing the adequacy of notice here.  The Commissioner and Solicitor General correctly note the constitutionality of that a particular notice procedure is assessed ex ante, not post hoc.  But if a feature of the States procedure is that it promptly provides additional information to the government about the effectiveness of attempted notice, the ex ante principle is not contravened by considering what the government does with that information.  None of the Commissioners additional contentionsthat notice was sent to an address that Jones provided and had a legal obligation to keep updated, that a property owner who fails to receive a property tax bill and pay taxes is on inquiry notice that his property is subject to governmental taking, and that Jones was obliged to ensure that those in whose hands he left his property would alert him if it was in jeopardyrelieves the State of its constitutional obligation to provide adequate notice.  Pp.712. 


2.Because additional reasonable steps were available to the State, given the circumstances here, the Commissioners effort to provide notice to Jones was insufficient to satisfy due process.  What is reasonable in response to new information depends on what that information reveals.  The certified letters return unclaimed meant either that Jones was not home when the postman called and did not retrieve the letter or that he no longer resided there.  One reasonable step addressed to the former possibility would be for the State to resend the notice by regular mail, which requires no signature.  Certified mail makes actual notice more likely only if someone is there to sign for the letter or tell the mail carrier that the address is incorrect.  Regular mail can be left until the person returns home, and might increase the chances of actual notice.  Other reasonable follow-up measures would have been to post notice on the front door or address otherwise undeliverable mail to occupant.  Either approach would increase the likelihood that any occupants would alert the owner, if only because an ownership change could affect their own occupancy.  Contrary to Jones claim, the Commissioner was not required to search the local phone book and other government records.  Such an open-ended search imposes burdens on the State significantly greater than the several relatively easy options outlined here.  The Commissioners complaint about the burden of even these additional steps is belied by Arkansas requirement that notice to homestead owners be accomplished by personal service if certified mail is returned and by the fact that the State transfers the cost of notice to the taxpayer or tax sale purchaser.  The Solicitor Generals additional argumentsthat posted notice could be removed by children or vandals, and that the follow-up requirement will encourage States to favor modes of delivery that will not generate additional informationare rejected.  This Court will not prescribe the form of service that Arkansas should adopt.  Arkansas can determine how best to proceed, and the States have taken a variety of approaches.  Pp.1217.

04-1495|"HARTMAN etal. v. MOORE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 041495.Argued January 10, 2006Decided April 26, 2006
Seeking to convince the United States Postal Service to incorporate multiline optical scanning technology, a company (REI), which manufactured multiline optical readers, commenced an extensive lobbying and public-relations campaign.  In the end, the Postal Service begrudgingly embraced the multiline technology, but awarded the lucrative equipment contract to a competing firm.  Subsequently, Postal Service inspectors investigated REI and its chief executive, respondent Moore, for their alleged involvement in a consulting-firm kickback scandal and for their alleged improper role in the search for a new Postmaster General.  Urged at least in part by the inspectors to bring criminal charges, a federal prosecutor tried REI and its top officials.  But, finding a complete lack of evidence connecting them to any wrongdoing, the District Court acquitted the defendants.  Moore then filed an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, against the federal prosecutor and petitioner postal inspectors, arguing, as relevant here, that they had engineered the prosecution in retaliation for his lobbying efforts.  The claims against the prosecutor were dismissed in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment.  Ultimately, the entire suit was dismissed, but the Court of Appeals reinstated the retaliatory-prosecution claim against the inspectors.  Back in District Court, the inspectors moved for summary judgment, claiming that because the underlying criminal charges were supported by probable cause they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  
Held:A plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution action must plead and show the absence of probable cause for pressing the underlying criminal charges.  Pp.515.
(a)As a general matter, this Court has held that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions, including criminal prosecutions, for speaking out.  Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U. S. 574, 592.  When nonretaliatory grounds are insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, retaliation is subject to recovery as the but-for cause of official injurious action offending the Constitution, see, e.g., id., at 593, and a vengeful federal officer is subject to damages under Bivens.  Pp.56.


(b)Although a Bivens (or 42 U. S.C. 1983) plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendants retaliatory animus and subsequent injury in any retaliation action, the need to demonstrate causation in the retaliatory-prosecution context presents an additional difficulty which can be overcome by a showing of the absence of probable cause.  In an ordinary retaliation case, the evidence of motive and injury are sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other, and the causation is understood to be but-for causation, without which the adverse action would not have been taken.  When the claimed retaliation is, however, a criminal charge, the action will differ in two ways.  First, evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the criminal charge will be highly valuable circumstantial evidence to prove or disprove retaliatory causation.  Demonstrating a lack of probable cause will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that the prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive.  Second, since the defendant in a retaliatory-prosecution case will not be the prosecutor, who has immunity, but an official who allegedly influenced the prosecutorial decision, the causal connection required is not between the retaliatory animus of one person and that persons own injurious action, as it is in the ordinary retaliation case, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the adverse action of another.  Because evidence of an inspectors animus does not necessarily show that the inspector induced the prosecutor to act when he would not have pressed charges otherwise and because of the longstanding presumption of regularity accorded prosecutorial decisionmaking, a showing of the absence of probable cause is needed to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agents retaliatory motive and the prosecutors injurious action and to rebut the presumption.  Pp.613.


(c)The significance of probable cause or the lack of it looms large, being a potential feature of every case, with obvious evidentiary value.   Though not necessarily dispositive, the absence of probable cause along with a retaliatory motive on the part of the official urging prosecution are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption of regularity behind the charging decision and enough for a prima facie inference that the unconstitutionally motivated inducement infected the prosecutors decision to go forward.

04-1324|"DAY v. McDONOUGH, INTERIM SECRETARY,
FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 041324.Argued February 27, 2006Decided April 25, 2006
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) sets a one-year limitation period for filing a state prisoners federal habeas corpus petition, running from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review, 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), but stops the one-year clock while the petitioners properly filed application for state postconviction relief is pending, 2244(d)(2).  Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is not challenged here, that tolling period does not include the 90 days in which a petitioner might have sought certiorari review in this Court challenging state-court denial of postconviction relief.


Petitioner Days Florida trial-court sentence was affirmed on December 21, 1999, and his time to seek this Courts review of the final state-court decision expired on March 20, 2000.  Day unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief 353 days later.  The trial courts judgment was affirmed on appeal, effective December 3, 2002.  Day petitioned for federal habeas relief 36 days later, on January 8, 2003.  Floridas answer asserted that the petition was timely because it was filed after 352 days of untolled time.  Inspecting the answer and attachments, however, a Federal Magistrate Judge determined that the State had miscalculated the tolling time: Under the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent, the untolled time was actually 388 days, rendering the petition untimely.  After affording Day an opportunity to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to meet AEDPAs one-year deadline, the Magistrate Judge found petitioners responses inadequate and recommended dismissal.  The District Court adopted the recommendation, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that a States patently erroneous concession of timeliness does not compromise a district courts authority sU. S.onte to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely.  
Held:In the circumstances here presented, the District Court had discretion to correct the States erroneous computation and, accordingly, to dismiss the habeas petition as untimely under AEDPAs one-year limitation.  Pp.211.
(a)A statute of limitations defense is not jurisdictional, therefore courts are under no obligation to raise the matter sU. S.onte.  Cf. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 458.  As a general matter, a defendant forfeits a statute of limitations defense not asserted in its answer or in an amendment thereto.  See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a) (made applicable to federal habeas proceedings by Rule 11 of the Rules governing such proceedings).  And the Court would count it an abuse of discretion to override a States deliberate waiver of the limitations defense.  But, in appropriate circumstances, a district court may raise a time bar on its own initiative.  The District Court in this case confronted no intelligent waiver on the States part, only an evident miscalculation of time.  In this situation the Court declines to adopt either an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever AEDPAs one-year clock has run, or, at the opposite extreme, a rule treating the States failure initially to plead the one-year bar as an absolute waiver.  Rather, the Court holds that a district court has discretion to decide whether the administration of justice is better served by dismissing the case on statute of limitations grounds or by reaching the merits of the petition.  This resolution aligns the statute of limitations with other affirmative defenses to habeas petitions, notably exhaustion of state remedies, procedural default, and nonretroactivity.  In Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 133, this Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a state prisoners failure to exhaust available state remedies before invoking federal habeas jurisdiction despite the States failure to interpose the exhaustion defense at the district-court level.  Similarly, in Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 389, the Court held that a federal court may, but need not, decline to apply [the nonretroactivity rule announced in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 310,] if the State does not argue it.  It would make scant sense to distinguish AEDPAs time bar from these other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners.  While a district court is not required to double-check the States math, cf. Pliler v. Ford, 542 U. S. 225, 231, no Rule, statute, or constitutional provision commands a judge who detects a clear computation error to suppress that knowledge.  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a).  The Court notes particularly that the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting sU. S.onte, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the States answer.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a).  There is no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.  Pp.210.  


(b)Before acting sU. S.onte, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.  It must also assure itself that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and determine whether the interests of justice would be better served by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.  See Granberry, 481 U. S., at 136. Here, the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a fair opportunity to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal.  The notice issued some nine months after the States answer.  No court proceedings or action occurred in the interim, and nothing suggests that the State strategically withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it.  From all that appears in the record, there was merely an inadvertent error, a miscalculation that was plain under Circuit precedent, and no abuse of discretion in following Granberry and Caspari.

			"|"DAY v. McDONOUGH, INTERIM SECRETARY,
FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 041324.Argued February 27, 2006Decided April 25, 2006
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) sets a one-year limitation period for filing a state prisoners federal habeas corpus petition, running from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review, 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), but stops the one-year clock while the petitioners properly filed application for state postconviction relief is pending, 2244(d)(2).  Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, which is not challenged here, that tolling period does not include the 90 days in which a petitioner might have sought certiorari review in this Court challenging state-court denial of postconviction relief.


Petitioner Days Florida trial-court sentence was affirmed on December 21, 1999, and his time to seek this Courts review of the final state-court decision expired on March 20, 2000.  Day unsuccessfully sought state postconviction relief 353 days later.  The trial courts judgment was affirmed on appeal, effective December 3, 2002.  Day petitioned for federal habeas relief 36 days later, on January 8, 2003.  Floridas answer asserted that the petition was timely because it was filed after 352 days of untolled time.  Inspecting the answer and attachments, however, a Federal Magistrate Judge determined that the State had miscalculated the tolling time: Under the controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent, the untolled time was actually 388 days, rendering the petition untimely.  After affording Day an opportunity to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to meet AEDPAs one-year deadline, the Magistrate Judge found petitioners responses inadequate and recommended dismissal.  The District Court adopted the recommendation, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, concluding that a States patently erroneous concession of timeliness does not compromise a district courts authority sU. S.onte to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely.  
Held:In the circumstances here presented, the District Court had discretion to correct the States erroneous computation and, accordingly, to dismiss the habeas petition as untimely under AEDPAs one-year limitation.  Pp.211.
(a)A statute of limitations defense is not jurisdictional, therefore courts are under no obligation to raise the matter sU. S.onte.  Cf. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 458.  As a general matter, a defendant forfeits a statute of limitations defense not asserted in its answer or in an amendment thereto.  See Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a) (made applicable to federal habeas proceedings by Rule 11 of the Rules governing such proceedings).  And the Court would count it an abuse of discretion to override a States deliberate waiver of the limitations defense.  But, in appropriate circumstances, a district court may raise a time bar on its own initiative.  The District Court in this case confronted no intelligent waiver on the States part, only an evident miscalculation of time.  In this situation the Court declines to adopt either an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever AEDPAs one-year clock has run, or, at the opposite extreme, a rule treating the States failure initially to plead the one-year bar as an absolute waiver.  Rather, the Court holds that a district court has discretion to decide whether the administration of justice is better served by dismissing the case on statute of limitations grounds or by reaching the merits of the petition.  This resolution aligns the statute of limitations with other affirmative defenses to habeas petitions, notably exhaustion of state remedies, procedural default, and nonretroactivity.  In Granberry v. Greer, 481 U. S. 129, 133, this Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a state prisoners failure to exhaust available state remedies before invoking federal habeas jurisdiction despite the States failure to interpose the exhaustion defense at the district-court level.  Similarly, in Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 389, the Court held that a federal court may, but need not, decline to apply [the nonretroactivity rule announced in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 310,] if the State does not argue it.  It would make scant sense to distinguish AEDPAs time bar from these other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners.  While a district court is not required to double-check the States math, cf. Pliler v. Ford, 542 U. S. 225, 231, no Rule, statute, or constitutional provision commands a judge who detects a clear computation error to suppress that knowledge.  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(a).  The Court notes particularly that the Magistrate Judge, instead of acting sU. S.onte, might have informed the State of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment to the States answer.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a).  There is no dispositive difference between that route, and the one taken here.  Pp.210.  


(b)Before acting sU. S.onte, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.  It must also assure itself that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and determine whether the interests of justice would be better served by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.  See Granberry, 481 U. S., at 136. Here, the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a fair opportunity to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal.  The notice issued some nine months after the States answer.  No court proceedings or action occurred in the interim, and nothing suggests that the State strategically withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it.

04-1618|"NORTHERN INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK v. CHATHAM COUNTY, GEORGIA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 041618.Argued March 1, 2006Decided April 25, 2006
Petitioner insurance company filed this admiralty suit against respondent County seeking damages resulting from a collision between a malfunctioning County drawbridge and a boat insured by petitioner.  Granting the County summary judgment, the District Court recognized that Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit does not extend to counties, but relied on Circuit precedent to conclude that sovereign immunity extends to counties and municipalities that, as here, exercise power delegated from the State.  The Eleventh Circuit, which was bound by that same precedent, affirmed.  It acknowledged that the County did not assert an Eleventh Amendment immunity defense, which would fail because, under other Circuit precedent, the County did not qualify as an arm of the State.  The Court of Appeals nonetheless concluded that common law has carved out a residual immunity that protects political subdivisions such as the County from suit.  
Held:An entity that does not qualify as an arm of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes cannot assert sovereign immunity as a defense to an admiralty suit.  Pp.  37.
(a)Immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today  except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.  Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 713.  Thus, the phrase Eleventh Amendment immunity  is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment.  Id., at 713.  Because preratification sovereignty is the source of immunity from suit, only States and arms of the State possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law.  See, e.g., id., at 740.  Accordingly, sovereign immunity does not extend to counties, see, e.g., Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 401, and n.19, even when they exercise a slice of state power, id., at 401.  The County argues unconvincingly that this Court has recognized a distinct residual immunity that permits adoption of a broader test than it applies in the Eleventh Amendment context to determine whether an entity is acting as an arm of the State entitled to immunity.  The Court has referenced only the States residuary and inviolable sovereignty that survived the Constitution.  See, e.g., Federal Maritime Commn v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 751.  Because the County may claim immunity neither based upon its identity as a county nor under an expansive arm-of-the-State test, it is subject to suit unless it was acting as an arm of the State, as delineated by this Courts precedents, in operating the drawbridge.  E.g., Alden, supra, at 756.  The County conceded below that it was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, and both the County and the Eleventh Circuit appear to have understood this concession to be based on the Countys failure to qualify as an arm of the State under this Courts precedent.  Moreover, certiorari was granted in this case premised on the conclusion that the County is not an arm of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes, and this Court presumes that to be the case.  The Countys concession and this Courts presumption are dispositive.  Pp.35.


(b)The Countys alternative argument that the Court should recognize a distinct sovereign immunity against in personam admiralty suits that bars cases arising from a countys exercise of core state functions with regard to navigable waters is rejected.  Such recognition cannot be reconciled with the Courts precedents, which applied the general principle that sovereign immunity does not bar a suit against a city to an admiralty suit as early as Workman v. New York City, 179 U. S. 552, 570.  The Court disagrees with the Countys contention that Workman does not govern the instant case under Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 498, where, in extending sovereign immunity beyond cases in law or equity to admiralty cases, the Court concluded that Workman involved only substantive admiralty law, not the power of the Court to exercise jurisdiction over a particular defendant.  But Workman did so precisely because the Court there held that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over municipal corporations.  See 179 U. S., at 565.  The Workman Court accordingly distinguished between the question before itwhether admiralty courts may, notwithstanding state law, redress a wrong committed by one over whom such courts have adequate jurisdiction, id., at 566, such as a municipal corporationand the question not before it, but before the Court in Ex parte New Yorkwhether admiralty courts may give redress in a case where jurisdiction over the person or property cannot be exerted, 179 U. S., at 566.  In the former circumstance, the court should apply general admiralty principles, while in the latter the court lacks the power to do so.  See id., at 570; Ex parte New York, supra, at 499500, 502503. Because here, as in Workman and in contrast to Ex parte New York, the defendant was an entity generally within the District Courts jurisdiction, Ex parte New York is inapposite, and Workman compels the conclusion that the County is unprotected by sovereign immunity.

The petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration.


The Fifth Circuit concluded that petitioners prior conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance constituted a controlled substance offense for purposes of United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines  Manual 4B1.1(a) (2003).  The term controlled substance offense is defined in pertinent part, however, as an offense under federal or state law . . . that prohibits . . . the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.  4B1.2(b) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit erred in treating petitioners conviction for simple possession as a controlled substance offense.  The Solicitor General acknowledges that the Fifth Circuit incorrectly ruled for the United States on this ground.  Brief in Opposition 89.

05-552|"ALBERTO R. GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. MICHELLE THOMAS etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05552.Decided April 17, 2006
Per Curiam.

The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General to grant an alien asylum if the alien cannot return to another country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.  101(a)(42)(A), as added, 201, 94 Stat. 102, 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added).  The respondents, Michelle Thomas and her immediate family, applied for asylum.  They checked boxes on the application form that indicated their claim rested upon fear of persecution in their native South Africa because of (1) their political opinion[s], and (2) their membership in a particular social group.  In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, they emphasized their fear of persecution because of their race (they are white) and their kinship with Michelles father-in-law, Boss Ronnie, a white South African who allegedly held racist views and mistreated black workers at the company at which he was a foreman.  The Immigration Judge, focusing upon questions of race and political views, rejected their claim.  And the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), responding to the Thomases primarily race-related arguments, summarily affirmed that decision.


On review, a Ninth Circuit panel held by a 2-to-1 vote that the Board had not adequately considered the Thomases claim of persecution because of membership in a particular social group, as relatives of Boss Ronnie.  Thomas v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 1169, 1177 (2004).  The Ninth Circuit took the matter en banc.  The en banc court, overruling what it considered aberrant contrary Circuit precedent, unanimously held that in principle a family may constitute a social group for the purposes of the refugee statutes.  409 F.3d 1177, 1187 (2005) (en banc) (emphasis added) (overruling, inter alia, Estrada-Posadas v. INS, 924 F.2d 916 (CA9 1991)).  In so doing, the court relied on earlier BIA opinions holding that certain kinship ties fall within the statutory term.  See id., at 1180, 1184-1186.


The court then went on to hold, over the dissent of four judges, that the particular family at issue, namely persons related to Boss Ronnie, fell within the scope of the statutory term particular social group and that the Thomases were attacked and threatened because they belonged to the particular social group of persons related to Boss Ronnie.  409 F.3d, at 1189.  The dissenting judges argued that the question whether the Thomases are a particular social group should first be considered by the relevant administrative agency.  Id., at 1193 (opinion of Rymer, J.) (emphasis in original).  And they said that the majoritys contrary decision was inconsistent with this Courts holding in INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 18 (2002) (per curiam).


The Solicitor General now asks us to grant certiorari to consider whether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in the first instance and without prior resolution of the questions by the relevant administrative agency, that members of a family can and do constitute a particular social group within the meaning of the Act.  Pet. for Cert. I.  He argues that a courts role in an immigration case is typically one of review, not of first view.  Id., at 29 (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)).  He adds that the decision clearly violates what this Court described in Ventura as the ordinary remand rule.  Pet. for Cert. 15 (quoting Ventura, supra, at 18).  And he concludes that the Ninth Circuits error is so obvious in light of Ventura that summary reversal would be appropriate.  Pet. for Cert. 29.


We agree with the Solicitor General.  The Ninth Circuits failure to remand is legally erroneous, and that error is obvious in light of Ventura, itself a summary reversal.


The alien in Ventura sought asylum on grounds of a reasonable fear of persecution in Guatemala on account of  [a] political opinion.  537 U. S., at 13.  The BIA held that the alien did not qualify for asylum because whatever persecution he faced when he left Guatemala in 1993 was not on account of a political opinion.  Ibid.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the record showed that in 1993 the alien did indeed face politically based persecution in Guatemala.  The Circuit then went on to consider the Governments alternative argumentthat, in any event, conditions within Guatemala had improved to the point that political persecution was no longer likely.  Ibid.  And the Circuit rejected this changed circumstances claim without first giving the agency an opportunity to consider the matter.  Id., at 14.


We reversed the Ninth Circuit summarily.  We pointed out that [w]ithin broad limits the law entrusts the agency to make the basic asylum eligibility decision.  Id., at 16.  In such circumstances, we added, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.  Ibid. (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 88 (1943)).  A court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.  Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U. S. 729, 744 (1985)).  Rather, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.  Ventura, supra, at 16 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 744; citing SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S.194, 196 (1947)).  Applying these basic legal principles, we concluded that every consideration that classically supports the laws ordinary remand requirement does so here.  Ventura, 537 U. S.,  at 16, 17.


We must reach the same conclusion in the present case.  The agency has not yet considered whether Boss Ronnies family presents the kind of kinship ties that constitute a particular social group.  The matter requires determining the facts and deciding whether the facts as found fall within a statutory term.  And as we said in Ventura:
The agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial determination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed discussion and analysis, help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.  Id., at 17.

We can find no special circumstance here that might have justified the Ninth Circuits determination of the matter in the first instance.  Thus, as in Ventura, the Court of Appeals should have applied the ordinary remand rule.  Id., at 18.


We grant the petition for certiorari.  We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  And we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

04-1067|"GEORGIA v. RANDOLPH
certiorari to the supreme court of georgia
No. 041067.Argued November 8, 2005Decided March 22, 2006
Respondents estranged wife gave police permission to search the marital residence for items of drug use after respondent, who was also present, had unequivocally refused to give consent.  Respondent was indicted for possession of cocaine, and the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence as products of a warrantless search unauthorized by consent.  The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that consent given by one occupant is not valid in the face of the refusal of another physically present occupant, and distinguished United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, which recognized the permissibility of an entry made with the consent of one co-occupant in the others absence.
Held:In the circumstances here at issue, a physically present co-occupants stated refusal to permit entry renders warrantless entry and search unreasonable and invalid as to him.  Pp.419.
(a)The Fourth Amendment recognizes a valid warrantless entry and search of a premises when the police obtain the voluntary consent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to share, common authority over the property, and no present co-tenant objects.  Matlock, supra, at 170; Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 186.  The constant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness in such cases is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations, which are influenced by property law but not controlled by its rules.  Thus, Matlock not only holds that a solitary co-inhabitant may sometimes consent to a search of shared premises, but also stands for the proposition that the reasonableness of such a search is in significant part a function of commonly held understandings about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each others interests.  Pp.46.


(b)Matlocks example of common understanding is readily apparent.  The assumption tenants usually make about their common authority when they share quarters is that any one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may be admitted in his absence.  Matlock placed no burden on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements, absent reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.  Pp.68.


(c)This Court took a step toward addressing the issue here when it held in Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U. S. 91, that overnight houseguests have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their temporary quarters.  If that customary expectation is a foundation of a houseguests Fourth Amendment rights, it should follow that an inhabitant of shared premises may claim at least as much.  In fact, a co-inhabitant naturally has an even stronger claim.  No sensible person would enter shared premises based on one occupants invitation when a fellow tenant said to stay out.  Such reticence would show not timidity but a realization that when people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to authority.  Absent some recognized hierarchy, e.g., parent and child, there is no societal or legal understanding of superior and inferior as between co-tenants.  Pp.810.


(d)Thus, a disputed invitation, without more, gives an officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have absent any consent.  Disputed permission is no match for the Fourth Amendment central value of respect for the privacy of the home, Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.

A co-tenant who has an interest in bringing criminal activity to light or in deflecting suspicion from himself can, e.g., tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.  This case, which recognizes limits on evidentiary searches, has no bearing on the capacity of the police, at the invitation of one tenant, to enter a dwelling over another tenants objection in order to protect a resident from domestic violence.  Though alternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside, nothing in social custom or its reflection in private law argues for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification before the government searches private living quarters over a residents objection.  Pp.1016.


(e)There are two loose ends.  First, while Matlocks explanation for the constitutional sufficiency of a co-tenants consent to enter and search recognized a co-inhabitants right to permit the inspection in his own right, 415 U. S., at 171, n.7, the right to admit the police is not a right as understood under property law.  It is, instead, the authority recognized by customary social usage as having a substantial bearing on Fourth Amendment reasonableness in specific circumstances.  The question here is whether customary social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority to prevail over the co-tenants objection, a question Matlock did not answer.  Second, a fine line must be drawn to avoid undercutting Matlockwhere the defendant, though not present, was in a squad car not far awayand Rodriguezwhere the defendant was asleep in the apartment and could have been roused by a knock on the door; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenants permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not part of the threshold colloquy, loses out.  Such formalism is justified.  So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance specifically to avoid a possible objection, there is practical value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, one recognizing the co-tenants permission when no fellow occupant is on hand, the other according dispositive weight to the fellow occupants expressed contrary indication.  Pp.1618.

			"|"GEORGIA v. RANDOLPH
certiorari to the supreme court of georgia
No. 041067.Argued November 8, 2005Decided March 22, 2006
Respondents estranged wife gave police permission to search the marital residence for items of drug use after respondent, who was also present, had unequivocally refused to give consent.  Respondent was indicted for possession of cocaine, and the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence as products of a warrantless search unauthorized by consent.  The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that consent given by one occupant is not valid in the face of the refusal of another physically present occupant, and distinguished United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164, which recognized the permissibility of an entry made with the consent of one co-occupant in the others absence.
Held:In the circumstances here at issue, a physically present co-occupants stated refusal to permit entry renders warrantless entry and search unreasonable and invalid as to him.  Pp.419.
(a)The Fourth Amendment recognizes a valid warrantless entry and search of a premises when the police obtain the voluntary consent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to share, common authority over the property, and no present co-tenant objects.  Matlock, supra, at 170; Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 186.  The constant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness in such cases is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations, which are influenced by property law but not controlled by its rules.  Thus, Matlock not only holds that a solitary co-inhabitant may sometimes consent to a search of shared premises, but also stands for the proposition that the reasonableness of such a search is in significant part a function of commonly held understandings about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each others interests.  Pp.46.


(b)Matlocks example of common understanding is readily apparent.  The assumption tenants usually make about their common authority when they share quarters is that any one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may be admitted in his absence.  Matlock placed no burden on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements, absent reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.  Pp.68.


(c)This Court took a step toward addressing the issue here when it held in Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U. S. 91, that overnight houseguests have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their temporary quarters.  If that customary expectation is a foundation of a houseguests Fourth Amendment rights, it should follow that an inhabitant of shared premises may claim at least as much.  In fact, a co-inhabitant naturally has an even stronger claim.  No sensible person would enter shared premises based on one occupants invitation when a fellow tenant said to stay out.  Such reticence would show not timidity but a realization that when people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to authority.  Absent some recognized hierarchy, e.g., parent and child, there is no societal or legal understanding of superior and inferior as between co-tenants.  Pp.810.


(d)Thus, a disputed invitation, without more, gives an officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have absent any consent.  Disputed permission is no match for the Fourth Amendment central value of respect for the privacy of the home, Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 610, and the States other countervailing claims do not add up to outweigh it.


A co-tenant who has an interest in bringing criminal activity to light or in deflecting suspicion from himself can, e.g., tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.  This case, which recognizes limits on evidentiary searches, has no bearing on the capacity of the police, at the invitation of one tenant, to enter a dwelling over another tenants objection in order to protect a resident from domestic violence.  Though alternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside, nothing in social custom or its reflection in private law argues for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification before the government searches private living quarters over a residents objection.

04-1371|"MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH, INC. v. DABIT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 041371.Argued January 18, 2006Decided March 21, 2006
Respondent Dabit filed a private securities fraud class action in federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction to advance his state-law claims that petitioner, his former employer, fraudulently manipulated stock prices, causing him and other brokers and their clients to keep their overvalued securities.  The District Court dismissed his amended complaint, finding his claims pre-empted by title I of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), which provides that no covered class action based on state law and alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party. 15 U. S.C. 78bb(f)(1)(A).  Vacating the judgment, the Second Circuit concluded that, to the extent the complaint alleged that brokers were fraudulently induced, not to sell or purchase, but to retain or delay selling, it fell outside SLUSAs pre-emptive scope. 
Held:The background, text, and purpose of SLUSAs pre-emption provision demonstrate that SLUSA pre-empts state-law holder class-action claims of the kind Dabit alleges.  Pp.517.
(a)The magnitude of the federal interest in protecting the integrity and efficiency of the national securities market cannot be overstated.  The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) anchor federal regulation of vital elements of this Nations economy.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b5, which was promulgated pursuant to 10(b) of the 1934 Act, is an important part of that regulatory scheme, and, like 10(b), prohibits deception, misrepresentation, and fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.  When, in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, this Court limited the Rule 10b5 private right of action to plaintiffs who were themselves purchasers or sellers, it relied on the widespread recognition that suits by nonpurchasers and nonsellers present a special risk of vexatious litigation that could frustrate or delay normal business activity, id., at 740.  Pp.58.


(b)Similar policy considerations prompted Congress to adopt legislation (Reform Act) targeted at perceived abuses of class actionse.g., nuisance filings and vexatious discovery requestsbut this effort prompted members of the plaintiffs bar to avoid the federal forum altogether.  To stem the shift of class actions from federal to state courts, Congress enacted SLUSA.  Pp.810.


(c)Both the class and the securities here are covered within SLUSAs meaning, and the complaint alleges misrepresentations and omissions of material facts.  The only disputed issue is whether the alleged wrongdoing was in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  Dabits narrow reading would pre-empt only those actions in which Blue Chip Stamps purchaser-seller requirement is met.  Insofar as that argument assumes that the Blue Chip Stamps rule stems from Rule 10b5s text, it must be rejected, for the Court relied on policy considerations in adopting that limitation, and it purported to define the scope of a private right of action under Rule 10b5, not to define in connection with the purchase or sale.  When this Court has sought to give meaning to that phrase in the 10(b) and Rule 10b5 context, it has broadly required that the alleged fraud coincide with a securities transaction, an interpretation that comports with the SECs longstanding views.  Congress can hardly have been unaware of this broad construction when it imported the phrase into SLUSA.  Where judicial interpretations have settled a statutory provisions meaning, repeating the same language in a new statute indicates the intent to incorporate the judicial interpretations as well.  That presumption is particularly apt here, because Congress not only used 10(b)s and Rule 10b5s words, but used them in another provision appearing in the same statute as 10(b).  The presumption that Congress envisioned a broad construction also follows from the particular concerns that culminated in SLUSAs enactment, viz., preventing state private securities class-action suits from frustrating the Reform Acts objectives.  A narrow construction also would give rise to wasteful, duplicative litigation in state and federal courts.  The presumption that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action, Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485, has less force here because SLUSA does not pre-empt any cause of action.  It simply denies the use of the class-action device to vindicate certain claims.  Moreover, tailored exceptions to SLUSAs pre-emptive commandfor, e.g., state agency enforcement proceedingsdemonstrate that Congress did not act cavalierly.  Finally, federal, not state, law has long been the principal vehicle for asserting class-action securities fraud claims.  Pp.1016.


(d)Dabits holder class action is distinguishable from a typical Rule 10b5 class action only in that it is brought by holders rather than sellers or purchasers.  That distinction is irrelevant for SLUSA pre-emption purposes.  The plaintiffs identity does not determine whether the complaint alleges the requisite fraud, and the alleged misconduct herefraudulent manipulation of stock pricesunquestionably qualifies as a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities as the phrase is defined in SEC v. Zandford, 535 U. S. 813, 820, and United States v. OHagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651.  Pp.1617.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 041414.Argued January 18, 2006Decided March 21, 2006
A Magistrate Judge issued an anticipatory search warrant for respondent Grubbs house based on a federal officers affidavit.  The affidavit explained that the warrant would not be executed until a parcel containing a videotape of child pornographywhich Grubbs had ordered from an undercover postal inspectorwas received at, and physically taken into, the residence.  The affidavit also referred to two attachments describing the residence and the items to be seized.  After the package was delivered and the search commenced, Grubbs was given a copy of the warrant, which included the attachments but not the supporting affidavit.  When he admitted ordering the videotape, he was arrested, and the videotape and other items were seized.  Following his indictment for receiving child pornography, see 18 U. S.C. 2252(a)(2), Grubbs moved to suppress the seized evidence, arguing, inter alia, that the warrant was invalid because it failed to list the triggering condition.  The District Court denied the motion, and Grubbs pleaded guilty.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the warrant ran afoul of the Fourth Amendments particularity requirement, which, under Circuit precedent, applied to the conditions precedent to an anticipatory warrant.
Held:
1.Anticipatory warrants are not categorically unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendments provision that no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.  Probable cause exists when there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238.  When an anticipatory warrant is issued, the fact that the contraband is not presently at the place described is immaterial, so long as there is probable cause to believe it will be there when the warrant is executed.  Anticipatory warrants are, therefore, no different in principle from ordinary warrants: They require the magistrate to determine (1) that it is now probable that (2) contraband, evidence of a crime, or a fugitive will be on the described premises (3) when the warrant is executed.  Where the anticipatory warrant places a condition (other than the mere passage of time) upon its execution, the first of these determinations goes not merely to what will probably be found if the condition is met, but also to the likelihood that the condition will be met, and thus that a proper object of seizure will be on the described premises.  Here, the occurrence of the triggering conditionsuccessful delivery of the videotapewould plainly establish probable cause for the search, and the affidavit established probable cause to believe the triggering condition would be satisfied.  Pp.37.


2.The warrant at issue did not violate the Fourth Amendments particularity requirement.  The Amendment specifies only two matters that the warrant must particularly describ[e]: the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.  That language is decisive here; the particularity requirement does not include the conditions precedent to execution of the warrant.  Cf. Dalia v. United States, 441 U. S. 238, 255, 257.  Respondents two policy rationalesthat setting forth the triggering condition in the warrant itself is necessary (1) to delineate the limits of the executing officers power and (2) to allow the individual whose property is searched or seized to police the officers conductfind no basis in either the Fourth Amendment or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41.

04-1152|"RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, etal. v.
FORUM FOR ACADEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 041152.Argued December 6, 2005Decided March 6, 2006
Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an association of law schools and law faculties, whose members have policies opposing discrimination based on, inter alia, sexual orientation.  They would like to restrict military recruiting on their campuses because they object to the Governments policy on homosexuals in the military, but the Solomon Amendmentwhich provides that educational institutions denying military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters will lose certain federal fundsforces them to choose between enforcing their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters and continuing to receive those funds.  In 2003, FAIR sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of an earlier version of the Solomon Amendment, arguing that forced inclusion and equal treatment of military recruiters violated its members First Amendment freedoms of speech and association.  Denying relief on the ground that FAIR had not established a likelihood of success on the merits, the District Court concluded that recruiting is conduct, not speech, and thus Congress could regulate any expressive aspect of the militarys conduct under United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367.  The District Court, however, questioned the Department of Defense (DOD) interpretation of the Solomon Amendment, under which law schools must provide recruiters access at least equal to that provided other recruiters.  Congress responded to this concern by codifying the DODs policy.  Reversing the District Courts judgment, the Third Circuit concluded that the amended Solomon Amendment violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine by forcing a law school to choose between surrendering First Amendment rights and losing federal funding for its university.  The court did not think that OBrien applied, but nonetheless determined that, if the activities were expressive conduct rather than speech, the Solomon Amendment was also unconstitutional under that decision.
Held:Because Congress could require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools freedoms of speech and association, the Third Circuit erred in holding that the Solomon Amendment likely violates the First Amendment.  Pp.521.
1.The Solomon Amendment should be read the way both the Government and FAIR interpret it: In order for a law school and its university to receive federal funding, the law school must offer military recruiters the same access to its campus and students that it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access.  Contrary to the argument of amici law professors, a school excluding military recruiters could not comply with the Solomon Amendment by also excluding any other recruiter that violates its nondiscrimination policy.  The Secretary of Defense must compare the militarys access to campuses and to students to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.  10 U. S.C.A. 983.  The statute does not focus on the content of a schools recruiting policy, but on the result achieved by the policy.  Applying the same policy to all recruiters does not comply with the statute if it results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military.  This interpretation is supported by the text of the statute and is necessary to give effect to the Solomon Amendments recent revision.  Pp. 58.


2.Under the Solomon Amendment, a university must allow equal access for military recruiters in order to receive certain federal funds.  Although there are limits on Congress ability to condition the receipt of funds, see, e.g., United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 210, a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly.  Because the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly imposing the Solomon Amendments access requirement, the statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.  Pp.820.


(a)As a general matter, the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals concluded that the statute violates law schools freedom of speech in a number of ways.  First, the law schools must provide military recruiters with some assistance clearly involving speech, such as sending e-mails and distributing flyers, if they provide such services to other recruiters.  This speech is subject to First Amendment scrutiny, but the compelled speech here is plainly incidental to the statutes regulation of conduct.  Compelling a law school that sends e-mails for other recruiters to send one for a military recruiter is simply not the same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance to the flag, West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, or forcing a Jehovahs Witness to display a particular motto on his license plate, Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, and it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it is.


Second, that military recruiters are, to some extent, speaking while on campus does not mean that the Solomon Amendment unconstitutionally requires laws schools to accommodate the militarys message by including those recruiters in interviews and recruiting receptions.  This Court has found compelled-speech violations where the complaining speakers own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate.  See, e.g., Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 566.  Here, however, the schools are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions.  They facilitate recruiting to assist their students in obtaining jobs.  Thus, a law schools recruiting services lack the expressive quality of, for example, the parade in Hurley.  Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, and nothing in the Solomon Amendment restricts what they may say about the militarys policies.


Third, freedom of speech can be violated by expressive conduct, but the expressive nature of the conduct regulated by the Solomon Amendment does not bring that conduct within the First Amendments protection.  Unlike flag burning, see Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, the conduct here is not so inherently expressive that it warrants protection under OBrien.  Before adoption of the Solomon Amendments equal-access requirement, law schools expressed their disagreement with the military by treating military recruiters differently from other recruiters.  These actions were expressive not because of the conduct but because of the speech that accompanied that conduct.  Moreover, even if the Solomon Amendment were regarded as regulating expressive conduct, it would be constitutional under OBrien.  Pp.818.


(b)The Solomon Amendment also does not violate the law schools freedom of expressive association.  Unlike Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, where the Boy Scouts freedom of expressive association was violated when a state law required the organization to accept a homosexual scoutmaster, the statute here does not force a law school to accept members it does not desire, id., at 648.  Law schools associate with military recruiters in the sense that they interact with them, but recruiters are not part of the school.  They are outsiders who come onto campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire studentsnot to become members of the schools expressive association.  The freedom of expressive association protects more than a groups membership decisions, reaching activities that affect a groups ability to express its message by making group membership less attractive.  But the Solomon Amendment has no similar effect on a law schools associational rights.  Students and faculty are free to associate to voice their disapproval of the militarys message; nothing about the statute affects the composition of the group by making membership less desirable.  Pp.1820.

			"|"RUMSFELD, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, etal. v.
FORUM FOR ACADEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 041152.Argued December 6, 2005Decided March 6, 2006
Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an association of law schools and law faculties, whose members have policies opposing discrimination based on, inter alia, sexual orientation.  They would like to restrict military recruiting on their campuses because they object to the Governments policy on homosexuals in the military, but the Solomon Amendmentwhich provides that educational institutions denying military recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters will lose certain federal fundsforces them to choose between enforcing their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters and continuing to receive those funds.  In 2003, FAIR sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of an earlier version of the Solomon Amendment, arguing that forced inclusion and equal treatment of military recruiters violated its members First Amendment freedoms of speech and association.  Denying relief on the ground that FAIR had not established a likelihood of success on the merits, the District Court concluded that recruiting is conduct, not speech, and thus Congress could regulate any expressive aspect of the militarys conduct under United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367.  The District Court, however, questioned the Department of Defense (DOD) interpretation of the Solomon Amendment, under which law schools must provide recruiters access at least equal to that provided other recruiters.  Congress responded to this concern by codifying the DODs policy.  Reversing the District Courts judgment, the Third Circuit concluded that the amended Solomon Amendment violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine by forcing a law school to choose between surrendering First Amendment rights and losing federal funding for its university.  The court did not think that OBrien applied, but nonetheless determined that, if the activities were expressive conduct rather than speech, the Solomon Amendment was also unconstitutional under that decision.
Held:Because Congress could require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the schools freedoms of speech and association, the Third Circuit erred in holding that the Solomon Amendment likely violates the First Amendment.  Pp.521.
1.The Solomon Amendment should be read the way both the Government and FAIR interpret it: In order for a law school and its university to receive federal funding, the law school must offer military recruiters the same access to its campus and students that it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access.  Contrary to the argument of amici law professors, a school excluding military recruiters could not comply with the Solomon Amendment by also excluding any other recruiter that violates its nondiscrimination policy.  The Secretary of Defense must compare the militarys access to campuses and to students to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.  10 U. S.C.A. 983.  The statute does not focus on the content of a schools recruiting policy, but on the result achieved by the policy.  Applying the same policy to all recruiters does not comply with the statute if it results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the military.  This interpretation is supported by the text of the statute and is necessary to give effect to the Solomon Amendments recent revision.  Pp. 58.


2.Under the Solomon Amendment, a university must allow equal access for military recruiters in order to receive certain federal funds.  Although there are limits on Congress ability to condition the receipt of funds, see, e.g., United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 210, a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly.  Because the First Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly imposing the Solomon Amendments access requirement, the statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.  Pp.820.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 041329.Argued November 29, 2005Decided March 1, 2006
Petitioners manufacture and market printing systems that include a patented printhead and ink container and unpatented ink, which they sell to original equipment manufacturers who agree that they will purchase ink exclusively from petitioners and that neither they nor their customers will refill the patented containers with ink of any kind.  Respondent developed ink with the same chemical composition as petitioners ink.  After petitioner Tridents infringement action was dismissed, respondent filed suit seeking a judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of Tridents patents on the ground that petitioners are engaged in illegal tying and monopolization in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  Granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court rejected respondents argument that petitioners necessarily have market power as a matter of law by virtue of the patent on their printhead system, thereby rendering the tying arrangements per se violations of the antitrust laws.  After carefully reviewing this Courts tying-arrangements decisions, the Federal Circuit reversed as to the 1 claim, concluding that it had to follow this Courts precedents until overruled by this Court. 
Held:Because a patent does not necessarily confer market power upon the patentee, in all cases involving a tying arrangement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has market power in the tying product.  Pp.317.
(a)Over the years, this Courts strong disapproval of tying arrangements has substantially diminished, as the Court has moved from relying on assumptions to requiring a showing of market power in the tying product.  The assumption in earlier decisions that such arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition, Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U. S. 293, 305306, was rejected in United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U. S. 610, 622 (Fortner II), and again in Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2, both of which involved unpatented tying products.  Nothing in Jefferson Parish suggested a rebuttable presumption of market power applicable to tying arrangements involving a patent on the tying good.  Pp.38.


(b)The presumption that a patent confers market power arose outside the antitrust context as part of the patent misuse doctrine, and migrated to antitrust law in International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392. See also Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488; United States v. Loews Inc., 371 U. S. 38.  Pp.810.


(c)When Congress codified the patent laws for the first time, it initiated the untwining of the patent misuse doctrine and antitrust jurisprudence.  At the same time that this Courts antitrust jurisprudence continued to rely on the assumption that tying arrangements generally serve no legitimate business purpose, Congress began chipping away at that assumption in the patent misuse context from whence it came.  Then, four years after Jefferson Parish repeated the presumption that patents confer market power, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate it in the patent misuse context.  While that amendment does not expressly refer to the antitrust laws, it invites reappraisal of International Salts per se rule.  After considering the congressional judgment reflected in the amendment, this Court concludes that tying arrangements involving patented products should be evaluated under the standards of cases like Fortner II and Jefferson Parish rather than the per se rule in Morton Salt and Loews.  Any conclusion that an arrangement is unlawful must be supported by proof of power in the relevant market rather than by a mere presumption thereof.  Pp.1113.


(d)Respondents alternatives to retention of the per se rulethat the Court endorse a rebuttable presumption that patentees possess market power when they condition the purchase of the patented product on an agreement to buy unpatented goods exclusively from the patentee, or differentiate between tying arrangements involving requirements ties and other types of tying arrangementsare rejected.  Pp.1416.  


(e)Because respondent reasonably relied on this Courts prior opinions in moving for summary judgment without offering evidence of the relevant market or proving petitioners power within that market, respondent should be given a fair opportunity to develop and introduce evidence on that issue, as well as other relevant issues, when the case returns to the District Court.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 041244.Argued November 30, 2005Decided February 28, 2006
Respondents, a national nonprofit organization that supports the legal availability of abortions and two health care clinics that perform abortions, filed a class action alleging that petitioners, individuals and organizations that oppose legal abortion, engaged in a nationwide conspiracy to shut down abortion clinics through violence and other unlawful acts.  Arguing that petitioners activities amounted in context to extortionate acts that created a pattern of racketeering activity, respondents based their claims on, inter alia, the Hobbs Act, which makes it a federal crime to obstruc[t], dela[y], or affec[t] commerce  by  robbery or extortion  or commit[ting] or threaten[ing] physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section, 18 U. S.C. 1951(a), and on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which defines a proscribed pattern of racketeering activity, 1962(a), in terms of certain predicate acts that include extortion, see 1961(1).  After trial, the jury concluded that petitioners violated RICOs civil provisions, the Hobbs Act, and other extortion-related laws.  In Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393 (NOW II), this Court reversed the Seventh Circuits affirmance of the jurys award of damages and the District Courts issuance of a permanent nationwide injunction.  The Court noted that the Hobbs Act defines extortion as necessarily including the improper obtaining of property from another, id., at 400 (quoting 1951(b)(2)); observed that the claimed property here consisted of a womans right to seek clinic services and the rights of clinic staff to perform their jobs and of clinics to provide care free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion, and fear, id., at 400401; decided that characterizing petitioners actions as an obtaining of property from respondents went well beyond permissible boundaries, id., at 402; and held, therefore, that petitioners did not commit extortion as defined by the Hobbs Act, id., at 397.  The Court concluded that, because all of the predicate acts supporting the jurys finding of a RICO violation had to be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed, id., at 411.  On remand, the Court of Appeals decided that, because this Court had not considered respondents alternative theory that the jurys RICO verdict rested not only on extortion-related conduct, but also on four instances (or threats) of physical violence unrelated to extortion, the cases must be remanded to the District Court to determine whether these four acts alone might constitute Hobbs Act violations (sufficient, as predicate acts under RICO, to support the injunction).  
Held:Physical violence unrelated to robbery or extortion falls outside the Hobbs Acts scope.  Congress did not intend to create a freestanding physical violence offense.  It did intend to forbid acts or threats of physical violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in what the Act refers to as robbery or extortion (and related attempts or conspiracies).  Pp.511. 
(a)The more restrictive reading of the statutory textthe one tying the prohibited violence to robbery or extortionis correct.  For one thing, it is the more natural reading.  The text preceding the physical violence clause does not forbid obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce; rather, it forbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce by robbery or extortion. 1951(a) (emphasis added).  This means that behavior that obstructs, delays, or affects commerce is a violation of the statute only if it also involves robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies).  Consequently, the reference in the physical violence clause to actions or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section seems to mean acts or threats of violence in furtherance of a plan or purpose to engage in robbery or extortion, for that is the only kind of behavior that the section otherwise makes a violation.  This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as affect commerce or in commerce to be read as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) granting that authority.  See, e.g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 273.  Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a violation of federal law.  Cf. Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 854.  Moreover, the statutes history supports the more restrictive reading: Both of the Hobbs Acts predecessor statutes made clear that the physical violence they prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce through coercion or extortion (1934 Act) or through extortion or robbery (1946 Act).  The Hobbs Acts legislative history contains nothing to the contrary.  That the present statutory language is less clear than the 1946 version does not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime.  To the contrary, Congress revised the Acts language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code, which was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.  Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 269, n.28.  The Court will not presume the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law absent a clearly expressed intent to do so.  Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 209.  Here there is no evidence of any such intent.  Finally, respondents interpretation broadens the Hobbs Acts scope well beyond what case law has assumed.  It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution.  Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach.  See, e.g., NOW II, supra, at 405.  Other Courts of Appeals have rejected respondents construction of the Act.  And in 1994, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S.C. 248(a)(3), which was aimed specifically at the type of activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting that Congress did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity.  Pp.59.


(b) Respondents reliance on the canon of statutory construction favoring interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity, is misplaced.  They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that take place through acts of violence (or related threats), see 1951(b)(1) and (2), there would be no reason for 1951(a) to contain its physical violence clause unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense.  Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the clause to do.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business.  Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the mobsters subordinates might not constitute attempted extortion or be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobsters plan, absent the specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion.  The Government adds that the clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct; e.g., a robber who injured bystanders could be charged with the separate Hobbs Act crimes of robbery and of using violence in furtherance of the robbery.  While this additional work is concededly small, Congress intent is clear.  Interpretive canons are designed to help courts determine what Congress intended, not to lead them to interpret the law contrary to that intent.  Pp.911.

This restrictive reading is further supported by the fact that Congress often intends such statutory terms as affect commerce or in commerce to be read as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision (here, the Commerce Clause) granting that authority.  See, e.g., Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 273.  Such jurisdictional language may limit, but it will not primarily define, the behavior that the statute calls a violation of federal law.  Cf. Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848, 854.  Moreover, the statutes history supports the more restrictive reading: Both of the Hobbs Acts predecessor statutes made clear that the physical violence they prohibited was not violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce, but violence in furtherance of a plan to injure commerce through coercion or extortion (1934 Act) or through extortion or robbery (1946 Act).  The Hobbs Acts legislative history contains nothing to the contrary.  That the present statutory language is less clear than the 1946 version does not reflect a congressional effort to redefine the crime.  To the contrary, Congress revised the Acts language in 1948 as part of its general revision of the Criminal Code, which was not intended to create new crimes but to recodify those then in existence.  Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 269, n.28.  The Court will not presume the revision worked a change in the underlying substantive law absent a clearly expressed intent to do so.  Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 209.  Here there is no evidence of any such intent.  Finally, respondents interpretation broadens the Hobbs Acts scope well beyond what case law has assumed.  It would federalize much ordinary criminal behavior, ranging from simple assault to murder, that typically is the subject of state, not federal, prosecution.  Congress did not intend the Hobbs Act to have so broad a reach.  See, e.g., NOW II, supra, at 405.  Other Courts of Appeals have rejected respondents construction of the Act.  And in 1994, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U. S.C. 248(a)(3), which was aimed specifically at the type of activity at issue in this litigation, thereby suggesting that Congress did not believe that the Hobbs Act already addressed that activity.  Pp.59.


(b) Respondents reliance on the canon of statutory construction favoring interpretations that give a function to each word in a statute, thereby avoiding linguistic superfluity, is misplaced.  They claim that, because the definitions of robbery or extortion (or related attempts or conspiracies) already encompass robbery or extortion that take place through acts of violence (or related threats), see 1951(b)(1) and (2), there would be no reason for 1951(a) to contain its physical violence clause unless Congress intended to create a freestanding offense.  Petitioners, however, have found a small amount of additional work for the clause to do.  The Scheidler petitioners point to a hypothetical mobster who threatens violence and demands payment from a business.  Those threats constitute attempted extortion; but the subsequent acts of violence against a noncomplying business by the mobsters subordinates might not constitute attempted extortion or be punishable as a conspiracy to commit extortion if the subordinates were not privy to the mobsters plan, absent the specific prohibition of physical violence in furtherance of a plan to commit extortion.  The Government adds that the clause permits prosecutors to bring multiple charges for the same conduct; e.g., a robber who injured bystanders could be charged with the separate Hobbs Act crimes of robbery and of using violence in furtherance of the robbery.  While this additional work is concededly small, Congress intent is clear.  Interpretive canons are designed to help courts determine what Congress intended, not to lead them to interpret the law contrary to that intent.  Pp.911.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04805.Argued January 10, 2006Decided February 28, 2006
Petitioners, Texaco Inc. and Shell Oil Co., collaborated in a joint venture, Equilon Enterprises, to refine and sell gasoline in the western United States under the two companies original brand names.  After Equilon set a single price for both brands, respondents, Texaco and Shell Oil service station owners, brought suit alleging that, by unifying gas prices under the two brands, petitioners had violated the per se rule against price fixing long recognized under 1 of the Sherman Act, see, e.g., Catalano, Inc. v. Target Sales, Inc., 446 U. S. 643, 647.  Granting petitioners summary judgment, the District Court determined that the rule of reason, rather than a per se rule, governs respondents claim, and that, by eschewing rule of reason analysis, respondents had failed to raise a triable issue of fact.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, characterizing petitioners position as a request for an exception to the per se price-fixing prohibition, and rejecting that request.  
Held:It is not per se illegal under 1 of the Sherman Act for a lawful, economically integrated joint venture to set the prices at which it sells its products.  Although 1 prohibits [e]very contract [or] combination  in restraint of trade, 15 U. S.C. 1, this Court has not taken a literal approach to that language, recognizing, instead, that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints, e.g., State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10.  Under rule of reason analysis, antitrust plaintiffs must demonstrate that a particular contract or combination is in fact unreasonable and anticompetitive.  See, e.g., id., at 1019.  Per se liability is reserved for plainly anticompetitive agreements.  National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 692.  While horizontal price-fixing agreements between two or more competitors are per se unlawful, see, e.g., Catalano, supra, at 647, this case does not present such an agreement, because Texaco and Shell Oil did not compete with one another in the relevant marketi.e., gasoline sales to western service stationsbut instead participated in that market jointly through Equilon.  When those who would otherwise be competitors pool their capital and share the risks of loss and opportunities for profit, they are regarded as a single firm competing with other sellers in the market.  Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 356.  As such, Equilons pricing policy may be price fixing in a literal sense, but it is not price fixing in the antitrust sense.  The court below erred in reaching the opposite conclusion under the ancillary restraints doctrine, which governs the validity of restrictions imposed by a legitimate joint venture on nonventure activities.  That doctrine has no application here, where the challenged business practice involves the core activity of the joint venture itselfthe pricing of the very goods produced and sold by Equilon.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04593.Argued December 6, 2005Decided February 22, 2006
Respondent McDonald, a black man, is sole shareholder and president of JWM Investments, Inc. (JWM).  He sued petitioners (collectively Dominos) under 42 U. S.C. 1981, alleging, inter alia, that JWM and Dominos had entered into several contracts, that Dominos had broken those contracts because of racial animus toward McDonald, and that the breach had harmed McDonald personally by causing him to suffer monetary damages and damages for emotional injuries.  The District Court granted Dominos motion to dismiss on the ground that McDonald could bring no 1981 claim against Dominos because McDonald was party to no contract with Dominos.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that an injury suffered only by the corporation would not permit a shareholder to bring a 1981 action, but concluded that when there are injuries distinct from those of the corporation, a nonparty like McDonald may nonetheless sue under 1981.  
Held:Consistent with this Courts case law, and as required by the statutes plain text, a plaintiff cannot state a 1981 claim unless he has (or would have) rights under the existing (or proposed) contract that he wishes to make and enforce.  The statute, originally enacted as 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, now protects the equal right of [a]ll persons to make and enforce contracts without respect to race, 1981(a), and defines make and enforce contracts to includ[e] the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits  of the contractual relationship, 1981(b).  This cannot be read to give McDonald a cause of action because he made and enforced contracts for JWM as its agent.  The right to make contracts protected by the 1866 legislation was not the insignificant right to act as an agent for someone elses contracting, but was rather the right, denied in some States to blacks, to give and receive contractual rights on ones own behalf.  The statutes text makes this common meaning doubly clear by speaking of the right to make and enforce contracts.  When the 1866 Act was drafted, a mere agent, who had no beneficial interest in a contract he made for his principal, could not generally sue on that contract.  Any 1981 claim, therefore, must initially identify an impaired contractual relationship, 1981(b), under which the plaintiff has rights.  McDonalds complaint identifies a contractual relationship between Dominos and JWM, but it is fundamental corporation and agency law that a corporations shareholder and contracting officer has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporations contracts.  McDonalds proposed new test for 1981 standingwhereby any person may sue if he is an actual target of discrimination and loses some benefit that would otherwise have inured to him had a contract not been impairedignores the explicit statutory requirement that the plaintiff be the perso[n] whose right  to make and enforce contracts, 1981(a), was impair[ed], 1981(c), on account of race.

04-848|"DOLAN v. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 04848.Argued November 7, 2005Decided February 22, 2006
Under the Postal Reorganization Act, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) applies to tort claims arising out of [Postal Service] activities.  39 U. S.C. 409(c).  The FTCA, in turn, waives sovereign immunity in certain cases involving negligence committed by federal employees in the course of their employment, 28 U. S.C. 1346(b)(1), making the United States liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, 2674.  However, the sovereign immunity bar remains as to, inter alia, [a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter.  2680(b).  Consequently, the United States may be liable if postal workers commit torts under local law, but not for claims defined by the exception.  Petitioner Dolan filed an FTCA suit against the Postal Service for injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell over mail left on her porch by postal employees.  The District Court dismissed the suit, and the Third Circuit affirmed, both concluding that, although the FTCA generally waives sovereign immunity as to federal employees torts, Dolans claims were barred by 2680(b)s exception.
Held:Because the postal exception is inapplicable in this case, Dolans claim may go forward.  This Court assumes that under the applicable state law a person injured by tripping over a package or bundle negligently left by a private party would have a cause of action for damages.  The question is whether 2860(b)s exception preserves sovereign immunity in such a case.  Considered in isolation, negligent transmission could embrace a wide range of acts.  However, interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the statutes purpose and context.  Here, both context and precedent require reading the phrase so that it does not go beyond negligence causing mail to be lost or to arrive late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.  Starting with context, negligent transmission follows the terms loss and miscarriage, which limit the reach of transmission.  Mail is lost if it is destroyed or misplaced and miscarried if it goes to the wrong address.  Since both terms refer to failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address, it would be odd if negligent transmission swept far more broadly to include injuries caused by postal employees but involving neither failure to transmit mail nor damage to its contents.  This interpretation is supported by Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, where this Court noted that one of the FTCAs purposes was to waive the Governments immunity from liability for injuries resulting from auto accidents involving postal trucks deliveringand thus transmittingthe mail.  Nothing in the statutory text supports a distinction between negligent driving, which the Government claims relates only circumstantially to the mail, and Dolans accident, which was caused by the mail itself.  In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail.  In addition, focusing on whether the mail itself caused the injury would yield anomalies, perhaps making liability turn on, e.g., whether a mail sack was empty or full.  It is more likely that Congress intended to retain immunity only for injuries arising because mail either fails to arrive or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address, since such harms are primarily identified with the Postal Services function of transporting mail.  The Government claims that, given the Postal Services vast operations, Congress must have intended to insulate delivery-related torts from liability, but 2680(b)s specificity indicates otherwise.  Had Congress intended to preserve immunity for all delivery-related torts, it could have used sweeping language similar to that used in other FTCA exceptions, e.g., 2860(i).  Furthermore, losses of the type for which immunity is retained under 2680(b) are at least to some degree avoidable or compensable through postal registration and insurance.  The Government raises the specter of frivolous slip-and-fall claims inundating the Postal Service, but that is a risk shared by any business making home deliveries.  Finally, the general rule that a sovereign immunity waiver will be strictly construed  in favor of the sovereign, Lane v. Pe&nacute;a, 518 U. S. 187, 192, is unhelpful in the FTCA context, where unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute, Kosak, supra, at 853, n.9, which waives the Governments immunity from suit in sweeping language, United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543, 547.  Pp.411.

04-928|"OREGON v. GUZEK
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 04928.Argued December 7, 2005Decided February 22, 2006
At the guilt phase of respondent Guzeks capital murder trial, his mother was one of two witnesses who testified that he had been with her on the night the crime was committed.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  Twice, the Oregon Supreme Court vacated the sentence and ordered new sentencing proceedings, but each time Guzek was again sentenced to death.  Upon vacating his sentence for a third time, the State Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce live alibi testimony from his mother at the upcoming resentencing proceeding.  After this Court granted certiorari, Guzek filed a motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.
Held:
1.Guzeks motion to dismiss certiorari is denied.  This Court does not lack jurisdiction on the ground that, irrespective of federal law, state law gives Guzek the right to introduce his mothers live testimony.  The Court possesses jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law, 28 U. S.C. 1257(a), and the Oregon Supreme Court based its legal conclusion in relevant part on such law.  It pointed out that relevant mitigating evidence under state law refers only to evidence that the Federal Constitution grants a defendant the right to present.  And it interpreted the federal admissibility requirement in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (plurality opinion), and Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95 (per curiam), to include evidence like the proffered alibi testimony.  Nor is this Court willing to dismiss the writ on the ground that irrespective of federal law and of the State Supreme Courts federal holding, Oregons capital-case resentencing statute gives Guzek the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phase.  At most, state law might give him such a right, but a possible adequate and independent state ground for a decision does not bar  reaching the federal questions where, as here, the State Supreme Courts decision quite clearly rested  solely on the Federal Constitution.  California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 997, n. 7.  Pp. 25.


2.The Constitution does not prohibit a State from limiting the innocence-related evidence a capital defendant can introduce at a sentencing proceeding to the evidence introduced at the original trial.  This Courts cases have not interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing such a defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast residual doubt on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction.  Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 173, n.6 (plurality opinion).  Lockett v. Ohio, supra, and Green v. Georgia, supra, distinguished.    Even if such a right existed, it could not extend so far as to provide Guzek with a right to introduce the evidence at issue.  The Eighth Amendment insists upon reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case, Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 328, and that a sentencing jury be able to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence about the defendants character or record or the circumstances of the offense, id., at 327328, but it does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits on the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted.  Three circumstances, taken together, show that the State has the authority to regulate Guzeks evidence through exclusion.  First, sentencing traditionally concerns how, not whether, a defendant committed the crime, but alibi evidence concerns only whether, not how, he did so.  Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant.  Thus, the evidence attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue.  The law typically discourages such collateral attacks.  Cf. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94.  Third, the negative impact of a rule restricting Guzeks ability to introduce new alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the defendant the right to present to the sentencing jury all the innocence evidence from the original trial (albeit through transcripts).

			"|"OREGON v. GUZEK
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 04928.Argued December 7, 2005Decided February 22, 2006
At the guilt phase of respondent Guzeks capital murder trial, his mother was one of two witnesses who testified that he had been with her on the night the crime was committed.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  Twice, the Oregon Supreme Court vacated the sentence and ordered new sentencing proceedings, but each time Guzek was again sentenced to death.  Upon vacating his sentence for a third time, the State Supreme Court held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments provide Guzek a federal constitutional right to introduce live alibi testimony from his mother at the upcoming resentencing proceeding.  After this Court granted certiorari, Guzek filed a motion to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.
Held:
1.Guzeks motion to dismiss certiorari is denied.  This Court does not lack jurisdiction on the ground that, irrespective of federal law, state law gives Guzek the right to introduce his mothers live testimony.  The Court possesses jurisdiction to review state-court determinations that rest upon federal law, 28 U. S.C. 1257(a), and the Oregon Supreme Court based its legal conclusion in relevant part on such law.  It pointed out that relevant mitigating evidence under state law refers only to evidence that the Federal Constitution grants a defendant the right to present.  And it interpreted the federal admissibility requirement in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (plurality opinion), and Green v. Georgia, 442 U. S. 95 (per curiam), to include evidence like the proffered alibi testimony.  Nor is this Court willing to dismiss the writ on the ground that irrespective of federal law and of the State Supreme Courts federal holding, Oregons capital-case resentencing statute gives Guzek the right to introduce witnesses who testified at the guilt phase.  At most, state law might give him such a right, but a possible adequate and independent state ground for a decision does not bar  reaching the federal questions where, as here, the State Supreme Courts decision quite clearly rested  solely on the Federal Constitution.  California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 997, n. 7.  Pp. 25.


2.The Constitution does not prohibit a State from limiting the innocence-related evidence a capital defendant can introduce at a sentencing proceeding to the evidence introduced at the original trial.  This Courts cases have not interpreted the Eighth Amendment as providing such a defendant the right to introduce at sentencing evidence designed to cast residual doubt on his guilt of the basic crime of conviction.  Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 173, n.6 (plurality opinion).  Lockett v. Ohio, supra, and Green v. Georgia, supra, distinguished.    Even if such a right existed, it could not extend so far as to provide Guzek with a right to introduce the evidence at issue.  The Eighth Amendment insists upon reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case, Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 328, and that a sentencing jury be able to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence about the defendants character or record or the circumstances of the offense, id., at 327328, but it does not deprive the State of its authority to set reasonable limits on the evidence a defendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted.  Three circumstances, taken together, show that the State has the authority to regulate Guzeks evidence through exclusion.  First, sentencing traditionally concerns how, not whether, a defendant committed the crime, but alibi evidence concerns only whether, not how, he did so.  Second, the parties previously litigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant.  Thus, the evidence attacks a previously determined matter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue.  The law typically discourages such collateral attacks.  Cf. Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94.

04-944|"ARBAUGH v. Y & H CORP. dba THE MOONLIGHT CAFE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 04944.Argued January 11, 2006Decided February 22, 2006
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer  to discriminate against any [employee] with respect to  sex, 42 U. S.C. 2000e2(a)(1), and defines employer as a person  who has fifteen or more employees, 2000e(b).  The Acts jurisdictional provision empowers federal courts to adjudicate civil actions brought under Title VII.  2000e5(f)(3).  Title VII actions also fit within the Judicial Codes grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to federal courts over actions arising under federal law.  28 U. S.C. 1331.  At the time Title VII was enacted, 1331 contained a $10,000 amount-in-controversy threshold, which left Title VII claims below that amount uncovered.  Section 2000e5(f)(3) assured that the amount-in-controversy limitation would not impede a Title VII complainants access to a federal forum.  Since 1980, when Congress amended 1331 to eliminate the amount-in-controversy threshold, 2000e5(f)(3) has served simply to underscore Congress intention to provide a federal forum for Title VII claims.  Because Congress has also authorized federal courts to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims linked to a federal claim, 28 U. S.C. 1367, Title VII plaintiffs may pursue complete relief in federal court.


The objection that a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1), may be raised at any stage in the litigation, even after trial and the entry of judgment, Rule 12(h)(3).  See Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455.  By contrast, the objection that a complaint fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Rule 12(b)(6), endures only up to, not beyond, trial on the merits, Rule 12(h)(2).


Petitioner Arbaugh sued her former employer, respondent Y&H Corporation, in Federal District Court, charging sexual harassment in violation of Title VII and asserting related state-law claims.  The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for Arbaugh.  After the court entered judgment on that verdict, Y&H moved to dismiss the entire action for want of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, asserting, for the first time, that it had fewer than 15 employees on its payroll and therefore was not amenable to suit under Title VII.  Although recognizing the unfairness and waste of judicial resources that granting the motion would entail, the District Court, citing Federal Rule 12(h)(3), considered itself obliged to do so because it believed the 15-or-more-employees requirement to be jurisdictional.  It therefore vacated its prior judgment and dismissed Arbaughs Title VII claim with prejudice and her state-law claims without prejudice.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed based on its precedent holding that unless the employee-numerosity requirement is met, federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction does not exist.
Held:Title VIIs numerical threshold does not circumscribe federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction.  Instead, the employee-numerosity requirement relates to the substantive adequacy of Arbaughs Title VII claim, and therefore could not be raised defensively late in the lawsuit, i.e., after Y&H had failed to assert the objection prior to the close of trial on the merits.  The basic statutory grants of federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction are contained in 28 U. S.C. 1331, which provides for [f]ederal-question jurisdiction, and 1332, which provides for [d]iversity of citizenship jurisdiction.  A plaintiff properly invokes 1331 jurisdiction when she pleads a colorable claim arising under the Federal Constitution or laws.  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 681685.  She invokes 1332 jurisdiction when she presents a claim between parties of diverse citizenship that exceeds the required jurisdictional amount, currently $75,000.  See 1332(a).  Arbaugh invoked federal-question jurisdiction under 1331, but her case aris[es] under a federal law, Title VII, that specifies, as a prerequisite to its application, the existence of a particular fact, i.e., 15 or more employees.  The Court resolves the question whether that fact is jurisdictional or relates to the merits of a Title VII claim mindful of the consequences of typing the 15-employee threshold a determinant of subject-matter jurisdiction, rather than an element of Arbaughs claim for relief.  First, subject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves the courts power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.  United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630.  Moreover, courts, including this Court, have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party.  Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 583.  Nothing in Title VIIs text indicates that Congress intended courts, on their own motion, to assure that the employee-numerosity requirement is met.  Second, in some instances, if subject-matter jurisdiction turns on contested facts, the trial judge may be authorized to review the evidence and resolve the dispute on her own.  If satisfaction of an essential element of a claim is at issue, however, the jury is the proper trier of contested facts.  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 150151.  Third, when a federal court concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the complaint must be dismissed in its entirety.  Thus, the trial court below dismissed, along with the Title VII claim, pendent state-law claims fully tried by a jury and determined on the merits.  In contrast, when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 1367, over pendent state-law claims.


While Congress could make the employee-numerosity requirement jurisdictional if it so chose, neither 1331 nor Title VIIs jurisdictional provision, 42 U. S.C. 2000e5(f)(3), specifies any threshold ingredient akin to 28 U. S.C. 1332s monetary floor.  Instead, the 15-employee threshold appears in a separate provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.  Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394.  Given the unfairness and waste of judicial resources entailed in tying the employee-numerosity requirement to subject-matter jurisdiction, the sounder course is to refrain from constricting 1331 or 2000e5(f)(3), and to leave the ball in Congress court.  If the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statutes scope shall count as jurisdictional, then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.  But when Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.  Applying that readily administrable bright line here yields the holding that Title VIIs 15-employee threshold is an element of a plaintiffs claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue.  Pp.815. 
380 F.3d 219, reversed and remanded.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Alito, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

VEGETAL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 041084.Argued November 1, 2005Decided February 21, 2006
Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) in response to Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, where, in upholding a generally applicable law that burdened the sacramental use of peyote, this Court held that the First Amendments Free Exercise Clause does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws, id., at 883890.  Among other things, RFRA prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a persons exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, 42 U. S.C. 2000bb1(a), except when the Government can demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person (1) [furthers] a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that  interest, 2000bb1(b).


Members of respondent church (UDV) receive communion by drinking hoasca, a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon Rainforest that contains DMT, a hallucinogen regulated under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, see 21 U. S.C. 812(c), Schedule I(c).  After U. S. Customs inspectors seized a hoasca shipment to the American UDV and threatened prosecution, the UDV filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDVs sacramental hoasca use violates RFRA.  At a hearing on the UDVs preliminary injunction motion, the Government conceded that the challenged application would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion, but argued that this burden did not violate RFRA because applying the Controlled Substances Act was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting UDV members health and safety, preventing the diversion of hoasca from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  The District Court granted relief, concluding that, because the parties evidence on health risks and diversion was equally balanced, the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden on the UDV.  The court also held that the 1971 Convention does not apply to hoasca.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDVs sacramental use of hoasca.  Pp.619.
1.This Court rejects the Governments argument that evidentiary equipoise as to potential harm and diversion is an insufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.  Given that the Government conceded the UDVs prima facie RFRA case in the District Court and that the evidence found to be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which the Government bore the burden of proof, the UDV effectively demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Governments argument that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction hearing is foreclosed by Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656, 666.  There, in affirming the grant of a preliminary injunction against the Government, this Court reasoned that the burdens with respect to the compelling interest test at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.  The Governments attempt to limit the Ashcroft rule to content-based restrictions on speech is unavailing.  The fact that Ashcroft involved such a restriction in no way affected the Courts assessment of the consequences of having the burden at trial for preliminary injunction purposes.  Congress express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same way as the tests constitutionally mandated applications, including at the preliminary injunction stage.  Pp.68.


2.Also rejected is the Governments central submission that, because it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made to accommodate the UDV.  The Government argues, inter alia, that the Acts description of Schedule I substances as having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety for use  under medical supervision, 21 U. S.C. 812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions, and that the Acts closed regulatory system, which prohibits all use of controlled substances except as the Act itself authorizes, see Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. ___, ___, cannot function properly if subjected to judicial exemptions.  Pp.816.


(a)RFRA and its strict scrutiny test contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Governments categorical approach.  RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law to the personthe particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.  42 U. S.C. 2000bb1(b).  Section 2000bb(b)(1) expressly adopted the compelling interest test of Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205.  There, the Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates, scrutinized the asserted harms, and granted specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.  Id., at 213, 221, 236; Sherbert, supra, at 410.  Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that [c]ontext matters in applying the compelling interest test, Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327, and has emphasized that strict scrutinys fundamental purpose is to take  relevant differences into account, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 228.  Pp.910.


(b)Under RFRAs more focused inquiry, the Governments mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances cannot carry the day.  Although Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous, see, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160, 162, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue.  That question was litigated below.  Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harm, the court noted that it could not ignore the congressional classification and findings.  But Congress determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its RFRA burden.  The Controlled Substances Acts authorization to the Attorney General to waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety, 21 U. S.C. 822(d), reinforces that Congress findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.  Indeed, despite the fact that everything the Government says about the DMT in hoasca applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Executive and Congress have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote, see 21 CFR 1307.31; 42 U. S.C. 1996a(b)(1).  If such use is permitted in the face of the general congressional findings for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, those same findings alone cannot preclude consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.  See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 547.  The Governments argument that the existence of a congressional exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to judicially crafted exceptions fails because RFRA plainly contemplates court-recognized exceptions, see 2000bb1(c).  Pp.1113.


(c)The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Governments broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.  The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled Substances Acts outset, and there is no evidence that it has undercut the Governments ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.  The Governments reliance on pre-Smith cases asserting a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause is unavailing.  Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise, but instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 258, 260.  They show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.  Here the Governments uniformity argument rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery slope concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law, i.e., if I make an exception for you, Ill have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.  But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to rule[s] of general applicability.  2000bb1(a).  Congress determination that the legislated test is workable  for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests, 200bb(a)(5), finds support in Sherbert, supra, at 407, and Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. ___, ___.  While there may be instances where a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA, it would be surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding peyote exemption and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance.  The Government has not shown that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in, e.g., Lee.  It cannot now compensate for its failure to convince the District Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act.  Pp.1316.


3.The Government argues unpersuasively that it has a compelling interest in complying with the 1971 U. N. Convention.  While this Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention does not cover hoasca, that does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDVs sacramental use.  At this stage, it suffices that the Government did not submit any evidence addressing the international consequences of granting the UDV an exemption, but simply relied on two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general (and undoubted) importance of honoring international obligations and maintaining the United States leadership in the international war on drugs.  Under RFRA, invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.  Pp.1618.

			"|"GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etal. v. O CENTRO ESPIRITA BENEFICENTE UNIAO DO
VEGETAL etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 041084.Argued November 1, 2005Decided February 21, 2006
Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) in response to Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, where, in upholding a generally applicable law that burdened the sacramental use of peyote, this Court held that the First Amendments Free Exercise Clause does not require judges to engage in a case-by-case assessment of the religious burdens imposed by facially constitutional laws, id., at 883890.  Among other things, RFRA prohibits the Federal Government from substantially burdening a persons exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, 42 U. S.C. 2000bb1(a), except when the Government can demonstrat[e] that application of the burden to the person (1) [furthers] a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that  interest, 2000bb1(b).


Members of respondent church (UDV) receive communion by drinking hoasca, a tea brewed from plants unique to the Amazon Rainforest that contains DMT, a hallucinogen regulated under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, see 21 U. S.C. 812(c), Schedule I(c).  After U. S. Customs inspectors seized a hoasca shipment to the American UDV and threatened prosecution, the UDV filed this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging, inter alia, that applying the Controlled Substances Act to the UDVs sacramental hoasca use violates RFRA.  At a hearing on the UDVs preliminary injunction motion, the Government conceded that the challenged application would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion, but argued that this burden did not violate RFRA because applying the Controlled Substances Act was the least restrictive means of advancing three compelling governmental interests: protecting UDV members health and safety, preventing the diversion of hoasca from the church to recreational users, and complying with the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  The District Court granted relief, concluding that, because the parties evidence on health risks and diversion was equally balanced, the Government had failed to demonstrate a compelling interest justifying the substantial burden on the UDV.  The court also held that the 1971 Convention does not apply to hoasca.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The courts below did not err in determining that the Government failed to demonstrate, at the preliminary injunction stage, a compelling interest in barring the UDVs sacramental use of hoasca.  Pp.619.
1.This Court rejects the Governments argument that evidentiary equipoise as to potential harm and diversion is an insufficient basis for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.  Given that the Government conceded the UDVs prima facie RFRA case in the District Court and that the evidence found to be in equipoise related to an affirmative defense as to which the Government bore the burden of proof, the UDV effectively demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Governments argument that, although it would bear the burden of demonstrating a compelling interest at trial on the merits, the UDV should have borne the burden of disproving such interests at the preliminary injunction hearing is foreclosed by Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656, 666.  There, in affirming the grant of a preliminary injunction against the Government, this Court reasoned that the burdens with respect to the compelling interest test at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.  The Governments attempt to limit the Ashcroft rule to content-based restrictions on speech is unavailing.  The fact that Ashcroft involved such a restriction in no way affected the Courts assessment of the consequences of having the burden at trial for preliminary injunction purposes.  Congress express decision to legislate the compelling interest test indicates that RFRA challenges should be adjudicated in the same way as the tests constitutionally mandated applications, including at the preliminary injunction stage.  Pp.68.


2.Also rejected is the Governments central submission that, because it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act, no exception to the DMT ban can be made to accommodate the UDV.  The Government argues, inter alia, that the Acts description of Schedule I substances as having a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety for use  under medical supervision, 21 U. S.C. 812(b)(1), by itself precludes any consideration of individualized exceptions, and that the Acts closed regulatory system, which prohibits all use of controlled substances except as the Act itself authorizes, see Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. ___, ___, cannot function properly if subjected to judicial exemptions.  Pp.816.


(a)RFRA and its strict scrutiny test contemplate an inquiry more focused than the Governments categorical approach.  RFRA requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law to the personthe particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.  42 U. S.C. 2000bb1(b).  Section 2000bb(b)(1) expressly adopted the compelling interest test of Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205.  There, the Court looked beyond broadly formulated interests justifying the general applicability of government mandates, scrutinized the asserted harms, and granted specific exemptions to particular religious claimants.  Id., at 213, 221, 236; Sherbert, supra, at 410.  Outside the Free Exercise area as well, the Court has noted that [c]ontext matters in applying the compelling interest test, Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327, and has emphasized that strict scrutinys fundamental purpose is to take  relevant differences into account, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 228.  Pp.910.


(b)Under RFRAs more focused inquiry, the Governments mere invocation of the general characteristics of Schedule I substances cannot carry the day.  Although Schedule I substances such as DMT are exceptionally dangerous, see, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U. S. 160, 162, there is no indication that Congress, in classifying DMT, considered the harms posed by the particular use at issue.  That question was litigated below.  Before the District Court found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing such harm, the court noted that it could not ignore the congressional classification and findings.  But Congress determination that DMT should be listed under Schedule I simply does not provide a categorical answer that relieves the Government of the obligation to shoulder its RFRA burden.  The Controlled Substances Acts authorization to the Attorney General to waive the requirement for registration of certain manufacturers, distributors, or dispensers if he finds it consistent with the public health and safety, 21 U. S.C. 822(d), reinforces that Congress findings with respect to Schedule I substances should not carry the determinative weight, for RFRA purposes, that the Government would ascribe to them.  Indeed, despite the fact that everything the Government says about the DMT in hoasca applies in equal measure to the mescaline in peyote, another Schedule I substance, both the Executive and Congress have decreed an exception from the Controlled Substances Act for Native American religious use of peyote, see 21 CFR 1307.31; 42 U. S.C. 1996a(b)(1).  If such use is permitted in the face of the general congressional findings for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans practicing their faith, those same findings alone cannot preclude consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so American members of the UDV who want to practice theirs.  See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 547.  The Governments argument that the existence of a congressional exemption for peyote does not indicate that the Controlled Substances Act is amenable to judicially crafted exceptions fails because RFRA plainly contemplates court-recognized exceptions, see 2000bb1(c).  Pp.1113.


(c)The peyote exception also fatally undermines the Governments broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA.  The peyote exception has been in place since the Controlled Substances Acts outset, and there is no evidence that it has undercut the Governments ability to enforce the ban on peyote use by non-Indians.  The Governments reliance on pre-Smith cases asserting a need for uniformity in rejecting claims for religious exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause is unavailing.  Those cases did not embrace the notion that a general interest in uniformity justified a substantial burden on religious exercise, but instead scrutinized the asserted need and explained why the denied exemptions could not be accommodated.  See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 258, 260.  They show that the Government can demonstrate a compelling interest in uniform application of a particular program by offering evidence that granting the requested religious accommodations would seriously compromise its ability to administer the program.  Here the Governments uniformity argument rests not so much on the particular statutory program at issue as on slippery slope concerns that could be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law, i.e., if I make an exception for you, Ill have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.  But RFRA operates by mandating consideration, under the compelling interest test, of exceptions to rule[s] of general applicability.  2000bb1(a).  Congress determination that the legislated test is workable  for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests, 200bb(a)(5), finds support in Sherbert, supra, at 407, and Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. ___, ___.  While there may be instances where a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under RFRA, it would be surprising to find that this was such a case, given the longstanding peyote exemption and the fact that the very reason Congress enacted RFRA was to respond to a decision denying a claimed right to sacramental use of a controlled substance.  The Government has not shown that granting the UDV an exemption would cause the kind of administrative harm recognized as a compelling interest in, e.g., Lee.  It cannot now compensate for its failure to convince the District Court as to its health or diversion concerns with the bold argument that there can be no RFRA exceptions at all to the Controlled Substances Act.  Pp.1316.


3.The Government argues unpersuasively that it has a compelling interest in complying with the 1971 U. N. Convention.  While this Court does not agree with the District Court that the Convention does not cover hoasca, that does not automatically mean that the Government has demonstrated a compelling interest in applying the Controlled Substances Act, which implements the Convention, to the UDVs sacramental use.  At this stage, it suffices that the Government did not submit any evidence addressing the international consequences of granting the UDV an exemption, but simply relied on two affidavits by State Department officials attesting to the general (and undoubted) importance of honoring international obligations and maintaining the United States leadership in the international war on drugs.  Under RFRA, invocation of such general interests, standing alone, is not enough.  Pp.1618.

04-1095|"MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR THE
ARMED FORCES OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC
OF IRAN v. DARIUSH ELAHI
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 041095.Decided February 21, 2006
Per Curiam.

A private citizen seeks to attach an asset belonging to Irans Ministry of Defense in order to help satisfy a judgment for money damages.  The question raised is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S.C. 1602 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. III), forbids that attachment.


The judgment for money damages consists of a default judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran (for about $300 million) that the private citizen, Dariush Elahi, obtained in a federal-court lawsuit claiming that the Republic had murdered his brother.  Elahi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 124 F.Supp. 2d 97, 103 (DC 2000).  The asset is an arbitration award (against a third party), which Irans Ministry of Defense obtained in Switzerland.  Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., 385 F.3d 1206, 1211 (CA9 2004).  The Ministry asked the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California to confirm the award.  Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., 236 F.Supp. 2d 1140 (2002).  The court did so.  And Elahi then intervened, seeking to impose a lien upon the award.  The Ministry opposed the attachment on the ground that the Act grants it immunity from such a claim.


The Federal District Court rejected the Ministrys immunity defense on the ground that, by suing to enforce the award, the Ministry had waived any such immunity.  On appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed with the District Court about waiver.  But it then found against the Ministry on a different grounda ground that the parties had not argued.  The Act says that under certain conditions the property of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government is not  immune from attachment if the agency is engaged in commercial activity in the United States.  28 U. S.C. 1610(b) (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeals found that the Ministry engages in commercial activity and that the other conditions were satisfied.  385 F.3d, at 12191222 (applying 1610(b)(2)).  And it held that this section of the Act barred the Ministrys assertion of immunity.  Ibid.


The Ministry filed a petition for certiorari asking us to review that decision.  The Solicitor General agrees with the Ministry that we should grant the writ but limited to the Ministrys Question 1, namely whether the property of a foreign state stricto sensu, situated in the United States is immune from attachment  as provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  Pet. for Cert. i (citing 1603(a), 1610(a)).  The Solicitor General also asks us to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for consideration of whether the Ministry is simply a foreign state (what the Ministry calls a foreign state stricto sensu) or whether the Ministry is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state (as the Ninth Circuit held).  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 1517.  We grant the writ limited to Question 1.  


The Act, as it applies to the property in the United States of a foreign state, 1610(a) (emphasis added), does not contain the engaged in commercial activity exception that the Ninth Circuit described. That exception applies only where the property at issue is property of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.  Compare 1610(b) (property  of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity) with 1610(a) (property  of a foreign state used for a commercial activity) (emphasis added).  The difference is critical.  Moreover, in the Solicitor Generals view a defense ministry (unlike, say, a government-owned commercial enterprise) generally is not an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state but an inseparable part of the state itself.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 811; see also Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, 30 F.3d 148, 153 (CADC 1994) (hold[ing] that armed forces are as a rule so closely bound up with the structure of the state that they must in all cases be considered as the foreign state itself, rather than a separate agency or instrumentality of the state).


We shall not now determine whether the Solicitor General is correct about the status of the Ministry, for the Ninth Circuit did not address the question nor did the parties argue the matter before the Circuit.  Neither can we fault the Ministry for that failure.  As we said, supra, at 1, the District Court based its denial of immunity upon waiver.  The parties Ninth Circuit briefs focused on matters not relevant here (such as the waiver question), with one exception.  The exception consists of a footnote in Elahis brief mentioning the Acts agency and instrumentality provision.  That footnote, however, does not ask for affirmance on that basis; nor did it provide the Ministry with clear notice that a reply was necessary.  Answering Brief of Appellee in No. 0355015 (CA9), p. 45, n. 27 (stating that [i]f [the Ministry] is considered an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state, rather than the foreign state itself, Mr. Elahis attachment still is valid (emphasis added)).


The Ninth Circuit said that it was free to affirm on any ground supported by the record.  385 F.3d, at 1219, n. 15.  But the court did not explain what in the record might demonstrate that the Ministry is an agency or instrumentality of the state rather than an integral part of the state itself.  The court noted that Elahi appears to concede that the Ministry is an agency and instrumentality, id., at 1218, n.13, but any relevant concession would have to have come from the Ministry, not from Elahi, whose position the concession favors.  Thus, in implicitly concluding that the Ministry was an agency or instrumentality of the Republic of Iran within the meaning of 1610(b), the Ninth Circuit either mistakenly relied on a concession by respondent that could not possibly bind petitioner, or else erroneously presumed that there was no relevant distinction between a foreign state and its agencies or instrumentalities for purposes of that subsection.  See 1603(a), (b).  Either way, the Ninth Circuit committed error that was essential to its judgment in favor of respondent.  


Because the Ninth Circuit did not consider, and the Ministry had no reasonable opportunity to argue, the critical legal point we have mentioned, we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

04-1264|"BUCKEYE CHECK CASHING, INC. v. CARDEGNA etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of florida
No. 041264.Argued November 29, 2005Decided February 21, 2006
For each deferred-payment transaction respondents entered into with Buckeye Check Cashing, they signed an Agreement containing provisions that required binding arbitration to resolve disputes arising out of the Agreement.  Respondents sued in Florida state court, alleging that Buckeye charged usurious interest rates and that the Agreement violated various Florida laws, rendering it criminal on its face.  The trial court denied Buckeyes motion to compel arbitration, holding that a court rather than an arbitrator should resolve a claim that a contract is illegal and void ab initio.  A state appellate court reversed, but was in turn reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which reasoned that enforcing an arbitration agreement in a contract challenged as unlawful would violate state public policy and contract law.
Held:Regardless of whether it is brought in federal or state court, a challenge to the validity of a contract as a whole, and not specifically to the arbitration clause within it, must go to the arbitrator, not the court.  Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, and Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, answer the question presented here by establishing three propositions.  First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.  See Prima Paint, 388 U. S., at 400, 402404.  Second, unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contracts validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.  See id., at 403404.  Third, this arbitration law applies in state as well as federal courts.  See Southland, supra, at 12.  The crux of respondents claim is that the Agreement as a whole (including its arbitration provision) is rendered invalid by the usurious finance charge.  Because this challenges the Agreement, and not specifically its arbitration provisions, the latter are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract, and the challenge should be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in declining to apply Prima Paints severability rule, and respondents assertion that that rule does not apply in state court runs contrary to Prima Paint and Southland.

05-379|"ANTHONY ASH etal. v. TYSON FOODS, INC.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 05379.Decided February 21, 2006
Per Curiam.

Petitioners Anthony Ash and John Hithon were superintendents at a poultry plant owned and operated by respondent Tyson Foods, Inc.  Petitioners, who are African-American, sought promotions to fill two open shift
manager positions, but two white males were selected instead.  Alleging that Tyson had discriminated on account of race, petitioners sued under Rev. Stat. 1977, 42 U. S.C. 1981, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S.C. 2000e et seq.


A trial proceeded in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  At the close of the plaintiffs evidence, Tyson moved for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a).  The District Court denied the motion, and the jury found for petitioners, awarding compensatory and punitive damages.  The employer renewed its motion for judgment under Rule 50(b).  The District Court granted the motion and, in the alternative, ordered a new trial as to both plaintiffs under Rule 50(c).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a; see generally Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 411) (discussing Rule 50).


The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  129 Fed. Appx. 529, 536 (2005) (per curiam).  As to Ash, the court affirmed the grant of the Rule 50(b) motion, deeming the trial evidence insufficient to show pretext (and thus insufficient to show unlawful discrimination) under the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973).  129 Fed. Appx., at 533534.  As to Hithon, the court reversed the Rule 50(b) ruling, finding there was enough evidence to go to the jury.  The court, however, affirmed the District Courts alternative remedy of a new trial under Rule 50(c), holding that the evidence supported neither the decision to grant punitive damages nor the amount of the compensatory award, and thus that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial.  Id., at 536.


The judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the trial court rulings it affirmed, may be correct in the final analysis.  In the course of its opinion, however, the Court of Appeals erred in two respects, requiring that its judgment now be vacated and the case remanded for further consideration.


First, there was evidence that Tysons plant manager, who made the disputed hiring decisions, had referred on some occasions to each of the petitioners as boy.  Petitioners argued this was evidence of discriminatory animus.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that [w]hile the use of boy when modified by a racial classification like black or white is evidence of discriminatory intent, the use of boy alone is not evidence of discrimination.  Id., at 533 (citation omitted).  Although it is true the disputed word will not always be evidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term, standing alone, is always benign.  The speakers meaning may depend on various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice, local custom, and historical usage.  Insofar as the Court of Appeals held that modifiers or qualifications are necessary in all instances to render the disputed term probative of bias, the courts decision is erroneous.


Second, the Court of Appeals erred in articulating the standard for determining whether the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons for Tysons hiring decisions were pretextual.  Petitioners had introduced evidence that their qualifications were superior to those of the two successful applicants.  (Part of the employers defense was that the plant with the openings had performance problems and petitioners already worked there in a supervisory capacity.)  The Court of Appeals, in finding petitioners evidence insufficient, cited one of its earlier precedents and stated:  Pretext can be established through comparing qualifications only when the disparity in qualifications is so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap you in the face.  Ibid. (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co., 390 F.3d 695, 732 (CA11 2004)).


Under this Courts decisions, qualifications evidence may suffice, at least in some circumstances, to show pretext.  See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 187188 (1989) (indicating a plaintiff might seek to demonstrate that respondents claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that she was in fact better qualified than the person chosen for the position), superseded on other grounds by 42 U. S.C. 1981(b); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 259 (1981) (The fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative of whether the employers reasons are pretexts for discrimination); cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 148 (2000) ([A] plaintiffs prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employers asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated).


The visual image of words jumping off the page to slap you (presumably a court) in the face is unhelpful and imprecise as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext from superior qualifications.  Federal courts, including the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in a decision it cited here, have articulated various other standards, see, e.g., Cooper, supra, at 732 (noting that disparities in qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question (internal quotation marks omitted)); Raad v. Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist., 323 F.3d 1185, 1194 (CA9 2003) (holding that qualifications evidence standing alone may establish pretext where the plaintiffs qualifications are clearly superior to those of the selected job applicant); Aka v. Washington Hospital Center, 156 F.3d 1284, 1294 (CADC 1998) (en banc) (concluding the factfinder may infer pretext if a reasonable employer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better qualified for the job), and in this case the Court of Appeals qualified its statement by suggesting that superior qualifications may be probative of pretext when combined with other evidence, see 129 Fed. Appx., at 533.  This is not the occasion to define more precisely what standard should govern pretext claims based on superior qualifications.  Todays decision, furthermore, should not be read to hold that petitioners evidence necessarily showed pretext.  The District Court concluded otherwise.  It suffices to say here that some formulation other than the test the Court of Appeals articulated in this case would better ensure that trial courts reach consistent results.


The Court of Appeals should determine in the first instance whether the two aspects of its decision here determined to have been mistaken were essential to its holding.  On these premises, certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

05-555|"KEITH LANCE, etal., APPELLANTS v. GIGI DENNIS,
COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE
on appeal from the united states district court for the district of colorado
No. 05555.Decided February 21, 2006
Per Curiam.

The Rooker-Feldman doctrine prevents the lower federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases brought by state-court losers challenging state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced.  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 284 (2005).  In this case, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs suit on the ground that they were in privity with a state-court loser.  We hold that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar plaintiffs from proceeding, and vacate the District Courts judgment.
I

This is the latest of several rounds of litigation involving the State of Colorados congressional redistricting after the 2000 census, under which the State gained a seat in the House of Representatives.  Lance v. Davidson, 379 F.Supp. 2d 1117, 1121 (2005).  The first round began in May 2001.  When the Colorado General Assembly failed to pass a redistricting plan for the 2002 congressional elections by the close of its regular session, a group of Colorado voters asked the state courts to create a plan.  The courts agreed, drawing a new map reflecting the additional district.  See Beauprez v.  Avalos, 42 P.3d 642 (Colo. 2002) (en banc).  The 2002 elections were held using this court-ordered plan.
The General Assembly passed its own redistricting plan in the spring of 2003, prompting further litigationthis time about which electoral map was to govern, the legislatures or the courts.  Two suits were filed seeking to enjoin the legislatures plan: an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court by the state attorney general seeking to require the secretary of state to use the court-ordered plan, and a similar action brought in a lower state court by several proponents of the court-ordered plan.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1121.  After the Colorado General Assembly intervened to defend its plan in the first case, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the plan violated Article V, 44, of the State Constitution, which the court construed to limit congressional redistricting to once per decade.  People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc).  It therefore ordered the secretary of state to use the court-created plan.  We denied certiorari.  541 U. S. 1093 (2004).


The second suit was removed to federal court by the defendants on the basis of plaintiffs federal-law claims.  See Keller v. Davidson, 299 F.Supp. 2d 1171, 1175 (Colo. 2004).  Once Salazar was decided by the Colorado Supreme Court, the viability of the defendants counterclaims was the only remaining issue.  A three-judge District Court held that the defendants were barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine from amending their counterclaims to assert additional challenges to the decision in Salazar.  It also held that the defendants original counterclaims, while not barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, were precluded under Colorado law by the judgment in Salazar.  Accordingly, the court dismissed the case.


Finally, this suit: Before the dismissal in Keller, several Colorado citizens unhappy with Salazar filed an action in the District Court seeking to require the secretary of state to use the legislatures plan.[Footnote 1]  The plaintiffs argued that Article V, 44, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violated the Elections Clause of Article I, 4, of the U. S. Constitution (The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof), and the First Amendments Petition Clause (Congress shall make no law  abridging  the right of the people  to petition the Government for a redress of grievances).  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine and Colorado preclusion law barred any attack on the Colorado Supreme Courts judgment in Salazar and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a valid Petition Clause claim.


The three-judge District Court ruled that under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, it had no jurisdiction to hear the Elections Clause claim.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1127.  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine, the court explained, includes three requirements: (1) the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must have actually been a party to the prior state-court judgment or have been in privity with such a party; (2) the claim raised in the federal suit must have been actually raised or inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment; and (3) the federal claim must not be parallel to the state-court claim.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1124.  The District Court found the first requirement satisfied on the ground that the citizen plaintiffs were in privity with the Colorado General Assemblya losing party in Salazar.  Relying on our decisions in Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658 (1979), and Tacoma v. Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U. S. 320 (1958), the court stated that when a state government litigates a matter of public concern, that states citizens will be deemed to be in privity with the government for preclusion purposes.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1125.  This principle, the court reasoned, applies with equal force in the Rooker-Feldman context.  Ibid.  The court went on to conclude that the Elections Clause claim was actually raised in Salazar, or inextricably intertwined with that decision, and was not parallel to the claims presented in Salazar.  As to the Petition Clause claim, the court ruled that neither Rooker-Feldman nor Colorado preclusion law prevented the court from proceeding to the merits, but that plaintiffs failed to state a claim.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1132; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.12(b)(6).


The plaintiffs appealed.  See 28 U. S.C. 1253.  We now note jurisdiction, and address whether the Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars the plaintiffs from proceeding because they were in privity with a party in Salazar.  We conclude it does not, and vacate the judgment of the District Court.
II

This Court is vested, under 28 U. S.C. 1257, with jurisdiction over appeals from final state-court judgments.  We have held that this grant of jurisdiction is exclusive: Review of such judgments may be had only in this Court.  District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462, 482 (1983) (emphasis added); see also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 286 (1970); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 416 (1923).  Accordingly, under what has come to be known as the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.
The Rooker-Feldman doctrine takes its name from the only two cases in which we have applied this rule to find that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction.  In Rooker, a party who had lost in the Indiana Supreme Court, and failed to obtain review in this Court, filed an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state-court judgment.  We viewed the action as tantamount to an appeal of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, over which only this Court had jurisdiction, and said that the aggrieved litigant cannot be permitted to do indirectly what he no longer can do directly.  263 U. S., at 416.  Feldman, decided 60 years later, concerned slightly different circumstances, with similar results.  The plaintiffs there had been refused admission to the District of Columbia bar by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, and sought review of these decisions in federal district court.  Our decision held that to the extent plaintiffs challenged the Court of Appeals decisions themselvesas opposed to the bar admission rules promulgated nonjudicially by the Court of Appealstheir sole avenue of review was with this Court.  460 U. S., at 476.


Neither Rooker nor Feldman elaborated a rationale for a wide-reaching bar on the jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and our cases since Feldman have tended to emphasize the narrowness of the Rooker-Feldman rule.  See Exxon Mobil, 544 U. S., at 292 (Rooker-Feldman does not apply to parallel state and federal litigation); Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Commn of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 644, n. 3 (2002) (Rooker-Feldman has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency); Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 10051006 (1994) (Rooker-Feldman does not bar actions by a nonparty to the earlier state suit).  Indeed, during that period, this Court has never applied Rooker-Feldman to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.  Exxon Mobil, supra, at 287.


In Exxon Mobil, decided last Term, we warned that the lower courts have at times extended Rooker-Feldman far beyond the contours of the Rooker and Feldman cases, overriding Congress conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U. S.C. 1738.  544 U. S., at 283.  Rooker-Feldman, we explained, is a narrow doctrine, confined to cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.  544 U. S., at 284.


Although we have never addressed the precise question before us, we have held Rooker-Feldman inapplicable where the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was not a party to the underlying state-court proceeding.  See De Grandy, supra, at 1006.  In De Grandy, the State of Florida sought, using Rooker-Feldman, to prevent the United States from bringing a challenge under 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the reapportionment of state electoral districts.  The Florida Supreme Court, in an action initiated by the state attorney general, had already declared the law valid under state and federal law.  We held that Rooker-Feldman did not bar the United States from bringing its own action in federal court because the United States was not a party in the state court, and was in no position to ask this Court to review the state courts judgment and has not directly attacked it in this proceeding.  512 U. S., at 1006.


In the case before us, plaintiffs were plainly not parties to the underlying state-court proceeding in Salazar.  Salazar was an action brought by the state attorney general against the secretary of state, in which the Colorado General Assembly intervened.  79 P.3d, at 1227.  The four citizen-plaintiffs here did not participate in Salazar, and were not in a position to ask this Court to review the state courts judgment.  De Grandy, supra, at 1006; see Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72, 77 (1987) ([T]he general rule [is] that one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom).


Although the District Court recognized the general rule that Rooker-Feldman may not be invoked against a federal-court plaintiff who was not actually a party to the prior state-court judgment, 379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1123, it nevertheless followed Tenth Circuit precedent in allowing application of Rooker-Feldman against parties who were in privity with a party to the earlier state-court action.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1123 (citing Kenmen Eng. v. Union, 314 F.3d 468, 481 (2002)).  In determining whether privity existed, the court looked to cases concerning the preclusive effect that state courts are required to give federal-court judgments.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1125 (citing Washington, 443 U. S., at 693, n.32; Taxpayers of Tacoma, 357 U. S., at 340341).  It concluded thatfor Rooker-Feldman as well as preclusion purposesthe outcome of the governments litigation over a matter of public concern binds its citizens.  379 F.Supp. 2d, at 1125.


The District Court erroneously conflated preclusion law with Rooker-Feldman.  Whatever the impact of privity principles on preclusion rules, Rooker-Feldman is not simply preclusion by another name.  The doctrine applies only in limited circumstances, Exxon Mobil, supra, at 291, where a party in effect seeks to take an appeal of an unfavorable state-court decision to a lower federal court.  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar actions by nonparties to the earlier state-court judgment simply because, for purposes of preclusion law, they could be considered in privity with a party to the judgment.[Footnote 2]


A more expansive Rooker-Feldman rule would tend to supplant Congress mandate, under the Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U. S.C. 1738, that federal courts give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that those judgments would be given in the courts of the State from which the judgments emerged.  Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U. S. 222, 246 (1998) (quoting Kremer v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 466 (1982)); see Exxon Mobil, supra, at 293.  Congress has directed federal courts to look principally to state law in deciding what effect to give state-court judgments.  Incorporation of preclusion principles into Rooker-Feldman risks turning that limited doctrine into a uniform federal rule governing the preclusive effect of state-court judgments, contrary to the Full Faith and Credit Act.[Footnote 3]
***

The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Although the secretary of state defended the legislatures plan in Salazar, following that decision she agreed to defend the court-ordered plan in this litigation and to allow the state attorney general to represent her.  379 F.Supp. 2d 1117, 1122, n.3 (Colo. 2005).
In holding that Rooker-Feldman does not bar plaintiffs here from proceeding, we need not address whether there are any circumstances, however limited, in which Rooker-Feldman may be applied against a party not named in an earlier state proceedinge.g., where an estate takes a de facto appeal in a district court of an earlier state decision involving the decedent.
Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred by Rooker-Feldman because they were in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party in People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.3d 1221 (Colo. 2003) (en banc).  We do not pass on the District Courts resolution of the merits of plaintiffs Petition Clause claim.

Our holding also disposes of the claim, which the District Court did not reach, that plaintiffs were barred by Rooker-Feldman because they were in privity with the secretary of state, the other losing party in People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.3d 1221 (Colo. 2003) (en banc).  We do not pass on the District Courts resolution of the merits of plaintiffs Petition Clause claim."|
04-1581|"WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC., APPELLANT v.
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
on appeal from the united states district court for
the district of columbia
[January 23, 2006]
Per Curiam.

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 203, 116 Stat. 91, prohibits corporations from using their general treasury funds to pay for any electioneering communications.  2 U. S.C. 441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. III).  BCRA 201 defines electioneering communications as any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a candidate for federal office and that is broadcast within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction in which that candidate is running for office.  2 U. S.C. 434(f)(3).  Appellant Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) brought this action against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking a judgment declaring BCRA unconstitutional as applied to several broadcast advertisements that it intended to run during the 2004 election.  WRTL also sought a preliminary injunction barring the FEC from enforcing BCRA against those advertisements. WRTL does not dispute that its advertisements are covered by BCRAs definition of prohibited electioneering communications.  Instead, it contends that BCRA cannot be constitutionally applied to its particular communications because they constitute grassroots lobbying advertisements.  Although the FEC has statutory authority to exempt by regulation certain communications from BCRAs prohibition on electioneering communications, 434(f)(3)(B)(iv), at this point, it has not done so for the types of advertisements at issue here.


The three-judge District Court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and subsequently dismissed WRTLs complaint in an unpublished opinion.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 545 U. S. ___ (2005).  Appellant asks us to reverse the judgment of the District Court because that court incorrectly read a footnote in our opinion in McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, (2003), as foreclosing any as-applied challenges to the prohibition on electioneering communications.  We agree with WRTL that the District Court misinterpreted the relevance of our uphold[ing] all applications of the primary definition of electioneering communications.  Id., at 190, n. 73.  Contrary to the understanding of the District Court, that footnote merely notes that because we found BCRAs primary definition of electioneering communication facially valid when used with regard to BCRAs disclosure and funding requirements, it was unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of the backup definition Congress provided.  Ibid.  In upholding 203 against a facial challenge, we did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges.


The FEC argues that the District Court also rested its decision on the alternative ground that the facts of this case suggest that WRTLs advertisements may fit the very type of activity McConnell found Congress had a compelling interest in regulating.  No. 041260 (DC, Aug. 17, 2004), App. to Juris. Statement 8a.  It is not clear to us, however, that the District Court intended its opinion to rest on this ground.  For one thing, the court used the word may.  For another, its separate opinion dismissing WRTLs challenge with prejudice characterized its previous opinion as holding that WRTLs as-applied challenge to BCRA is foreclosed by the Supreme Courts decision in McConnell.  Id., at 3a.  Given this ambiguity, we cannot say with certainty that the District Courts dismissal was based on this alternative ground.


We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTLs as-applied challenge in the first instance.
It is so ordered.

04-597|"UNITHERM FOOD SYSTEMS, INC. v. SWIFT-ECKRICH, INC., dba CONAGRA REFRIGERATED FOODS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 04597.Argued November 2, 2005Decided January 23, 2006
After respondent ConAgra warned companies selling equipment and processes for browning precooked meats that it intended to protect its rights under its patent for that process, petitioner Unitherm, whose president had invented the process six years before ConAgra filed its patent application, and one of ConAgras direct competitors jointly filed suit in an Oklahoma federal court.  As relevant here, they sought a declaration that ConAgras patent was invalid and unenforceable and alleged that ConAgra had violated 2 of the Sherman Act by attempting to enforce a patent obtained by fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office, see Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 174.  The District Court found the patent invalid and allowed the Walker Process claim to proceed to trial.  Before the case was submitted to the jury, ConAgra moved for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) based on legal insufficiency of the evidence.  The court denied the motion, the jury returned a verdict for Unitherm, and ConAgra neither renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) nor moved for a new trial on antitrust liability pursuant to Rule 59.  On appeal to the Federal Circuit, ConAgra maintained that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Walker Process verdict.  The court applied Tenth Circuit law, under which a party that has failed to file a postverdict sufficiency of the evidence challenge may nonetheless raise such a claim on appeal, so long as the party filed a Rule 50(a) motion before submission of the case to the jury.  The only available relief in such a circumstance is a new trial.  Freed to examine the sufficiency of the evidence, the Federal Circuit vacated the judgment and ordered a new trial. 
Held:Since respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b), the Federal Circuit had no basis for reviewing respondents sufficiency of the evidence challenge.  Rule 50 sets forth the requirements, establishing two stages, for challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil jury trial.  Rule 50(a) allows a challenge prior to the cases submission to the jury, authorizing the district court to grant the motion at the courts discretion.  Rule 50(b), by contrast, sets forth the requirements for renewing the challenge after the jury verdict and entry of judgment.  A partys failure to file a Rule 50(b) postverdict motion deprives an appellate court of the power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.  Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U. S. 212, 218.  It also deprives an appellate court of the power to order the entry of judgment in favor of that party where the district court directed the jurys verdict, Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332 U. S. 571, and where the district court expressly reserved a partys preverdict directed verdict motion and then denied it after the verdict, Johnson v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 344 U. S. 48.  A postverdict motion is necessary because determining whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart.  Cone, supra, at 216.  Moreover, the requirement is not an idle motion but an essential part of the rule, firmly grounded in principles of fairness.  Johnson, supra, at 53.  These authorities require reversal of the judgment below.  This Courts observations about the postverdict motions necessity and the benefits of the district courts input at that stage apply with equal force whether a party is seeking judgment as a matter of law or simply a new trial.  Contrary to respondents argument, the Cone, Globe Liquor, and Johnson outcomes underscore this holding.  Those litigants all secured new trials, but they had moved for a new trial postverdict in the district court and did not seek to establish their entitlement to a new trial based solely on a denied Rule 50(a) motion.  This result is further validated by the purported basis of respondents appeal, namely the District Courts denial of its Rule 50(a) motion.  Cone, Globe Liquor, and Johnson unequivocally establish that the precise subject matter of a partys Rule 50(a) motion cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b).  Respondent, rather than seeking to appeal the claim raised in its Rule 50(a) motion, seeks a new trial based on legal insufficiency of the evidence.  If a litigant that has failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion is foreclosed from seeking the relief sought in its Rule 50(a) motion, then surely respondent is foreclosed from seeking relief it did not and could not seek in its preverdict motion.  Rule 50(b)s text confirms that respondents Rule 50(a) motion did not give the District Court the option of ordering a new trial, for it provides that a district court may only order a new trial based on issues raised in a Rule 50(a) motion when ruling on a renewed motion under Rule 50(b).  If the District Court lacked such power, then the Court of Appeals was similarly powerless.  Rule 50(a)s text and application also support this result.  A district court may enter judgment as a matter of law when it concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient, but it is not required to do so.  Thus, the denial of respondents Rule 50(a) motion was not error, but merely an exercise of the District Courts discretion.  Pp. 412.

WALLACES BOOKSTORES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 04885.Argued October 31, 2005Decided January 23, 2006
The Bankruptcy Clause, Art. I, 8, cl.4, empowers Congress to establish uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.  In Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation v. Hood, 541 U. S. 440, this Court, without reaching the question whether the Clause gives Congress the authority to abrogate States immunity from private suits, see id., at 443, upheld the application of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S.C. 101 et seq., to proceedings initiated by a debtor against a state agency to determine the dischargeability of a student loan debt, see 541 U. S., at 451.  In this case, a proceeding commenced by respondent Bankruptcy Trustee under 547(b) and 550(a) to avoid and recover alleged preferential transfers by the debtor to petitioner state agencies, the agencies claim that the proceeding is barred by sovereign immunity.  The Bankruptcy Court denied petitioners motions to dismiss on that ground, and the District Court and the Sixth Circuit affirmed based on the Circuits prior determination that Congress has abrogated the States sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings.
Held:A bankruptcy trustees proceeding to set aside the debtors preferential transfers to state agencies is not barred by sovereign immunity.  Pp.322.
(a)The Bankruptcy Clauses history, the reasons it was adopted, and the legislation proposed and enacted under it immediately following ratification demonstrate that it was intended not just as a grant of legislative authority to Congress, but also to authorize limited subordination of state sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy arena.  Although statements in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, reflect an assumption that that cases holding would apply to the Clause, careful study and reflection convince this Court that that assumption was erroneous.  The Court is not bound to follow its dicta in a prior case in which the point at issue was not fully debated.  Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399400. Pp.45.


(b)States, whether or not they choose to participate, are bound by a bankruptcy courts order discharging the debtor no less than are other creditors.  Hood, 541 U. S., at 448.  Petitioners here, like the state agency parties in Hood, have conceded as much.  See id., at 449.  The history of discharges in bankruptcy proceedings demonstrates that these concessions, and Hoods holding, are correct.  The Framers primary goal in adopting the Clause was to prevent competing sovereigns interference with discharge: The patchwork of wildly divergent and uncoordinated insolvency and bankruptcy laws that existed in the American Colonies resulted in one jurisdictions imprisoning debtors discharged (from prison and of their debts) in and by another jurisdiction.  The absence of extensive debate at the Convention over the Clauses text or its insertion into the Constitution indicates that there was general agreement on the importance of authorizing a uniform federal response to the problems and injustice that system created.  Pp.511.


(c)Bankruptcy jurisdiction, as understood today and at the framing, is principally in rem.  See, e.g., Hood, 541 U. S., at 447.  It thus does not implicate States sovereignty to nearly the same degree as other kinds of jurisdiction.  See id., at 450451.  The Framers would have understood the Bankruptcy Clauses grant of power to enact laws on the entire subject of Bankruptcies to include laws providing, in certain limited respects, for more than simple adjudications of rights in the res.  Courts adjudicating disputes concerning bankrupts estates historically have had the power to issue ancillary orders enforcing their in rem adjudications.  See, e.g., id., at 455456.  The interplay between in rem adjudications and orders ancillary thereto is also evident in this case.  Whether or not actions such as this are properly characterized as in rem, those who crafted the Bankruptcy Clause would have understood it to give Congress the power to authorize courts to avoid preferential transfers and to recover the transferred property.  Pp.1215.


(d)Insofar as orders ancillary to the bankruptcy courts in rem jurisdiction, like orders directing turnover of preferential transfers, implicate States sovereign immunity from suit, the States agreed in the plan of the Constitutional Convention not to assert that immunity.  That is evidenced not only by the Bankruptcy Clauses history, but also by legislation considered and enacted in the immediate wake of the Constitutions ratification.  For example, the Bankruptcy Act of 1800 specifically granted federal courts habeas authority to release debtors from state prisons at a time when state sovereign immunity was preeminent among the Nations concerns, yet there appears to be no record of any objection to that grant based on an infringement of sovereign immunity.  This history demonstrates that the power to enact bankruptcy legislation was understood to carry with it the power to subordinate state sovereignty, albeit within a limited sphere.  Pp. 1521.


(e)The Court need not consider the question Hood left open: whether Congress attempt to abrogat[e] state sovereign immunity in 11 U. S.C. 106(a) is valid.  The relevant question is not abrogation, but whether Congress determination that States should be amenable to preferential transfer proceedings is within the scope of its power to enact Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies.  Beyond peradventure, it is.  Congress power, at its option, either to treat States in the same way as other creditors or exempt them from the operation of bankruptcy laws arises from the Clause itself; the relevant abrogation is the one effected in the plan of the Convention, not by statute.  Pp.2122.

04-1144|"AYOTTE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD
 OF NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 041144.Argued November 30, 2005Decided January 18, 2006
New Hampshires Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, in relevant part, prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor until 48 hours after written notice of such abortion is delivered to her parent or guardian.  The Act does not require notice for an abortion necessary to prevent the minors death if there is insufficient time to provide notice, and permits a minor to petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification.  The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.  Respondents, who provide abortions for pregnant minors and expect to provide emergency abortions for them in the future, filed suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming that the Act is unconstitutional because it lacks a health exception and because of the inadequacy of the life exception and the judicial bypass confidentiality provision.  The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement, and the First Circuit affirmed.
Held:If enforcing a statute that regulates access to abortion would be unconstitutional in medical emergencies, invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pp.410.
(a)As the case comes to this Court, three propositions are established.  First, States have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy.  Second, a State may not restrict access to abortions that are necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for preservation of the life or health of the mother.  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 879 (plurality opinion).  Third, New Hampshire has not taken issue with the cases factual basis:In a very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health.  New Hampshire has conceded that, under this Courts cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks.  Pp.46.


(b)Generally speaking, when confronting a statutes constitutional flaw, this Court tries to limit the solution to the problem, preferring to enjoin only the statutes unconstitutional applications while leaving the others in force, see United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 2022, or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 227229.  Three interrelated principles inform the Courts approach to remedies.  First, the Court tries not to nullify more of a legislatures work than is necessary.  Second, mindful that its constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, the Court restrains itself from rewrit[ing] state law to confirm it to constitutional requirements.  Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397.  Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent.  After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, the Court must ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all?

			"|"AYOTTE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW
HAMPSHIRE v. PLANNED PARENTHOOD
 OF NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 041144.Argued November 30, 2005Decided January 18, 2006
New Hampshires Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, in relevant part, prohibits physicians from performing an abortion on a pregnant minor until 48 hours after written notice of such abortion is delivered to her parent or guardian.  The Act does not require notice for an abortion necessary to prevent the minors death if there is insufficient time to provide notice, and permits a minor to petition a judge to authorize her physician to perform an abortion without parental notification.  The Act does not explicitly permit a physician to perform an abortion in a medical emergency without parental notification.  Respondents, who provide abortions for pregnant minors and expect to provide emergency abortions for them in the future, filed suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming that the Act is unconstitutional because it lacks a health exception and because of the inadequacy of the life exception and the judicial bypass confidentiality provision.  The District Court declared the Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement, and the First Circuit affirmed.
Held:If enforcing a statute that regulates access to abortion would be unconstitutional in medical emergencies, invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.  Pp.410.
(a)As the case comes to this Court, three propositions are established.  First, States have the right to require parental involvement when a minor considers terminating her pregnancy.  Second, a State may not restrict access to abortions that are necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for preservation of the life or health of the mother.  Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 879 (plurality opinion).  Third, New Hampshire has not taken issue with the cases factual basis:In a very small percentage of cases, pregnant minors need immediate abortions to avert serious and often irreversible damage to their health.  New Hampshire has conceded that, under this Courts cases, it would be unconstitutional to apply the Act in a manner that subjects minors to significant health risks.  Pp.46.


(b)Generally speaking, when confronting a statutes constitutional flaw, this Court tries to limit the solution to the problem, preferring to enjoin only the statutes unconstitutional applications while leaving the others in force, see United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 2022, or to sever its problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 227229.  Three interrelated principles inform the Courts approach to remedies.  First, the Court tries not to nullify more of a legislatures work than is necessary.  Second, mindful that its constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, the Court restrains itself from rewrit[ing] state law to confirm it to constitutional requirements.  Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383, 397.  Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent.  After finding an application or portion of a statute unconstitutional, the Court must ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all?  See generally, e.g., Booker, supra, at 227.  Here, the courts below chose the most blunt remedypermanently enjoining the Acts enforcement and thereby invalidating it entirely.  They need not have done so.  In Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914where this Court invalidated Nevadas partial birth abortion law in its entirety for lacking a health exceptionthe parties did not ask for, and this Court did not contemplate, relief more finely drawn, but here New Hampshire asked for and respondents recognized the possibility of a more modest remedy.  Only a few applications of the Act would present a constitutional problem.  So long as they are faithful to legislative intent, then, in this case the lower courts can issue a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the Acts unconstitutional application.  On remand, they should determine in the first instance whether the legislature intended the statute to be susceptible to such a remedy.  Pp.610.


(c)Because an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications or a holding that consistency with legislative intent requires invalidating the statue in toto should obviate any concern about the Acts life exception, this Court need not pass on the lower courts alternative holding.  If the Act survives in part on remand, the Court of Appeals should address respondents separate objection to the judicial bypass confidentiality provision.  P.10.

04-1332|"WILL etal. v. HALLOCK etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 041332.Argued November 28, 2005Decided January 18, 2006
In a warranted search of Susan and Richard Hallocks residence, Customs Service agents seized computer equipment, software, and disk drives.  No criminal charges were ever brought, but the equipment was returned damaged, with all of the stored data lost, forcing Susan to close her computer software business.  She sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, invoking the waiver of sovereign immunity, 28 U. S.C. 1346, and alleging negligence by the customs agents in executing the search.  While that suit was pending, Susan also filed this action against the individual agents under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, alleging that the damage they caused to her computers deprived her of property in violation of the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause.  After the District Court dismissed the first suit on the ground that the agents activities fell within an exception to the Tort Claims Acts waiver of sovereign immunity, 2680(e), the agents moved for judgment in the Bivens action.  They relied on the Tort Claims Acts judgment bar, 2676, which provides that the judgment in an action under 1346(b)  constitute[s] a complete bar to any action  against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that dismissal of the Tort Claims Act suit against the Government failed to raise the Acts judgment bar.  The Second Circuit affirmed, after first ruling in favor of jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.  Under this doctrine, appellate authority to review all final decisions of the district courts, 1291, includes jurisdiction over a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but are sufficiently important and collateral to the merits that they should nonetheless be treated as final, Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 867.
Held:A refusal to apply the Federal Tort Claims Acts judgment bar is not open to collateral appeal.  Pp.49. 
(a)Three conditions are required for collateral appeal: the order must [1] conclusively determine the disputed question; [2] resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits  , and [3] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.  Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 144.  Those conditions are stringent.  Digital Equipment, supra, at 868.  Unless they are kept so, the underlying doctrine will overpower the substantial finality interests 1291 is meant to further.  Pp.34.


(b)Among the small class of orders this Court has held to be collaterally appealable are those rejecting absolute immunity, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 742, qualified immunity, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530, and a States Eleventh Amendment immunity claim, Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 144145.  In each of these cases, the collaterally appealing party was vindicating or claiming a right to avoid trial, in satisfaction of the third condition: unless the order to stand trial was immediately appealable the right would be effectively lost.  However, to accept the generalization that any order denying a claim of right to prevail without trial satisfies the third condition would leave 1291s final order requirement in tatters.  See Digital Equipment, supra, at 872873.  Pp.45.


(c)Thus, only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify as orders that cannot be reviewed effectively after a conventional final judgment.  The further characteristic that merits collateral appealability is a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of the final judgment requirement.  Digital Equipment, supra, at 878879.  In each case finding appealability, some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial, e.g., honoring the separation of powers, Nixon, supra, at 749, 758, preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials, Mitchell, supra, at 526, and respecting a States dignitary interests, Puerto Rico Aqueduct, supra, at 146.  It is not mere avoidance of a trial, but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest that counts.  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468.  Pp.57.


(d)The customs agents claim here does not serve a weighty public objective.  This case must be distinguished from qualified immunity cases.  The nub of such immunity is the need to induce government officials to show reasonable initiative when the relevant law is not clearly established, Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 817; a quick resolution of a qualified immunity claim is essential.  There is, however, no such public interest at stake simply because the judgment bar is said to be applicable.  It is the avoidance of litigation for its own sake that supports the bar, and if simply abbreviating litigation troublesome to government employees were important enough, 1291 would fade out whenever the government or an official lost in an early round.  Another difference between qualified immunity and the judgment bar lies in the bars essential procedural element.  While a qualified immunity claim is timely from the moment an official is served with a complaint, the judgment bar can be raised only after a case under the Tort Claims Act has been resolved in the Governments favor.  The closer analogy to the judgment bar is the defense of res judicata.  Both are grounded in the perceived need to avoid duplicative litigation, not in a policy of freeing a defendant from any liability.  But this rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so important that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them.  See Digital Equipment, supra, at 873.  Pp.79. 
387 F.3d 147, vacated and remanded.
Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

04-52|"RICE, WARDEN, etal. v. COLLINS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 0452.Argued December 5, 2005Decided January 18, 2006
After the prosecutor struck a young, African-American woman, Juror 16, from the panel at respondent Collins state-court drug trial, Collins objected that the strike was made on account of Juror 16s race.  As race-neutral explanations for the strike, the prosecutor said that Juror 16 had rolled her eyes in response to a question from the court; that she was young and might be too tolerant of a drug crime; and that she was single and lacked ties to the community.  In rejecting Collins challenge, the trial court declared that it did not observe the complained-of demeanor by Juror 16, but noted that she was youthful, as was a white male juror also dismissed by peremptory challenge, and stated it would give the prosecutor the benefit of the doubt.  The prosecutor had also referred to Juror 16s gender in explaining the strike, but the trial court disallowed any reliance on that ground.  The California Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and the trial courts ruling on the peremptory challenge, finding that the prosecutor permissibly excluded Juror 16 based on her youth.  Even if youth was not a legitimate reason to exercise a peremptory challenge, said the court, Juror 16s demeanor supported the strike; nothing in the record suggested the trial court failed to conduct a searching inquiry of the prosecutors reasons for striking her.  The California Supreme Court denied review.  The Federal District Court dismissed Collins habeas petition with prejudice, but the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded, concluding that, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the State Court of Appeals affirmance was based on an unreasonable factual determination in light of the evidence presented at trial.  
Held:The Ninth Circuits attempt to use a set of debatable inferences to set aside the state courts conclusion does not satisfy AEDPAs requirements for granting habeas relief.  Pp.38.
(a)Under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 98, a defendants challenge to a peremptory strike allegedly based on race requires, inter alia, that the trial court determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.  This involves evaluating the persuasiveness of the [prosecutors proffered] justification for the strike, but the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 768.  Because, under AEDPA, a federal habeas court must find the state-court conclusion an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(2), a federal court can only grant Collins petition if it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutors race-neutral explanations for the Batson challenge.  Pp.34.


(b)Though the Ninth Circuit recited the proper standard of review, it improperly substituted its evaluation of the record for that of the state trial court, which, under 2254(d)(2), did not make an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.  Noting that the trial court had not witnessed Juror 16s purported eye rolling, the Ninth Circuit concluded that no reasonable factfinder could have accepted the prosecutors rendition of the alleged incident because the prosecutor had completely undermined her own credibility based on three considerations: her erroneous statement that another prospective African-American juror, Juror 19, was young when, in fact, she was a grandmother; the prosecutors improper attempt to use gender as a basis for exclusion; and the Court of Appeals skepticism toward the prosecutors explanation that she struck Juror 16 in part because of her youth and lack of ties to the community.  As to the first reason, because the prosecutors reference to Juror 19s youth occurred during a discussion of three prospective jurors, two of whom were, indeed, young, it is quite plausible that the prosecutor simply misspoke.  It is a tenuous inference to say that an accidental reference with respect to one juror undermines the prosecutors credibility with respect to another.  Second, the Ninth Circuit assigned the prosecutors reference to Juror 16s gender more weight than it can bear, given that the prosecutor provided a number of other permissible and plausible race-neutral reasons for excluding her.  Collins provides no argument why this matter demonstrates that a reasonable factfinder must conclude the prosecutor lied about the eye rolling and struck Juror 16 based on her race.  Finally, even if the prosecutors concerns about Juror 16s youth and lack of community ties were overly cautious, her wariness could be seen as race neutral, for she used a peremptory strike on a white male juror, Juror 6, with the same characteristics.  Viewing the foregoing concerns together, the most generous reading would suggest only that the trial court had reason to question the prosecutors credibility regarding Juror 16s alleged improper demeanor.  That does not, however, compel the conclusion that the trial court had no permissible alternative but to reject the prosecutors race-neutral justifications and conclude Collins had shown a Batson violation.  Reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutors credibility, but on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial courts credibility determination.  Pp.48.

04-1186|"WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION v. SCHMIDT etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 041186.Argued November 28, 2005Decided January 17, 2006
Petitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a national banking association with its designated main office in North Carolina and branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.  Plaintiff-respondent Schmidt and other South Carolina citizens sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter.  Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in Federal District Court, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute.  As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties diverse citizenship.  See 28 U. S.C. 1332.  The District Court denied Wachovias petition on the merits.  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit determined that the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, vacated the judgment, and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.  The appeals court observed that Wachovias citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by 1348, which provides that national banking associations are deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.  As the court read 1348, Wachovia is located in, and is therefore a citizen of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  Thus, Wachovias South Carolina branch operations rendered it a citizen of that State.  Given the South Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the court concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court.
Held:A national bank, for 1348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.  Pp.515.
(a)When Congress first authorized national banks, it allowed them to sue and be sued in federal court in any and all civil proceedings.  State banks, however, could initiate actions in federal court only on the basis of diversity of citizenship or the existence of a federal question.  Congress ended national banks automatic qualification for federal jurisdiction in 1882, placing them on the same footing as the banks of the state where they were located, Leather Manufacturers Bank v. Cooper, 120 U. S. 778, 780.  In an 1887 enactment, Congress first used the located language today contained in 1348.  Like its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act sought to limit  the access of national banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same extent [as] non-national banks.  Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555, 565566.  In the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings involving national banks, but retained without alteration the located clause.  Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial Code revision, Congress enacted 1348 in its current form.  Pp.57.


(b)The Fourth Circuit advanced three principal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is located in, and therefore a citizen of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  First, consulting dictionaries, the court observed that the term located refers to physical presence in a place.  Next, the court noted that 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: established and located.  The court concluded that, to give independent meaning to each word, established should be read to refer to the banks charter location and located, to the place where the bank has a physical presence.  Finally, the court relied on Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, in which this Court interpreted the term located in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U. S.C. 94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office.  Viewing the jurisdiction and venue statutes as pertaining to the same subject matter, the court concluded that, under the in pari materia canon, the two statutes should be interpreted consistently.  Pp.78.


(c)None of the Fourth Circuits rationales persuade this Court to read 1348 to attribute to a national bank, for diversity-jurisdiction purposes, the citizenship of each State in which the bank has established branch operations.  First, the term located, as it appears in the National Bank Act, has no fixed, plain meaning.  In some provisions, the word unquestionably refers to the site of the banking associations designated main office, but in others, located apparently refers to or includes branch offices.  Recognizing the controlling significance of context, this Court stated in Bougas: There is no enduring rigidity about the word located.  434 U. S., at 44.  Second, Congress may well have comprehended the words located and established, as used in 1348, as synonymous terms.  When Congress enacted 1348s statutory predecessors and 1348 itself, a national bank was almost always located only in the State in which it was established, under any of the proffered definitions of the two words.  For with rare exceptions a national bank could not operate a branch outside its home State until 1994, when Congress broadly authorized national banks to establish branches across state lines.  Congress use of the two terms may be best explained as a coincidence of statutory codification.  Deriving from separate provisions enacted in different years, the word established appearing in the first paragraph of 1348 and the word located appearing in the second paragraph were placed in the same section in the 1911 revision.  The codifying Act stated that provisions substantially the same as existing statutes should not be treated as new enactments.  Thus, it is unsurprising that, in 1947, this Court, referring to a national banks citizenship under the 1911 Act, used the terms established and located as alternatives.  See Cope v. Anderson, 331 U. S. 461, 467.  Finally, Bougas does not control 1348s meaning.  Although it is true that, under the in pari materia canon, statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read as if they were one law, Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U. S. 239, 243, venue and subject-matter jurisdiction are not concepts of the same order.  Venue, largely a matter of litigational convenience, is waived if not timely raised.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, on the other hand, concerns a courts competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases; a matter far weightier than venue, subject-matter jurisdiction must be considered by the court on its own motion, even if no party raises an objection.  Cognizant that venue is primarily a matter of choosing a convenient forum, Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., 443 U. S. 173, 180, the Court in Bougas stressed that its interpretation of [the former] 94 [would] not inconvenience the bank or unfairly burden it with distant litigation, 434 U. S., at 44, n.10.  Subject-matter jurisdiction, however, does not entail an assessment of convenience.  It poses the question whether the Legislature empowered the court to hear cases of a certain genre.  Thus, the considerations that account for the Bougas decision are inapplicable to 1348, a prescription governing subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting 1348 in pari materia with the former 94.  Significantly, Bougas reading of former 94 effectively aligned the treatment of national banks for venue purposes with the treatment of state banks and corporations.  By contrast, the Fourth Circuits decision in this case severely constricts national banks access to diversity jurisdiction as compared to the access generally available to corporations, for corporations ordinarily rank as citizens only of States in which they are incorporated or maintain their principal place of business, and are not deemed citizens of every State in which they maintain a business establishment.

			"|"WACHOVIA BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION v. SCHMIDT etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 041186.Argued November 28, 2005Decided January 17, 2006
Petitioner Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wachovia), is a national banking association with its designated main office in North Carolina and branch offices in many States, including South Carolina.  Plaintiff-respondent Schmidt and other South Carolina citizens sued Wachovia in a South Carolina state court for fraudulently inducing them to participate in an illegitimate tax shelter.  Shortly thereafter, Wachovia filed a petition in Federal District Court, seeking to compel arbitration of the dispute.  As the sole basis for federal-court jurisdiction, Wachovia alleged the parties diverse citizenship.  See 28 U. S.C. 1332.  The District Court denied Wachovias petition on the merits.  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit determined that the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, vacated the judgment, and instructed the District Court to dismiss the case.  The appeals court observed that Wachovias citizenship for diversity purposes is controlled by 1348, which provides that national banking associations are deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.  As the court read 1348, Wachovia is located in, and is therefore a citizen of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  Thus, Wachovias South Carolina branch operations rendered it a citizen of that State.  Given the South Carolina citizenship of the opposing parties, the court concluded that the matter could not be adjudicated in federal court.
Held:A national bank, for 1348 purposes, is a citizen of the State in which its main office, as set forth in its articles of association, is located.  Pp.515.
(a)When Congress first authorized national banks, it allowed them to sue and be sued in federal court in any and all civil proceedings.  State banks, however, could initiate actions in federal court only on the basis of diversity of citizenship or the existence of a federal question.  Congress ended national banks automatic qualification for federal jurisdiction in 1882, placing them on the same footing as the banks of the state where they were located, Leather Manufacturers Bank v. Cooper, 120 U. S. 778, 780.  In an 1887 enactment, Congress first used the located language today contained in 1348.  Like its 1882 predecessor, the 1887 Act sought to limit  the access of national banks to, and their suability in, the federal courts to the same extent [as] non-national banks.  Mercantile Nat. Bank at Dallas v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555, 565566.  In the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress combined two formerly discrete provisions on proceedings involving national banks, but retained without alteration the located clause.  Finally, as part of the 1948 Judicial Code revision, Congress enacted 1348 in its current form.  Pp.57.


(b)The Fourth Circuit advanced three principal reasons for deciding that Wachovia is located in, and therefore a citizen of, every State in which it maintains a branch office.  First, consulting dictionaries, the court observed that the term located refers to physical presence in a place.  Next, the court noted that 1348 uses two distinct terms to refer to the presence of a banking association: established and located.  The court concluded that, to give independent meaning to each word, established should be read to refer to the banks charter location and located, to the place where the bank has a physical presence.  Finally, the court relied on Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, in which this Court interpreted the term located in the former venue statute for national banks, see 12 U. S.C. 94 (1976 ed.), as encompassing any county in which a bank maintains a branch office.  Viewing the jurisdiction and venue statutes as pertaining to the same subject matter, the court concluded that, under the in pari materia canon, the two statutes should be interpreted consistently.  Pp.78.

04-623|"GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etal. v. OREGON etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04623.Argued October 5, 2005Decided January 17, 2006
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA or Act), which was enacted in 1970 with the main objectives of combating drug abuse and controlling legitimate and illegitimate traffic in controlled substances, criminalizes, inter alia, the unauthorized distribution and dispensation of substances classified in any of its five schedules.  The Attorney General may add, remove, or reschedule substances only after making particular findings, and on scientific and medical matters, he must accept the findings of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).  These proceedings must be on the record after an opportunity for comment.  The dispute here involves controlled substances listed in Schedule II, which are generally available only by written prescription, 21 U. S.C. 829(a).  A 1971 regulation promulgated by the Attorney General requires that such prescriptions be used for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.  21 CFR 1306.04.  To prevent diversion of controlled substances, the CSA regulates the activity of physicians, who must register in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.  He may deny, suspend, or revoke a registration that, as relevant here, would be inconsistent with the public interest.  21 U. S.C. 824(a)(4), 822(a)(2).  In determining consistency with the public interest, he must consider five factors, including the States recommendation, compliance with state, federal, and local law regarding controlled substances, and public health and safety.  823(f).  The CSA explicitly contemplates a role for the States in regulating controlled substances.  See 903.


The Oregon Death With Dignity Act (ODWDA) exempts from civil or criminal liability state-licensed physicians who, in compliance with ODWDAs specific safeguards, dispense or prescribe a lethal dose of drugs upon the request of a terminally ill patient.  In 2001, the Attorney General issued an Interpretive Rule to address the implementation and enforcement of the CSA with respect to ODWDA, declaring that using controlled substances to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical practice and that dispensing or prescribing them for this purpose is unlawful under the CSA.  The State, a physician, a pharmacist, and some terminally ill state residents challenged the Rule.  The District Court permanently enjoined its enforcement.  The Ninth Circuit invalidated the Rule, reasoning that, by making a medical procedure authorized under Oregon law a federal offense, it altered the balance between the States and the Federal Government without the requisite clear statement that the CSA authorized the action; and in the alternative, that the Rule could not be squared with the CSAs plain language, which targets only conventional drug abuse and excludes the Attorney General from medical policy decisions.
Held:The CSA does not allow the Attorney General to prohibit doctors from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide under state law permitting the procedure.  Pp.828.
(a)An administrative rule interpreting the issuing agencys own ambiguous regulation may receive substantial deference.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461463.  So may an interpretation of an ambiguous statute, Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842845, but only when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority, United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226227.  Otherwise, the interpretation is entitled to respect only to the extent it has the power to persuade.  Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140.  Pp.89.


(b)The Interpretive Rule at issue is not entitled to Auer deference as an interpretation of 21 CFR 1306.04.  Unlike the underlying regulations in Auer, which gave specificity to a statutory scheme the Secretary of Labor was charged with enforcing and reflected the Labor Departments considerable experience and expertise, the underlying regulation here does little more than restate the terms of the statute itself.  The CSA allows prescription of drugs that have a currently accepted medical use, 21 U. S.C. 812(b); requires a medical purpose for dispensing the least controlled substances of those on the schedules, 829(c); and defines a valid prescription as one issued for a legitimate medical purpose, 21 U. S.C.A. 830(b)(3)(A)(ii).  Similarly, physicians are considered practitioners if they dispense controlled substances in the course of professional practice.  21 U. S.C. 802(21).  The regulation just repeats two of these statutory phrases and attempts to summarize the others.  An agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language.  Furthermore, any statutory authority for the Interpretive Rule would have to come from 1984 CSA amendments adding the public interest requirement, but 21 CFR 1306.04 was adopted in 1971.  That the current interpretation runs counter to the intent at the time of the regulations promulgation is an additional reason why Auer deference is unwarranted.  Pp.911.


(c)The Interpretive Rule is also not entitled to Chevron deference.  The statutory phrase legitimate medical purpose is ambiguous in the relevant sense.  However, Chevron deference is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.  A rule must be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.  The specific respects in which the Attorney General is authorized to make rules under the CSA show that he is not authorized to make a rule declaring illegitimate a medical standard for patient care and treatment specifically authorized under state law.  Congress delegated to the Attorney General only the authority to promulgate rules relating to registration and control of the dispensing of controlled substances, 21 U. S.C. A. 821, and for the efficient execution of his [statutory] functions, 21 U. S.C. 871(b).  Control means to add a  substance to a schedule, 802(5), following specified procedures.  Because the Interpretive Rule does not concern scheduling of substances and was not issued under the required procedures, it cannot fall under the Attorney Generals control authority.  Even if control were understood to signify something other than its statutory definition, it could not support the Interpretive Rule.  Nor can the Interpretive Rule be justified under the CSAs registration provisions.  It does not undertake the Acts five-factor analysis for determining when registration is inconsistent with the public interest, 823(f), and it deals with much more than registration.  It purports to declare that using controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide is a crime, an authority going well beyond the Attorney Generals statutory power to register or deregister physicians.  It would be anomalous for Congress to have painstakingly described the Attorney Generals limited authority to deregister a single physician or schedule a single drug, but to have given him, just by implication, authority to declare an entire class of activity outside the course of professional practice and therefore a criminal violation of the CSA.  It is not enough that public interest, public health and safety, and Federal law are used in the part of the Act over which the Attorney General has authority.  Cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471.  The first two terms do not call on the Attorney General, or any Executive official, to make an independent assessment of the meaning of federal law.  The Attorney General did not base the Interpretive Rule on an application of the five-factor test generally, or the public health and safety factor specifically.  Even if he had, it is doubtful that he could cite those factors to deregister a physician simply because he deemed a controversial practice permitted by state law to have an illegitimate medical purpose.  The federal-law factor requires the Attorney General to decide [c]ompliance with the law but does not suggest that he may decide what the law is.  To say that he can define the substantive standards of medical practice as part of his authority would also put 21 U. S.C. 871(b) in considerable tension with the narrowly defined control and registration delegation.  It would go, moreover, against the plain language of the text to treat a delegation for the execution of his functions as a further delegation to define other functions well beyond the Acts specific grants of authority.  The authority desired by the Government is inconsistent with the Acts design in other fundamental respects, e.g., the Attorney General must share power with, and in some respect defer to, the Secretary, whose functions are likewise delineated and confined by the Act.  Postenactment congressional commentary on the CSAs regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attorney Generals claimed authority.  The Governments claim that the Attorney Generals decision is a legal, not medical, one does not suffice, for the Interpretive Rule places extensive reliance on medical judgments and views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose.  The idea that Congress gave him such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation is not sustainable.  The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.  Pp.1122.


(d)The Attorney Generals opinion is unpersuasive under Skidmore.  The CSA and this Courts case law amply support the conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.  Beyond this, the Act manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally, which is understandable given federalisms structure and limitations.  The CSAs structure and operation presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States police powers.  The Federal Government can set uniform standards for regulating health and safety.  In connection with the CSA, however, the only provision in which Congress set general, uniform medical practice standards, 42 U. S.C. 2990bb2a, strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit statutory language.  The difficulty in defending the Attorney Generals declaration that the CSA impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide is compounded by the Acts consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the CSAs limited objectives.  The Governments contention that the terms medical or medicine refer to a healing or curative art, and thus cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patients death, rests on a reading of 21 U. S.C. 829(a)s prescription requirement without the illumination of the rest of the statute.  Viewed in context, that requirement is better understood as ensuring that patients use controlled substances under a doctors supervision so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse.  To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as drug abuse under the CSA is discordant with the phrases consistent use throughout the Act, not to mention its ordinary meaning.  The Governments interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretarys primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA and the Acts otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers.  Pp. 2228.
368 F.3d 1118, affirmed.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, OConnor, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Roberts, C.J., and Thomas, J., joined.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

Postenactment congressional commentary on the CSAs regulation of medical practice is also at odds with the Attorney Generals claimed authority.  The Governments claim that the Attorney Generals decision is a legal, not medical, one does not suffice, for the Interpretive Rule places extensive reliance on medical judgments and views of the medical community in concluding that assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose.  The idea that Congress gave him such broad and unusual authority through an implicit delegation is not sustainable.  The importance of the issue of physician-assisted suicide makes the oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.  Pp.1122.


(d)The Attorney Generals opinion is unpersuasive under Skidmore.  The CSA and this Courts case law amply support the conclusion that Congress regulates medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means to engage in illicit drug dealing and trafficking as conventionally understood.  Beyond this, the Act manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally, which is understandable given federalisms structure and limitations.  The CSAs structure and operation presume and rely upon a functioning medical profession regulated under the States police powers.  The Federal Government can set uniform standards for regulating health and safety.  In connection with the CSA, however, the only provision in which Congress set general, uniform medical practice standards, 42 U. S.C. 2990bb2a, strengthens the understanding of the CSA as a statute combating recreational drug abuse, and also indicates that when Congress wants to regulate medical practice in the given scheme, it does so by explicit statutory language.  The difficulty in defending the Attorney Generals declaration that the CSA impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide is compounded by the Acts consistent delegation of medical judgments to the Secretary and its otherwise careful allocation of powers for enforcing the CSAs limited objectives.  The Governments contention that the terms medical or medicine refer to a healing or curative art, and thus cannot embrace the intentional hastening of a patients death, rests on a reading of 21 U. S.C. 829(a)s prescription requirement without the illumination of the rest of the statute.  Viewed in context, that requirement is better understood as ensuring that patients use controlled substances under a doctors supervision so as to prevent addiction and recreational abuse.  To read prescriptions for assisted suicide as drug abuse under the CSA is discordant with the phrases consistent use throughout the Act, not to mention its ordinary meaning.  The Governments interpretation of the prescription requirement also fails under the objection that the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of such broad authority, given the Secretarys primacy in shaping medical policy under the CSA and the Acts otherwise careful allocation of decisionmaking powers.

04-980|"BROWN, WARDEN v. SANDERS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04980.Argued October 11, 2005Decided January 11, 2006
In convicting respondent Sanders of, inter alia, first-degree murder, the jury found four special circumstances, each of which rendered him death eligible under Cal. Penal Code Ann. 190.2.  At the penalty phase, the jury was instructed to consider a list of sentencing factors, including [t]he circumstances of the crime  and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true, 190.3(a), and sentenced him to death.  The State Supreme Court invalidated two of the special circumstances on direct appeal, but nonetheless affirmed the conviction and sentence.  The Federal District Court subsequently denied Sanders habeas relief, rejecting his claim that the jurys consideration of invalid special circumstances rendered his death sentence unconstitutional.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit applied the rules for weighing States, see Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, rather than non-weighing States, see Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, and found that Sanders had been unconstitutionally deprived of an individualized death sentence.
Held:
1.The requirement that States limit the class of murderers to which the death penalty may be applied, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (per curiam), is usually met when the trier of fact finds at least one statutory eligibility factor at either the guilt or penalty phase.  Once this narrowing requirement has been satisfied, the sentencer must determine whether an eligible defendant should receive the death penalty; many States channel this function by specifying aggravating factors (sometimes identical to the eligibility factors) that are to be weighed against mitigating considerations.  In answering the question confronted herewhat happens when the sentencer imposes the death penalty after finding a valid eligibility factor, but under a scheme in which another eligibility factor is later held invalidthis Court has set forth different rules for so-called weighing and non-weighing States.  In a weighing State, the sentencer could consider as aggravation only specified eligibility factors.  Where the sentencer relied on an eligibility factor that was later invalidated, the sentencer was erroneously invited to count the invalid factor as weighing in favor of death, thus skewing the weighing process, Stringer, supra, at 232.  Such automatic skewing would not necessarily occur in a non-weighing State, however, which permitted the sentencer to consider aggravating factors different from, or in addition to, the eligibility factors.  This weighing/non-weighing scheme seems needlessly complex and incapable of providing for the full range of variations.  This Court is henceforth guided by the following rule: An invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process unless one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.  Pp.39.


2. The jurys consideration of invalid special circumstances in Sanders case gave rise to no constitutional violation.  In California, the special circumstances listed in 190.2 are the eligibility factors designed to satisfy Furmans narrowing requirement.  If the jury finds the existence of one of those circumstances, it must take into account a separate list of sentencing factors, including 190.3(a)s circumstances of the crime factor.  That factor has the effect of rendering all the specified factors nonexclusive, thus making California (in this Courts prior terminology) a non-weighing State.  Setting aside the weighing/non-weighing dichotomy and applying the more direct analysis set out here, two of the four special circumstances were invalidated, but the remaining two are sufficient to satisfy Furmans narrowing requirement and alone rendered Sanders death eligible.  Moreover, all of the facts and circumstances admissible to prove the invalid eligibility factors were also properly adduced as aggravating facts and circumstances under the circumstances of the crime sentencing factor.  Even if 190.3(a)s direction to consider the existence of any special circumstances found to be true placed special emphasis upon the facts and circumstances relevant to the invalid factors, that impact cannot fairly be regarded as a constitutional defect in the sentencing process, Zant, supra, at 889.  Pp.912.

No. 041203.Argued November 9, 2005Decided January 10, 2006
Goodman, petitioner in No. 041236, is a paraplegic who sued respondent state defendants and others, challenging the conditions of his confinement in a Georgia prison under, inter alia, 42 U. S.C. 1983 and Title II of the Americans with Disability Act of 1990.  As relevant here, the Federal District Court dismissed the 1983 claims because Goodmans allegations were vague, and granted respondents summary judgment on the Title II money damages claims because they were barred by state sovereign immunity.  The United States, petitioner in No. 041203, intervened on appeal.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the District Courts judgment as to the Title II claims, but reversed the 1983 ruling, finding that Goodman had alleged facts sufficient to support a limited number of Eighth Amendment claims against state agents and should be permitted to amend his complaint.  This Court granted certiorari to decide the validity of Title IIs abrogation of state sovereign immunity.
Held:Insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.  Pp.58.
(a)Because this Court assumes that the Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Goodman had alleged actual Eighth Amendment violations for purposes of 1983, and because respondents do not dispute Goodmans claim that this same conduct violated Title II, Goodmans Title II money damages claims were evidently based, at least in part, on conduct that independently violated 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  No one doubts that 5 grants Congress the power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendments provisions by creating private remedies against the States for actual violations of those provisions.  This includes the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity by authorizing private suits for damages against the States.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing those of Goodmans claims based on conduct that violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp.57.


(b)Once Goodmans complaint is amended, the lower courts will be best situated to determine in the first instance, on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the States alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such conduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congresss purported abrogation of sovereign immunity in such contexts is nevertheless valid.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 04721.Argued November 9, 2005Decided January 10, 2006
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) gives a state prisoner whose conviction has become final one year to seek federal habeas corpus relief, 28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A), but tolls this 1-year limitations period for the time during which a properly filed application for State  collateral review . . . is pending, 2244(d)(2).  Under Californias collateral review scheme, the equivalent of a notice of appeal is timely if filed within a reasonable time.  In Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, this Court held, inter alia, that (1) only a timely appeal tolls AEDPAs limitations period for the time between the lower courts adverse decision and the filing of a notice of appeal; (2) in California, unreasonable delays are not timely; and (most pertinently) (3) a California Supreme Court order denying a petition on the merits does not automatically indicate that the petition was timely filed.


Respondent Chavis, a California state prisoner, filed a state habeas petition on May 14, 1993, which the trial court denied.  On September 29, 1994, the California Court of Appeal also held against him.  He then waited more than three years before seeking review in the California Supreme Court.  On April 29, 1998, that court issued an order stating simply that the petition was denied.  On August 30, 2000, Chavis filed a federal habeas petition.  After the case reached it, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the federal petitions timeliness depended on whether Chavis state postconviction relief application was pending, therefore tolling AEDPAs limitations period, during the 3-year period between the time the California Court of Appeal issued its opinion and the time he sought review in the State Supreme Court.  The Ninth Circuit held that the state application was pending because under Circuit precedent a denial without comment or citation is treated as a denial on the merits, and a petition denied on the merits was not untimely.
Held:The Ninth Circuit departed from Saffolds interpretation of AEDPA as applied to Californias system.  Pp.712.
(a)Contrary to Saffold, the Circuit in this case said in effect that the California Supreme Courts denial of a petition on the merits did automatically mean that the petition was timely.  More than that, it treated a State Supreme Court order that was silent on the grounds for the courts decision as equivalent to an order in which the words on the merits appeared.  If the appearance of on the merits does not automatically warrant a holding that the filing was timely, the absence of those words could not automatically warrant such a holding.  Absent (1) clear direction or explanation from the California Supreme Court about the meaning of reasonable time in the present context, or (2) clear indication that a particular request for appellate review was timely or untimely, the Ninth Circuit must itself examine the delay in each case and determine what the state courts would have held in respect to timeliness.  This is what this Court believes it asked the Circuit to do in Saffold.  This is what this Court believes the Circuit should have done here.  Pp.78.


(b)Given the uncertain scope of Californias reasonable time standard, it may not be easy for the Ninth Circuit to decide in each of the several hundred federal habeas petitions from California prisoners it hears annually whether a prisoners state-court review petition was timely.  However, for the reasons given in Saffold, the Circuits attempt to create shortcuts looking to the label the California Supreme Court applied to the denial order, even where that label does not refer to timeliness, are not true, either to Californias timeliness rule or to AEDPAs intent to toll the 1-year limitations period only when the state collateral review proceeding is pending.  Saffold, 536 U. S., at 220221, 225226.  The California courts might alleviate the problem by clarifying the scope of reasonable time or by indicating, when denying a petition, whether the filing was timely.  And the Ninth Circuit might seek guidance by certifying a question to the State Supreme Court in an appropriate case.  Id., at 226227.  Alternatively, the California Legislature might decide to impose more determinate time limits, conforming California law with that of most other States.  Absent any such guidance from state law, however, the Ninth Circuits only alternative is to simply ask and decide whether the state prisoners filing was made within a reasonable time.  In doing so, the Circuit must be mindful that, in Saffold, this Court held that timely filings in California fell within the federal tolling provision on the assumption that Californias reasonable time standard would not lead to filing delays substantially longer than those in States with determinate timeliness rules.  Id., at 222223.  Pp.810.


(c)Chavis did not file his petition for review in the California Supreme Court within a reasonable time.  This Courts examination of the record refutes his claim that his 3-year, 1-month, delay was reasonable because he could not use the prison library to work on his petition during this period.  And since Chavis needs all but two days of that lengthy delay to survive the federal 1-year habeas filing period, he cannot succeed.  Pp.1012.

04-905|"VOLVO TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. REEDER-SIMCO GMC, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 04905.Argued October 31, 2005Decided January 10, 2006
Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc. (Reeder), an authorized dealer of heavy-duty trucks manufactured by Volvo Trucks North America, Inc. (Volvo), generally sold those trucks through an industry-wide competitive bidding process, whereby the retail customer describes its specific product requirements and invites bids from dealers it selects based on such factors as an existing relationship, geography, and reputation.  Once a Volvo dealer receives the customers specifications, it requests from Volvo a discount or concession off the wholesale price.  Volvo decides on a case-by-case basis whether to offer a concession.  The dealer then uses its Volvo discount in preparing its bid; it purchases trucks from Volvo only if and when the retail customer accepts its bid.  Reeder was one of many regional Volvo dealers.  Although nothing prohibits a Volvo dealer from bidding outside its territory, Reeder rarely bid against another Volvo dealer.  In the atypical case in which a retail customer solicited a bid from more than one Volvo dealer, Volvos stated policy was to provide the same price concession to each dealer.  In 1997, after Volvo announced plans to enlarge the size of its dealers markets and to reduce by almost half the number of its dealers, Reeder learned that Volvo had given another dealer a price concession greater than the discounts Reeder typically received.


Reeder, suspecting it was one of the dealers Volvo sought to eliminate, filed this suit under, inter alia, 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S.C. 13, alleging that its sales and profits declined because Volvo offered other dealers more favorable price concessions.  At trial, Reeder presented evidence of two instances when it bid against another Volvo dealer for a particular sale.  In the first, although Volvo initially offered Reeder a lower concession, Volvo ultimately matched the concession offered to the competing dealer.  Neither dealer won the bid.  In the second, Volvo initially offered the two dealers the same concession, but increased the other dealers discount after it, rather than Reeder, was selected.  Reeder dominantly relied on comparisons between concessions it received on four occasions when it bid successfully against non-Volvo dealers (and thus purchased Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions other successful Volvo dealers received in bidding processes in which Reeder did not participate.  Reeder also compared concessions Volvo offered it on several occasions when it bid unsuccessfully against non-Volvo dealers (and therefore did not purchase Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions accorded other Volvo dealers who gained contracts on which Reeder did not bid.  Reeder did not look for instances in which it received a larger concession than another Volvo dealer, but acknowledged it was quite possible that such instances occurred.  Nor did Reeder offer any statistical analysis revealing whether it was disfavored on average as compared to other dealers.  The jury found a reasonable possibility that discriminatory pricing may have harmed competition between Reeder and other Volvo dealers, that Volvos discriminatory pricing injured Reeder, and that Reeders damages from Volvos Robinson-Patman violation exceeded $1.3 million.  The District Court awarded treble damages on the Robinson-Patman Act claim, and entered judgment.


Affirming, the Eighth Circuit, among other things, noted the threshold requirement that Reeder show it was a purchaser within the Acts meaning; rejected Volvos contention that competitive bidding situations do not give rise to Robinson-Patman claims; held that the four instances in which Reeder purchased trucks following successful bids rendered it a purchaser under the Act; determined that a jury could reasonably decide Reeder was in actual competition with favored dealers at the time price differentials were imposed; and held that the jury could properly find Reeder had proved competitive injury based on evidence that (1) Volvo intended to reduce the number of its dealers, (2) Reeder lost one contract for which it competed with another Volvo dealer, (3) Reeder would have earned more profits, had it received the concessions given other dealers, and (4) Reeders sales declined over time.  
Held:A manufacturer may not be held liable for secondary-line price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act in the absence of a showing that the manufacturer discriminated between dealers competing to resell its product to the same retail customer.  The Act does not reach the case Reeder presents.  It centrally addresses price discrimination in cases involving competition between different purchasers for resale of the purchased product.  Competition of that character ordinarily is not involved when a product subject to special order is sold through a customer-specific competitive bidding process.  Pp.715. 
1.Section 2 was enacted to curb financially powerful corporations use of localized price-cutting tactics that gravely impaired other sellers competitive position.  FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U. S. 536, 543, and n.6.  Augmenting 2, the Robinson-Patman Act targeted the perceived harm to competition occasioned by the advent of large chain stores able to obtain lower prices for goods than smaller buyers could demand.  Robinson-Patman does not ban all price differences charged to different purchasers of similar commodities, but proscribes only price discrimination [that] threatens to injure competition, Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209, 220.  Of the three categories of competitive injury that may give rise to a Robinson-Patman claim, secondary-line cases, like this one, involve price discrimination that injures competition among the discriminating sellers customers (here, Volvos dealerships).  Reeder has satisfied the Acts first two requirements for establishing secondary-line injury: (1) The relevant Volvo truck sales were made in interstate commerce, and (2) the trucks were of like grade and quality, 15 U. S.C. 13(a).  Because Reeder has not identified any differentially-priced transaction in which it was both a purchaser under the Act and in actual competition with a favored purchaser for the same customer, see e.g., FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U. S. 505, 518519, Volvo and amicus United States maintain that Reeder cannot satisfy the Acts third and fourth requirementsthat (3) Volvo discriminate[d] in price between Reeder and another purchaser of Volvo trucks, and (4) the effect of such discrimination may be . . . to injure, destroy, or prevent competition to the advantage of a favored purchaser, i.e., one who receive[d] the benefit of such discrimination, ibid.  Absent actual competition with a favored Volvo dealer, Reeder cannot establish the competitive injury the Act requires.  Pp.710.


2.The injury to competition targeted by the Robinson-Patman Act is not established by the selective comparisons Reeder presented at trial: (1) comparisons of concessions Reeder received for four successful bids against non-Volvo dealers, with larger concessions other successful Volvo dealers received for different sales on which Reeder did not bid (purchase-to-purchase comparisons); (2) comparisons of concessions offered to Reeder in connection with several unsuccessful bids against non-Volvo dealers, with greater concessions accorded other Volvo dealers who competed successfully for different sales on which Reeder did not bid (offer-to-purchase comparisons); and (3) comparisons of two occasions on which Reeder bid against another Volvo dealer (head-to-head comparisons).  Pp.1014.


(a)Because the purchase-to-purchase and offer-to-purchase comparisons fail to show that Volvo sold at a lower price to Reeders competitors, those comparisons do not support an inference of competitive injury.  See Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U. S. 428, 435.  Both types of comparisons fall short because in none of the discrete instances on which Reeder relied did it compete with beneficiaries of the alleged discrimination for the same customer.  Nor did Reeder even attempt to show that the compared dealers were consistently favored over it.  Reeder simply paired occasions on which it competed with non-Volvo dealers for a sale to Customer A with instances in which other Volvo dealers competed with non-Volvo dealers for a sale to Customer B.  The compared incidents were tied to no systematic study and were separated in time by as many as seven months.  This Court declines to permit an inference of competitive injury from evidence of such a mix-and-match, manipulable quality.  No similar risk of manipulation occurs in cases kin to the chain-store paradigm.  Here, there is no discrete favored dealer comparable to a chain store or a large independent department storeat least, Reeders evidence is insufficient to support an inference that such a dealer exists.  For all that appears, Reeder, on occasion, might have gotten a better deal vis--vis one or more of the dealers in its comparisons.  While Reeder may have competed with other Volvo dealers for the opportunity to bid on potential sales in a broad geographic area, competition at that initial stage is based on a variety of factors, including the existence vel non of a relationship between the potential bidder and the customer, geography, and reputation.  Once the customer has chosen the particular dealers from which it will solicit bids, the relevant market becomes limited to the needs and demands of the particular end user, with only a handful of dealers competing for the sale.  Volvo dealers bidding for sales in the same geographic area does not import that they in fact competed for the same customer-tailored sales.  Pp.1112.


(b)Nor is a Robinson-Patman violation established by Reeders evidence of two instances in which it competed head to head with another Volvo dealer.  When multiple dealers bid for the business of the same customer, only one dealer will win the business and thereafter purchase the suppliers product to fulfill its contractual commitment.  Even assuming the Act applies to head-to-head transactions, Reeder did not establish that it was disfavored vis--vis other Volvo dealers in the rare instances in which they competed for the same salelet alone that the alleged discrimination was substantial.  Reeders evidence showed loss of only one sale to another Volvo dealer, a sale of 12 trucks that would have generated $30,000 in gross profits for Reeder.  Per its policy, Volvo initially offered Reeder and the other dealer the same concession, but ultimately granted a larger concession to the other dealer after it had won the bid.  In the only other instance of head-to-head competition, Volvo increased Reeders initial discount to match the discount offered the other competing Volvo dealer, but neither dealer won the bid.  If price discrimination between two purchasers existed at all, it was not of such magnitude as to affect substantially competition between Reeder and the favored Volvo dealer.  Pp.1213.


3.The Robinson-Patman Act signals no large departure from antitrust laws primary concern, interbrand competition.  Even if the Acts text could be construed as Reeder urges and the Eighth Circuit held, this Court would resist interpretation geared more to the protection of existing competitors than to the stimulation of competition.  There is no evidence here that any favored purchaser possesses market power, the allegedly favored purchasers are dealers with little resemblance to large independent department stores or chain operations, and the suppliers selective price discounting fosters competition among suppliers of different brands.  By declining to extend Robinson-Patmans governance to such cases, the Court continues to construe the Act consistently with antitrust laws broader policies.  Pp.1314.

			"|"VOLVO TRUCKS NORTH AMERICA, INC. v. REEDER-SIMCO GMC, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 04905.Argued October 31, 2005Decided January 10, 2006
Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc. (Reeder), an authorized dealer of heavy-duty trucks manufactured by Volvo Trucks North America, Inc. (Volvo), generally sold those trucks through an industry-wide competitive bidding process, whereby the retail customer describes its specific product requirements and invites bids from dealers it selects based on such factors as an existing relationship, geography, and reputation.  Once a Volvo dealer receives the customers specifications, it requests from Volvo a discount or concession off the wholesale price.  Volvo decides on a case-by-case basis whether to offer a concession.  The dealer then uses its Volvo discount in preparing its bid; it purchases trucks from Volvo only if and when the retail customer accepts its bid.  Reeder was one of many regional Volvo dealers.  Although nothing prohibits a Volvo dealer from bidding outside its territory, Reeder rarely bid against another Volvo dealer.  In the atypical case in which a retail customer solicited a bid from more than one Volvo dealer, Volvos stated policy was to provide the same price concession to each dealer.  In 1997, after Volvo announced plans to enlarge the size of its dealers markets and to reduce by almost half the number of its dealers, Reeder learned that Volvo had given another dealer a price concession greater than the discounts Reeder typically received.


Reeder, suspecting it was one of the dealers Volvo sought to eliminate, filed this suit under, inter alia, 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S.C. 13, alleging that its sales and profits declined because Volvo offered other dealers more favorable price concessions.  At trial, Reeder presented evidence of two instances when it bid against another Volvo dealer for a particular sale.  In the first, although Volvo initially offered Reeder a lower concession, Volvo ultimately matched the concession offered to the competing dealer.  Neither dealer won the bid.  In the second, Volvo initially offered the two dealers the same concession, but increased the other dealers discount after it, rather than Reeder, was selected.  Reeder dominantly relied on comparisons between concessions it received on four occasions when it bid successfully against non-Volvo dealers (and thus purchased Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions other successful Volvo dealers received in bidding processes in which Reeder did not participate.  Reeder also compared concessions Volvo offered it on several occasions when it bid unsuccessfully against non-Volvo dealers (and therefore did not purchase Volvo trucks), with more favorable concessions accorded other Volvo dealers who gained contracts on which Reeder did not bid.  Reeder did not look for instances in which it received a larger concession than another Volvo dealer, but acknowledged it was quite possible that such instances occurred.  Nor did Reeder offer any statistical analysis revealing whether it was disfavored on average as compared to other dealers.  The jury found a reasonable possibility that discriminatory pricing may have harmed competition between Reeder and other Volvo dealers, that Volvos discriminatory pricing injured Reeder, and that Reeders damages from Volvos Robinson-Patman violation exceeded $1.3 million.  The District Court awarded treble damages on the Robinson-Patman Act claim, and entered judgment.


Affirming, the Eighth Circuit, among other things, noted the threshold requirement that Reeder show it was a purchaser within the Acts meaning; rejected Volvos contention that competitive bidding situations do not give rise to Robinson-Patman claims; held that the four instances in which Reeder purchased trucks following successful bids rendered it a purchaser under the Act; determined that a jury could reasonably decide Reeder was in actual competition with favored dealers at the time price differentials were imposed; and held that the jury could properly find Reeder had proved competitive injury based on evidence that (1) Volvo intended to reduce the number of its dealers, (2) Reeder lost one contract for which it competed with another Volvo dealer, (3) Reeder would have earned more profits, had it received the concessions given other dealers, and (4) Reeders sales declined over time.
