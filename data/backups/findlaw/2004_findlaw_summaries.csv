LAMIE v. US TRUSTEE, 02-693|02-693|Bankruptcy Code section 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors' attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by section 327. To be paid from estate funds under section 330(a)(1) in a chapter 7 case, the attorney must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court.
FELLERS v. US, 02-6320|02-6320|"The absence of an ""interrogation"" did not foreclose the accused's claim that jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from him at his home."
ALASKA DEP'T OF ENVTL. CONSERVATION v. EPA, 02-658|02-658|"The Clean Air Act authorizes defendant to stop construction of a major pollutant emitting facility permitted by a state authority when it finds that the authority's ""best available control technology"" determination is unreasonable in light of 42 U.S.C. section 7479(3)'s prescribed guides."
KONTRICK v. RYAN, 02-819|02-819|A debtor forfeits the right to challenge a creditor's objection to discharge as untimely under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4004 if the debtor does not raise that rule's time limitation before the bankruptcy court reaches the merits of the creditor's objection to discharge.
FREW v. HAWKINS, 02-628|02-628|Enforcement of a consent decree that springs from a federal dispute and that furthers the objectives of federal law does not violate the Eleventh Amendment.
VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICES OF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLP, 02-682|02-682|A class action alleging breach of an incumbent local exchange carrier's duty, per the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to share its network with competitors does not state a claim under Sherman Act section 2. The activity complained of does not violate pre-existing antitrust standards, and the 1996 Act does not amend these standards; where there is a regulatory structure to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm, antitrust enforcement will tend to provide little additional benefit.
ILLINOIS v. LIDSTER, 02-1060|02-1060|Brief highway checkpoint stops, when appropriately tailored by police seeking information about a crime of considerable public concern that was in all likelihood committed by others, do not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of motorists.
SEC v. EDWARDS, 02-1196|02-1196|"An investment scheme promising a fixed rate of return can be an ""investment contract"" and thus a ""security"" subject to the federal securities laws. There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns when determining whether a particular scheme is an investment contract."
MUHAMMAD v. CLOSE, 02-9065|02-9065|Court of Appeal's dismissal of prisoner's section 1983 action is reversed where the rule in Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477 (1994), which requires prisoners to resort to state litigation and federal habeas before section 1983, does not apply here.
USPS v. FLAMINGO INDUS. (USA) LTD., 02-1290|02-1290|Plaintiff is not subject to antitrust liability. In both form and function, it is not a separate antitrust person from the US but is part of the Government, and so is not controlled by the antitrust laws.
LOCKE v. DAVEY, 02-1315|02-1315|Washington State's exclusion of the pursuit of a devotional theology degree from its otherwise-inclusive scholarship aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The State's interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial, and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on program scholars.
BANKS v. DRETKE, 02-8286|02-8286|When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching material in the State's possession, e.g., by withholding evidence that would have allowed a defendant to discredit essential prosecution witnesses, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight. The Fifth Circuit erred in dismissing death row inmate's Brady claim with respect to one such witness, and in denying him a certificate of appealability with respect to another.
OLYMPIC AIRWAYS v. HUSAIN, 02-1348|02-1348|"Defendant is liable for the death of an international passenger because its conduct here constitutes an ""accident"" under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention. Flight attendant's refusal to reseat the asthmatic passenger away from the smoking section was clearly external to him, and unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, defendant's policy, and the simple nature of the requested accommodation."
GEN. DYNAMICS LAND SYS., INC. v. CLINE, 02-1080|02-1080|The ADEA's text, structure, purpose, history, and relationship to other federal statutes show that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one. Thus, it does not protect plaintiffs-employees, all between 40 and 50 years old, who were denied health benefits under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
GROH v. RAMIREZ, 02-811|02-811|The search of plaintiffs' ranch was clearly unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The warrant was plainly invalid, failing to describe with particularity the items to be seized; because it did not describe these items at all, the search was presumptively unreasonable; defendant, who prepared and executed the warrant, is not entitled to qualified immunity because no reasonable officer could believe such a warrant to be valid.
DOE v. CHAO, 02-1377|02-1377|Plaintiff must prove some actual damages to qualify for the minimum statutory award under the Privacy Act of 1974. His uncorroborated claim of emotional distress, on learning of defendant's improper disclosure of his Social Security number in connection with his black lung benefits claim, is not compensable.
ILLINOIS v. FISHER, 03-374|03-374|Constitutional Law, Criminal Law & Procedure
BEDROC LTD., LLC v. US, 02-1593|02-1593|"Sand and gravel are not ""valuable minerals"" reserved to the US in land grants issued under the Pittman Underground Water Act. Sand and gravel are abundant throughout Nevada, they have no intrinsic value, and they were commercially worthless when the Act was passed in 1919."
US v. FLORES-MONTANO, 02-1794|02-1794|Removal and disassembly of a vehicle's gas tank in the course of an international border inspection does not require reasonable suspicion. The interference with a motorist's possessory interest in his gas tank is justified by the Government's paramount interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects.
NAT'L ARCHIVES & RECORDS ADMIN. v. FAVISH, 02-954|02-954|The FOIA recognizes surviving family members' right to personal privacy with respect to their close relative's death-scene images. The privacy interest of Vincent Foster's family is protected by Exemption 7(C), and outweighs the public interest in disclosure; the requester failed to produce evidence warranting a belief that responsible officials might have acted negligently or otherwise improperly in performing their duties.
NIXON v. MISSOURI MUN. LEAGUE, 02-1238|02-1238|The class of entities contemplated by 47 U.S.C. section 253 does not include a State's own subdivisions; that preemption provision does not affect the power of States and localities to restrict their own (or their political inferiors') delivery of telecommunications services.
US v. GALLETTI, 02-1389|02-1389|The proper tax assessment against a partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the partnership's debts. Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Internal Revenue Code requires the IRS to separately assess the same tax against individuals who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for the taxpayer's debt.
S. FLORIDA WATER MGMT. DIST. v. MICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS, 02-626|02-626|This suit, brought under the Clean Water Act and alleging that the removal of phosphorus-laden water from the C-11 canal into the WCA-3 wetland requires a permit per the Act's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, is remanded for further proceedings regarding whether C-11 and WCA-3 are meaningfully distinct water bodies.
CRAWFORD v. WASHINGTON, 02-9410|02-9410|Admission of a testimonial statement made by defendant's wife during police interrogation violated the Confrontation Clause. Where testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is confrontation.
IOWA v. TOVAR, 02-1541|02-1541|"For a right-to-counsel waiver at the plea stage to be ""knowing and intelligent,"" it is sufficient that the trial court inform the accused of the nature of the charges against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant upon the entry of a guilty plea. He need not be warned of the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked, or that he will lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on whether it is wise for him to plead guilty."
BALDWIN v. REESE, 02-964|02-964|"A state prisoner ordinarily does not ""fairly present"" a federal claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition, a brief, or similar papers to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that will alert it to the presence of such a claim. Accordingly, the prisoner seeking habeas relief in the instant case failed to exhaust available state rememdies."
RAYMOND B. YATES, M.D., P.C. PROFIT SHARING PLAN v. HENDON, 02-458|02-458|"The working owner of a business may qualify as a ""participant"" in a pension plan covered by ERISA. If the plan covers one or more employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants; such a working owner qualifies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies.  Remanded with instructions regarding issue of loan repayments."
VIETH v. JUBELIRER, 02-1580|02-1580|Dismissal of a gerrymandering challenge to a congressional redistricting plan adopted by Pennsylvania's General Assembly is affirmed. These statewide claims are nonjusticiable.
ENGINE MFRS. ASS'N v. S. COAST AIR QUALITY MGMT. DIST., 02-1343|02-1343|Local Fleet Rules generally prohibiting the purchase or lease by various public and private fleet operators of vehicles that do not comply with stringent emission requirements appear to be preempted, in whole or in part, by section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act. The Rules do not escape preemption just because they address the purchase of vehicles, rather than their manufacture or sale.
HOUSEHOLD CREDIT SERVS., INC. v. PFENNIG, 02-857|02-857|"Regulation Z, which interprets the Truth in Lending Act's definition of ""finance charge"" to exclude charges for exceeding a credit limit, is not an unreasonable interpretation of 15 U.S.C. section 1605."
US v. LARA, 03-107|03-107|Because Congress recognizes the tribes' criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians, the Spirit Lake Tribe acted in its capacity as a sovereign authority when it prosecuted defendant, thus the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the Federal Government from prosecuting him for a discrete federal offense.
NELSON v. CAMPBELL, 03-6821|03-6821|When challenging confinement conditions in prison, 42 U.S.C. section 1983 is an appropriate vehicle to bring an Eighth Amendment claim seeking a temporary stay and permanent injunctive relief.
THORNTON v. US, 03-5165|03-5165|When a lawful custodial arrest of an automobile's occupant is made, the Fourth Amendment allows a contemporaneous search of the vehicle's passenger compartment, regardless of whether the officer initiated contact with the arrestee while he was still in the car.
SABRI v. US, 03-44|03-44|18 U.S.C. section 666(a)(2), which proscribes bribery of officials of entities that receive at least $10,000 in federal funds, does not require proof of connection with federal money and is a valid exercise of Congress's Article I authority.
GRUPO DATAFLUX v. ATLAS GLOBAL GROUP, L.P., 02-1689|02-1689|A party's postfiling change in citizenship cannot cure a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction that existed at the time of filing in a diversity action.
TILL v. SCS CREDIT CORP., 02-1016|02-1016|"Four justices conclude that the ""prime-plus"" or ""formula rate"" best meets the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code's cram down provision; because the proposed 9.5% interest rate is higher than the risk-free rate, it is sufficient to account for the time value of money, which is all 11 U.S.C. section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) requires."
TENNESSEE v. LANE, 02-1667|02-1667|As it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, Title II of the ADA constitutes a valid exercise of Congress' authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive guarantees.
TENNESSEE STUDENT ASSISTANCE CORP. v. HOOD, 02-1606|02-1606|Bankruptcy court's discharge of a student loan debt guaranteed by a state entity does not implicate the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity; the Court declines to decide whether a bankruptcy court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a State would be valid under the Eleventh Amendment.
MIDDLETON v. MCNEIL, 03-1028|03-1028|The state court did not err when it found that, considering the instructions on voluntary manslaughter and imperfect self-defense in their entirety, there was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled by the erroneous imminent-peril instruction.
JOHNSON v. CALIFORNIA, 03-6539|03-6539|The California Supreme Court's decision on petitioner's Wheeler/Batson claim was not final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. section 1257; dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
DRETKE v. HALEY, 02-1824|02-1824|The Court declines to decide whether the actual innocence exception extends to noncapital sentencing errors. When faced with allegations of actual innocence, whether of the sentence or of the crime charged, a federal court must first address all nondefaulted claims for comparable relief and other grounds for cause to excuse the procedural default.
SCARBOROUGH v. PRINCIPI, 02-1657|02-1657|A timely application for attorney's fees per 28 U.S.C. section 2412(d)may be amended after the 30-day filing period has run to cure an initial failure to allege that the Government's position in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification.
JONES v. R.R. DONNELLEY & SONS CO., 02-1205|02-1205|"A cause of action ""arises under an Act of Congress enacted"" after December 1, 1990 - and therefore is governed by 28 U.S.C. section 1658's four-year statute of limitations - if the claim was made possible by a post-1990 enactment. Because petitioners' causes of action arose under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, they are not time-barred."
ASHCROFT v. ACLU, 03-218|03-218|The Court upheld a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of the Child Online Pornography Act, because the statute likely violates the First Amendment.
SOSA v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN, 03-339|03-339|The Federal Tort Claims Act's exception to waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising in a foreign country bars claims based on any injury suffered in a foreign country, regardless of where the tortious act or omission occurred.
HOLLAND v. JACKSON, 03-1200|03-1200|Concerning a habeas petition, the Sixth Circuit erred in holding that the state court's application of Strickland was unreasonable on evidence not properly before the state court, and in finding that the district court wrongly assessed prejudice under a preponderance standard, rather than a reasonable probability standard.
MISSOURI v. SEIBERT, 02-1371|02-1371|Where an officer intentionally withheld Miranda warnings, obtained a confession, then issued Miranda warnings and elicited a second confession, the court found that both confessions were inadmissible as violating the defendant-s Fifth Amendment rights.
HAMDI v. RUMSFELD, 03-6696|03-6696|Where a U.S. citizen was detained for allegedly fighting against the U.S. in Afghanistan as an enemy combatant, due process demands that he be given a meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for his detention before a neutral decision maker.
US v. PATANE, 02-1183|02-1183|Failure to give as suspect full Miranda warnings does not require the suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect's unwarned, voluntary statements.

RUMSFELD v. PADILLA, 03-1027|03-1027|"The Court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff's habeas petition, because the U. S. Secretary of State, against whom the petition was brought, was not the immediate custodian of plaintiff's ""person"", and therefore was not the proper respondent."
BEARD v. BANKS, 02-1603|02-1603|Concerning a capital prisoner's habeas petition, the Court found its decision in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, announced a new rule of constitutional law which did not fall under the Teague exception, and therefore could not be applied retroactively by the habeas petitioner.
BLAKELY v. WASHINGTON, 02-1632|02-1632|Because the facts supporting the defendant's exceptionally harsh sentence were neither admitted by the defendant, nor found by a jury, the sentence violated defendant's Sixth amendment right to trial by jury.
TENNARD v. DRETKE, 02-10038|02-10038|In a capital murder case involving a defendant with an IQ of 67, a COA should have issued, because a reasonable jurist could have found the district court's assessment of constitutional claims, relating to defendant's low IQ, debatable or wrong.
CHENEY v. U.S. DIST. COURT FOR DIST. OF COLUMBIA, 03-475|03-475|In a case concerning the National Energy Policy Development Group's alleged failure to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act's open meeting and disclosure requirements, the Court declined to compel the Vice President to comply with discovery requests, but remanded to the court below for further consideration.
SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLIN, 03-526|03-526|"The rule set out by the Court in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 548, requiring the existence of an aggravating factor to be proved to the jury rather than a judge, does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review, because it was not a ""watershed rule of criminal procedure."""
INTEL CORP. v. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC., 02-572|02-572|In an anti-trust case, USC Section 1782(a) authorizes, but does not require a district court to compel discovery requested by an adverse party to be used in a case brought before the Directorate-General of the Commission of European Communities.

HIBBS v. WINN, 02-1809|02-1809|Tax Injunction Act did not bar plaintiffs' challenge to a state tax law providing for credits for payments made to school tuition organizations that provided scholarships to private school students, which plaintiffs challenged as violating the Establishment Clause.
PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE v. SUDERS, 03-95|03-95|"To establish ""constructive discharge,"" plaintiff must prove a work environment so hostile as to merit resignation as a fitting response.

DEPT. OF TRANSP. v. PUB.

CITY OF LITTLETON v. Z. J. GIFTS, 02-1609|02-1609|City's adult business license ordinance was found to meet the First Amendment's requirements that such a licensing scheme ensure prompt judicial review of an administrative decision denying a license.
REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA v. ALTMAN, 03-13|03-13|The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies retroactively to actions of foreign states that occurred before the FSIA's 1976 enactment.

YARBOROUGH v. ALVARADO, 02-1684|02-1684|A state court considered the proper factors and reached a reasonable conclusion that minor defendant was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview. The District Court's decision granting habeas relief under AEDPA is reversed.
