Cunningham v. California, 05-6551|05-6551|California's determinate sentencing law, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge's province, violates a defendant's right to trial by jury safe-guarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Osborn v. Haley, 05-593|05-593|In the context of the Westfall Act, which accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts undertaken in the course of their official duties, the Attorney General's scope-of-employment certification is conclusive for purposes of removal. Once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court. Also, Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Attorney General concludes, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.
Jones v. Bock, 05-7058, 05-7142|05-7142|Procedural rules adopted by the Sixth Circuit and other lowers courts, designed to implement the Prison Litigation Reform Act's (PLRA) exhaustion requirement and to facilitate early judicial screening, are not required by the PLRA, and crafting and imposing them exceeded the proper limits on the judicial role.
Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 05-1629|05-1629|"In the context of 8 U.S.C. section 1101(a)(43)(G), which provides for removal from the United States of an alien convicted of ""a theft offense ... for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,"" the term ""theft offense"" in the statute includes the crime of ""aiding and abetting"" a theft offense."
Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. Sorrell, 05-746|05-746|In cases under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence are governed by the same causation standard.
US v. Resendiz-Ponce, 05-998|05-998|The Ninth Circuit's reversal of respondent's conviction for illegally attempting to reenter the U.S. is reversed where the indictment at issue was not defective, and consequently, the Supreme Court did not need to answer the question of whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from a federal indictment can constitute harmless error.
MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 05-608|05-608|Dismissal of a drug manufacturer's patent and contract declaratory judgment action, for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, is reversed where petitioner was not required, insofar as Article III is concerned, to break or terminate its 1997 license agreement before seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court that the underlying patent was invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed.
Burton v. Stewart, 05-9222|05-9222|Denial of a habeas petition challenging the constitutionality of petitioner's sentence under Apprendi is vacated where petitioner failed to comply with the gate-keeping requirements of 28 U. S. C. section 2244(b) and thus, the district court was deprived of jurisdiction to hear his claims in the first place. Consequently, the court did not answer the question on which it granted certiorari, specifically, whether the decision in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), announced a new rule and, if so, whether it applies retroactively on collateral review.
Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts, 05-996|05-996|"In a bankruptcy case involving the issue of whether a debtor in a Chapter 7 proceeding, despite bad faith conduct, has an absolute right to convert under section 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Court rules that the courts in this case correctly held that the debtor forfeited his right to proceed under Chapter 13. The Court does not indicate with precision what conduct qualifies as ""bad faith"" sufficient to permit a bankruptcy judge to dismiss a Chapter 13 case or to deny conversion from Chapter 7, except to indicate the debtor's conduct must be atypical."
Wallace v. Kato, 05-1240|05-1240|The statute of limitations for a 42 U.S.C. section 1983 claim seeking damages for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process.
Weyerhauser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 05-381|05-381|In the antitrust context of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the test the Court applied to claims of predatory pricing in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209 (1993), also applies to claims of predatory bidding, which involves the exercise of market power on the buy side or input side of a market to drive the price of a critical input to high levels.
Lawrence v. State of Florida, 05-8820|05-8820|28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2) does not toll the one year limitations period for seeking federal habeas relief from a state-court judgment during the pendency of a certiorari petition in the Supreme Court.
Philip Morris USA v. Williams, 05-1256|05-1256|A punitive damages award, based in part on a jury's desire to punish a defendant for harming nonparties, amounts to a taking of property from the defendant without due process. A judgment rejecting a tobacco company's challenges to a punitive damages award against it in a negligence and deceit case is vacated where the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard when considering the tobacco company's appeal.
Limtiaco v. Camacho, 06-116|06-116|In the context of the Guam Organic Act's debt-limitation provision, 48 U.S.C. section 1423a, Guam's debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed valuation of property in Guam.
Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. US, 05-1272|05-1272|"In a qui tam suit under the False Claims Act brought by relator-former engineer against Rockwell arising from its operation of a nuclear weapons plant and improper toxic pond sludge disposal, a circuit court ruling in favor of the relator is reversed where the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment in his favor as: 1) the False Claim Act's ""original source"" requirement is jurisdictional; and 2) the engineer did not meet the requirement that a relator have ""direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based"" for purposes of being an original source."
Travelers Cas. & Surety Co. of Am. v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 05-1429|05-1429|Federal bankruptcy law does not disallow contract-based claims for attorney's fees based solely on the fact that the fees were incurred litigating bankruptcy law issues.
Sinochem Int'l Co. Ltd. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp., 06-102|06-102|A district court has discretion to respond at once to a defendant's forum non conveniens plea, and need not take up first any other threshold objection. In particular, a court need not resolve whether it has authority to adjudicate the cause (subject-matter jurisdiction) or personal jurisdiction over the defendant if it determines that, in any event, a foreign tribunal is the more suitable arbiter of the merits of the case.
Lance v. Coffman, 06-641|06-641|In an action brought by Colorado citizens involving the constitutionality of a state constitutional provision limiting redistricting to once per census, a judgment finding the suit barred by issue preclusion is vacated in part where plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their Elections Clause claim as their alleged injury was an undifferentiated, generalized grievance about the conduct of government.
Whorton v. Bockting, 05-595|05-595|"Under the rules set out in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), the Supreme Court's decision regarding the admissibility of testimonial hearsay evidence under the Sixth Amendment in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), is not retroactive to cases already final on direct review. Crawford announced a ""new rule"" of criminal procedure which does not fall within the Teague exception for watershed rules."
United Haulers Ass'n, Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth., 05-1345|05-1345|"In a suit brought by a trade association and individual haulers under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 alleging that certain counties' flow control ordinances involving solid waste disposal violated the Commerce Clause, the ordinances are upheld as, while the ordinances benefit a clearly public facility, they treat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones, and thus do not ""discriminate against interstate commerce"" for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause."
Scott v. Harris, 05-1631|05-1631|A police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent by-standers does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.
KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 04-1350|04-1350|"In a patent dispute involving adjustable pedal systems and raising issues regarding the ""teaching, suggestion, or motivation"" test for obviousness, a circuit court decision reversing summary judgment for defendant is reversed where, in rejecting the district court's rulings on obviousness, the Federal Circuit analyzed the issue in a narrow, rigid manner inconsistent with 35 U.S.C. section 103 and the Supreme Court's precedents."
EC Term of Years Trust v. US, 05-1541|05-1541|In a refund action brought by a trust under 28 U.S.C. section 1346(a)(1), arising from allegedly wrongful levies by the IRS on a bank account in which the trust had deposited funds, dismissal of the action is affirmed where the trust: 1) missed 26 U.S.C. section 7426(a)(1)'s deadline for challenging a levy; and 2) may not bring the challenge as a tax refund claim under section 1346(a)(1).
Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 05-1056|05-1056|"In a patent infringement suit brought by AT&T charging Microsoft with liability for foreign installations of Windows under 35 U.S.C. section 271(f), rulings holding Microsoft liable are reversed as, because Microsoft does not export from the U.S. copies of Windows installed on the foreign-made computers in question, it does not ""suppl[y]...from the United States"" ""components"" of those computers, and it is therefore not liable under section 271(f)."
Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 05-11284|05-11284|In a capital murder case, denial of habeas relief for petitioner is reversed where there was a reasonable likelihood that a state trial court's instructions prevented jurors from giving meaningful consideration to constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence, and consequently a court of appeals' ruling resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.
Smith v. Texas, 05-11287|05-11287|In a first-degree murder and death penalty case in which sentencing took place in between the two Penry decisions of the Supreme Court, denial of relief on collateral review is reversed where a state court's errors of federal law regarding preservation of a Penry claim could not be the predicate for requiring him to show egregious harm, and petitioner appeared to be entitled to relief under the applicable state harmless-error framework.
Brewer v. Quarterman, 05-11287|05-11287|In a capital murder case, denial of a habeas petition is reversed where the Texas capital sentencing statute, as interpreted by a state court, impermissibly prevented defendant's jury from giving meaningful consideration and effect to constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence. Thus, its decision denying relief under Penry was contrary to, and involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.
James v. US, 05-9264|05-9264|"Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a ""violent felony"" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) for sentencing purposes."
Gonzales v. Carhart, 05-380, 05-1382|05-1382|In a challenge to the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act which proscribes a particular method of ending fetal life in the later stages of pregnancy, judgments enjoining enforcement of the Act are reversed as respondents did not demonstrate that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception.
Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., 05-705|05-705|In the context of rules that require long-distance and other communications carriers to compensate a payphone operator when a caller uses a payphone to obtain free access to the carrier's lines, the FCC's application of 47 U.S.C. section 201(b) to a long distance carrier's refusal to pay compensation is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and is, thus, lawful. 47 U.S.C. section 207 authorizes a payphone operator to bring a federal-court lawsuit against a recalcitrant carrier that refuses to pay the compensation ordered by the FCC.
Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 05-1342|05-1342|A national bank's mortgage business, whether conducted by the bank itself or through the bank's operating subsidiary, is subject to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) superintendence, and not to the licensing, reporting, and visitorial regimes of the several states in which the subsidiary operates.
Zuni Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Dep't of Educ., 05-1508|05-1508|"The federal Impact Aid Act sets forth a method that the Secretary of Education is to use when determining whether a state's public school funding program ""equalizes expenditures"" throughout the state, for purposes of allowing offsets of federal impact aid to individual school districts. In a dispute over the proper equalization formula, lower courts' rejection of school districts' challenges to the Secretary of Education's applicable regulations is affirmed as certain statutory language in the Act permits the Secretary to identify the school districts that should be ""disregard[ed]"" by looking to the number of the district's pupils, as well as to the size of the district's expenditures per pupil."
Massachusetts v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 05-1120|05-1120|"In an action brought by states, groups, and organizations alleging the EPA abdicated its responsibility under the Clean Air Act to regulate certain greenhouse gas emissions, a judgment finding that the EPA properly denied a petition for rule making is reversed where: 1) petitioners had standing to challenge the EPA's ruling; 2) the denial of a petition for rulemaking is reviewed to determine whether it was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;"" 3) the EPA has the statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles; and 4) the EPA rejected the rulemaking petition on impermissible grounds, and on remand the EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute."
Envtl. Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 05-848|05-848|In an enforcement action involving two air pollution control schemes to the Clean Air Act, summary judgment for respondent, coal-based power plant operator, is vacated as: 1) the Court of Appeals's reading of the 1980 Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations, intended to align them with New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), was inconsistent with their terms and effectively invalidated them; and 2) any such result must be shown to comport with the Clean Air Act's restrictions on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., 05-1074|05-1074|In a suit raising a pay discrimination claim under Title VII, a court of appeals' decision reversing a judgment and award in plaintiff's favor is affirmed where plaintiff's claim was untimely because a pay-setting decision is a discrete act that occurs at a particular point in time, and the later effects of past discrimination do not restart the clock for filing an EEOC charge.
Hinck v. US, 06-376|06-376|The Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for judicial review of a refusal by the Secretary of the Treasury to abate interest under section 6404(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Office of Sen. Mark Dayton v. Hanson, 06-618|06-618|In a suit arising from plaintiff's discharge from employment with former Senator Dayton brought against the Senator's office, invoking the district court's jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountability Act, defendant-office's appeal from a denial of its motion to dismiss based on a claim of immunity is dismissed as the Court lacked jurisdiction under section 412 of the Act, and certiorari is also denied.
Roper v. Weaver, 06-313|06-313|The writ of certiorari in a criminal matter, which raised an issue regarding whether a court of appeals properly applied the AEDPA's stringent standard of review in setting aside a capital sentence, is dismissed as improvidently granted, as the Court found it necessary to prevent three identically-situated litigants from being treated in a needlessly disparate manner, simply because the district court in this matter erroneously dismissed respondent's pre-AEDPA petition.
Los Angeles County v. Rettele, 06-605|06-605|In a 42 U.S.C. section 1983 suit brought by residents arising from a police search and detention under circumstances in which police obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but were unaware that the suspects being sought had previously moved out, a court of appeals' ruling against petitioners-officers is reversed where respondents' constitutional rights were not violated when petitioners ordered Caucasian respondents out of bed while they were naked, despite the fact that the suspects being sought were of a different race. The orders by the police to the occupants, in the context of the lawful search in this case, were permissible, and perhaps necessary, to protect the safety of the deputies and the residents' detention was not unreasonable either.
Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., 05-983|05-983|The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants parents independent, enforceable rights, which are not limited to procedural and reimbursement-related matters, but encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for their child.
Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 05-1126|05-1126|Stating a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made. An allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice. Under such plausibility standard, plaintiffs' putative class action at hand should be dismissed as it alleged only that major telecommunications providers engaged in certain parallel conduct unfavorable to competition, and did not make any independent allegation of actual agreement among the Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers for purposes of a conspiracy in restraint of trade.
Schriro v. Landrigan, 05-1575|05-1575|In habeas proceedings in a death penalty case, a circuit court's decision remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective assistance claim is reversed where the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant respondent an evidentiary hearing. Even assuming the truth of all the facts respondent sought to prove at the evidentiary hearing at issue, he still could not be granted federal habeas relief because state courts' factual determination that respondent would not have allowed counsel to present any mitigating evidence at sentencing was not an unreasonable determination of the facts under the AEDPA, and the mitigating evidence he sought to introduce would not have changed the result.
Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 05-908|05-908|In cases involving school districts that voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely upon race to determine which public schools certain children may attend, court of appeals' decisions upholding the plans are reversed as, under strict scrutiny, the districts failed to show that the interest they sought to achieve justified the means chosen.
Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 06-480|06-480|Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373, which makes it per se illegal under section 1 of the Sherman Act for a manufacturer and its distributor to agree on the minimum price the distributor can charge for the manufacturer's goods, is overruled. Vertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of reason.
Panetti v. Quarterman, 06-6407|06-6407|Denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought by a prisoner convicted and sentenced to death in a Texas state court is reversed where: 1) the Supreme Court has statutory authority to adjudicate the claims raised in the habeas application; 2) a state court failed to provide the procedures to which petitioner was entitled under the Constitution; and 3) a federal appellate court employed an improperly restrictive test when it considered petitioner's claim of incompetency on the merits.
Nat'l Ass'n of Homebuilders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 06-340, 06-549|06-549|Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act does not effectively operate as a tenth criterion on which the EPA's transfer of certain permitting powers to state authorities under section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act must be conditioned.
Morse v. Frederick, 06-278|06-278|"Schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use.

Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., 06-157|06-157|In an action brought claiming that conferences held as part of the President's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives program violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, a circuit court's decision reversing a dismissal of the action is reversed as the circuit court erred in holding that the plaintiffs had standing as taxpayers because the conferences at issue were paid for with money appropriated by Congress.
Wilkie v. Robbins, 06-219|06-219|In an action brought by the owner and operator of a commercial guest resort against officials of the Bureau of Land Management alleging harassment and intimidation aimed at extracting an easement across plaintiff's private property, denial of qualified immunity for defendants is reversed where the landowner has neither: 1) a private action for damages of the sort recognized in Bivens; nor 2) a claim against the officials in their individual capacities under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
Fed. Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 06-969, 06-970|06-970|In an action brought by a nonprofit corporation, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act section 203's prohibition on corporate election communications was unconstitutional as applied to certain ads, summary judgment for WRTL on its challenge is affirmed.

Rita v. US, 06-5754|06-5754|A court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence within the United States Sentencing Guidelines.
Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., 05-85|05-85|When a district court remands a properly removed case because it nonetheless lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the remand is covered by 28 U.S.C. section 1447(c), and is thus shielded from review by section 1447(d). Further, when a district court relies upon a ground that is colorably characterized as subject-matter jurisdiction, 1447(d)'s bar on appellate review applies. In an appeal arising from suits brought in California state courts against various companies in the California energy market, alleging that they had conspired to fix prices in violation of California law, a court of appeals judgment finding inter alia that it was not precluded from reviewing substantive issues of law that preceded a remand order is vacated in part, as section 1447(d) barred appellate consideration of petitioner's claim that it is a foreign state for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).
Brendlin v. California, 06-8120|06-8120|When police make a traffic stop, a passenger in the car, like the driver, is seized for Fourth Amendment purposes and thus may challenge the stop's constitutionality.

Bowles v. Russell, 06-5306|06-5306|"The timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement, and case law precedent setting forth the ""unique circumstances"" doctrine is overruled to the extent the cases purported to authorize an exception to a jurisdictional rule. In a habeas case in which a district court purported to extend petitioner's time for filing an appeal beyond the period allowed by statute, dismissal of petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed where petitioner's untimely notice, even though filed in reliance upon the district court's order, deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction."
