Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 06-9130|06-9130|"In a case involving the scope of 28 U.S.C. section 2680, which carves out certain exceptions to the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal employees, the Court rules that section 2680's broad phrase ""any other law enforcement officer"" covers all law enforcement officers, and not just law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws."
Knight v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 06-1286|06-1286|In the context of the Internal Revenue Code, under which individuals may subtract from their taxable income certain itemized deductions, but only to the extent the deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income, investment advisory fees are also subject to the 2% floor when incurred by a trust.
New York State Bd. of Elections v. Torres, 06-766|06-766|New York's system of choosing party nominees for the State Supreme Court, in which political parties select their nominees for Supreme Court Justice at a convention of delegates chosen by party members in a primary election, does not violate the First Amendment rights of prospective party candidates.
Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 06-43|06-43|In a class action brought by investors alleging losses after purchasing common stock, the investors sought to impose liability on entities who, acting both as customers and suppliers, agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors' company to mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial statement affecting the stock price. Dismissal of the action is affirmed as the Court rules that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 section 10(b) private right of action does not reach the customer/supplier companies because the investors did not rely upon their statements or representations.
John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. US, 06-1164|06-1164|The special statute of limitations governing the Court of Federal Claims requires sua sponte consideration of the timeliness of a lawsuit filed in that court, despite the government's waiver of the issue.
Arave v. Hoffman, 07-110|07-110|In habeas corpus proceedings brought by an individual convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, a circuit court judgment granting habeas relief on a claim that he received ineffective assistance during plea negotiations is vacated as petitioner now abandoned the claim, and it was moot.
Wright v. Van Patten, 07-212|07-212|Grant of habeas relief from a conviction and sentence for first-degree reckless homicide is reversed where, contrary to the ruling below, no clearly established law contrary to the state court's conclusion justified collateral relief with regard to a claim that petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his participation in a plea hearing by speaker phone.
Fed. Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 06-1322|06-1322|"In an Age Discrimination in Employment Act case involving the question of whether Fed Ex courier's filing of an intake questionnaire and affidavit with the EEOC was a ""charge"" under the Act so as to allow the filing of a civil action, the Court defers to the EEOC's interpretation for the proper test for determining whether a filing is a charge. Specifically, in addition to the information required by the implementing regulations, if a filing is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee. In this case, the filings constituted such a charge and the circuit court correctly reversed dismissal of the case."
Sprint/United Mgmt. Co. v. Mendelsohn, 06-1221|06-1221|In an age discrimination case brought under 29 U. S. C. section 621 et seq., in which the district court excluded testimony by nonparties alleging discrimination at the hands of supervisors of defendant-company who played no role in the adverse employment decision challenged by plaintiff, a court of appeals decision remanding the matter with instructions to admit the challenged testimony is vacated and remanded where: 1) Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 403 do not make such evidence per se admissible or per se inadmissible; and 2) the circuit court erred in conducting its own analysis of the relevant factors under the Rules, as the inquiry required by those Rules was within the province of the district court in the first instance.
LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & Assocs., Inc., 06-856|06-856|Although section 502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries, that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant's individual account.
Danforth v. Minnesota, 06-8273|06-8273|"Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), limits the kinds of constitutional violations that will entitle an individual to federal habeas corpus relief, but does not in any way limit the authority of a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed ""nonretroactive"" under Teague."
Preston v. Ferrer, 06-1463|06-1463|When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative, are superseded by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). In a dispute involving the question of whether an entertainment industry attorney acted as an unlicensed talent agent in violation of California's Talent Agencies Act, or as a personal manager not governed by the TAA, judgment for respondent-talent granting jurisdiction to the state Labor Commissioner is reversed and remanded.
Riegel v. Medtronic, 06-179|06-179|The pre-emption clause enacted in the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) bars common-law claims challenging the safety or effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Ass'n, 06-457|06-457|"A federal statute that prohibits states from enacting any law ""related to"" a motor carrier ""price, route, or service"" preempts two provisions of a Maine tobacco law, which regulate the delivery of tobacco to customers within the state."
Medellin v. Texas, 06-984|06-984|Neither an International Court of Justice case, Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. 12, nor a memorandum issued by the President of the United States constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions. Consequently, dismissal of a habeas petition in a death penalty case raising a claim that petitioner was not informed of his Vienna Convention right to notify the Mexican consulate of his detention is affirmed.
Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 06-989|06-989|The statutory grounds provided by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards are exclusive, as opposed to mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement. In a dispute between a commercial landlord and tenant-manufacturer, involving arbitration of the applicability of a lease indemnification provision for failure to comply with environmental laws, the Ninth Circuit's judgment is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.
Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 06-713, 06-730|06-730|Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's holding below, a 2004 initiative passed by Washington voters changing the state's primary election system is facially constitutional. The initiative, I-872, provided that: 1) candidates must be identified on the primary ballot by their self-designated party preference; 2) voters may vote for any candidate; and 3) the two top votegetters for each office, regardless of party preference, advance to the general election.
Boulware v. US, 06-1509|06-1509|In the context of sections of the Internal Revenue Code that set the conditions for treating certain corporate distributions as returns of capital, nontaxable to the recipient, a distributee accused of criminal tax evasion may claim return-of-capital treatment without producing evidence that either he or the corporation intended a return of capital when the distribution occurred.
Warner-Lambert Co. v. Kent, 06-1498|06-1498|In a one-line, per curiam opinion, the judgment below is affirmed by an equally divided Court. In a case involving Michigan legislation which immunized drugmakers from products liability claims so long as the FDA approved the pharmaceutical product at issue, the circuit court had held that a fraud exception to the immunity legislation was not prohibited through federal preemption.
Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., 07-21, 07-25|07-25|In a suit challenging the constitutionality of an Indiana law requiring citizens voting in person to present photo identification issued by the government, a judgment upholding the law is affirmed where the evidence in the record was not sufficient to support a facial attack on the validity of the entire statute.
Virginia v. Moore, 06-1082|06-1082|In a case raising the issue of whether a police officer violates the Fourth Amendment by making an arrest based on probable cause but prohibited by state law, the Supreme Court rules that warrantless arrests for crimes committed in the presence of an arresting officer are reasonable under the Constitution, and that while states are free to regulate such arrests however they desire, state restrictions do not alter the Fourth Amendment's protections.
Baze v. Rees, 07-5439|07-5439|Kentucky's lethal injection protocol used as its method of execution does not violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments. (Five concurring opinions and dissent)
Burgess v. US, 06-11429|06-11429|"The term ""felony drug offense"" contained in the Controlled Substances Act's (CSA), 21 U.S.C. section 841(b)(1)(A), provision for a 20-year minimum sentence, is defined exclusively by section 802(44) and does not incorporate section 802(13)'s definition of ""felony."" Consequently, a state drug offense punishable by more than one year qualifies as a ""felony drug offense,"" even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor."
Begay v. US, 06-11543|06-11543|"Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico's criminal statutes, is not a ""violent felony"" as the term is defined in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)."

US v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., 07-308|07-308|The plain language of 26 U.S.C. sections 7422(a) and 6511 requires a taxpayer seeking a refund for a tax assessed in violation of the Export Clause, just as for any other unlawfully assessed tax, to file a timely administrative refund claim before bringing suit against the government.
US v. Ressam, 07-455|07-455|"A circuit court's decision setting aside defendant's conviction on a count of carrying an explosive ""during the commission of"" a felony is reversed where, under a natural reading of 18 U.S.C. section 844(h)(2), since defendant was carrying explosives when he feloniously made a false statement to a customs official, he was carrying them ""during"" the commission of that felony. Contrary to the court of appeals' ruling, there is no requirement of a relationship between possession of the item in question and the underlying felony."
US v. Williams, 06-694|06-694|"A statute criminalizing, in certain specified circumstances, the pandering or solicitation of child pornography is neither overbroad under the First Amendment nor impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause.  The Court rejects concerns that virtual child pornography or sex between youthful-looking adult actors might be covered by the term ""simulated sexual intercourse."""
US v. Rodriquez, 06-1646|06-1646|"A sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is reversed where, for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), the ""maximum term of imprisonment . . . prescribed by law"" for the state drug convictions at issue was a 10-year maximum set by the applicable state recidivist provision. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that ""the maximum term of imprisonment ... prescribed by law"" must be determined without taking recidivist enhancements into account."
Dep't of Revenue of Kentucky v. Davis, 06-666|06-666|In the context of states/subdivisions' exemption of interest on their own bonds from their state income taxes, which are imposed on bond interest from other states, the Court rules that Kentucky's version of such a differential tax scheme does not offend the Commerce Clause.
Dist. of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290|07-290|The District of Columbia's prohibition on the possession of usable handguns in the home violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution, as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense. The Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.
Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 07219.html|07219.html|In an action brought against Exxon for economic losses resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, a circuit court ruling remitting the punitive damages award to $2.5 billion is vacated and remanded for further reduction where: 1) the Court was equally divided on the question of whether a shipowner may be liable for punitive damages without acquiescence in the actions causing harm, and thus the circuit court's opinion is undisturbed on the issue; 2) federal statutory law does not bar a punitive award on top of damages for economic loss; but 3) the award in this case should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages, or approximately $500 million.

Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 06-923|06-923|The Supreme Court rules that the dual role of ERISA plan administrators that both determine whether an employee is eligible for benefits, and pay benefits out of their own pockets, creates a conflict of interest. Thus, a reviewing court should consider such conflict as a factor in determining whether a plan administrator has abused its discretion in denying benefits, and the significance of the factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.
Boumediene v. Bush, 06-1195, 06-1196|06-1196|In habeas proceedings brought by aliens detained at Guantanamo after being captured in Afghanistan or elsewhere abroad and designated enemy combatants by tribunals, the Court rules that petitioners have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus. The procedures for review of the detainees' status provided by the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 are not an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus, and consequently, section 7 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.
Munaf v. Geren, 06-1666|06-1666|In cases concerning the availability of habeas corpus relief arising from an international coalition force's detention of American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and were alleged to have committed crimes there, the Court rules that the habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command, even when those forces are acting as part of a multinational coalition. However, district courts may not exercise their habeas jurisdiction to enjoin the United States from transferring individuals alleged to have committed crimes and detained within the territory of a foreign sovereign to that sovereign's government for criminal prosecution.

Republic of the Philippines v. Pimentel, 06-1204|06-1204|In an interpleader action commenced to determine the ownership of property allegedly stolen by Ferdinand Marcos when he was the President of the Republic of the Philippines, a circuit court's decision finding that the action could proceed without the Republic of the Philippines and a Philippine Commission as parties, which had successfully asserted sovereign immunity and been dismissed from the action, is reversed where: 1) the circuit court gave insufficient weight to the foreign sovereign status of those two parties; and 2) it further erred in reaching and discounting the merits of their claims.

Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Elecs., Inc., 06-937|06-937|In a patent case involving computer technology patents, a circuit court's ruling in favor of plaintiff-LG Electronics and against defendants-computer manufacturers is reversed where: 1) contrary to the holding below, the exhaustion doctrine applies to method patents; and 2) because a license agreement authorized the sale of components that substantially embodied the patents in suit, the sale exhausted the patents.

Instead, a plaintiff asserting such a claim must prove that the defendant intended that the false record or statement be material to the government's decision to pay or approve the false claim.
