Goldstein, 07-854|07-854|In the context of 42 U.S.C. section 1983 civil rights suits, a prosecutor's absolute immunity extends to claims that the prosecution failed to disclose impeachment material due to failure to: 1) properly train prosecutors; 2) properly supervise prosecutors; or 3) establish an information system containing potential impeachment material about informants.
Nelson v. US, 08-5657|08-5657|The Court re-emphasizes that its cases do not allow a sentencing court (as opposed to an appellate court) to presume that a sentence within the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range is reasonable. Here, the sentencing court clearly applied a presumption of reasonableness to petitioner's Guidelines range, and the circuit court erred in affirming the sentence.
Arizona v. Johnson, 07-1122|07-1122|"In a case involving the authority of police officers to ""stop and frisk"" a passenger in a motor vehicle after a traffic stop, the Court rules that: 1) the first condition of Terry v. Ohio, i.e. a lawful investigatory stop, is met whenever it is lawful for police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into a vehicular violation; 2) police need not have, in addition, cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity; and 3) to justify a pat-down of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop, however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous."

Locke v. Karass, 07-610|07-610|In a case involving circumstances where a local union charges nonmembers a service fee that (among other things) reflects an affiliation fee that the local union pays to its national union organization, a portion of which the national union uses to pay for litigation expenses incurred in large part on behalf of other local units, the Supreme Court rules that the Constitution permits including such an element in the local's charge to nonmembers as long as: 1) the subject matter of the extra-local litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if the litigation were local; and 2) the litigation charge is reciprocal in nature.

Rivera v. Illinois, 07-9995|07-9995|Provided that all jurors seated in a criminal case are qualified and unbiased, the Due Process Clause does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because of the trial court's good-faith error in denying the defendant's peremptory challenge to a juror.

AT&T Corp. v. Hulteen, 07-543|07-543|In a Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) challenge to Defendant's pension calculation system, summary judgment for Plaintiff is reversed where an employer does not necessarily violate the PDA when it pays pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only pre-PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for medical leave generally.

Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 08-678|08-678|In an unlawful termination suit wherein defendant-employer appealed from an order granting plaintiff's motion to compel the production of documents that, according to defendant, were protected by the attorney-client privilege, dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed where disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.
