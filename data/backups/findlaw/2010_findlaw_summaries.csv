Hemi Group, LLC v. City of N.Y., 08-969| 08-969|In an action by New York City against an online cigarette seller under the civil enforcement provision of RICO, alleging that defendant's failure to file Jenkins Act reports with New York State constituted mail and wire fraud, the court of appeals' judgment reversing the dismissal of the complaint is reversed where plaintiff failed to satisfy RICO's proximate cause requirement because defendant's obligation was to file Jenkins Act reports with the state, not the city, and the city's harm of lost tax revenue was directly caused by cigarette customers, not defendant.
Citizens United v. FEC, 08-205| 08-205|"The Court rules that the government may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether. Specifically, in an action brought by a nonprofit corporation, the makers of a documentary critical of Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy, challenging the constitutionality of a federal law prohibiting corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech that was an ""electioneering communication"" or for speech that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a candidate, a denial of a preliminary injunction for plaintiff is reversed in part where Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990), is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the government to limit corporate independent expenditures. Hence, the part of McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93 (2007), that upheld the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act section 203's extension of section 441b's restrictions on independent corporate expenditures is also overruled. However, the order is affirmed in part where BCRA sections 201 and 311 were valid as applied to the ads for the documentary and to the movie itself because disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak, but they imposed no ceiling on campaign-related activities, or prevented anyone from speaking."
Wood v. Allen, 08-9156| 08-9156|In capital habeas proceedings, a court of appeals' reversal of a grant of petitioner's petition is affirmed where a state court's conclusion that defense counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or present evidence of petitioner's mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.
Kucana v. Holder, 08-911| 08-911|In a petition for review of the BIA's denial of petitioner's motion to reopen his removal proceedings, the court of appeals' denial of the petition is reversed where 8 U.S.C. section 1252(a)(2)(B)'s proscription of judicial review applies only to Attorney General determinations made discretionary by statute, not to determinations declared discretionary by the Attorney General himself through regulation.
South Carolina v. N. Carolina, 138| 138|In an original jurisdiction action by South Carolina seeking an equitable apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River's waters, the special master's grant of three nonparties' motions to intervene is affirmed in part as to two of them where: 1) the Catawba River Water Supply Project was properly permitted to intervene because it showed a compelling interest in protecting the viability of its operations, which were premised on a fine balance between the joint venture's two participating counties; and 2) Duke Energy was also properly allowed to intervene because it was likely that any equitable apportionment of the river would need to take into account the amount of water that Duke Energy needed to sustain its operations.  However, the order is reversed in part where the interest of Charlotte, North Carolina was not sufficiently unique and would be properly represented by North Carolina.
Wellons v. Hall, 09-5731| 09-5731|In a capital habeas matter, the petition for certiorari is granted and the court of appeals' order is vacated and remanded where the court of appeals incorrectly held that the habeas petition, which claimed that petitioner was denied discovery into the issue of whether there had been improper communications between the judge and jury, was procedurally barred based on an insufficient record, contrary to Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. ___ (2009).
Presley v. Georgia, 09-5270| 09-5270|In a drug trafficking prosecution, the state supreme court's affirmance of defendant's conviction is reversed where the trial court failed to consider all reasonable alternatives to closure when it excluded defendant's uncle from the voir dire proceedings, in violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.
Hollingsworth v. Perry, 09A648| 09A648|In defendant-intervenors' application for a stay of an order of the district court in the California Proposition 8 trial permitting the trial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to a number of federal courthouses around the country, the stay is granted where the district court failed to give appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment before modifying a local rule to permit the broadcast, as required by 28 U.S.C. section 2071(b).
Hollingsworth v. Perry, 09A648| 09A648|In defendant-intervenors' application for a stay of an order of the district court in the California Proposition 8 trial permitting the trial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to a number of federal courthouses around the country, the stay is granted where the district court failed to give appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment before modifying a local rule to permit the broadcast, as required by 28 U.S.C. section 2071(b).
NRG Power Mktg., LLC v. Maine Pub. Utils. Comm., 08-674| 08-674|In a petition for review of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) approval of a settlement agreement establishing rate-setting mechanisms for the sale of energy capacity, circuit court's partial grant of the petition is reversed where: 1) the Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks FERC investigation, and the presumption is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties; and 2) contrary to the ruling below, the Mobile-Sierra presumption applies when a rate challenge is brought by a non-contracting third party.
Hollingsworth v. Perry, 09A648| 09A648|In defendant-intervenors' application for a stay of an order of the district court in the California Proposition 8 trial permitting the trial to be broadcast live via streaming audio and video to a number of federal courthouses around the country, the stay is granted where the district court failed to give appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment before modifying a local rule to permit the broadcast, as required by 28 U.S.C. section 2071(b).
Smith v. Spisak, 08-724| 08-724|In capital habeas proceedings, a grant of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed where a state court's rejection of claimed errors regarding jury instructions, verdict forms and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel, was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as: 1) the jury instructions in the penalty phase made clear that, to recommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously; and 2) even assuming that defense counsel's closing argument was inadequate in the respects claimed by petitioner, there was no reasonable probability that a better closing argument without such defects would have made a significant difference.
McDaniel v. Brown, 08-559| 08-559|In habeas proceedings arising from a rape conviction, a circuit court of appeals' order affirming the grant of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed where: 1) the court of appeals' analysis failed to preserve the factfinder's role as weigher of the evidence by reviewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and it erred in finding a state court's resolution of petitioner's claim to be objectively unreasonable; and 2) petitioner forfeited his claim that a prosecution expert incorrectly described the statistical implications of certain DNA evidence.
Maryland v. Shatzer, 08-680| 08-680|In a sexual child abuse prosecution, the state court of appeals' reversal of defendant's conviction is reversed where defendant experienced a break in Miranda custody lasting more than two weeks between first and second attempts at interrogation, and thus Edwards did not mandate suppression of defendant's statements during the second interrogation.
Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 08-1107| 08-1107|"In a wage and hour action, the court of appeals' affirmance of the district court's order remanding the case to state court is vacated and remanded where the Court returned to the ""nerve center"" approach in determining a corporation's citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes, under which ""principal place of business"" is best read as referring to the place where a corporation's officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities."
Florida v. Powell, 08-1175| 08-1175|"In a state prosecution for possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, a reversal of defendant's conviction on Miranda grounds is reversed where the police satisfied Miranda's requirements by informing defendant that he had ""the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of their questions,"" and that he had ""the right to use any of his rights at any time he wanted during the interview."""
Thaler v. Haynes, 09-273| 09-273|In a capital habeas matter, the court of appeals' reversal of the denial of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed and the matter remanded where clearly established law did not provide that a demeanor-based explanation for a peremptory challenge, in response to a Batson claim, must be rejected unless the judge personally observed and recalled the relevant aspect of the prospective juror's demeanor.
Wilkins v. Gaddy, 08-10914| 08-10914|"In a 42 U.S.C. section 1983 action alleging excessive force by a correctional officer, a court of appeals' affirmance of dismissal of the complaint is reversed where the district court's approach (based on its determination that plaintiff's injuries were ""de minimis"") was at odds with precedent directing it to decide excessive force claims based on the nature of the force, rather than the extent of the injury."
Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 08-1008| 08-1008|"In a class action seeking to recover interest due under New York law on plaintiff's insurance claim, the Second Circuit's order affirming the district court's dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction based on a New York law precluding class actions to recover a ""penalty"" such as statutory interest is reversed where Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) answered the question in dispute -- whether plaintiff's suit may proceed as a class action -- when it stated that ""[a] class action may be maintained"" if certain conditions are met. Since N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. section 901(b) attempted to answer the same question, stating that plaintiff's suit ""may not be maintained as a class action"" because of the relief it sought, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is ultra vires."
Padilla v. Kentucky, 08-651| 08-651|In postconviction proceedings arising from a drug distribution prosecution, after which petitioner faced deportation based on his guilty plea and claimed that his counsel failed to advise him of the consequences of the plea, denial of postconviction relief is reversed and remanded where, because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation, petitioner sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.
Berghuis v. Smith, 08-1402| 08-1402|"In habeas proceedings brought by an individual convicted of second degree murder by an all-white jury, the Sixth Circuit's reversal of the denial of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed where Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), hardly established -- much less ""clearly"" so -- that petitioner was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community, because petitioner's evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude that the county's juror assignment order had any significant effect on the representation of African-Americans in the venire."
Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. US ex rel. Wilson, 08-304| 08-304|"In an action claiming that county conservation districts and local and federal officials knowingly submitted false payment claims to the U.S. in violation of the False Claims Act, the Fourth Circuit's reversal of the district court's dismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction is reversed where the reference to ""administrative"" reports, audits, and investigations contained in 31 U.S.C. section 3730(e)(4)(A) (the FCA's public disclosure bar) encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources, as well as federal sources."
Jones v. Harris Assocs. L.P., 08-586| 08-586|In an action by shareholders in mutual funds managed by defendant investment adviser alleging that defendant violated section 36(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Seventh Circuit's order affirming the district court on alternative grounds is vacated and remanded where, based on section 36(b)'s terms and the role that a shareholder action for breach of the investment adviser's fiduciary duty plays in the Act's overall structure, Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F. 2d 923 (2d Cir. 1982), applied the correct standard to section 36(b) claims.  More specifically, to be guilty of a violation of section 36(b), an adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's length bargaining.
United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, 08-1134| 08-1134|In an appeal from a bankruptcy court order in a Chapter 13 proceeding, enforcing the confirmation of a student loan debtor's plan and directing creditors to cease any collection efforts, the Ninth Circuit's judgment reversing a district court's order in favor of student loan creditor is affirmed where: 1) creditor's actual notice of the filing and contents of the debtor's plan more than satisfied its due process rights, and thus debtor's failure to make the required service did not entitle creditor to relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4); 2) although the bankruptcy court's failure to find undue hardship in this case was a legal error, the confirmation order was enforceable and binding on creditor because it had actual notice of the error and failed to object or timely appeal; but 3) the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that bankruptcy courts must confirm a plan proposing the discharge of a student loan debt without an undue hardship determination in an adversary proceeding unless the creditor timely raises a specific objection.
Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. US, 08-1119| 08-1119|"In an action by a law firm seeking declaratory relief, arguing that plaintiff was not bound by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act's (BAPCPA) debt relief agency provisions and therefore could freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertisements, the Eighth Circuit's order rejecting the district court's conclusion that attorneys are not ""debt relief agencies"" under BAPCPA, upholding application of BAPCPA's disclosure requirements to attorneys, and finding BAPCPA section 526(a)(4) unconstitutional, is affirmed in part where: 1) attorneys who provided bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons were debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA; and 2) BAPCPA section 528's requirements were reasonably related to the government's interest in preventing consumer deception.  However, the court of appeals' order is reversed in part where BAPCPA section 526(a)(4) prohibited a debt relief agency only from advising a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor was filing for bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose."

Bloate v. US, 08-728| 08-728|In a drug and firearm possession prosecution, the Eighth Circuit's order affirming the district court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on Speedy Trial Act grounds is reversed where the time granted to prepare pretrial motions was not automatically excludable from the 70-day limit under 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h)(1), and such time may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance based on appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).
Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 08-103| 08-103|In a class action alleging copyright infringement, a circuit court's ruling vacating a settlement class certification order for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reversed where 17 U.S.C. section 411(a)'s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a copyright infringement claim, but a copyright holder's failure to comply with that requirement does not restrict a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction over infringement claims involving unregistered works.
Mac's Shell Serv., Inc. v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 08-240| 08-240|In an action under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (Act) by service station franchisees, alleging that a petroleum franchisor, Shell, and its assignee had constructively terminated their franchises and constructively failed to renew their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for many of them, a circuit court's order partially affirming judgment for plaintiffs is affirmed in part where a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim under the Act.  However, the court of appeals' order is reversed in part where a franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under the Act if the franchisor's allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise.
Johnson v. US, 08-6925| 08-6925|A circuit court's judgment upholding a sentence for possession of ammunition by a convicted felon, which was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act, is reversed where the Florida felony offense of battery by actually and intentionally touching another person does not have as an element the use of physical force against the person of another, and thus does not constitute a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1).
Salazar v. Buono, 08-472| 08-472|"In an action involving an underlying Establishment Clause challenge to a Latin cross placed on federal land by members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to honor American soldiers who died in World War I, the Ninth Circuit's order precluding the government from transferring the cross and the land on which it stood to a private party in order to comply with a prior injunction is reversed and the matter remanded where: 1) plaintiff had standing to maintain the instant action because a party that obtains a judgment in its favor acquires a ""judicially cognizable"" interest in ensuring compliance with that judgment; but 2) the district court erred in enjoining the government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect plaintiff's rights under the 2002 injunction."
Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l. Corp., 08-1198| 08-1198|"In an antitrust class action, the Second Circuit's reversal of the district court's order vacating an arbitration panel's order allowing for class arbitration of the dispute is reversed where imposing class arbitration on parties who had not agreed to authorize class arbitration was inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, and the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration despite the parties' stipulation that they had reached ""no agreement"" on that issue."
Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 08-905| 08-905|In a 2003 securities fraud class action alleging that Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart-attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx, the Third Circuit's reversal of the district court's dismissal of the complaint as untimely is affirmed where: 1) the limitations period in section 1658(b)(1) began to run once the plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the facts constituting the violation whichever came first; and 2) prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck did not show that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, the facts constituting the violation.
Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 08-1200| 08-1200|In an action contending that, by sending a notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writing, defendant law firm violated section 1692g(a) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which governed the contents of notices to debtors, the Sixth Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment for defendant is reversed where the bona fide error defense in section 1692k(c) did not apply to a violation resulting from a debt collector's mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA.
Perdue v. Kenny A., 08-970| 08-970|In a civil rights action alleging deficiencies in the Georgia foster care system, the district court's award of attorney's fees to plaintiffs' counsel is reversed where the calculation of an attorney's fee based on a lodestar may be increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary circumstances.

US v. Stevens, 08-769| 08-769|The Third Circuit's reversal of defendant's conviction under 18 U.S.C. section 48 for selling videos depicting dogfighting is affirmed where section 48 was substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment, because section 48 explicitly regulated expression based on content and was thus presumptively invalid.
American Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League, 08-661| 08-661|In an antitrust action challenging the NFL's grant to Reebok of an exclusive license to create apparel incorporating the NFL's intellectual property, the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment for defendants is reversed where the alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property constituted concerted action that was not categorically beyond the coverage of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
Lewis v. Chicago, 08-974| 08-974|In a Title VII action challenging Chicago's practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above on a written examination because of its disparate impact on African-Americans, the Seventh Circuit's reversal of judgment for plaintiff is reversed where a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice may assert a disparate impact claim in a timely charge challenging the employer's later application of that practice as long as he alleges each of the elements of a disparate impact claim.
Jefferson v. Upton, 09-8852| 09-8852|In a capital habeas matter, the Eleventh Circuit's affirmance of the denial of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed where the court of appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions to the presumption of correctness given to state court factual findings under 28 U.S.C. sections 2254(d)(1)-(8).
Hardt v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co., 09-448| 09-448|In an action alleging that defendant violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits claim, the Fourth Circuit's order vacating the district court's award of attorney's fees to plaintiff is reversed where 1) a fee claimant need not be a -prevailing party- to be eligible for an attorney-s fees award under 29 U.S.C. section 1132(g)(1); and 2) a court may award fees and costs under sectionb 1132(g)(1), as long as the fee claimant has achieved some degree of success on the merits.
US v. Marcus, 08-1341| 08-1341|The Second Circuit's reversal of defendant's forced labor and sex trafficking conviction is reversed where the Second Circuit-s plain error standard, under which a retrial was necessary whenever there was any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on defendant's conduct prior to the enactment of the statute under which he was charged, was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's approach to plain error, under which 1) the error must affect the appellant-s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and 2) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
US v. O'Brien, 08-1569| 08-1569|The First Circuit's affirmance of defendant's sentence for using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence is affirmed where the fact that the firearm was a machine gun was an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at sentencing.
Abbott v. Abbott, 08-645| 08-645|In a petition seeking an order requiring petitioner's son's return to Chile under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), the Fifth Circuit's affirmance of the district court's denial of the petition is reversed where petitioner had a right of custody under the Convention by reason of that parent's ne exeat right under Chilean law, because: 1) Chilean law determined the content of petitioner's right, while the Convention's text and structure resolved whether that right was a right of custody; 2) that the child was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of a right of custody was shown by the Convention's text, by the U.S. State Department's views, by contracting states' court decisions, and by the Convention's purposes; and 3) while a parent possessing a ne exeat right had a right of custody and could seek a return remedy, return could not automatically be ordered if the abducting parent could establish the applicability of a Convention exception.
Hui v. Castaneda, 08-1529| 08-1529|In an action raising medical negligence claims against the U.S. under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and the Bivens doctrine, a denial of defendants' motion to dismiss the Bivens claims is reversed where the immunity provided by 42 U.S.C. section 233(a) precludes Bivens actions against individual Public Health Service officers or employees for harms arising out of constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of their office or employment.
Renico v. Lett, 09-338| 09-338|In a murder prosecution, a grant of petitioner's habeas petition is reversed where it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial, and thus the state court's decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under a proper application of the AEDPA's deferential standard of review.
Sears v. Upton, 09–8854| 09–8854|"In a capital murder prosecution, the Georgia Supreme Court's affirmance of a denial of post-conviction relief is vacated where the state post-conviction trial court failed to apply the correct prejudice inquiry the Court has established for evaluating defendant's ineffective assistance claim, because: 1) the court curtailed a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel's mitigation theory; and 2) the Court never limited the prejudice inquiry under Strickland to cases in which there was only ""little or no mitigation evidence"" presented."
McDonald v. City of Chicago, 08-1521| 08-1521|In an action against the City of Chicago alleging that the City's handgun ban left plaintiffs vulnerable to criminals, judgment for defendants is reversed where the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, recognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense.
Free Enterprise Fund v. Pub. Co. Acctg. Oversight Bd., 08–861| 08–861|In an action against the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and its members, seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board was unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers, the D.C. Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment for defendants is affirmed in part where the Board’s appointment was consistent with the Appointments Clause.  However, the judgment is reversed in part where 1) the dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitution’s separation of powers; and 2) the unconstitutional tenure provisions were severable from the remainder of the statute.
Bilski v. Kappos, 08–964| 08–964|"In a patent application seeking protection for a claimed invention explaining how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy market could protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes, the denial of the application is affirmed where: 1) the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. section 101; 2) Section 101 precluded a reading of the term ""process"" that would categorically exclude business methods; and 3) even though petitioners' application was not categorically outside of section 101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejected today, that did not mean it was a ""process"" under section 101."
Christian Legal Soc. v. Martinez, 08–1371| 08–1371|"In an action against Hastings College of Law, a public law school, alleging that   Hastings' refusal to grant a Christian group ""Registered Student Organization"" status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion, the Ninth Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment for defendant is affirmed where: 1) the Court considered only whether a public institution's conditioning access to a student organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violated the Constitution; and 2) the all-comers policy was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum."
Morrison v. Nat'l Australia Bank Ltd., 08-1191| 08-1191|In a securities fraud action by Australian citizens claiming that defendant corporation and its officers manipulated financial models to make the company-s mortgage-servicing rights appear more valuable than they really were, the Second Circuit's affirmance of the dismissal of the action is affirmed where 1) the Second Circuit erred in considering Securities and Exchange Act section 10(b)-s extraterritorial reach to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, thus allowing dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1); and 2) section 10(b) did not provide a cause of action to foreign plaintiffs suing foreign and American defendants for misconduct in connection with securities traded on foreign exchanges.
Granite Rock Co. v. Int'l. Brotherhood of Teamsters, 08-1214| 08-1214|In an action against a labor union by an employer, invoking federal jurisdiction under section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), seeking strike-related damages for the unions' alleged breach of contract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the Ninth Circuit's partial affirmance of the district court's order dismissing plaintiff's tortious interference claims and denying defendant's separate motion to send the parties' dispute over the CBA's ratification date to arbitration is affirmed in part where the Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new federal common-law cause of action under LMRA section 301(a) for defendant's alleged tortious interference with the CBA.  However, the judgment is reversed in part where the parties' dispute over the CBA's ratification date was a matter for the district court, not an arbitrator, to resolve.
Skilling v. US, 08-1394| 08-1394|"The Fifth Circuit's affirmance of defendant Jeffrey Skilling's honest-services fraud conviction is affirmed in part where pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial, and he did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  However, the judgment is vacated in part where 18 U.S.C. section 1346, which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of ""the intangible right of honest services,"" was properly confined to cover only bribery and kickback schemes, and Skilling's alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback."
Magwood v.

Black v. US, 08-876| 08-876|The Seventh Circuit's affirmance of defendants' honest-services mail fraud convictions is vacated where: 1) per the ruling today in Skilling v. US, the honest-services component of the federal mail-fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. section 1346, criminalizes only schemes to defraud that involved bribes or kickbacks, and that holding renders the honest-services instructions given in this case incorrect; and 2) by properly objecting to the honest-services jury instructions at trial, defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal, and they did not forfeit that right by declining to acquiesce in the government-proposed special-verdict forms.

Further, defendants' challenge to their section 924(c) sentences, resting their objections on the ""except"" clause prefacing section 924(c)(1)(A) are rejected as there is strong contextual support for the view that the ""except"" clause was intended to simply clarify section 924(c), and it applies only when a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided."
