Ryburn v. Huff, 11-208| 11-208|In an action under 42 USC section 1983 alleging that police officers violated the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home without a warrant, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit disagreeing with the district court’s conclusion that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity is reversed, where reasonable police officers could have come to the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment permitted them to enter the plaintiffs' residence if there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that violence was imminent, and a reasonable officer could have come to such a conclusion based on the facts as found by the district court.
Reynolds v. US, 10-6549| 10-6549|In a prosecution for failure to register as a sex offender under the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act in which the Third Circuit concluded that the Act’s registration requirements applied to pre-Act offenders even in the absence of a rule by the Attorney General, judgment is reversed, as the Act’s registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General so specifies, so that whether an interim rule promulgated by the Attorney General set forth a valid specification was a relevant issue.
US v. Jones, 10-1259| 10-1259|In a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturning conviction is affirmed, as: 1) the government’s attachment of a global-positioning system (GPS) device to a vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment; and 2) the government forfeited the argument that the search of the vehicle in this case was reasonable.
National Meat Association v. Harris, 10-224| 10-224|In a suit by a trade association representing meatpackers and processors to enjoin enforcement of a California statute affecting swine slaughterhouses, judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed and the case remanded for entry of an injunction, where the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) expressly preempts the California statute because the FMIA regulates slaughterhouses’ handling and treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their delivery through the end of the meat production process, and the California statute endeavors to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, except by imposing different requirements.
Perry v. Perez, 11-713| 11-713|In cases challenging redistricting plans in Texas for race discrimination under the federal Constitution and section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, orders of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas implementing interim electoral district maps for the 2012 Texas elections are vacated and cases are remanded for further proceedings, where the district court erred to the extent it exceeded its mission to draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept of the collective public good for the Texas Legislature’s determination of which policies serve the interests of the citizens of Texas.
Maples v. Thomas, 10-63| 10-63|Judgment denying a state prisoner's petition for federal habeas corpus relief is reversed and the case is remanded, where: 1) there was cause to excuse prisoner's procedural default in failing to timely file an appeal of the denial of his petition for postconviction relief in state court, where through no fault of his own, he lost the assistance of any authorized attorney during the appeal period and he had no reason to suspect that he had been reduced to pro se status; and 2) neither the district court nor the Eleventh Circuit reached the question of prejudice, so that it remained open for decision on remand.
Golan v. Holder, 10-545| 10-545|In a suit by orchestra conductors, musicians, publishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to literary and artistic works removed from the public domain by section 514 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the Tenth Circuit's reversal of a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs is affirmed, as: 1) section 514 does not exceed Congress’s authority under the Copyright Clause; and 2) the First Amendment does not inhibit the restoration of foreign works to copyright protection by section 514.
Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 10-1195| 10-1195|In a damages action brought in federal district court, alleging that the respondent, seeking to collect a debt, violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call the plaintiff’s cellular phone without his consent, the dismissal of the complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction is reversed, as the claim arose under federal law, and the TCPA's permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does not deprive the US district courts of federal-question jurisdiction under 28 USC section 1331.
Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, 10-507| 10-507|In an appeal from a judgment of the appeals court vacating an administrative dismissal of respondent's Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) claim for benefits as a surviving spouse, judgment is affirmed where a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.
Perry v. New Hampshire, 10-8974| 10-8974|In an appeal from a judgment of the State Supreme Court upholding the conviction of defendant for theft by unauthorized taking, judgment is affirmed where the Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement.
Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 10-553| 10-553|"In an appeal from a judgment of the appeals court vacating the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's ADA action on the grounds that the defendant was shielded by the ""ministerial exception,"" judgment is reversed where: 1) the ministerial exception, derived from the First Amendment, bars employment discrimination suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches; and 2) plaintiff was a minister within the meaning of the exception."
Smith v. Cain, 10-8145| 10-8145|In an appeal from the denial of habeas relief from defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, judgment is reversed where the prosecutor's failure to disclose contradictory statements of the sole eyewitness, whose testimony formed the basis of defendant's conviction, was a Brady violation because the statements are material where there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.
CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 10-948| 10-948|In an appeal from the judgment of the appeals court upholding the trial court's denial of petitioner's motion to compel arbitration of respondents' Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) action under an arbitration provision, judgment is reversed where, because the CROA is silent on whether such claims can proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires that the arbitration agreement to be enforced.
Minneci v. Pollard, 10-1104| 10-1104|In an appeal from a judgment of the appeals court vacating the trial court's dismissal of petitioner's Bivens claim against employees at a privately run federal prison in California for deprivation of adequate medical care, judgment is reversed where, on the circumstances of the case, no Bivens remedy can be implied because state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages action, thus providing both significant deterrence and compensation.
Gonzalez v. Thaler, 10-895| 10-895|In an appeal from a judgment of the appeals court upholding the trial court's dismissal of petitioner's AEDPA petition for habeas relief as time-barred, judgment is affirmed where 28 U.S.C. section 2253(c)(3) is a mandatory but nonjurisdictional rule and because, for purposes of Section 2244(d)(1)(A), judgment becomes final on the date that the time for seeking such review expires.
Kurns v. Railroad Friction Products Corp., 10-879| 10-879|In a design-defect and failure-to-warn suit by the estate of a man who had mesothelioma allegedly from his exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts distributed by the respondents, summary judgment to the respondents is affirmed, where the state-law claims fell within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted by the federal Locomotive Inspection Act, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U.S. 605.
Messerschmidt v. Millender, 10-704| 10-704|In a suit under 42 USC section 1983 alleging that the plaintiffs were subjected to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment because the warrant authorizing the search of their home was not supported by probable cause, the Ninth Circuit's denial of qualified immunity to defendant police officers is reversed, where: 1) an officer could reasonably have believed that the scope of the warrant was supported by probable cause; and 2) any arguable defect would have become apparent only upon a close parsing of the warrant application and a comparison of the supporting affidavit to the terms of the warrant to determine whether the affidavit established probable cause to search for all the items listed in the warrant.
PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana, 10-218| 10-218|In a suit by power companies claiming that the state of Montana was barred from seeking compensation for their use of riverbeds, in which Montana counterclaimed contending that under the equal-footing doctrine it owns the riverbeds and can charge rent for their use, summary judgment in favor of Montana as to navigability for purposes of determining riverbed title is reversed, where: 1) the Montana Supreme Court erred in its treatment of the question of river segments and portage; and 2) the Montana Supreme Court erred as a matter of law in relying on evidence of present-day, primarily recreational use of the Madison River.
Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc., 09-958| 09-958|In consolidated cases challenging statutory Medicaid rate reductions by the state of California that were approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), judgments of the Ninth Circuit are vacated and the cases are remanded to permit the parties to argue before the Ninth Circuit in the first instance the question whether the respondents may maintain Supremacy Clause actions, where the CMS approval may require the respondents to seek review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) rather than in a Supremacy Clause action against California.
Kawashima v. Holder, 10-577| 10-577|"In removal proceedings against resident aliens who were convicted of willfully making and subscribing a false tax return under 26 USC section 7206(1) and aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return under 26 USC section 7206(2), the orders of removal are affirmed, as violations of sections 7206(1) and (2) are crimes ""involv[ing] fraud or deceit"" under 8 USC section 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) and are therefore aggravated felonies subjecting the respondents to removal when the loss to the government exceeds $10,000."
Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 11-391| 11-391|In litigation involving three negligence suits against nursing homes in West Virginia, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is vacated and the cases remanded, where: 1) West Virginia's prohibition against predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the Federal Arbitration Act; and 2) it was unclear to what degree the state court’s alternative holding--that the particular arbitration clauses at issue were unconscionable--was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule that the state court adopted.
Howes v. Fields, 10-680| 10-680|On petition for habeas corpus challenging the admissibility of a confession given while the prisoner was questioned by corrections officers within a prison, the Sixth Circuit's granting of habeas relief is reversed, where: 1) there is no categorical rule that isolation from the general prison population, combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison, makes any such interrogation custodial per se; and 2) under the circumstances, the respondent was not taken into custody for Miranda purposes, so his confession was admissible.
Wetzel v. Lambert, 11-38| 11-38|"On petition for habeas corpus claiming, inter alia, that the state's failure to disclose a ""police activity sheet"" violated his rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), the Third Circuit's grant of the writ is vacated, where the state court ruling that the document contained ambiguous and speculative references could be reasonable."
Setser v. US, 10-7387| 10-7387|In a case in which the federal district court imposed a 151-month sentence on a drug charge, to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for a probation violation, but concurrently with any state sentence imposed on the drug charge, the Fifth Circuit's upholding of the sentence is affirmed, where: 1) the district court had discretion to order that the defendant's federal sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the probation violation, rather than the Bureau of Prisons after the federal sentence had been imposed; and 2) the state court's subsequent decision to make the state sentences run concurrently did not establish that the federal district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.
Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper, 10-1024| 10-1024|"In an airline pilot's suit alleging that government agencies violated the Privacy Act of 1974 by unlawfully disclosing his confidential medical information, thereby causing him mental and emotional distress, the Ninth Circuit's decision in favor of the plaintiff is reversed, where: 1) the Privacy Act, which allows recovery against the government for ""actual damages,"" does not unequivocally authorize an award of damages for mental or emotional distress as ""actual damages""; and 2) accordingly, the Act does not waive the federal government’s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms."
Vartelas v. Holder, 10-1211| 10-1211|In removal proceedings against a lawful permanent resident who pre-IIRAIRA was convicted of a crime that made him inadmissible upon reentry under post-IIRAIRA INA section 101(a)(13)(C)(v), the Second Circuit's decision finding the petitioner removable is reversed, as the impact of the petitioner's brief travel abroad was determined not by IIRAIRA, which if applied would have had an impermissible retroactive effect, but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction, which did not require admissibility upon reentry.
Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 10-699| 10-699|"In a case in which parents of a child born in Jerusalem sought to have the child's place of birth recorded in his passport as ""Israel"" as allowed by a federal statute but prohibited by State Department policy, dismissal of the case on grounds that it presented a nonjusticiable political question is vacated, where: 1) resolution of the claim would not require the judiciary to define U.S. policy toward the status of Jerusalem, but rather required the courts to determine only whether the plaintiff could vindicate his statutory right to choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport; 2) the only real question for the courts was whether the statute was unconstitutional; and 3) there was not a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the question."
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC v. Simmonds, 10-1261| 10-1261|"In consolidated suits seeking disgorgement of ""short-swing"" insider trading profits under section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act that were brought more than two years after the date profits were realized, the Ninth Circuit's reversal of the district court's dismissal is vacated and the case remanded, where: 1) the two-year period of limitations in section 16(b) is not tolled by failure to comply with section 16(a)'s requirement that insiders disclose any changes to their ownership interests; and 2) it was necessary for the lower courts to consider in the first instance how usual equitable tolling rules applied."
Lafler v. Cooper, 10-209| 10-209|In a case in which a defendant was convicted of assault with intent to murder and three other offenses and received a mandatory minimum 185-to-360-month sentence, after receiving ineffective assistance of counsel in advice to reject a plea offer to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a 51-to-85-month sentence on the other two, the judgment of the Sixth Circuit on petition for habeas corpus is vacated and the case remanded, where: 1) the defendant showed prejudice for purposes of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim by showing that but for his attorney's deficient performance there was a reasonable probability he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea; but 2) the district court should not have ordered specific performance of the plea agreement, but rather ordered the state to reoffer the plea.
Missouri v. Frye, 10-444| 10-444|In a case in which a defendant was convicted of driving with a revoked license after his attorney failed to convey plea bargain offers to him, the judgment of the Missouri Court of Appeals on the defendant's motion for postconviction relief is vacated and remanded, where the Missouri court correctly concluded that the attorney's failure to inform the defendant of the written plea offer before it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard for purposes of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, but the Missouri court failed to require the defendant to show that the plea offer would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court for purposes of showing prejudice.
Sackett v. EPA, 10-1062| 10-1062|In a suit by landowners seeking declarative and injunctive relief, contending that a compliance order from the EPA, which stated that their residential lot contained navigable waters and that their construction project violated the Clean Water Act, was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that it deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, dismissal of the complaint is reversed, where: 1) the compliance order was a final agency action that the district court had jurisdiction to review under the APA; and 2) the Clean Water Act is not a statute that precludes judicial review under the APA.
Roberts v. Sea-Land Services, Inc., 10-1399| 10-1399|"In a suit under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act for injuries sustained in 2002 at an Alaska marine terminal while working for the respondent, an award of benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate is affirmed, as an employee is ""newly awarded compensation"" under the Act when he or she first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his or her behalf."
Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, 10-1016| 10-1016|In a suit alleging that a state employer violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 USC section 2612(a)(1)(D), by denying the plaintiff self-care leave, dismissal is affirmed, with four justices holding that suits against states under the self-care provision are barred by sovereign immunity, where the sex-based discrimination that supports allowing section 2612(a)(1)(C) suits against states--for denying leave for the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious medical condition--is absent with respect to the self-care provision.
Martinez v. Ryan, 10-1001| 10-1001|In a case in which an Arizona prisoner claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel both at trial and in an initial-review Arizona collateral proceeding, but in the initial-review Arizona collateral proceeding his attorney did not raise any claim that the trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance, denial of a petition for federal habeas corpus review is reversed, because in states like Arizona where ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those claims if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.
Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 10-1150| 10-1150|In a patent infringement case involving two patents that concerned the use of thiopurine drugs to treat autoimmune diseases, the Federal Circuit's judgment finding infringement is reversed, where the patent processes--embodying researchers' findings that identify correlations between metabolite levels in the bloodstream and likely harm or ineffectiveness of thiopurine drugs with precision--were not patent eligible, since they were based on laws of nature and did not have additional features that provided practical assurance that they were genuine applications of those laws rather than drafting efforts designed to monopolize the correlations.
Martel v. Clair, 10-1265| 10-1265|"Denial of a habeas petitioner's motion to substitute counsel under 18 USC section 3599 is affirmed, with a holding that courts should employ the same ""interests of justice"" standard for ruling on motions to substitute counsel in capital cases under 18 USC section 3599 that applies in noncapital cases under 18 USC section 3006A, and a finding that under the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner's request for new counsel."
US v. Home Concrete & Supply, LLC, 11-139| 11-139|"In a case in which the government asserted a deficiency, outside the 3-year limitations period of 26 USC section 6501(a), against a taxpayer who overstated the basis of certain property it had sold, it is held that the taxpayers' overstatements of basis, and resulting understatements of gross income, did not trigger the extended limitations period applicable when a taxpayer ""omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return,” as: 1) the issue had been decided in Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner, 357 U.S. 28 (1958); and 2) a more recent Treasury regulation was not entitled to Chevron deference because Colony eliminated any different construction of the statute available for adoption by the agency."
Wood v. Milyard, 10-9995| 10-9995|"In a case in which the state twice informed the district court that it would ""not challenge, but [was] not conceding,"" the timeliness of a prisoner's federal petition for habeas corpus, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals' dismissal of the petition as untimely is reversed, where: 1) courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority--though not the obligation--to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative in exceptional cases; but 2) the state deliberately waived the statute of limitations defense."
Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 11-88| 11-88|"In a suit against the Palestinian Authority and the PLO under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA) brought by the estate of a person killed in the West Bank, dismissal of the case is affirmed, as the TVPA's use of the term ""individual"" encompasses only natural persons and so does not impose liability against organizations."
Kappos v. Hyatt, 10-1219| 10-1219|In a civil action under 35 USC section 145 against the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging the denial of a patent, the Federal Circuit's reversal of summary judgment to the Director is affirmed, with holdings that: 1) there are no limitations on a patent applicant's ability to introduce new evidence in a section 145 proceeding beyond those already present in the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and 2) if new evidence is presented on a disputed question of fact, the district court must make de novo factual findings that take account of both the new evidence and the administrative record before the PTO.
Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A S, 10-844| 10-844|In patent infringement litigation between a brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturer and a generic manufacturer, the Federal Circuit's holding denying a statutory counterclaim is reversed, as a generic manufacturer may employ the counterclaim provision of 21 USC section 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) to force correction of a use code that inaccurately describes the brand's patent as covering a particular method of using a drug, even if the patent covers other approved methods.
Filarsky v. Delia, 10-1018| 10-1018|In an action under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 against defendants who included an attorney hired by a city for an internal affairs investigation of the plaintiff, alleging that the attorney's order to the plaintiff to produce building materials stored at the plaintiff's home violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the Ninth Circuit's holding that the attorney was not entitled to seek qualified immunity is reversed, as a private individual temporarily retained by the government to carry out its work is entitled to seek qualified immunity from suit under section 1983.
Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 10-945| 10-945|In a suit under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 alleging Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, in which the petitioner argued for a rule that persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive searches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband, the Third Circuit's reversal of summary judgment to the plaintiff is affirmed, where the search procedures at the county jails struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions, and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments did not require adoption of the framework of rules proposed by the petitioner.
Rehberg v. Paulk, 10-788| 10-788|In an action under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 alleging that a chief investigator for a district attorney's office had conspired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury, the Eleventh Circuit's holding that the investigator had absolute immunity from a section 1983 suit based on his grand jury testimony is affirmed, as a witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same absolute immunity from suit under section 1983 as a witness who testifies at trial.
Coleman v. Johnson, 11-1053| 11-1053|In a case in which a man was convicted as an accomplice and co-conspirator in a murder and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted him habeas corpus relief on the ground that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, judgment is reversed, where: 1) the decision of the state court of last review, which did not think that the jury's finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality, was entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA; and 2) the evidence at trial was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979).
RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 11-166| 11-166|In Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, a creditor bank's objection to the debtor's cramdown plan is sustained, where the proposed sale of the bank's collateral free and clear of the bank’s lien would not comply with 11 USC section 1129(b)(2)(A) because it would not permit the bank to credit-bid at the sale.
Blueford v. Arkansas, 10-1320| 10-1320|In a murder prosecution in which the judge declared a mistrial after the jury foreman announced that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide, it is held that retrial of the capital and first-degree murder charges did not violate double jeopardy, since the jury's report that it was unanimous on the murder charges was not a final resolution of those charges, and it was not improper to declare a mistrial.
Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 10-1042| 10-1042|In a case in which three couples who obtained mortgage loans from the respondent filed separate state-court actions alleging that the respondent had violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act's prohibition of fee splitting at 12 U.S.C. section 2607(b) by charging them fees for which no services were provided in return, summary judgment to the respondent is affirmed, because in order to establish a violation of section 2607(b), a plaintiff must demonstrate that a charge for settlement services was divided between two or more persons. Section 2607(b) cannot be understood to reach a single provider's retention of an unearned fee.
Astrue v. Capato, 11-159| 11-159|In a case in which a widow gave birth to twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using her husband’s frozen sperm and then applied for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins, the Social Security Administration (SSA) denial of her application is upheld, where: 1) under 42 USC section 416(h)(2)(A), the children could would qualify for benefits only if they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law, and Florida law did not allow them to; 2) the SSA's interpretation of the statutory scheme was reasonable and entitled to Chevron deference.
Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 10-1472| 10-1472|"In a case in which the respondent was the prevailing party in a civil action instituted by the petitioner, an award of the cost of translating documents is vacated, as the Court Interpreters Act, 28 U.S.C. section 1920, which includes ""compensation of interpreters"" among the costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits, does not include the cost of document translation."
Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez, 10-1542| 10-1542|A Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denial of cancellation of removal is upheld, where: 1) the aliens lacked the required years of continuous presence and lawful permanent resident status; and 2) the BIA's rejection of imputation of their parents' years of continuous presence and lawful permanent resident status was based on a permissible construction of the cancellation of removal statute, 8 USC section 1229b(a).
Hall v. US, 10-875| 10-875|"In Chapter 12 bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtors proposed treating a capital gains tax on the postpetition sale of their farm as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds were available, with the unpaid balance being discharged, the objection of the IRS is sustained, as the federal income tax liability resulting from the sale was not ""incurred by the estate"" under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, and thus was neither collectible nor dischargeable in the Chapter 12 plan."
National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius, 11-363| 11-363|In a suit challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Eleventh Circuit's decision that the Medicaid expansion is a valid exercise of Congress's spending power, but that Congress lacks authority to enact the individual mandate, is affirmed in part and reversed in part where: 1) the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause; 2) the individual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do not have health insurance; 3) the individual mandate may be upheld as within Congress's power under the Taxing Clause; and 4) the Medicaid expansion violates the Constitution by threatening states with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.
US v. Alvarez, 11-210| 11-210|In a case involving a conviction under the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of military decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the Congressional Medal of Honor is involved, 18 U.S.C. sections 704(b), (c), the Ninth Circuit's decision reversing the conviction and finding the Stolen Valor Act invalid under the First Amendment is affirmed where the Act infringes upon speech protected by the First Amendment.
First American Financial Corp. v. Edwards, 10-708| 10-708|On writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.
Arizona v. US, 11-182| 11-182|In a case assessing the constitutionality of an Arizona statute known as S.B. 1070, which was enacted in 2010 to address pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the state, the Ninth Circuit's ruling affirming the district court's issuance of a preliminary injunction preventing four of its provisions from taking effect is: 1) affirmed in part, where Sections 3 (misdemeanor for failure to comply with federal alien-registration), 5(C) (misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to work), and 6 (authorizes officers to arrest without a warrant a person the officer has probable cause to believe has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the US) of S.B. 1070 are preempted by federal law; but 2) reversed in part, where it was improper to enjoin section 2(B) (requiring officers conducting a stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts to verify the person's immigration status with the Federal Government) before the state courts had an opportunity to construe it and without some showing that section 2(B)'s enforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objectives.
Miller v. Alabama, 10-9646| 10-9646|In consolidated petitions for habeas corpus relief, where both petitioners were convicted of murder at the age of 14 and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, denial of petition is reversed and remanded where the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders.
American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v.

Knox v. Service Employees International Union, 10-1121| 10-1121|"In a class action brought on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into a union's ""Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund,"" alleging the union's violation of their First Amendment rights, the Ninth Circuit's decision in the union's favor, concluding that Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 302–311, prescribed a balancing test under which the proper inquiry is whether the union's procedures reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer, and the nonmember employees, is reversed where: 1) this case is not moot and a live controversy remains, even though the union offered a full refund to all class members after certiorari was granted; and 2) under the First Amendment, when a union imposes a special assessment or dues increase levied to meet expenses that were not disclosed when the regular assessment was set, it must provide a fresh notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent."

US, 11-94| 11-94|In a case involving a criminal fine for conviction of violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) for having knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at a subsidiary's facility, the First Circuit's ruling upholding the fine because it held that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, does not apply to criminal fines, is reversed, as the rule of Apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.
Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 10-1293| 10-1293|"In an action involving the FCC's modified indecency enforcement regime to regulate ""fleeting expletives,"" as applied to three incidents, two concerning isolated utterances of obscene words during two live broadcasts and the third during an episode of a television show broadcast when the nude buttocks of an adult female character were shown for approximately seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment, because the FCC failed to give either broadcaster fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the FCC's standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague."
Williams v. Illinois, 10-8505| 10-8505|Conviction for rape is affirmed where the admission of expert testimony pertaining to third-party laboratory procedures involved in processing incriminating DNA evidence did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the laboratory's report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 11-204| 11-204|In an action by pharmaceutical sales representatives alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for failure to pay overtime wages, 29 U.S.C. section 207(a), the Ninth Circuit's decision denying plaintiffs' motion to alter or amend the judgment and affirming summary judgment to employer, is affirmed where the sales reps qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the Department of Labor's regulations, and are therefore exempt from the overtime wage requirement.
Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 11-246| 11-246|In a suit brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenging a deal to take into trust on the Tribe's behalf a tract of land for gaming purposes, under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), 25 U.S.C. section 465, and alleging a variety of economic, environmental, and aesthetic harms as a result of the Tribe's proposed use of the property to operate a casino, the D.C.

Elgin v. Dept. of Treasury, 11-45| 11-45|In a suit brought by federal employees discharged pursuant to 5 U.S.C. section 3328, which bars from Executive agency employment anyone who has knowingly and willfully failed to register for the Selective Service as required by the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA), 50 U.S.C. App. section 453, claiming that section 3328 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and unconstitutionally discriminates based on sex when combined with the MSSA's male-only registration requirement, the First Circuit's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed where the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) precludes district court jurisdiction over petitioners' claims, because it is fairly discernible that Congress intended the statute's review scheme to provide the exclusive avenue to judicial review for covered employees who challenge covered adverse employment actions, even when those employees argue that a federal statute is unconstitutional.

Armour v. Indianapolis, 11-161| 11-161|In an Equal Protection action brought by homeowners to obtain a refund of money paid to a city to fund a public works sewer project after the city changed its method of financing the project, the Indiana Supreme Court's holding -- that the city's distinction between those who had already paid and those who had not was rationally related to its legitimate interests in reducing administrative costs, providing financial hardship relief to homeowners, transitioning from the Barrett Law system to STEP, and preserving its limited resources -- is affirmed where the city had a rational basis for its distinction and thus did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Tennant v. W. Virginia Sec'y of State, 11–1184| 11–1184|"In a challenge to the West Virginia's 2011 congressional redistricting plan as violating the ""one person, one vote"" principle, district court's judgment holding the plan ""null and void"" and enjoining the West Virginia's Secretary of State from implementing it, is reversed where the district court: 1) misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v.

US v. Bormes, 11-192| 11-192|In an attorney's putative class action against the United States seeking damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as well as under the Little Tucker Act, alleging that the electronic receipt he received when paying his client's federal-court filing fee on Pay.gov included the last four digits of his credit card number and the card's expiration date, in willful violation of the FCRA, the judgment of the Federal Circuit reversing the district court's dismissal of the suit, is vacated and remanded where: 1) the Little Tucker Act does not waive the government's sovereign immunity with respect to FCRA damages actions; and 2) where, as in FCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme, only its own text can determine whether Congress unequivocally intended to impose the statute's damages liability on the Federal Government.
Lefemine v. Wideman, 12-168| 12-168|"In plaintiffs' section 1983 suit against several police officers alleging that the prohibition of carrying pictures of aborted fetuses during their demonstrations violated their First Amendment rights, the Fourth Circuit's judgment affirming the district court's grant of plaintiffs' motion for a permanent injunction but denial of attorney's fees, on the ground that plaintiff is not a prevailing party because he did not secure monetary damages, is vacated and remanded where a plaintiff ""prevails"" when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff. Here, the injunction ordered the defendant officials to change their behavior in a way that directly benefited the plaintiff."
Kloeckner v.

Arkansas Game & Fish Comm'n v. US, 11-597| 11-597|In a takings suit brought by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission against the US, alleging that the temporary deviations from the plan known as the Water Control Manual caused sustained flooding during tree-growing season, and that the cumulative impact of the controlled flooding caused the destruction of timber in the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area and a substantial change in the character of the terrain, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in favor of the US is reversed and remanded where: 1) government-induced flooding temporary in duration gains no automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection, and can constitute takings, and takings temporary in duration can be compensable; and 2) when regulation or temporary physical invasion by government interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the existence vel non of a compensable taking, as well as the degree to which the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action, the character of the land at issue, the owner's reasonable investment-backed expectations regarding the land's use, and the severity of the interference.
