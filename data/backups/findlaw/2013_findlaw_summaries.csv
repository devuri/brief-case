Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 11-1231| 11-1231|In challenge by hospitals to Medicare's SSI fraction calculation, which affects the reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries and any upward adjustment for serving a disproportionate number of low-income patients, judgment allowing administrative appeal made 10 years after the determination, is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the 180-day limitation in section 42 USC 1395oo(a)(3) is not jurisdictional; 2) the Secretary reasonably construed the statute to permit a regulation extending the time for a provider's appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board to three years; and 3) the presumption in favor of equitable tolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the kind here at issue.
Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, 11-626| 11-626|"In admiralty suit in rem against floating home, judgment that the floating home was a ""vessel"" under 1 U.S.C. section 3 and award of damages to plaintiff-city are reversed where: 1) the case is not moot; 2) the floating home is not a vessel under 1 U.S.C. section 3 because a reasonable observer, looking to the home's physical characteristics and activities, would not consider it to be designed to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water."
Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 11-982| 11-982|In trademark infringement and invalidity dispute, judgment dismissing suit as moot is affirmed, where: 1) under the voluntary cessation doctrine, Nike met its burden of showing that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to occur; 2) the Covenant Not to Sue issued by Nike is irrevocable and unconditional, and prevents any claim or demand; 3) Already has not demonstrated any intent to design or market a shoe that would expose it to any prospect of infringement liability; and 4) remand in this case would serve no purpose.
Smith v. US, 11-8976| 11-8976|In appeal from conviction of conspiracy charges for role in illegal drug business, judgment is affirmed, where: 1) a criminal defendant bears the burden of proving withdrawal from a conspiracy regardless of when the purported withdrawal took place; 2) allocating the burden to defendant does not violate the Due Process clause; 3) Congress did not address in 21 U.S.C. section 846 or 18 U.S.C. section 1962(d) the burden of proof for withdrawal, and thus the common law rule that defendant bears the burden of proving affirmative defenses remains; and 4) the burden of proof does not change even when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-of-limitations defense.
Ryan v. Valencia Gonzales, 10-930| 10-930|In federal habeas corpus appeals, judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed and judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated and remanded, where: 1) the Courts of Appeals for the Ninth and Sixth Circuits both erred in holding that district courts must stay federal habeas proceedings when state prisoner-petitioners are adjudged incompetent; and 2) neither 18 U.S.C. section 3599 nor 18 U.S.C. section 4241 provides such a right.
Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 11-460| 11-460|In citizen suit against defendant-district brought under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for alleged violations of its permit to discharge storm water into navigable waters, judgment of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals holding the defendant-district liable for discharges is reversed, where the flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the very same waterway does not qualify as a discharge of pollutants under the CWA.
Gabelli v. SEC, 11-1274| 11-1274|The five-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. section 2462, the general statute of limitations for civil penalty actions, including an SEC enforcement action for civil penalties pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act that is at issue here, begins to run when the fraud occurs, not when it is discovered.
Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 11-1085| 11-1085|Although required to prevail on the merits, proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a securities-fraud class action seeking money damages for alleged violations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5.
Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 11-1175| 11-1175|A district court may award costs to prevailing defendants in Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) cases without finding that the plaintiff brought the case in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, because 15 U.S.C. section 1692k(a)(3) of the FDCPA, which allows for an award of attorney's fees and costs when a party brings suit in bad faith, is not contrary to and does not displace a district court's discretion to award costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), which gives district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants unless a federal statute provides otherwise.
Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 11-1025| 11-1025|"Plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to challenge 50 U.S.C. section 1881a of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to acquire foreign intelligence information by jointly authorizing the surveillance of individuals who are not United States persons and are reasonably believed to be located outside the U.S., where: 1) the standard for determining standing is that the threatened injury must be ""certainly impending"" to constitute injury in fact; 2) plaintiffs are U.S. persons whose work allegedly requires them to engage in sensitive international communications with individuals who they believe are likely targets of surveillance; 3) plaintiffs' standing theory rests on a speculative chain of possibilities that does not establish that their potential injury is certainly impending or is fairly traceable to section 1881a; and 4) plaintiffs cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending."
Gunn v. Minton, 11-1118| 11-1118|"28 U.S.C. section 1338(a), which provides federal district courts with exclusive jurisdiction over patent cases, does not deprive the state courts of subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's state law claim alleging legal malpractice in the handling of his patent case because the legal malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent law, where: 1) resolution of a federal patent question is ""necessary"" to plaintiff's case; 2) the federal issue of the experimental-use exception is also ""actually disputed"" here; but 3) the federal issue in this case is not substantial in the relevant sense; and 4) there is no serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum."
Henderson v. US, 11-9307| 11-9307|"An error is ""plain"" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 52(b) so long as the error is plain at the time of appellate review, whether or not the law at the time of the trial judge's decision was settled or unsettled."
Johnson v. Williams, 11-465| 11-465|For purposes of 28 USC section 2254(d), which limits the relief a federal habeas court may grant to a state prisoner, when a state court rules against a defendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendant's claims but does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits, and here: 1) the federal claim at issue here (a Sixth Amendment jury trial claim) must be presumed to have been adjudicated on the merits by the California courts; 2) this presumption was not adequately rebutted; 3) the restrictive standard of review set out in section 2254(d)(2) consequently applies; and 4) under that standard defendant is not entitled to habeas relief.
Evans v. Michigan, 11-1327| 11-1327|The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial of defendant for arson, where: 1) defendant's court-decreed acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles, i.e. that the State had to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling, which was not in fact a required element; but 2) acquittals are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely; and 3) a judicial acquittal premised upon an erroneous addition of an extraneous element to the charged offense  is an acquittal on the merits that bars retrial.
Chaidez v. US, 11-820| 11-820|Padilla v. Kentucky, which held that the Sixth Amendment requires defense attorneys to inform non-citizen clients of the deportation risks of guilty pleas, does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review, because Padilla announced a new rule regarding whether Strickland applied to advice on deportation in the first instance, which was an unsettled question.
Chafin v. Chafin, 11-1347| 11-1347|The return of a child to a foreign country pursuant to a return order under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction does not render an appeal of that order moot, and therefore the courts below continue to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the parties' respective claims.
Bailey v. US, 11-770| 11-770|The rule in Michigan v. Summers regarding detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant is limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched and does not apply here, where defendant was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question; however, the question whether stopping petitioner was lawful under Terry v. Ohio remains open on remand.
Federal Trade Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 11-1160| 11-1160|Georgia's law that creates special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities and gives those entities general corporate powers, including the power to acquire hospitals,  has not clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed a state policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions that substantially lessen competition, and as a result: 1) the clear-articulation test is not satisfied; 2) state action immunity does not apply; and 3) defendant is not exempt from scrutiny under the federal antitrust laws.
Florida v. Harris, 11-817| 11-817|During a routine traffic stop, the officer had probable cause to search defendant's truck under the totality of the circumstances, where: 1) training and testing records supported a drug detection dog's reliability in detecting drugs; and 2) defendant did not adequately contest that evidence.
Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 11-864| 11-864|Plaintiffs' class action, alleging violations of the federal antitrust laws, was improperly certified under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), where: 1) the Third Circuit ran afoul of Supreme Court precedents when it refused to entertain arguments against plaintiffs' damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification simply because they would also be pertinent to the merits determination; and 2) under the proper standard for evaluating certification, plaintiffs' model falls far short of establishing that damages can be measured class-wide.
Millbrook v. US, 11-10362| 11-10362|28 U.S.C. section 2680(h) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the proviso that extends the government's waiver of immunity to claims for certain intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the acts or omissions of an investigative or law enforcement officer who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests, extends to law enforcement officers' acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, regardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.
Florida v. Jardines, 11-564| 11-564|"Using a drug-sniffing dog on defendant-homeowner's porch to investigate the contents of the home is a ""search"" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and therefore the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida suppressing evidence obtained from that search is affirmed."
Wos v. E. M. A., 12-98| 12-98|The federal anti-lien provision pre-empts North Carolina's irrebuttable statutory presumption that one-third of a tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses, where: 1) a State is prevented from taking any portion of a Medicaid beneficiary's tort judgment or settlement not designated as payments for medical care under the federal statute and Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn; 2) the North Carolina statute is in direct conflict with the federal Medicaid statute insofar as it attempts to recover one-third of a tort recovery even if the settlement or verdict expressly allocates a lower percentage of the judgment to medical expenses; 3) the North Carolina statute sets forth no process for determining what portion of a beneficiary's tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses; and 4) a judicial or administrative proceeding may be necessary where a beneficiary and the State are unable to agree on what portion of a settlement represents compensation for medical expenses.
Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center, 11-338| 11-338|In a citizen suit brought under the Clean Water Act (CWA) alleging that defendants had not obtained National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Oregon rivers, the EPA's interpretation of its regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue here is a reasonable one and accorded deference, where: 1) the present action falls within the scope of 33 U.S.C. section 1365 because the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the CWA or its regulations; 2) the EPA's recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule does not make the cases moot; and 3) the preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule, as permissibly construed by the EPA, exempts discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES permitting scheme.
Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 11-1450| 11-1450|Plaintiff's stipulation that he and the class would seek less than $5 million in damages does not defeat federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act, which gives federal district courts original jurisdiction over class actions in which the matter in controversy exceeds $5 million in sum or value, because a plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified.
Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 11-697| 11-697|"The ""first sale"" doctrine, which provides that the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under the Copyright Act, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy,  applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad."
Levin v. US, 11-1351| 11-1351|Under the Gonzalez Act, which makes the remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel, subsection 10 U.S.C. 1089(e) abrogates the FTCA's intentional tort exception, and therefore permits plaintiff-veteran's suit against the U.S. alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting within the scope of his employment.
McBurney v. Young, 12-17| 12-17|"Virginia's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which grants Virginia citizens access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-Virginians, does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are ""fundamental,"" nor does it violate the dormant Commerce Clause."
Boyer v. Louisiana, 11-9953| 11-9953|In suit challenging whether a delay caused by a State's failure to fund counsel for an indigent's defense should be weighed against the State in determining whether there was a deprivation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.
Moncrieffe v. Holder, 11-702| 11-702|If a noncitizen’s conviction for a marijuana distribution offense fails to establish that the offense involved either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana, it is not an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded.
Missouri v. McNeely, 11-1425| 11-1425|Judgment finding that the nonconsensual warrantless blood test violated defendant's Fourth Amendment right to be free from warrantless searches of his person, and suppressing said evidence, is affirmed, where, in drunk driving investigations the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.
Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 10-1491| 10-1491|The Alien Tort Statute does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign's territory, where: 1) the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the Alien Tort Statute; and 2) nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption. Therefore, the claim by Nigerian nationals now living in the U.S. against defendant corporations for aiding and abetting the Nigerian government in committing violations of the law of nations, which occurred outside the U.S., is barred.
Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 11-1059| 11-1059|A collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) on behalf of respondent and other employees similarly situated, was appropriately dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction where, after she ignored petitioners' offer of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, respondent had no personal interest in representing putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness.
US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 11-1285| 11-1285|In an ERISA action under section 502(a)(3), which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan, based on an equitable lien by agreement, the ERISA plan's terms govern. Neither general unjust enrichment principles nor specific doctrines reflecting those principles, such as the double-recovery or common-fund rules, can override the applicable contract.
Marshall v. Rodgers, 12-382| 12-382|"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in granting defendant's petition for habeas corpus based on his claim that the California courts had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial motion after he had previously waived his right to counsel on three occasions, and thus its judgment is reversed and remanded, where the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that defendant's claim was supported by ""clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."""
Trevino v. Thaler, 11-10189| 11-10189|"Where, as here, a State's procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception recognized in Martinez, that ""a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the State’s initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective, still applies."
McQuiggin v. Perkins, 12-126| 12-126|The Sixth Circuit's holding that that defendant's actual-innocence claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it had been filed on time is vacated and remanded, where: 1) Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a defendant may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar  or expiration of the AEDPA statute of limitations, as in this case; 2) a  federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner's part, not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown; but 3) here, the district court's finding that defendant's habeas petition was insufficient to meet the actual innocence standard should not have been disturbed by the Sixth Circuit, absent cause, which is not seen here.
Metrish v. Lancaster, 12-547| 12-547|Defendant is not entitled to federal habeas relief, where: 1) after defendant's first trial but prior to his retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court 2001 decision in Carpenter, held that the diminished-capacity defense was not encompassed within the Michigan Legislature's comprehensive scheme for mental-illness defenses and thus could not be invoked by criminal defendants; 2) in light of U.S. Supreme Court precedent and the history of Michigan's diminished-capacity defense, the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision applying Carpenter retroactively at defendant's retrial is not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law; and thus, 3) defendant's due process rights were not violated.
Sebelius v. Cloer, 12-236| 12-236|An untimely petition under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act may qualify for an award of attorney's fees if it is filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis for its claim.

City of Arlington v. Federal Communications Commission, 11-1545| 11-1545|"Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agency's interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency's statutory authority (i.e. jurisdiction), and here: 1) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Declaratory Ruling that the phrase ""reasonable period of time"" under section 332(c)(7)(B) of The Communications Act of 1934 is presumptively, but rebuttably, 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications; and 2) the preconditions to deference under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority."

Hollingsworth v. Perry, 12-144| 12-144|In challenge to the district court's ruling that California's Proposition 8, which amended the State Constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, was unconstitutional, Proposition 8's official proponents did not have standing to appeal the district court's order.

Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 12-399| 12-399|"In dispute arising under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) between an adoptive couple and the biological father of the child who had previously relinquished all parental rights prior to the child's birth, the South Carolina State Supreme Court's judgment for the biological father is reversed and remanded, where: 1) assuming for the sake of argument that biological father is a ""parent"" under the ICWA, section 1912(f) does not apply, as here, where the relevant parent never had custody of the child; 2) section 1912(d) is inapplicable when, as here, the parent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never had custody of the child; and 3) section 1915(a)'s adoption-placement preferences are inapplicable in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt the child."
Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, 11-1447| 11-1447|In a dispute involving plaintiff's attempt to obtain permits from defendant to develop a section of his property, defendant's denial of plaintiff's proposal to mitigate the environmental impacts of the same, and defendant's demands in order to approve his request, the Florida Supreme Court's judgment for defendant is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the government's demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when it denies the permit; and 2) the government's demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when its demand is for money.
Shelby County v.

Salinas v. Texas, 12-246| 12-246|Defendant's murder conviction is affirmed, where: 1) without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warnings, defendant voluntarily answered the questions of a police officer who was investigating a murder; 2) defendant remained silent when asked by the officer whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioner's shotgun; and 3) at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer's question suggested that he was guilty.

Spears, 12-25| 12-25|In an action brought by plaintiffs, South Carolina residents, against defendant attorneys for violating the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 by obtaining, disclosing, and using plaintiffs' personal information from motor vehicle records for bulk solicitation without their express consent, judgment of the Fourth Circuit that the use of the information satisfied the litigation exception under 18 U.S.C. section 2721(b)(4) is vacated and remanded, where an attorney's solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered by the (b)(4) litigation exception.
Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc., 12-416| 12-416|"The Eleventh Circuit erred in affirming the dismissal of a suit brought by plaintiff Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by unlawfully agreeing to abandon their patent challenges, to refrain from launching their low-cost generic drugs, and to share in the patent holder's monopoly profits, where: 1) although the anti-competitive effects of the reverse settlement agreement might fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent holder's patent, this does not immunize the agreement from antitrust attack; 2) the FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove its antitrust claim; but 3) reverse payment settlement agreements are not presumptively unlawful, but should be reviewed by applying the ""rule of reason,"" rather  than under a ""quick look"" approach."
American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 11-798| 11-798|In a challenge to defendant's concession agreement, which was implemented as part of the Clean Truck Program to govern the relationship between the defendant's Port and drayage companies whose short-haul companies move cargo into and out of the Port, the Ninth Circuit's judgment finding only the driver employment provision of the agreement preempted, is reversed in part and remanded, where: 1) the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act expressly preempts the concession agreement's placard and parking requirements because defendant's placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carrier's price, route, or service with respect to transporting property, and have the force and effect of law; but 2) this Court declines to decide in the case's present, pre-enforcement posture whether Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., limits the way the Port can enforce the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements upheld by the Ninth Circuit.

Myriad Genetics, Inc., 12-398| 12-398|A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA, whose creation results in an exons-only molecule, is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.
US v. Davila, 12-167| 12-167|The Court of Appeals' order vacating defendant's guilty plea is vacated and remanded, where: 1) under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(h), vacatur of defendant's plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to defendant's decision to plead guilty; and 2) here, though the Magistrate Judge plainly violated Rule 11(c)(1) by exhorting defendant to plead guilty, the Court of Appeals failed to further consider the facts of the case, and whether defendant's case should be judged under Rule 52(a)'s harmless-error standard or Rule 52(b)'s plain-error standard.
Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann, 11-889| 11-889|The Red River Compact, a congressionally sanctioned agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, does not pre-empt Oklahoma water statutes that restrict out-of-state diversions of water, because the Compact creates no cross-border rights in its signatories for these statutes to infringe, and the Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Commerce Clause.
Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 12-123| 12-123|In a dispute between the USDA and California raisin growers involving the failure to surrender requisite portions of raisins to the reserve as established by the California Raisin Marketing Order, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to decide petitioners' takings claim that the Order violates the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against taking property without just compensation, where a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order.
Oxford Health Plans v. Sutter, 12-135| 12-135|In a proposed class action suit brought by a physician under contract with a health insurance company, alleging nonpayment, the Third Circuit's dismissal of the insurer's motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision that their contract permitted class action is affirmed where the arbitrator's decision survives the limited judicial review allowed by section 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act.
Peugh v. US, 12-62| 12-62|Sentence for bank fraud for conduct that took place in 1999 and 2000 is reversed and remanded where the Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998 version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time of sentencing.
Hillman v. Maretta, 11-1221| 11-1221|"The Virginia State Supreme Court correctly concluded that Section D of Va. Code Ann. Section 20–111.1 is preempted by The Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA), where: 1) FEGLIA establishes an insurance program for federal employees, permitting an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds, and specifies an ""order of precedence"" providing that an employee's death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential recipients; 2) Section D of the Virginia statute provided a cause of action rendering a former spouse liable to the current spouse for the principal amount of life insurance proceeds left to them by the deceased, where there has been a change in the decedent’s mari¬tal status but the deceased failed to change the designated beneficiary; and 3) Section D of the Virginia statute conflicts with the purposes and objectives of Congress."
Nevada v. Jackson, 12-694| 12-694|The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision granting defendant habeas corpus relief is reversed and remanded, where: 1) state supreme court reasonably concluded that evidence that the rape victim previously reported that defendant had assaulted her but the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations was properly excluded; 2) no prior decision of the U.S. Supreme Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence violated respondent's federal constitutional rights; so therefore, 3) the Court of Appeals' decision to the contrary was in error.
Maryland v. King, 12-207| 12-207|When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.
Madigan v. Levin, 12-872| 12-872|In a case raising the issue of whether the Seventh Circuit erred in holding that state and local government employees may avoid the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act’s comprehensive remedial regime by bringing age discrimination claims directly under the Equal Protection Clause and 42 U.S.C. section 1983, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.
Burt v. Titlow, 12-414| 12-414|"The Sixth Circuit erred in reversing the lower court's denial of a prisoner's habeas corpus petition, challenging her second degree murder conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining, where the Sixth Circuit: 1) failed to apply the ""doubly deferential"" standard of review recognized by the Court's case law when it refused to credit the state court's reasonable factual finding that the prisoner's new attorney advised withdrawal of the guilty plea only after the prisoner's proclamation of innocence; and 2) assumed that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent."
Stanton v. Sims, 12-1217| 12-1217|"In a suit under 42 U.S.C. section 1983, alleging that a police officer unreasonably searched plaintiff's yard without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit's holding that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity, on grounds that the law clearly established the officer's pursuit of a suspect into plaintiff's yard did not justify his warrantless entry because the suspect was only suspected of a misdemeanor, is reversed where the officer was not ""plainly incompetent"" in entering plaintiff's yard while in hot pursuit."

Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co., 12-729| 12-729|"Dismissal of a petition for review of an ERISA plan administrator's denial of long-term disability benefits claim is affirmed, where: 1) the plan required any suit to recover benefits to be filed within three years after ""proof of loss"" was due; 2) petitioner filed the petition more than three years after proof of loss was due but less than three years after the final denial; and 3) the plan's limitations provision is enforceable because absent a controlling statute to the contrary, a participant and a plan may agree by contract to a particular limitations period, even one that starts to run before the cause of action accrues, as long as the period is reasonable."
Kansas v. Cheever, 12-609| 12-609|The Kansas Supreme Court's decision vacating defendant's murder conviction and death sentence is vacated and remanded, where: 1) Buchanan v. Kentucky established that a State may introduce the results of  a court-ordered psychiatric examination for the limited purpose of rebutting a mental-status defense; 2) defendant raised a voluntary intoxication defense, offering expert testimony regarding his methamphetamine use; 3) the Kansas Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Buchanan rule did not apply; and 4) the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the government from introducing evidence from a court ordered mental evaluation of a criminal defendant to rebut that defendant's presentation of expert testimony in support of a defense of voluntary intoxication.

Jacobs, 12-815| 12-815|In a suit in which plaintiff sought a declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the Iowa Utilities Board's (IUB) decision that intrastate fees applied Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, the Eighth Circuit's conclusion that Younger abstention was required because the ongoing state-court review concerned Iowa's important interest in regulating and enforcing state utility rates, is reversed, where this case does not fall within any of the three classes of exceptional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate.
