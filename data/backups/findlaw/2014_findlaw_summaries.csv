Burrage v. US, 12-7515| 12-7515|Defendant's conviction for unlawfully distributing heroin where death resulted from the use of that substance, which subjected him to a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhancement provision of the Controlled Substances Act, is reversed and remanded, where at least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s death or serious bodily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement under the Controlled Substances Act unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury.
Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp., 12-417| 12-417|"Summary judgment to defendant-employer in a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert defendant-employer requires workers to wear because of hazards at its steel plants is affirmed, where: 1) 29 U. S. C. section 203(o) allows parties to collectively bargain over whether time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday must be compensated; and 2) the time plaintiffs spend donning and doffing their protective gear is not compensable by operation of section 203(o) because it qualifies as ""changing clothes"" under that section."
Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper, 12-315| 12-315|In a defamation action brought by plaintiff-terminated employee against defendant-airline for statements made to the Transportation Security Administration regarding their concerns involving the location of plaintiff's weapon and his stability upon his termination, judgment for plaintiff is reversed and remanded, where: 1) immunity may not be denied under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to materially true statements; 2) under the correct material falsity analysis, defendant-airline is entitled to immunity as a matter of law.
Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, 12-1128| 12-1128|"In a declaratory action brought by plaintiff-patent licensee against defendant-patent owner challenging defendant's assertion that certain of plaintiff's products infringed defendant's patents, the Federal Circuit's determination that plaintiff had the burden of proof is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the Federal Circuit had subject-matter jurisdiction because the action ""arises under"" federal patent law; but 2) when a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee that its products do not infringe the licensed patent, the patentee bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of infringement; and thus, 3) the Federal Court erred in concluding that plaintiff had the burden of proof."
Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension Fund of Operating Engineers and Participating Employers, 12-992| 12-992|"In an action brought by various union-affiliated benefit funds to collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law, and for attorneys fees and costs, where the district court issued an order on June 17, 2011 on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on July 25 on plaintiffs' motion for fees and costs, plaintiffs' August 15, 2011 appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely, where: 1) a decision on the merits is a ""final decision"" for appeal purposes under 28 U.S.C. section 1291 even if the award or amount of attorney's fees for the litigation remains to be determined; and 2) whether the claim for attorney's fees is based on a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a general rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for purposes of appeal."
Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 12-1036| 12-1036|"A suit filed by a State as the sole plaintiff does not constitutes a ""mass action"" under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) where it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries suffered by the State's citizens, and here, because the State of Mississippi is the only named plaintiff in the instant action, the case must be remanded to state court."

Chadbourne & Parke LLP v. Troice, 12-79| 12-79|The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 does not preclude the plaintiffs' state-law class actions, which allege that defendants helped Allen Stanford and his companies perpetrate a Ponzi scheme by falsely representing that uncovered securities (certificates of deposit in Stanford International Bank) that plaintiffs were purchasing were backed by covered securities.
US v. Apel, 12-1038| 12-1038|"Under 18 U. S. C. section 1382, which makes it a crime to reenter a ""military installation"" after having been ordered not to do so by any officer or person in command, the term ""military installation"" encompasses the commanding officer's area of responsibility, and includes Vandenberg Air Force Base's highways and protest area. The Ninth Circuit's holding otherwise is therefore vacated and remanded."
Walden v. Fiore, 12-574| 12-574|"In a tort action filed in Nevada arising out of allegations against a Georgia police officer who searched plaintiffs at a Georgia airport, seized a large amount of cash, and allegedly drafted a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds' forfeiture, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the district could exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant, because defendant lacks the ""minimal contacts"" with Nevada that are a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him."
Kaley v. US, 12-464| 12-464|When challenging the legality of a 21 U.S.C. section 853(e)(1) pre-trial asset seizure, a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitutionally entitled to contest a grand jury's determination of probable cause to believe the defendant committed the crimes charged.
Fernandez v. California, 12-7822| 12-7822|The rule of Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006), that the consent of one occupant to a search is insufficient when another occupant is present and objects to the search, does not extend to the very different situation in this case, where consent was provided by an abused woman well after her partner, the defendant, had been removed from the apartment they shared.
Hinton v. Alabama, 13-6440| 13-6440|The Alabama appellate court's ruling denying the petition for habeas relief, which challenged petitioner's murder conviction, is vacated and remanded, where: 1) the Alabama courts incorrectly applied Strickland v. Washington to petitioner's case; 2) petitioner's trial attorney rendered constitutionally deficient performance because it was unreasonable for petitioner's lawyer to fail to seek additional funds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding was capped at $1,000; and 3) the matter must be remanded for inquiry into whether, under the proper standard, petitioner's attorney's deficient performance was prejudicial under Strickland.
US v. Castleman, 12-1371| 12-1371|"Defendant's prior conviction for ""intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to"" the mother of his child does qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" for purposes of defendant's indictment under 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(9), which forbids the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,"" and the Sixth Circuit erred in concluding otherwise."
US v. Quality Stores, Inc., 12-1408| 12-1408|In an action in which plaintiff sought a refund of taxes paid on severance payments it made to employees who were involuntarily terminated as part of plaintiff's Chapter 11 bankruptcy, summary judgment in favor of plaintiff is reversed and remanded, where the severance payments at issue are taxable wages for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).
Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 12-873| 12-873|In an action in which plaintiff, a toner cartridge seller, alleged that defendant, a maker and seller of components for the remanufacture of plaintiff's cartridges, infringed plaintiff's copyright by developing a microchip that mimicked plaintiff's which allowed defendant to refurbish plaintiff's cartridges, and defendant countersued claiming that plaintiff violated the Lanham Act by misrepresenting to consumers that they were legally bound by the Prebate terms and thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge to plaintiff after a single use, and that it was illegal for remanufacturers to sell refurbished Prebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to use defendant's products to refurbish those cartridges, the Sixth Circuit's determination that defendant adequately pleaded the elements of a Lanham Act cause of action for false advertising is affirmed, where: 1) a cause of action under the Lanham Act extends to plaintiffs who fall within the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury was proximately caused by a violation of that statute; and 2) defendant comes within the class of plaintiffs authorized to sue under the Lanham Act because its alleged injuries, lost sales and damage to its business reputation, fall within the zone of interests protected by the Act, and defendant sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by plaintiff's misrepresentations.
Marvin M. Brandt Revocable Trust v. US, 12-1173| 12-1173|In an action in which the government sought to quiet title to a right of way through defendant-landowner's property that had been granted pursuant to the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, but had been abandoned by the railroad, summary judgment for the government is reversed and remanded, where the right of way was an easement that was terminated by the railroad's abandonment, leaving defendant-landowner's land unburdened.
Rosemond v. US, 12-895| 12-895|Defendant's conviction for aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. section 924(c), using or carrying a gun in connection with a drug trafficking crime, is vacated and remanded, where: 1) the Government establishes that a defendant aided and abetted a section 924(c) violation by proving that the defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime's commission; and 2) the trial court's jury instructions were erroneous because they failed to require that defendant knew in advance that one of his cohorts would be armed.
BG Group PLC v. Republic of Argentina, 12-138| 12-138|"The decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that arbitrators lacked authority to decide a dispute between the parties arising under an investment treaty between the United Kingdom and Argentina, which contained a local litigation requirement, is reversed and remanded, where: 1)  a court of the United States, in reviewing an arbitration award made under the treaty should interpret and apply ""threshold"" provisions concerning arbitration using the framework developed for interpreting similar provisions in ordinary contracts; 2) under that framework, the local litigation requirement is a matter for arbitrators primarily to interpret and apply; 3) courts should review their interpretation with deference; and 4) while Argentina is entitled to court review (under a properly deferential standard) of the arbitrators' decision to excuse plaintiff's noncompliance with the litigation requirement, that review shows that the arbitrators' determinations were lawful."

EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 12-1182| 12-1182|The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals erred in vacating the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which attempted to curb nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in 27 upwind states, in its entirety and in holding that the EPA's actions exceeded its statutory authority, where: 1) the Clean Air Act (CAA) does not command that States be given a second opportunity to file a State Implementation Plan (SIP) after the EPA has quantified the State's inter-state pollution obligation; and 2) the EPA's cost-effective allocation of emission reductions among upwind States is a permissible, workable, and equitable interpretation of the Good Neighbor Provision in the CAA.
Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 12-1163| 12-1163|"The proper standard of review for an appellate court reviewing a district court's award of fees under the Patent Act's fee-shifting provision, which authorizes a district court to award attorney's fees to the prevailing party in ""exceptional cases,"" is abuse of discretion and here, the Federal Circuit erred in reviewing the decision de novo."
Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 12-1184| 12-1184|"In considering a party's request under the Patent Act's fee-shifting provision, which authorizes district courts to award attorney's fees to prevailing parties in ""exceptional cases,"" district courts may determine whether a case is ""exceptional"" in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances. The standard set forth in Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378, 1381 is rejected because it is unduly rigid and impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts."
White v. Woodall, 12-794| 12-794|The Sixth Circuit erred in granting defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging his capital sentence for murder, kidnapping and first-degree rape on the basis that the trial court denied defense counsel's request to instruct the jury not to draw any adverse inference from defendant's decision not to testify at the penalty phase, where the Kentucky Supreme Court's rejection of defendant's Fifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable.
Paroline v. US, 12-8561| 12-8561|The Fifth Circuit erred in holding that defendant, who pled guilty to possessing child pornography, two of which depicted images of the victim here, was liable for said victim's entire losses from the trade in her images, where: 1) restitution is proper under 18 U.S.C. 2259 only to the extent the defendant's offense proximately caused a victim's losses; 2) victims should be compensated and defendants should be held to account for the impact of their conduct on those victims, but defendants should only be made liable for the consequences and gravity of their own conduct, not the conduct of others; and 3) a court should order restitution in an amount that comports with the defendant's relative role in the causal process underlying the victim’s general losses.
Schuette v. BAMN, 12-682| 12-682|An amendment to the Constitution of the State of Michigan, approved and enacted by its voters, which prohibits the use of race-based preferences as part of the admissions process for state universities is upheld, where the plurality concludes that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in the Court's precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.
Prado Navarette v. California, 12-9490| 12-9490|Defendants' motion to suppress evidence of marijuana was properly denied, where: 1) defendants' truck was stopped by the highway patrol because it matched the description of a vehicle that a 911 caller had recently reported as having run her off the road; 2) upon approaching the truck, the officers smelled marijuana; 3) the officers found 30 pounds of marijuana upon searching the truck; and 4) the traffic stop complied with the Fourth Amendment because, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had reasonable suspicion that the truck's driver was intoxicated.
McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, 12-536| 12-536|In an action in which plaintiffs alleged that aggregate limits restricting how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), were unconstitutional under the First Amendment, the district court's decision granting the government's motion to dismiss is reversed and remanded, where the aggregate limits are invalid under the First Amendment.
Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 12-462| 12-462|In an action alleging that defendant-airlines violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it terminated plaintiff's membership in its frequent flyer program, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the claim was not preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the ADA preempts a state-law claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it seeks to enlarge the contractual obligations that the parties voluntarily adopt; 2) plaintiff's claim clearly has a connection with or reference to airline prices, routes, or services; and 3) because plaintiff's implied covenant claim seeks to enlarge his contractual agreement with defendants, it is preempted by the ADA.
Hall v. Florida, 12-10882| 12-10882|As interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court, Florida's rule requiring a threshold showing that a defendant have an IQ score of 70 or below before being permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence so as to be deemed ineligible for the death penalty, is unconstitutional.
Martinez v. Illinois, 13-5967| 13-5967|The Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State's attempt to appeal in the hope of subjecting defendant to a new trial on charges of aggravated battery and mob action, where: 1) on the day defendant's trial was set to begin, the State declined to present any evidence because it wanted the trial court to grant a continuance, and the trial court granted defendant's motion for a directed not-guilty verdict; 2) defendant was subjected to jeopardy because the jury was impaneled and sworn; and 3) the trial court found the State's evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, so there is no doubt that defendant may not be retried.
Plumhoff v. Rickard, 12-1117| 12-1117|"In a 42 U.S.C. section 1983 action alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments when they shot the driver of a fleeing vehicle to put an end to a dangerous car chase, the Sixth Circuit erred in concluding that defendant-officers were not entitled to qualified immunity, where: 1) the Sixth Circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1291, which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from ""final decisions"" of the district court, and the general rule that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a ""final decision,"" and thus not immediately appealable, does not apply when it is based on a qualified immunity claim; 2) defendant-officers' conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment; and 3) even if defendant-officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, defendants would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because plaintiff points to no cases that could be said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force to end a high-speed car chase."
Wood v. Moss, 13-115| 13-115|In an action in which plaintiff-protesters alleged that defendant-agents engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment when they moved plaintiff-protesters away from the Inn where President George W. Bush was dining on the outside patio but allowed the supporters to remain in their original location, the Ninth Circuit erred in concluding that viewpoint-driven conduct on the defendant-agents' part could be inferred from the absence of a legitimate security rationale for the different treatment accorded the two groups of demonstrators, where the agents are entitled to qualified immunity.
Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 12-515| 12-515|"Plaintiff-state's suit alleging that defendant-tribe had violated their compact pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) is barred by tribal sovereign immunity, where: 1) the compact authorized defendant-tribe to operate a casino on Indian lands located within the State's border but prohibited it from doing so outside that territory; 2) defendant-tribe later opened a second casino on land it had purchased through a congressionally established land trust; and 3) the Sixth Circuit correctly concluded that the compact only authorized suits to enjoin gaming activity located ""on Indian lands,"" whereas plaintiff-state's complaint alleged the casino was outside such territory, so plaintiff-state must therefore resort to other mechanisms, including legal actions against the responsible individuals, to resolve this dispute."
Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 12-1315| 12-1315|"In an copyright infringement action brought by plaintiff-copyright owner, who inherited the rights to her father's screenplay, which he had assigned to defendant's predecessor for the film ""Raging Bull"" in 1976, and which plaintiff renewed to become the sole owner in 1991, summary judgment in favor of defendants is reversed and remanded, where: 1) although plaintiff's suit was brought 18 years after her renewal of the copyright, laches cannot be invoked as a bar to plaintiff's pursuit of a claim for damages brought within the Copyright Act's three-year window, i.e. after 2006; 2) while laches cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the Copyright Act's three-year window, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may, at the very outset of the litigation, curtail the relief equitably awarded; and here, 3) no such extraordinary circumstance is present here because plaintiff notified defendant of her copyright claims before defendant invested millions of dollars in creating a new edition of Raging Bull, and the equitable relief she seeks, disgorgement of unjust gains and an injunction against future infringement, would not result in anything like ""total destruction"" of the film."
Town of Greece v. Galloway, 12-696| 12-696|Defendant-town's practice of beginning the monthly town board meetings with a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in a local directory does not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, where: 1) legislative prayer is not required to be nonsectarian; 2) absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation; and 3) so long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.
Robers v. United States, 12-9012| 12-9012|"Following defendant's conviction of a federal crime for submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks, the district court's order that defendant pay the difference between the amount lent to him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that had served as collateral for the loans pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 is affirmed, where: 1) under 18 U.S.C. section 3663A, which is used to calculate the amount of restitution, the phrase ""any part of the property returned"" refers to the property the banks lost, namely the money the banks lent to defendant, and not to the collateral the banks received, namely the houses; 2) a sentencing court must reduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the victim received in selling the collateral, not the value of the collateral when the victim received it; and 3) the rule of lenity does not apply here."
Tolan v. Cotton, 13-551| 13-551|In an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for excessive force arising out of defendant-police sergeant's shooting of plaintiff, summary judgment for defendant is vacated and remanded, where: 1) the Fifth Circuit erred in concluding that defendant was entitled to qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage; and 2) in holding that defendant's actions did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to plaintiff with respect to the central facts of this case.
Harris v. Quinn, 11-681| 11-681|"Under Illinois' Home Services Program (Rehabilitation Program), which allows Medicaid recipients who would normally need institutional care to hire a ""personal assistant"" (PA) to provide homecare services, where defendant-union was designated the exclusive union representative for Rehabilitation Program employees, the First Amendment prohibits the collection of an agency fee from Rehabilitation Program PAs who do not want to join or support the union because the First Amendment does not permit a State to compel personal care providers to subsidize speech on matters of public concern by a union that they do not wish to join or support."
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 13-354| 13-354|The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) does not permit the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to demand that three closely held corporations provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies' owners.

NLRB v. Noel Canning, 12-1281| 12-1281|In a challenge to an order of the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the Board lacked a quorum because three of the five Board members had been invalidly appointed, the D. C. Circuit's decision that the appointments fell outside the scope of the Recess Appointments Clause is affirmed, where: 1) the President appointed the three members in question between the January 3 and January 6 pro forma sessions during which no business was transacted; 2) the Recess Appointments Clause empowers the President to fill any existing vacancy during any recess, intra-session (i.e., breaks between formal sessions of the Senate) or inter-session (i.e., breaks in the midst of a formal session), of sufficient length; 3) in light of historical practice, a recess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within the Recess Appointments Clause; 4) for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business; 5) under the standard set forth here, the Senate was in session during the pro forma sessions at issue; 6) because the Senate was in session during its pro forma sessions, the President made the recess appointments at issue during a 3-day recess; and 7) three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the scope of the Clause, so the President lacked the authority to make those appointments.
American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, Inc., 13-461| 13-461|"The Second Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that defendant does not infringe plaintiffs' copyrights by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the Copyright Act of 1976 gives a copyright owner the ""exclusive right"" to ""perform the copyrighted work publicly""; 2) defendant is not just an equipment supplier; 3) defendant performs plaintiffs' works publicly within the meaning of the Transmit Clause of the Copyright Act; and thus, 4) defendant infringes this exclusive right."
Riley v. California, 13-132| 13-132|The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested. Additionally, although the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement does not apply to cell phones, the continued availability of other case-specific exceptions, including the exigent circumstances exception, may still justify a warrantless search of a particular phone.
Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer, 12-751| 12-751|"In an action in which plaintiffs allege that defendants breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) in their administration of the ""employee stock ownership plan"" (ESOP), which invests its funds primarily in defendant-company's stock, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that ESOP fiduciaries are entitled to a ""presumption of prudence"" that does not apply to other ERISA fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage, and that plaintiff stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, is vacated and remanded, where: 1) ESOP fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence; 2) ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to ERISA fiduciaries in general, except that they need not diversify the fund's assets; and 3) on remand, the Sixth Circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in Ashcroft v.

Loughrin v. US, 13-316| 13-316|"Defendant's conviction for violating the federal bank fraud state, 18 U.S.C. section 1344(2), which makes it a crime to knowingly execute a scheme to obtain property owned by, or under the custody of, a bank by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, is affirmed, where: 1) plaintiff was caught forging stolen checks, using them to buy goods at a Target store, and then returning the goods for cash; 2) section 1344(2) does not require the Government to prove that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution; and thus, 3) the District Court did not err in declining to give defendant's proposed jury instruction that a conviction under section 1344(2) required proof of ""intent to defraud a financial institution."""
Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 12-1146| 12-1146|"Dismissal of an action challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) promulgation of greenhouse-gas emission standards for new motor vehicles, which made stationary sources subject to the ""Prevention of Significant Deterioration"" (PSD) program and Title V of the Clean Air Act on the basis of their potential to emit greenhouse gases, is: 1) reversed in part, where the Clean Air Act neither compels nor permits the EPA to adopt an interpretation of the Act requiring a source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit on the sole basis of its potential greenhouse-gas emissions; but 2) affirmed in part, where the EPA reasonably interpreted the Act to require sources that would need permits based on their emission of conventional pollutants to comply with the ""best available control technology"" (BACT) requirement for greenhouse gases."

C. section 1983 action alleging that defendants had violated the First Amendment by firing plaintiff-public employee in retaliation for testifying against another official in the organization, summary judgment for defendant holding that the individual-capacity claims were barred by qualified immunity and the official-capacity claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment is: 1) reversed in part, where the First Amendment protects a public employee who provides truthful sworn testimony, compelled by subpoena, outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities; 2) affirmed in part, where defendant Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him in his individual capacity; and 3) reversed in part and remanded, where the Eleventh Circuit did not consider the dismissal of the claims against defendant Burrows, the successor president of the organization, in her official capacity.

NML Capital, Ltd., 12-842| 12-842|In an action brought by a plaintiff-bondholder against Argentina to enforce judgments it obtained, the district court's order granting plaintiff-bondholder's motion to compel compliance with subpoenas on two non-party banks for records relating to Argentina's global financial transactions, is affirmed, where no provision in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 immunizes a foreign-sovereign judgment debtor from post-judgment discovery of information concerning its extraterritorial assets.
Abramski v. United States, 12-1493| 12-1493|"Defendant's convictions for knowingly making false statements with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of a gun under 18 U. S. C. section 922(a)(6), and for making a false statement with respect to the information required to be kept in the gun dealer's records under section 924(a)(1)(A), are affirmed, where: 1) defendant answered falsely on the form he filled out that he was the actual buyer of a gun when he was buying it for his uncle; 2) defendant's misrepresentation is material under section 922(a)(6); 3) defendant's misrepresentation about the identity of the actual buyer concerned ""information required by to be kept"" in the dealer’s records; and 4) such a misrepresentation is punishable under the statute, whether or not the true buyer could have purchased the gun without the straw purchaser."
Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 13-193| 13-193|Dismissal of plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to an Ohio law that criminalizes certain false statements made during the course of a political campaign, is reversed and remanded, where plaintiffs have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for Article III purposes.
POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 12-761| 12-761|In a Lanham Act suit brought by one beverage company against another, alleging that the name, label, marketing, and advertising of one of defendant's juice blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices, partial summary judgment to defendant on grounds that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its regulations preclude Lanham Act challenges to the name and label of the juice blend is reversed where competitors may bring Lanham Act claims like plaintiff's challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the FDCA.
Clark v. Rameker, 13-299| 13-299|"In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in which plaintiffs sought to exclude roughly $300,000 in an inherited individual retirement account (IRA) from the bankruptcy estate using the ""retirement funds"" exemption, 11 U.S.C. section 522(b)(3)(C), the Seventh Circuit's ruling that the exemption does not apply is affirmed where funds held in inherited IRAs are not ""retirement funds"" within the meaning of section 522(b)(3)(C)."
CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 13-339| 13-339|In an action in which plaintiffs brought suit against defendant alleging damages from stored contaminants on land that defendant had sold twenty-four years prior, defendant was entitled to dismissal of the suit, where: 1) the action was subject to a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant's last culpable act; and 2) 42 U.S.C. section 9658, which preempts statutes of limitations applicable to state-law tort actions in certain circumstances, does not preempt the state statute of repose here because, 42 U. S. C. section 9658 preempts only statutes of limitation and not statutes of repose.
Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio, 12-930| 12-930|The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) unambiguously entitled all aged-out derivative beneficiaries on whose behalf parents filed immigration petitions  to automatic conversion and prior priority date retention, where the Board of Immigration Appeals permissibly interpreted the CSPA as providing relief to only a subset of that group, specifically, those aged-out aliens who qualified or could have qualified as principal beneficiaries of a visa petition, rather than only as derivative beneficiaries piggy-backing on a parent.
Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 12-1200| 12-1200|"In an action brought by the bankruptcy trustee alleging the fraudulent conveyance of assets from the bankruptcy debtor to defendant, judgment in favor of the trustee is affirmed, where: 1) under the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, federal district courts have original jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory categories of proceedings: ""core"" proceedings, where bankruptcy judge may hear and determine and enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to the district court’s traditional appellate review,  and ""non-core"" proceedings, where final judgment must be entered by the district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judge’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent; 2)  in Stern v. Marshall, the Court held that Article III prohibits Congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to finally adjudicate the ""core"" claim of tortious interference; 2)  where a claim otherwise satisfies 28 U. S. C.  section 157(c)(1), the bankruptcy court should simply treat the Stern claim as non-core; 3) section 157(c)(1)’s procedures apply to the fraudulent conveyance claims here, and therefore the bankruptcy court would have been permitted to follow that provision's procedures, i.e., to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review; and 4) the district court's de novo review of the bankruptcy court's order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any potential error in the bankruptcy court's entry of judgment."
Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Technologies, Inc., 12-786| 12-786|A defendant is not liable for inducing infringement of a patent under 35 U. S. C. section 271(b) when no one has directly infringed the patent under section 271(a) or any other statutory provision, and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.
Bond v. United States, 12-158| 12-158|Defendant's crime of simple assault, carried out by spreading two toxic chemicals on the victim's car, mailbox, and door knob in hopes that the victim would develop an uncomfortable rash, does not come within the scope of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998, which makes it a federal crime for a person to use or possess any chemical weapon. The Third Circuit Court of Appeal's conclusion otherwise is therefore reversed and remanded.
Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 13-369| 13-369|"In a patent infringement suit alleging that defendant, without obtaining a license, sold exercise machines containing plaintiff's patented technology for a heart-rate monitor used with exercise equipment, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals erred in concluding that plaintiff's patent survived indefiniteness review under its articulated standard, where: 1) a patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the patent's specification and prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention; 2) definiteness is to be evaluated from the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant art, claims are to be read in light of the patent's specification and prosecution history, and definiteness is to be measured as of the time of the patent application; 3) the Federal Circuit’s standard that a patent claim passes the threshold so long as the claim is ""amenable to construction,"" and the claim, as construed, is not ""insolubly ambiguous,"" does not satisfy the Patent Act's definiteness requirement; and 4) the matter must be remanded so that the Federal Circuit can reconsider, under the proper standard, whether the relevant claims in the subject patent are sufficiently definite."
Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, 13-719| 13-719|In this putative class action for which respondent seeks compensation for damages class members allegedly sustained when petitioners underpaid oil and gas lease royalties, petitioner removed the case to Federal District Court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) on grounds that the amount in controversy exceeded $5 million.  Respondent subsequently moved to remand to state court, arguing that the removal notice was deficient as a matter of law because it included no evidence proving the amount in controversy was greater than $5 million, and the remand motion was granted.  The judgment of the District Court is vacated and remanded, where: 1) to remove a case from state court to federal court, a defendant must file a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal (28 U.S.C. section 1446(a)); and 2) the short and plain statement need not contain evidentiary submissions.
Heien v. North Carolina, 13-604| 13-604|In this search and seizure case, a police officer stopped petitioner's vehicle because one of its two brake lights was out, but a court later determined that a single working brake light was all the law required and was not grounds for a stop.  During the stop, petitioner gave his consent to allow the officer to search the vehicle, and was subsequently arrest and charged with attempted trafficking after cocaine was found inside.  The decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversing the denial of petitioner's motion to suppress the seized evidence is reversed in turn, where the officer's mistaken understanding of the law was reasonable, and thus the stop was valid.
Warger v. Shauers, 13-517| 13-517|Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) precludes a party seeking a new trial from using one juror's affidavit of what another juror said in deliberations to demonstrate the other juror's dishonesty during voir dire.
Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk, 13-433| 13-433|In this case, petitioner-employer required its employees to undergo an antitheft security screening before leaving the warehouse each day.  Judgment in favor of respondent-employees is reversed, where the time that employees spent waiting to undergo and undergoing the security screenings is not compensable.
Glebe v. Frost, 14-95| 14-95|In this case, the trial court restricted the defense's closing arguments, which defendant asserts constituted structural error requiring automatic reversal.  Judgment of the Ninth Circuit reversing defendant's conviction on various robbery, burglary, and assault counts, and instructing the District Court to grant habeas relief, is reversed and remanded, where: 1) even assuming, for argument's sake, that the trial court violated the Constitution in restricting the defense's closing arguments, it was not clearly established that its mistake ranked as structural error; and 2) the restriction, which precluded the defense from simultaneously contesting reasonable doubt and claiming duress, does not suggest structural error due to supposed extraction of a tacit admission to elements of the crimes, given that the introduction of a coerced confession is classified only as a trial error.
Lopez v. Smith, 13-946| 13-946|Judgment granting habeas relief to defendant Smith is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings, where: 1) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1), a federal court may grant habeas relief on grounds that a state court misapplied federal law in adjudicating a claim on the merits only if the state court's decision was contrary to, or involved the unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; and 2) the Ninth Circuit cited only its own precedent for establishing the appropriate standard of notice applicable in cases like this, thus failing to comply with the requirements of section 2254(d)(1).
Carroll v. Carman, 14-212| 14-212|"In this case, plaintiffs sued defendant police officer under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 for, as they allege, unlawfully entering their property in violation of the Fourth Amendment when the officer went into their backyard and onto their deck without a warrant.  Judgment of the Third Circuit finding that the officer violated the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law because the ""knock and talk"" exception requires that police officers begin their encounter at the front door, where they have an implied invitation to go, and finding that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated clearly established law, is reversed as to the determination that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity, where: 1) a government official sued under section 1983 is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statuary or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct; and 2) existing precedent did not put a statutory or constitutional question at-issue in the circumstances here described."
