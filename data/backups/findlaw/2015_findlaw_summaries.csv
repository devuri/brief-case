M&G Polymers USA v. Tackett, 13-1010| 13-1010|In this case, plaintiff retired employees sued defendant, their former employer, asserting that certain expired collective-bargaining agreements created a right to lifetime contribution-free healthcare benefits for retirees, their surviving spouses, and their dependents.  The Sixth Circuit sided with the retirees, arguing under International Union, United Auto, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Yard-Man, Inc. that retiree healthcare benefits are unlikely to be left up to future negotiations.  The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded, where Yard-Man inferences are inconsistent with ordinary principles of contract law, given that: 1) retiree healthcare benefits are not a form of deferred compensation; 2) requiring a contract to include a specific durational clause for retiree healthcare benefits to prevent vesting conflicts with the principle of contract law that the written agreement is presumed to encompass the whole agreement of the parties; and 3) when a contract is silent as to the duration of retiree benefits, a court may not infer that the parties intended those benefits to vest for life.
Department of Homeland Security v. MacLean, 13-894| 13-894|"In this whistleblower case, plaintiff federal air marshal publicly disclosed that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) had decided to cut costs by removing air marshals from certain flights.  He was subsequently fired for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.  The Federal Circuit vacated the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board finding that plaintiff was not entitled to whistleblower protection for the disclosures he made, which were specifically prohibited by TSA's promulgated regulation (49 CFR section 1520.7(j)).  The judgment of the Federal Circuit is affirmed, where: 1) when Congress used the phrase ""specifically prohibited by law"" to create an exception to the protections of the Whistleblower statute (5 U.S.C. section 2302(b)(8)(A)) instead of ""specifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation,"" it meant to exclude rules and regulations, and as such, the TSA's regulations do not qualify as ""law"" for the purposes of section 2302(b)(8)(A); and 2) 49 U.S.C. section 114(r)(1), does not prohibit any disclosures itself, but instead only authorizes the Under Secretary to ""prescribe regulations."""
Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp., 13-1174| 13-1174|In this multi-district class action, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss without leave to amend, and the 2nd Circuit, acting on its own motion, dismissed the appeal filed by plaintiffs Gelboim and Zacher for want of appellate jurisdiction. The judgment of the Second Circuit is reversed, where: 1) the Gelboim-Zacher complaint retained its independent status for purposes of appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1291; and 2) plaintiffs' right to appeal ripened when the district court dismissed their case, not upon eventual completion of multi-district proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.
Hana Financial, Inc. v. Hana Bank, 13-1211| 13-1211|In this trademark infringement case, defendant invoked the tacking doctrine, under which lower courts have provided that a trademark user may make certain modifications to its mark over time while, in limited circumstances, retaining its priority position. The district court adopted in substantial part the jury instruction on tacking proposed by plaintiff, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's subsequent verdict in defendant's favor, explaining that the tacking inquiry was an exceptionally limited and highly sensitive matter reserved for juries, not judges. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, where it correctly held that whether two marks may be tacked for purposes of determining priority is a question for the jury.
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 13-854| 13-854|"In this patent infringement case involving a multiple sclerosis drug, the district court concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite and the patent was valid. The Federal Circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the district court's claim construction and reversed, finding the ""molecular weight"" term indefinite and the patent invalid. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is vacated and remanded, where, in reviewing a district court's resolution of subsidiary factual matters made in the course of its construction of a patent claim, the Federal Circuit must apply a ""clear error, "" not a de novo, standard of review."
Christeson v. Roper, 14-6873| 14-6873|In this case, petitioner's first federal habeas petition was dismissed as untimely, and because his appointed attorneys had missed the filing deadline, they could not be expected to argue that petitioner was entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.  Petitioner thus requested substitute counsel unaffected by the conflict of interest.  Judgment denying petitioner's motion is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings, where: 1) 18 U.S.C. section 3599, which entitles indigent defendants to appointment of counsel in capital cases, does not give capital habeas petitioners the right to select the counsel of their choice, but does contemplate that a court may replace appointed counsel with similarly qualified counsel upon motion of the petitioner; 2) the denial of petitioner's motion did not adequately account for all the factors set forth in the Supreme Court's controlling decision in Martel v. Clair; and 3) Clair makes clear that a conflict, as here, in which counsel's contentions were directly and concededly contrary to their client's interest and manifestly served their own professional and reputational interests, is grounds for substitution.
Holt v. Hobbs, 13-6827| 13-6827|Petitioner is an Arkansas inmate and devout Muslim who wishes to grow a .5 inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs. The Arkansas Department of Correction's (the Department) grooming policy, however, prohibits inmates from growing beards unless they have a particular dermatological condition. Judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals holding that the Department had satisfied its burden of showing that the grooming policy was the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling interests is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, where: the Department's grooming policy substantially burdens petitioner's religious exercise; 2) the Department has a compelling interest in stopping the flow of contraband and facilitating prisoner identification; 3) it is questionable whether the prohibition against petitioner's beard furthers the Department's compelling interest in stopping the flow of contraband; and 4) the Department has failed to show that its policy is the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling interests.
Jennings v. Stephens, 13-7211| 13-7211|In this habeas proceeding, petitioner Jennings sought federal habeas relief on the basis of three ineffective assistance of counsel theories (two based on Wiggins v. Smith, and one based on Smith v. Spisak, that his counsel expressed resignation to a death sentence during his closing argument).  The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of habeas corpus under the two Wiggins theories and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the Spisak claim, further noting that Jennings neither filed a timely notice of appeal nor obtained a certificate of appealability.  The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded for consideration of Jennings' Spisak claim, where, because the Spisak theory would neither have enlarged his rights nor diminished the State's rights under the district court's judgment, Jennings was required neither to take a cross-appeal nor to obtain a certificate of appealability.
T-Mobile South v. City of Roswell, 13-975| 13-975|"In this case, plaintiff-telecom alleges that defendant City's denial of their application to build a cell phone tower on residential property was not supported by substantial evidence on the record.  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit reversed the decision of the district court, finding that the requirements of the Telecommunications Act were satisfied here because plaintiff had received a denial letter and possessed a transcript of the hearing on the matter that it arranged to have recorded.  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed and remanded, where: 1) the Telecommunications Act requires that localities provide or make available their reasons for denying telecommunication companies' applications to construct cell phone towers, but those reasons need not appear in the written denial letters or notices themselves, and may be stated with sufficient clarity in some other written record issued ""essentially contemporaneously"" with the denial; and 2) in this case, the City provided its reasons in writing and did so in the acceptable form of detailed minutes of the City Council meeting, but did not provide these reasons ""essentially contemporaneously"" with its written denial (defendant waited 26 days after the date of the written denial and just 4 days before plaintiff's time to seek judicial review would have expired)."
Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 13-684| 13-684|In this case, petitioners borrowed from respondent and, exactly three years later, mailed respondents a letter purporting to rescind the loan pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act.  Respondent refused to acknowledge the validity of the rescission.  Judgment entered on the pleadings for respondents is reversed and remanded, where a borrower exercising his right to rescind under the Act need only provide written notice to his lender within three years of the date the loan was consummated, not file suit within that period.
Whitfield v. US, 13-9026| 13-9026|"In this case, petitioner fled police after a botched bank robbery, entered the home of a 79-year-old lady through an unlocked door, guided the lady through the hallway to a room, where she suffered a fatal heart attack. Petitioner was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. section 2113(e), which establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who ""forces a person to accompany him"" in the court of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery. Judgment of the Fourth Circuit finding that petitioner's movement with the deceased qualified as forced accompaniment is affirmed, where a bank robber forces a person to accompany him, for purposes of section 2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance."
Yates v. US, 13-7451| 13-7451|"In this case, petitioner Yates was a ship captain who was found by a federal agent to have caught undersized red grouper fish in violation of federal conservation regulations and instructed by the federal agent to keep the fish segregated until the ship returned to port.  Instead, Yates told a crew member to throw the undersized fish overboard.  Yates was thereafter convicted of impeding a federal investigation by knowingly altering, destroying, mutilating, concealing, covering up, falsifying, or making a false entry in any record, document, or ""tangible object"" in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1519, and was also convicted under section 2232(a) for destroying or removing property to prevent seizure.  Yates does not contest his section 2232(a) conviction, but he maintains that fish are not trapped within the term ""tangible object,"" as that term is used in section 1519.  The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded, where a ""tangible object"" within the meaning of section 1519 is one used to record or preserve information, and fish do not meet such criteria."
North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, 13-534| 13-534|"The North Carolina Dental Practice Act provides that the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is the agency of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.  The Act does not, however, specify that teeth whitening is ""the practice of dentistry.""  In this antitrust case, upon complaint that non-dentists were providing teeth whitening serves in North Carolina, the Board began various actions that led non-dentists to cease offering such services.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed the Federal Trade Commission's ruling that the Board is not entitled to state-action immunity and that the Board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law.  The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is affirmed, where, because a controlling number of the Board's decision makers are active market participants in the occupation that the Board regulates, it can invoke state-action antitrust immunity only if it was subject to active supervision by the State, and here that requirement was not met."
Kansas v. Nebraska, 126| 126|In this case, plaintiff Kansas and defendant Nebraska engaged in litigation concerning a dispute over their rights to the waters of the Republican River Basin, as set out in an interstate compact.  The first round of litigation ended with a settlement agreement designed to promote future compliance with the compact's terms.  Kansas seeks exceptional relief, both partial disgorgement of gains and an injunction, for Nebraska's conceded overconsumption of water.  The case was referred to a Special Master who made recommendations as to appropriate equitable remedies.  The recommendations of the Special Master granting partial disgorgement but no injunction for Kansas, and reforming the technical appendix to the settlement for Nebraska, are adopted, where: 1) compelling Nebraska to disgorge profits deters it from taking advantage of its upstream position to appropriate more water than the compact allows; and 2) amending the Accounting Procedures ensures that the compact's provisions will govern the division of only the Basin's water supply.
Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 14–15| 14–15|Respondents, providers of habilitation services, sued petitioners, Idaho Health and Welfare Department officials, claiming that Idaho reimbursed them at rates lower than section 30(a) of the Medicaid Act permits.  Respondents sought to enjoin petitioners to increase these rates.  The District Court entered summary judgment for respondent-providers, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Supremacy Clause gave the providers an implied right of action, and that they could sue under this implied right of action to seek an injunction requiring Idaho to comply with section 30(a).  The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, where: 1) the Supremacy Clause does not confer a private right of action; 2) the Supremacy Clause instructs courts to give federal law priority when state and federal law clash, but it is not the source of any federal rights and does not create a cause of action; and 3) Medicaid providers cannot sue for an injunction requiring compliance with section 30(a).
Woods v. Donald, 14–618| 14–618|"In this habeas corpus action, the Sixth Circuit held that defendant Donald's attorney provided per se ineffective assistance of counsel under US v. Cronic when he was briefly absent during testimony concerning other defendants.  The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, where: 1) Cronic applies in circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified; and 2) the Michigan Court of Appeals' refusal to apply Cronic to these circumstances was not the ""extreme malfunction"" required for federal habeas relief."
Grady v. North Carolina, 14–593| 14–593|Petitioner was convicted in North Carolina trial courts of a second degree sexual offense in 1997 and of taking indecent liberties with a child in 2006, and after serving his sentence of the 2006 crime, petitioner was ordered to appear for a hearing to determine whether he should be subjected to satellite-based monitoring (SBM) as a recidivist sex offender.  Petitioner argued that the monitoring program would violate his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, but the trial court disagreed and ordered petitioner to enroll and be monitored for the rest of his life.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed.  The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings, where: 1) the State's program is plainly designed to obtain information, and since it does so by physically intruding on a subject's body, it effects a Fourth Amendment search; 2) Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, and the reasonableness depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature and purpose of the search and the extent to which the search intrudes upon reasonable privacy expectations; and 3) the North Carolina courts did not examine whether the monitoring program was reasonable when properly viewed as a search.
Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 13-895| 13-895|"In 2012, defendant Alabama redrew the boundaries of the State's House districts and Senate districts.  Plaintiffs claim that Alabama's new district boundaries create a ""racial gerrymander"" in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause.  After a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of the State.  The judgment is vacated and remanded, where: 1) the district court's analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim as referring to the State ""as a whole,"" rather than district-by-district, was legally erroneous; 2) the district court erred in decided that plaintiff Alabama Democratic Conference lacked standing, as in these circumstances, elementary principles of procedural fairness required that the district court, rather than acting sua sponte, give the Conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence; 3) the district court did not properly calculate ""predominance"" in its alternative holding that ""race was not the predominant motivating factor"" in the creation of any of the challenged districts; 4) there is strong evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26; and 5) section 5 of the Voting Rights Act does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage, it requires that the jurisdiction maintain a minority's ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice."
Young v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 12-1226| 12-1226|When plaintiff became pregnant, she was told by her employer, defendant United Parcel Service, that she could not work while under a pregnancy lifting restriction due to the nature of her job as a part-time driver handling packages.  Plaintiff alleges that defendant acted unlawfully in refusing to accommodate her pregnancy-related lifting restriction.  Plaintiff further alleges that defendant had, pursuant to its internal policies, accommodated several individuals whose disabilities created work restrictions similar to hers.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded, where: 1) the Pregnancy Discrimination Act requires that employers provide similar accommodations as they do to any other persons who are similar in their ability or inability to work; 2) a pregnant worker demonstrating disparate treatment may make out a prima facie case under the McDonnell Douglas framework by showing that she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her, and that the employer did accommodate others similarly situated in their ability to work; 3) there is a genuine dispute as to whether defendant provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from plaintiff's; 4) plaintiff introduced evidence that defendant had three separate accommodation policies, and taken together, these policies significantly burdened pregnant women; and 5) the Fourth Circuit did not consider the combined effects of these policies, nor did it consider the strength of defendant's justifications for each when combined.
B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 13-352| 13-352|Respondent Hargis Industries (Hargis) attempted to register its trademark for SEALTITE with the US Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to the Lanham Act, but petitioner B&B Hardware (B&B) opposed registration, claiming that SEALTITE is too similar to B&B's own SEALTIGHT trademark.  The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) concluded that SEALTITE should not be registered due to likelihood of confusion between the two marks, while later, in an infringement suit before the district court, B&B argued that Hargis was precluded from contesting the likelihood of confusion issue because of the TTAB's decision.  The district court disagreed and the Eight Circuit affirmed, holding that preclusion was unwarranted.  The judgment of the Eighth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, where a court should give preclusive effect to TTAB decisions so long as the ordinary elements of issue preclusion are met.
Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund, 13-435| 13-435|"In this securities action, petitioner Omnicare, a pharmacy services company, filed a registration statement in connection with a public offering of common stock, and in addition to the required disclosures, the registration statement contained two statements expressing the company's opinion that it was in compliance with federal and state laws.  After the Federal Government field suit against Omnicare for allegedly receiving kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers, respondent pension funds that purchased stock sued Omnicare under section 11 of the Securities Act, claiming that Omnicare's legal-compliance statements constituted ""untrue statements of material fact"" and that Omnicare ""omitted to state the facts necessary"" to make those statements not misleading.  The district court granted Omnicare's motion to dismiss and the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that no showing of subjective disbelief was required, and that the allegations that Omnicare's legal-compliance opinions were objectively false sufficed to support respondents' claim.  The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is vacated and the case is remanded, where: 1) because a statement of opinion admits the possibility of error, such a statement remains true, and thus is not an ""untrue statement of fact,"" even if the opinion turns out to have been wrong; 2) a statement of opinion qualifies as an ""untrue statement of fact"" if the opinion expressed was not sincerely held, but Omnicare's sincerity is not contested here; 3) if a registration statement omits material facts about the issuer's inquiry into, or knowledge concerning, a state of opinion, and those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself, then the section 11 omissions create liability."
Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association, 13-1041| 13-1041|In this case, in 2006 the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (the Department) issued an opinion letter finding that mortgage-loan officers fell within the administrative except to overtime pay requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and in 2010 the Department withdrew the 2006 opinion letter without notice or an opportunity to comment and issued an Administrator's Interpretation concluding that mortgage-loan officers do not qualify for the administrative exception.  Respondent filed suit contending that the Administrator's Interpretation was procedurally invalid under the D.C. Circuit's decision in Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena L.P, which holds that an agency must use the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA) notice-and-comment procedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from a previously adopted interpretation.  The district court granted summary judgment to the Department, but the D.C. Circuit applied Paralyzed Veterans and reversed.  The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, where: 1) the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is contrary to the clear test of the APA's rule making provisions and improperly imposes on agencies an obligation beyond the APA's maximum procedural requirements; and 2) APA section 4 specifically exempts interpretive rules from notice-and-comment requirements.
Dep't of Transp. v. Ass'n of American Railroads, 13-1080| 13-1080|"In this case, in 2008 Congress gave the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue ""metrics and standards"" addressing the performance and scheduling of passenger railroad services pursuant to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act section 207(a), including Amtrak's on-time performance and train delays caused by host railroads.  Respondent Association of American Railroads sued petitioners, claiming that the metrics and standards must be invalidated because it is unconstitutional for Congress to allow and direct a private entity like Amtrak to exercise joint authority in their issuance on separation of powers grounds.  The district court rejected respondent's claims, but the circuit court reversed as to the separation of powers claim, reasoning that Amtrak is a private corporation and thus cannot constitutionally be granted regulatory power under section 207.  The judgment of the circuit court is vacated and the case is remanded, where, for the purposes of determining the validity of the metrics and standards, Amtrak is a governmental entity, as given that Amtrak was created by the government, is controlled by the government, and operates for the government's benefit, it is not an autonomous private enterprise."
Kansas v. Nebraska, 126| 126|In this case in which plaintiff Kansas and defendant Nebraska engaged in litigation concerning a dispute over their rights to the waters of the Republican River basin, as set out in an interstate compact, the recommendations of the Special Master granting partial disgorgement of profits but no injunction for Kansas were adopted.  The Court now decrees: 1) Nebraska is not liable for evaporative losses from Harlan County Lake during 2006; 2) Evaporation from the non-federal reservoirs located in Nebraska is a Beneficial Consumptive use under the Compact and must be accounted for as such; 3) Nebraska's consumption in 2005 and 2006 exceeded its Compact allocation; 4) Nebraska must pay $5.5 million within 60 days of this order; 5) the parties respective responsibilities for the fees and costs awarded to the Special Master are Kansas (40%), Nebraska (40%), and Colorado (20%); and 6) the parties' previous payments made to the Special Master discharge in full their respective obligations to pay for or share among themselves fees and costs awarded to the Special Master together with any costs that might have otherwise been assessed.
Alabama Dep't of Revenue v. CSX Transp., Inc., 13-553| 13-553|In this case, plaintiff, an interstate rail carrier that operates in Alabama, sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases, claiming that the State's asymmetrical tax treatment (in which railroads are taxed on purchase of diesel fuel, but motor carriers and water carriers are not) discriminates against rail carriers in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulation Reform Act, or 49 U.S.C. section 11501(b)(4).  The district court rejected plaintiff's claim, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that plaintiff could establish discrimination by showing that Alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors.  The judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded, where: 1) plaintiff's competitors are an appropriate comparison class for its section 11501(b)(4) claim; 2) the Eleventh Circuit erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax; 3) a tax does not discriminate against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt, since both competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other; 4) an alternative, roughly equivalent fuel-excise tax is one possible justification that renders the tax disparity non-discriminatory; and 5) on remand the Eleventh Circuit must consider whether the fuel-excise tax is the rough equivalent of the sales tax as applied to diesel fuel.
Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, 13-1032| 13-1032|"In this case, petitioner, a trade association of retailers, many of which sell to Colorado residents but do not collect taxes, allege that a Colorado law requiring noncollecting retailers to notify any Colorado customer of the State's sales and use tax requirement and to report tax-related information to those customers and the Colorado Department of Revenue violates the United States and Colorado Constitutions.  The Tenth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to petitioner and permanent injunction against enforcement of the notice and reporting requirements, holding that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA) deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the suit.  The judgment of the Tenth Circuit is reversed and remanded, where: 1) petitioner's suit is not barred by the TIA, as the relief sought by petitioner would not ""enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection"" of Colorado's sales and use taxes; 2) petitioner's suit cannot be understood to ""restrain"" the ""assessment, levy, or collection"" of Colorado's sales and use taxes merely because it may inhibit those activities; and 3) it is left to the Tenth Circuit on remand as to whether the comity argument remains available to Colorado."
Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 13-1499| 13-1499|Disciplinary sanctions imposed by the state bar, pursuant to Cannon 7(C)(1), on a candidate for judicial office, who mailed and posted online a letter soliciting financial contributions for her campaign, are affirmed over a First Amendment challenge, where Cannon 7(C)(1) is narrowly tailored to serve the State's compelling interest.
Mach Mining, LLC v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 13-1019| 13-1019|In an unlawful hiring case, the Seventh Circuit's holding that the EEOC's conciliation obligation with employer was unreviewable is reversed where: 1) courts have authority to review whether the EEOC has fulfilled its Title VII duty to attempt conciliation; and 2) the appropriate scope of judicial review of the EEOC's conciliation activities is narrow, enforcing only the EEOC's statutory obligation to give the employer notice and an opportunity to achieve voluntary compliance.
US v. Wong, 13-1074| 13-1074|In suits under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FCTA), the time limits of 28 U.S.C. section 2401(b) are subject to equitable tolling, and the Ninth Circuit's judgment is affirmed where the Government's arguments for treating section 2401(b)'s time limits as jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling are unpersuasive.
Rodriguez v. US, 13-9972| 13-9972|Absent reasonable suspicion, police extension of a traffic stop in order to conduct a dog sniff violates the Constitution's shield against unreasonable seizures. On remand, the Eight Circuit is to consider the District Court's determination that detention for the dog sniff was not independently supported by individualized suspicion.
Oneok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc, 13-271| 13-271|In a suit alleging interstate natural gas pipelines violated state antitrust law by reporting false information to natural-gas indices, which affected wholesale and retail natural gas prices, the Ninth Circuit's ruling is affirmed where the state-law antitrust claims are not within the field of matters pre-empted by the Natural Gas Act.
Commil USA, LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 13-896| 13-896|In a case alleging direct and induced infringement of a patent for a method of implementing short-range wireless networks, the Federal Circuit's judgment that the trial court erred in excluding defendant's evidence of its good-faith belief that plaintiff's patent was invalid, is vacated and remanded where a defendant's belief regarding patent validity is not a defense to an induced infringement claim.
Kellogg Brown & Root Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Carter, 12-1497| 12-1497|In a qui tam action under the False Claims Act (FCA), alleging that defense contractors and related entities had fraudulently billed the Government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly, the Fourth Circuit's judgment that the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act (WSLA), which suspends the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense involving fraud against the Federal Government, applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed, is: 1) reversed in part where the WSLA applies only to criminal offenses, not to civil claims like those in this case; and 2) affirmed in part where the FCA's first-to-file bar keeps new claims out of court only while related claims are still alive, not in perpetuity, and thus, dismissal with prejudice was not called for in this case.
Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 13-935| 13-935|In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case involving a debtor's purported alter ego and Stern claim, the Seventh Circuit's judgment is reversed and remanded where Article III permits bankruptcy judges to adjudicate Stern claims with the parties' knowing and voluntary consent.

Henderson v. US, 13-1487| 13-1487|A court-ordered transfer of a felon's lawfully owned firearms from Government custody to a third party is not barred by 18 U.S.C. section 922(g) if the court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over the firearms, so that he could either use them or direct their use. Federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding to its rightful owner. Section 922(g), however, bars a court from ordering guns returned to a felon-owner like Henderson, because that would place the owner in violation of the law. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.
City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 13-1412| 13-1412|"In a case involving an individual who was arrested after she threatened to kill her social worker and police officers, alleging violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) when police arrested her without accommodating her disability, 42 U.S.C. section 12132, the Ninth Circuit's judgment is reversed where the officers are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for the injuries suffered by plaintiff. The question of whether section 12132 ""requires law enforcement officers to provide accommodations to an armed, violent, and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody,"" is dismissed as improvidently granted."
Coleman v.

C. section 1983, against various entities and individuals connected with a correctional institution, who plaintiffs claimed violated decedent's civil rights in failing to prevent his suicide, the Third Circuit's denial of defendants' motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is reversed where:1) even if the institution's suicide screening and prevention measures contained the shortcomings that plaintiffs allege, no precedent on the books in November 2004 would have made clear to petitioners that they were overseeing a system that violated the Constitution; and 2) because, at the very least, defendants were not contravening clearly established law, they are entitled to qualified immunity.
Mellouli v.
