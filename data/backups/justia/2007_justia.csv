06-571|"WATSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 06571.Argued October 9, 2007Decided December 10, 2007
After trading a controlled substance for a pistol, petitioner Watson was indicted for, inter alia, violating 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(A), which sets a mandatory minimum sentence, depending on the facts, for a defendant who, during and in relation to any  drug trafficking crime[,]  uses  a firearm.  The statute does not define uses, but this Court has spoken to it twice.  In holding that a criminal who trades his firearm for drugs uses it  within the meaning of 924(c)(1), Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 241, the Court rested primarily on the ordinary or natural meaning of the verb in context, id., at 228, understanding its common range as going beyond employment as a weapon to trading a weapon for drugs, id., at 230.  Later, in holding that merely possessing a firearm kept near the scene of drug trafficking is not use under 924(c)(1), the Court, in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, again looked to ordinary or natural meaning, id., at 145, deciding that 924(c)(1) requires evidence sufficient to show an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense, id., at 143.  Watson pleaded guilty but reserved the right to challenge the factual basis for a 924(c)(1)(A) conviction and sentence.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed on its precedent foreclosing any argument that Watson had not used a firearm.
Held:A person does not use a firearm under 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(A) when he receives it in trade for drugs.  Pp. 49.
(a)The Governments position lacks authority in either precedent or regular English.  Neither Smith, which addressed only the trader who swaps his gun for drugs, not the trading partner who ends up with the gun, nor Bailey, which ruled that a gun must be made use of actively to satisfy 924(c)(1)(A), decides this case.  With no statutory definition, the meaning of uses has to turn on everyday meaning revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as both reasonable and normal.  Smith, supra, 228, 230.  When Watson handed over the drugs for the pistol, the officer used the pistol to get the drugs, but regular speech would not say that Watson himself used the pistol in the trade.  Pp. 45.


(b)The Governments first effort to trump ordinary English is rejected.  Noting that 924(d)(1) authorizes seizure and forfeiture of firearms intended to be used in certain crimes, the Government infers that since some of those offenses involve receipt of a firearm, use necessarily includes receipt of a gun even in a barter transaction.  The Governments reliance on Smith for the proposition that the term must be given the same meaning in both subsections overreads Smith.  The common verb use is not at odds in the two subsections but speaks to different issues in different voices and at different levels of specificity.  Section 924(d)(1) indicates that a gun can be used in a receipt crime, but does not say whether both parties to a transfer use the gun, or only one, or which one; however, 924(c)(1)(A) requires just such a specific identification.  Pp. 57.


(c)Nor is the Governments second effort to trump ordinary English persuasive.  It claims that failing to treat receipt in trade as use would create unacceptable asymmetry with Smith; i.e., it would be strange to penalize one side of a gun-for-drugs exchange but not the other.  The problem is not with Smith, however, but with the limited malleability of the language it construed, and policy-driven symmetry cannot turn receipt-in-trade into use.  Whatever the tension between the prior result and the outcome here, law depends on respect for language and would be served better by statutory amendment than by racking statutory language to cover a policy it fails to reach.  Pp. 89.
191 Fed. Appx. 326, reversed and remanded.
Souter, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Ginsburg, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

06-6330|"KIMBROUGH v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 066330.Argued October 2, 2007Decided December 10, 2007
Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and distribution of cocaine, 21 U. S.C. 841, and the relevant Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a drug trafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine.  Petitioner Kimbrough pleaded guilty to four offenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder; possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack; possession with intent to distribute powder; and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense.  Under the relevant statutes, Kimbroughs plea subjected him to a minimum prison term of 15 years and a maximum of life.  The applicable advisory Guidelines range was 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years.  The District Court found, however, that a sentence in this range would have been greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S.C. 3553(a).  In making that determination, the court relied in part on its view that Kimbroughs case exemplified the disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.  The court noted that if Kimbrough had possessed only powder cocaine, his Guidelines range would have been far lower: 97 to 106 months.  Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence was long enough to accomplish 3553(a)s objectives, the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months, in prison.  The Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence, finding that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder offenses.  
Held: 
1.Under United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only, and the Fourth Circuit erred in holding the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory.  A district judge must include the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting consideration, but the judge may determine that, in the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is greater than necessary to serve the objectives of sentencing, 3553(a).  In making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines treatment of crack and powder offenses.  Pp.521.


(a)Crack and powder cocaine have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but are handled very differently for sentencing purposes.  The relevant statutes and Guidelines employ a 100-to-1 ratio that yields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those for offenses involving equal amounts of powder.  Thus, a major supplier of powder may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys powder and converts it to crack.  Pp.511.


(1)The crack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), which created a two-tiered scheme of five- and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and distribution offenses.  Congress apparently adopted the 100-to-1 ratio because it believed that crack, a relatively new drug in 1986, was significantly more dangerous than powder.  Thus, the 1986 Acts five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 5 grams of  crack or 500 grams of powder, and its ten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder.  In developing Guidelines sentences for cocaine offenses, the Sentencing Commission employed the statutes weight-driven scheme, rather than its usual empirical approach based on past sentencing practices.  The statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the Guidelines used the 100-to-1 ratio to set sentences for a full range of drug quantities.  Pp.68.


(2)Based on additional research and experience with the 100-to-1 ratio, the Commission later determined that the crack/powder differential does not meet the objectives of the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.  The Commission also found the disparity inconsistent with the 1986 Acts goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level dealers, and furthermore observed that the differential fosters a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system because of a perception that it promotes an unwarranted divergence based on race.  Pp.810.


(3)The Commission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio.  Congress rejected a 1995 amendment to the Guidelines that would have replaced the 100-to-1 ratio with a 1-to-1 ratio, but directed the Commission to propose revision of the ratio under the relevant statutes and Guidelines.  Congress took no action after the Commissions 1997 and 2002 reports recommended changing the ratio. The Commissions 2007 report again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act, but the Commission also adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines.  The modest amendment, which became effective on November 1, 2007, yields sentences for crack offenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder.  The Commission thus noted that it is only a partial remedy to the problems generated by the crack/powder disparity.  Pp.1011.


(b)The federal sentencing statute, as modified by Booker, requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, but permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other [3553(a)] concerns as well, 543 U. S., at245246.  The Government contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100-to-1 ratio are an exception to this general freedom and offers three arguments in support of its position, each of which this Court rejects.  Pp.1121.


(1)The Government argues that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Commission and sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100-to-1 ratio.  This position lacks grounding in the statute, which, by its terms, mandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of possession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 40.  A person with 50 grams or more of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life.  The statute says nothing about appropriate sentences within these brackets, and this Court declines to read any implicit directive into the congressional silence.  See Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341.  Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here, because Congress knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.  See, e.g., 28 U. S.C. 994(h).  This cautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284, which involved different methods of calculating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) weights: The method applicable in determining statutory minimum sentences combined the weight of the pure drug and its carrier medium, while the one controlling the calculation of Guidelines ranges presumed a lower weight for the carrier medium.  This Court rejected the argument that the Guidelines and the statute should be interpreted consistently, with the Guidelines presumptive-weight method controlling the mandatory minimum calculation.  Were the Governments current position correct, the Guidelines involved in Neal would be in serious jeopardy.  The same reasons alleged to justify reading into the 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing courts to apply the 100-to-1 ratio to all crack quantities could be urged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the Commission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in calculating LSD weights.  Yet Neal never questioned the Guidelines validity, and in fact endorsed the Commissions freedom to adopt a new method.  If the 1986 Act does not require the Commission to adhere to the Acts method for determining LSD weights, it does not require the Commissionor, after Booker, sentencing courtsto adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio for crack quantities other than those triggering the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.  Pp.1316.


(2)The Government also argues that Congress made clear, in disapproving the Commissions 1995 proposed Guidelines amendment, that the 1986 Act required the Commission and courts to respect the 100-to-1 ratio.  But nothing in Congress 1995 action suggested that crack sentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1.  To the contrary, Congress required the Commission to recommend a revision of the ratio.  The Government argues that, by calling for recommendations to change both the statute and the Guidelines, Congress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of congressional action.  But the more likely reading is that Congress sought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines because the Commissions criticisms of the 100-to-1 ratio concerned the exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.  Moreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, which Congress did not disapprove or modify, the Guidelines now deviate from the statutes 100-to-1 ratio, advancing a ratio that varies (at different offense levels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1.  Pp.1618.


(3)Finally, the Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate from the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder ratio, unwarranted sentence disparities, 18 U. S.C. 3553(a)(6), will ensue.  The Government claims that, because sentencing courts remain bound by the 1986 Acts mandatory minimum sentences, deviations from the 100-to-1 ratio could result in sentencing cliffs around quantities triggering the mandatory minimums.  For example, a district court could grant a sizable downward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams of crack, but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose a much higher sentence for only 1 additional gram.  The LSD Guidelines approved in Neal, however, create a similar risk of sentencing cliffs.  The Government also maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, defendants will receive markedly different sentences depending on the particular judge drawn for sentencing.  While uniformity remains an important sentencing goal, Booker recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy that decision adopted.  And as to crack sentences in particular, possible variations among district courts are constrained by the 1986 Acts mandatory minimums.  Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of unwarranted sentence disparities within the meaning of 3353(a)(6), the proper solution is for district courts to take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the cliffs resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences and weigh these disparities against the other 3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparities created by the crack/powder ratio itself.  Pp.1820.


(c)Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543 U. S., at 245, but preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission.  In the ordinary case, the Commissions recommendation of a sentencing range will reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve 3553(a)s objectives.  Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 11).  The sentencing judge, on the other hand, is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under 3553(a) in each particular case.  Gall v. United States, ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district courts decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.  Rita, 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judges view that the Guidelines range fails properly to reflect 3553(a) considerations even in a mine-run case.  Ibid.  The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commissions exercise of its characteristic institutional role.  Given the Commissions departure from its empirical approach in formulating the crack Guidelines and its subsequent criticism of the crack/powder disparity, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve 3553(a)s purposes, even in a mine-run case.  Pp.2021.


2.The 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection.  The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range.  It then addressed the relevant 3553(a) factors, including the Sentencing Commissions reports criticizing the 100-to-1 ratio.  Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own, but appropriately framed its final determination in line with 3553(a)s overarching instruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in 3553(a)(2).  The court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and committed no procedural error, Gall, ante, at 17.  Kimbroughs sentence was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range.  But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbroughs case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commissions consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with 3553(a).  Giving due respect to the District Courts reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion.  Pp. 2123.

The LSD Guidelines approved in Neal, however, create a similar risk of sentencing cliffs.  The Government also maintains that, if district courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on their disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, defendants will receive markedly different sentences depending on the particular judge drawn for sentencing.  While uniformity remains an important sentencing goal, Booker recognized that some departures from uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy that decision adopted.  And as to crack sentences in particular, possible variations among district courts are constrained by the 1986 Acts mandatory minimums.  Moreover, to the extent that the Government correctly identifies risks of unwarranted sentence disparities within the meaning of 3353(a)(6), the proper solution is for district courts to take account of sentencing practices in other courts and the cliffs resulting from the statutory mandatory minimum sentences and weigh these disparities against the other 3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparities created by the crack/powder ratio itself.  Pp.1820.


(c)Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543 U. S., at 245, but preserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission.  In the ordinary case, the Commissions recommendation of a sentencing range will reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve 3553(a)s objectives.  Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 11).  The sentencing judge, on the other hand, is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under 3553(a) in each particular case.  Gall v. United States, ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of these discrete institutional strengths, a district courts decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.  Rita, 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  On the other hand, while the Guidelines are no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judges view that the Guidelines range fails properly to reflect 3553(a) considerations even in a mine-run case.  Ibid.  The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for elaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do not exemplify the Commissions exercise of its characteristic institutional role.  Given the Commissions departure from its empirical approach in formulating the crack Guidelines and its subsequent criticism of the crack/powder disparity, it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve 3553(a)s purposes, even in a mine-run case.  Pp.2021.


2.The 180-month sentence imposed on Kimbrough should survive appellate inspection.  The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range.  It then addressed the relevant 3553(a) factors, including the Sentencing Commissions reports criticizing the 100-to-1 ratio.  Finally, the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own, but appropriately framed its final determination in line with 3553(a)s overarching instruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in 3553(a)(2).  The court thus rested its sentence on the appropriate considerations and committed no procedural error, Gall, ante, at 17.  Kimbroughs sentence was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range.  But in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term, the District Court properly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbroughs case and accorded weight to the Sentencing Commissions consistent and emphatic position that the crack/powder disparity is at odds with 3553(a).  Giving due respect to the District Courts reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could not rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction Kimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion.

Petitioner Gall joined an ongoing enterprise distributing the controlled substance ecstasy while in college, but withdrew from the conspiracy after seven months, has sold no illegal drugs since, and has used no illegal drugs and worked steadily since graduation.  Three and half years after withdrawing from the conspiracy, Gall pleaded guilty to his participation.  A presentence report recommended a sentence of 30 to 37 months in prison, but the District Court sentenced Gall to 36 months probation, finding that probation reflected the seriousness of his offense and that imprisonment was unnecessary because his voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy and postoffense conduct showed that he would not return to criminal behavior and was not a danger to society.  The Eighth Circuit reversed on the ground that a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range must beand was not in this casesupported by extraordinary circumstances.
Held:
1.While the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentenceswhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines rangeunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.  Pp.714.


(a)Because the Guidelines are now advisory, appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are reasonable, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, and an abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.  A district judge must consider the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain the appropriateness of an unusually lenient or harsh sentence with sufficient justifications.  An appellate court may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines, but it may not require extraordinary circumstances or employ a rigid mathematical formula using a departures percentage as the standard for determining the strength of the justification required for a specific sentence.  Such approaches come too close to creating an impermissible unreasonableness presumption for sentences outside the Guidelines range.  The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.  And both approaches reflect a practice of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range, which is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisionswhether inside or outside that range.  Pp.710.


(b)A district court should begin by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.  The Guidelines are the starting point and initial benchmark but are not the only consideration.  After permitting both parties to argue for a particular sentence, the judge should consider all of 18 U. S.C. 3353(a)s factors to determine whether they support either partys proposal.  He may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable but must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.  If he decides on an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variation.  He must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.  In reviewing the sentence, the appellate court must first ensure that the district court made no significant procedural errors and then consider the sentences substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of a variance from the Guidelines range, but must give due deference to the district courts decision that the 3553(a) factors justify the variance.  That the appellate court might have reasonably reached a different conclusion does not justify reversal.  Pp.1114.


2.On abuse-of-discretion review, the Eighth Circuit failed to give due deference to the District Courts reasoned and reasonable sentencing decision.  Since the District Court committed no procedural error, the only question for the Circuit was whether the sentence was reasonable, i.e., whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the 3553(a) factors supported the sentence and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.  The Circuit gave virtually no deference to the District Courts decision that the variance was justified.  The Circuit clearly disagreed with the District Courts decision, but it was not for the Circuit to decide de novo whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable.

06-1287|"CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. GEORGIA STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 061287.Argued November 5, 2007Decided December 4, 2007
Under Georgia law, most commercial and industrial property is valued locally by county boards for tax purposes, but public utilities such as petitioner railroad (CSX) are initially valued by the State.  In 2002, respondent Georgia state board used a different combination of methodologies than it had in 2001 to determine that the market value of CSXs in-state real property had increased 47 percent, resulting in a significantly higher advalorem tax levy.  CSX filed suit under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4R Act or Act), which bars States from, inter alia, [a]ssess[ing] rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the [propertys] true market value  than the ratio between the assessed and true market values of other commercial and industrial property in the same taxing jurisdiction, 49 U. S.C. 11501(b)(1), and authorizes the federal district court to enjoin the tax if the railroad ratio exceeds the ratio for other property by at least five percent, 11501(c).  CSX alleged that Georgia had grossly overestimated the market value of its in-state rail property while accurately valuing other commercial and industrial property in the State, so that CSXs property was taxed at a ratio of assessed-to-market value considerably more than 5 percent greater than the same ratio for the other in-state property.  Ruling that Georgia had not discriminated against CSX in violation of the 4R Act because the State had used widely accepted valuation methods to arrive at its 2002 estimate of true market value, the District Court declared that the Act does not allow a railroad to challenge a States chosen methodology if it is rational and not motivated by discriminatory intent.  The Eleventh Circuit panel affirmed, reasoning that the Act does not clearly state that railroads may challenge valuation methodologies, and that such a clear statement was required in light of the intrusion on state taxing prerogatives.  
Held:The 4R Act allows a railroad to attempt to show that state methods for determining the value of railroad property result in a discriminatory determination of true market value.  Pp.512.
(a)The Acts language is clear.  States may not tax railroad property at a ratio of assessed-to-true-market value higher than the ratio for other commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction.  To apply the Act, district courts must calculate the true market value of in-state railroad property.  A court cannot undertake the comparison of ratios the statute requires without that figure at hand, see Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Commn, 481 U. S. 454, 461, and the determination of true market value may be affected by the States choice of valuation methods.  Georgias argument that valuation methodologies must be distinguished from their application, and that the Act allows courts to question only the latter, is rejected.  There is no distinction between method and application in the Acts language and no passage limiting district court factfinding as the State proposes.  Georgias position is untenable given the way market value is calculated.  Valuation is not a matter of mathematics, but an applied science, even a craft.  Most appraisers estimate market value by employing not one methodology but a combination because no one approach is entirely accurate, at least in the absence of an established market for the type of property at issue.  The individual methods yield sometimes more, sometimes less reliable results depending on the peculiar features of the property evaluated.  Given the extent to which the chosen methods can affect the determination of value, preventing courts from scrutinizing state valuation methodologies would render 11501 a largely empty command, forcing district courts to accept as true the market value estimate of the State, one of the parties to the litigation.  States, in turn, would be free to employ appraisal techniques that routinely overestimate the market worth of railroad assets.  By then levying taxes based on those overestimates, States could implement the very discriminatory taxation Congress sought to eradicate.  Courts would be powerless to stop them, and the Act would ultimately guarantee railroads nothing more than mathematically accurate discriminatory taxation.


The States warning that allowing railroads to introduce their own valuation estimates based on different methodologies will inevitably lead to a futile clash of experts, which courts will have no reasonable way to settle, is not compelling, given that Congress was not similarly troubled.  Rather, Congress directed courts to find true market value, however elusive, making that value the objective benchmark for courts evaluation.  Property valuation, though admittedly complex, is at bottom just an issue of fact about possible market prices, Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520 U. S. 725, 741, an issue district courts are used to addressing.  In light of the statutes directive making true market value a factual question to be determined by the district court, what Georgia really seeks is to limit the types of evidence courts may consider as part of their factual inquiry.  Had Congress intended to impose such a limit, it could easily have included language insulating the States chosen methodologies from judicial scrutiny.  It did not.  Pp.59.


(b)The State argues that any interpretation of the Act allowing courts to question state valuation methods ignores the background principles of federalism against which the statute was enacted.  Even if important state policy questions are intertwined with the selection of a valuation methodology, however, Congress clearly permitted courts to question such methodologies when it banned discriminatory assessment ratios and made true market value a question to be litigated in federal court.  Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332, 343344, distinguished.  The Court also disagrees with Georgias claim that the Courts interpretation will destroy the States discretion to choose their own valuation methodologies.  A State may use whatever method it likes, so long as the result is not discriminatory in violation of the Act.  Pp.912.

06-6911|"LOGAN v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 066911.Argued October 30, 2007Decided December 4, 2007
Under federal law, the maximum prison term for a felon convicted of possessing a firearm is ordinarily 10 years.  See 18 U. S.C. 924(a)(2).  If the offenders prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for violent felon[ies,] however, the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA) mandates a minimum term of 15 years.  See 924(e)(1).  Congress defined the term violent felony to include specified crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, 924(e)(2)(B), but also provided that a state-law misdemeanor may qualify as a violent felony if the offense is punishable by a term of more than two years, 921(a)(20)(B).  Congress amended 921(a)(20) in 1986 to exclude from qualification for enhanced sentencing  any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights [i.e., rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury] restored.


Petitioner Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and received a 15-year sentence, the mandatory minimum under ACCA.  In imposing this sentence, the court took account of three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each of them punishable by a 3-year maximum sentence, and none of them revoking any of Logans civil rights.  Logan challenged his sentence on the ground that his state-court convictions fell within 921(a)(20)s civil rights restored exemption from ACCAs reach.  Rights retained, Logan argued, should be treated the same as rights revoked but later restored.  The District Court disagreed, holding that the exemption applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The exemption contained in 921(a)(20) does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.  Pp.613.
(a) The ordinary meaning of the word restoredgiving back something that has been taken awaydoes not include retention of something never lost.  Moreover, the context in which restored appears in 921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the words ordinary meaning.  In 921(a)(20), the words civil rights restored appear in the company of expunged, set aside, and pardoned.  Each of those terms describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction.  In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone.  He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.  Pp.67.  


(b)Logans dominant argument against a plain-meaning approach is not persuasive.  He relies on the harsh result a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, he maintains, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCAs enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment.  Logan urges that this result is not merely anomalous; it is absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights occurs automatically upon release from prison.  Pp.78.


Logans harsh or absurd consequences argument overlooks 921(a)(20)s unless clause, under which an offender gains no exemption from ACCAs application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation expressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.  Many States that restore felons civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities.  Further, Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates.  Pp.89.


The resolution Logan proposes, in any event, would correct one potential anomaly while creating others.  Under Logans proposed construction, all crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which civil rights [have been] restored in a State that does not revoke any offenders civil rights, while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.  Accepting Logans argument would also undercut 921(a)(20)(B), which subjects to ACCA state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years imprisonment.  Because misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights, reading the word restored to include retained would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCAs reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but would be released from ACCAs grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights.  This Court is disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).  Even assuming that when Congress revised 921(a)(20) in 1986, it labored under the misapprehension that all misdemeanants and felons at least temporarily forfeit civil rights, and indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake, this Court is not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can the Court recast 921(a)(20) in Congress stead.  Pp.911.


Section 922(g)(9)which was adopted 10 years after 921(a)(20) was given its current shape and which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone convicted  of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violencecautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny the 921(a)(20) exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights.  Tailored to 922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), corresponding to 921(a)(20), which specifies expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction.  That provision also demonstrates that the words civil rights restored do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away.  It provides for restoration of civil rights as a qualifying dispensation only if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights in the first place.  Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) also rebuts Logans absurdity argument.  Statutory terms may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words could not conceivably have been intended to apply to the case at hand.  See, e.g., Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 511.  In 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), however, Congress explicitly distinguished between restored and retained, thereby making it more than conceivable that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, meant to do the same in 921(a)(20).  Pp.1113.
453 F.3d 804, affirmed.
Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

No. 066911.Argued October 30, 2007Decided December 4, 2007
Under federal law, the maximum prison term for a felon convicted of possessing a firearm is ordinarily 10 years.  See 18 U. S.C. 924(a)(2).  If the offenders prior criminal record includes at least three convictions for violent felon[ies,] however, the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA) mandates a minimum term of 15 years.  See 924(e)(1).  Congress defined the term violent felony to include specified crimes punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, 924(e)(2)(B), but also provided that a state-law misdemeanor may qualify as a violent felony if the offense is punishable by a term of more than two years, 921(a)(20)(B).  Congress amended 921(a)(20) in 1986 to exclude from qualification for enhanced sentencing  any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights [i.e., rights to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury] restored.


Petitioner Logan pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and received a 15-year sentence, the mandatory minimum under ACCA.  In imposing this sentence, the court took account of three Wisconsin misdemeanor battery convictions, each of them punishable by a 3-year maximum sentence, and none of them revoking any of Logans civil rights.  Logan challenged his sentence on the ground that his state-court convictions fell within 921(a)(20)s civil rights restored exemption from ACCAs reach.  Rights retained, Logan argued, should be treated the same as rights revoked but later restored.  The District Court disagreed, holding that the exemption applies only to defendants whose civil rights were both lost and restored, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The exemption contained in 921(a)(20) does not cover the case of an offender who retained civil rights at all times, and whose legal status, postconviction, remained in all respects unaltered by any state dispensation.  Pp.613.
(a) The ordinary meaning of the word restoredgiving back something that has been taken awaydoes not include retention of something never lost.  Moreover, the context in which restored appears in 921(a)(20) counsels adherence to the words ordinary meaning.  In 921(a)(20), the words civil rights restored appear in the company of expunged, set aside, and pardoned.  Each of those terms describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction.  In contrast, a defendant who retains rights is simply left alone.  He receives no status-altering dispensation, no token of forgiveness from the government.  Pp.67.  


(b)Logans dominant argument against a plain-meaning approach is not persuasive.  He relies on the harsh result a literal reading could yield: Unless retention of rights is treated as legally equivalent to restoration of rights, he maintains, less serious offenders will be subject to ACCAs enhanced penalties while more serious offenders in the same State, who have had civil rights restored, may escape heightened punishment.  Logan urges that this result is not merely anomalous; it is absurd, particularly in States where restoration of civil rights occurs automatically upon release from prison.  Pp.78.


Logans harsh or absurd consequences argument overlooks 921(a)(20)s unless clause, under which an offender gains no exemption from ACCAs application through an expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights if the dispensation expressly provides that the [offender] may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.  Many States that restore felons civil rights (or accord another measure of forgiveness) nonetheless impose or retain firearms disabilities.  Further, Wisconsin no longer punishes misdemeanors by more than two years imprisonment, and thus no longer has any misdemeanors that qualify as ACCA predicates.  Pp.89.


The resolution Logan proposes, in any event, would correct one potential anomaly while creating others.  Under Logans proposed construction, all crimes, including first-degree murder, would be treated as crimes for which civil rights [have been] restored in a State that does not revoke any offenders civil rights, while less serious crimes committed elsewhere would not.  Accepting Logans argument would also undercut 921(a)(20)(B), which subjects to ACCA state misdemeanor convictions punishable by more than two years imprisonment.  Because misdemeanors generally entail no revocation of civil rights, reading the word restored to include retained would yield this curiosity: An offender would fall within ACCAs reach if his three prior offenses carried potential prison terms of over two years, but would be released from ACCAs grip by virtue of his retention of civil rights.  This Court is disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand (exposure to ACCA) it withdrew with the other (exemption from ACCA).  Even assuming that when Congress revised 921(a)(20) in 1986, it labored under the misapprehension that all misdemeanants and felons at least temporarily forfeit civil rights, and indulging the further assumption that courts may repair such a congressional oversight or mistake, this Court is not equipped to say what statutory alteration, if any, Congress would have made had its attention trained on offenders who retained civil rights; nor can the Court recast 921(a)(20) in Congress stead.  Pp.911.


Section 922(g)(9)which was adopted 10 years after 921(a)(20) was given its current shape and which outlaws possession of a firearm by anyone convicted  of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violencecautions against any assumption that Congress did not mean to deny the 921(a)(20) exemption to offenders who retained their civil rights.  Tailored to 922(g)(9), Congress adopted a definitional provision, 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), corresponding to 921(a)(20), which specifies expungement, set aside, pardon, or restoration of rights as dispensations that can cancel lingering effects of a conviction.  That provision also demonstrates that the words civil rights restored do not cover a person whose civil rights were never taken away.  It provides for restoration of civil rights as a qualifying dispensation only if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights in the first place.  Section 921(a)(33)(B)(ii) also rebuts Logans absurdity argument.  Statutory terms may be interpreted against their literal meaning where the words could not conceivably have been intended to apply to the case at hand.  See, e.g., Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 511.  In 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), however, Congress explicitly distinguished between restored and retained, thereby making it more than conceivable that the Legislature, albeit an earlier one, meant to do the same in 921(a)(20).  Pp.1113.
453 F.3d 804, affirmed.

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS v. DANIEL
SIEBERT
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 061680.Decided November 5, 2007
Per Curiam.

Daniel Siebert was convicted and sentenced to death in the State of Alabama for the murder of Linda Jarman.  Sieberts conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the certificate of judgment issued on May 22, 1990.  This Court denied certiorari on November 5, 1990.  Siebert v. Alabama, 498 U. S. 963.  On August 25, 1992, Siebert filed a petition for postconviction relief in Alabama state court.  The state courts denied the petition as untimely, however, because it was filed approximately three months after the expiration of the then-applicable 2-year statute of limitations, 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20002001), which began to run from the date the certificate of judgment issued.*  The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari on September 15, 2000.  Siebert did not seek review in this Court.  On September 14, 2001, Siebert filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U. S.C. 2254, in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.


The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a 1-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition.  2244(d)(1).  The limitations period is tolled, however, while a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.  2244(d)(2).  Because Sieberts direct appeal became final before AEDPA became effective, the 1-year limitations period began to run from April 24, 1996, AEDPAs effective date.  See Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 217 (2002).  Thus, absent tolling, Sieberts federal habeas petition would be untimely by over four years.


The District Court dismissed Sieberts habeas petition as untimely, reasoning that an application for state postconviction relief is not properly filed if it was rejected by the state court on statute-of-limitations grounds.  The Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that Sieberts state postconviction petition was properly filed within the meaning of 2244(d)(2), because the state time bar was not jurisdictional and the Alabama courts therefore had discretion in enforcing it.  See Siebert v. Campbell, 334 F.3d 1018, 1030 (CA11 2003) (per curiam).  The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded to the District Court to consider the merits of Sieberts petition.


While Sieberts habeas petition was pending on remand in the District Court, we decided Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408 (2005).  In Pace, we held that a state postconviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not properly filed within the meaning of 2244(d)(2).  Id., at 414, 417.  Relying on Pace, the District Court again found that Sieberts state postconviction petition was not properly filed, and dismissed his federal habeas petition as untimely.  The Court of Appeals, however, reversed and remanded.  In a one-paragraph opinion, the court distinguished Pace on the ground that Rule 32.2(c), unlike the statute of limitations at issue in Pace, operate[s] as an affirmative defense.  480 F.3d 1089, 1090 (CA11 2007).  Thus, the court found its prior holdingthat Sieberts state postconviction petition was properly filed because the state court rejected it on a nonjurisdictional groundstood as the law of the case.  Ibid.


The Court of Appeals carve-out of time limits that operate as affirmative defenses is inconsistent with our holding in Pace.  Although the Pennsylvania statute of limitations at issue in Pace happens to have been a jurisdictional time bar under state law, see Commonwealth v. Banks, 556 Pa. 1, 56, 726 A.2d 374, 376 (1999), the jurisdictional nature of the time limit was not the basis for our decision.  Rather, we built upon a distinction that we had earlier articulated in Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), between postconviction petitions rejected on the basis of filing conditions, which are not properly filed under 2244(d)(2), and those rejected on the basis of procedural bars [that] go to the ability to obtain relief, which are.  Pace, supra, at 417 (citing Artuz, supra, at 1011).  We found that statutes of limitations are filing conditions because they go to the very initiation of a petition and a courts ability to consider that petition.  Pace, 544 U. S., at 417.  Thus, we held that time limits, no matter their form, are filing conditions, and that a state postconviction petition is therefore not properly filed if it was rejected by the state court as untimely.  Ibid. (emphasis added).


In short, our holding in Pace turned not on the nature of the particular time limit relied upon by the state court, but rather on the fact that time limits generally establish conditions to filing a petition for state postconviction relief.  Whether a time limit is jurisdictional, an affirmative defense, or something in between, it is a condition to filing, Artuz, supra, at 9it places a limit on how long a prisoner can wait before filing a postconviction petition.  The fact that Alabamas Rule 32.2(c) is an affirmative defense that can be waived (or is subject to equitable tolling) renders it no less a filing requirement than a jurisdictional time bar would be; it only makes it a less stringent one.  Indeed, in Pace we cited the very statute at issue in this case as an example of such a filing requirement.  See 544 U. S., at 417, n.7 (citing 2 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20042005)).


Excluding from Paces scope those time limits that operate as affirmative defenses would leave a gaping hole in what we plainly meant to be a general rule, as statutes of limitations are often affirmative defenses.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); Kirkland v. State, 143 Idaho 544, 546, 149 P.3d 819, 821 (2006) (The statute of limitations for petitions for post-conviction relief is not jurisdictional.  It is an affirmative defense that may be waived if it is not pleaded by the defendant (quoting Cole v. State, 135 Idaho 107, 110, 15 P.3d 820, 823 (2000); citation omitted)); People v. Boclair, 202 Ill.2d 89, 101, 789 N.E. 2d 734, 742 (2002) (holding that time bar for filing postconviction petition is an affirmative defense and can be raised, waived, or forfeited, by the State).  What is more, whether a time limit is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense is often a disputed question, as the interpretive history of Rule 32.2(c) itself illustrates, see Ex parte Ward, No. 1051818, 2007 WL 1576054, *6 (Ala., June 1, 2007) (noting confusion in the Alabama lower courts over whether Rule 32.2(c) is jurisdictional).  Under the Court of Appeals approach, federal habeas courts would have to delve into the intricacies of state procedural law in deciding whether a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely was nonetheless properly filed under 2244(d)(2).  Our decision in Pace precludes such an approach.


We therefore reiterate now what we held in Pace: When a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that [is] the end of the matter for purposes of 2244(d)(2).  544 U. S., at 414 (quoting Carey, 536 U. S., at 226; alteration in original).  Because Sieberts petition for state postconviction relief was rejected as untimely by the Alabama courts, it was not properly filed under 2244(d)(2).  Accordingly, he was not entitled to tolling of AEDPAs 1-year statute of limitations.


The petition for certiorari is granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
*At the time Sieberts petition was before the Alabama courts, Rule 32.2(c) provided that the court shall not entertain any petition, with certain exceptions not applicable here, unless the petition is filed  within two (2) years after the issuance of the certificate of judgment by the Court of Criminal Appeals.  The statute has since been amended to provide for a 1-year limitations period, but is otherwise unchanged.  See 1 Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(c) (20072008).

05-908|"PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05908.Argued December 4, 2006Decided June 28, 2007
Respondent school districts voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely on race to determine which schools certain children may attend.  The Seattle district, which has never operated legally segregated schools or been subject to court-ordered desegregation, classified children as white or nonwhite, and used the racial classifications as a tiebreaker to allocate slots in particular high schools.  The Jefferson County, Ky., district was subject to a desegregation decree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation to the greatest extent practicable.  In 2001, the district adopted its plan classifying students as black or other in order to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests.


Petitioners, an organization of Seattle parents (Parents Involved) and the mother of a Jefferson County student (Joshua), whose children were or could be assigned under the foregoing plans, filed these suits contending, inter alia, that allocating children to different public schools based solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amendments equal protection guarantee.  In the Seattle case, the District Court granted the school district summary judgment, finding, inter alia, that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In the Jefferson County case, the District Court found that the school district had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools, and that its plan was, in all relevant respects, narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.   
Held:The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded.
No. 05908, 426 F.3d 1162; No. 05915, 416 F.3d 513, reversed and remanded.
The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IIIA, and IIIC, concluding:


1.The Court has jurisdiction in these cases.  Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because its current members claimed injuries are not imminent and are too speculative in that, even if the district maintains its current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, those members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a high school that is oversubscribed and integration positive.  This argument is unavailing; the groups members have children in all levels of the districts schools, and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of members whose elementary and middle school children may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice in the future.  The fact that those children may not be denied such admission based on their race because of undersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them does not eliminate the injury claimed.  The group also asserted an interest in not being forced to compete in a race-based system that might prejudice its members children, an actionable form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 211.  The fact that Seattle has ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dispositive, since the district vigorously defends its programs constitutionality, and nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign students if it prevails.  See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189.  Similarly, the fact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the Courts jurisdiction; Jefferson Countys racial guidelines apply at all grade levels and he may again be subject to race-based assignment in middle school.  Pp.911.


2.The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of showing that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means they have chosendiscriminating among individual students based on race by relying upon racial classifications in making school assignments.  Pp.1117, 2528.  


(a)Because racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification, Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 537 (Stevens, J., dissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or benefits based on individual racial classifications are reviewed under strict scrutiny, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505506.  Thus, the school districts must demonstrate that their use of such classifications is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Adarand, supra, at 227.


Although remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination is a compelling interest under the strict scrutiny test, see Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494, that interest is not involved here because the Seattle schools were never segregated by law nor subject to court-ordered desegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jefferson County schools were previously subject has been dissolved.  Moreover, these cases are not governed by Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny purposes, a government interest in student body diversity in the context of higher education is compelling.  That interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed all factors that may contribute to student body diversity, id., at 337, including, e.g., having overcome personal adversity and family hardship, id., at 338.  Quoting Justice Powells articulation of diversity in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 314315, the Grutter Court noted that it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race, 539 U. S., at 324325, but a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element, id., at 325.  In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints, id., at 330; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone.  The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor.  See Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 275.  Even as to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/other terms in Jefferson County.  The Grutter Court expressly limited its holdingdefining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher educationbut these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending Grutter to the sort of classifications at issue here.  Pp.1117.


(b)Despite the districts assertion that they employed individual racial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends, the minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments suggests that other means would be effective.  Seattles racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools.  Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its use of racial classifications has had a minimal effect, and claims only that its guidelines provide a firm definition of the goal of racially integrated schools, thereby providing administrators with authority to collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the desired range.  Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this Courts precedents and the Nations history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.  In Grutter, in contrast, the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law school there at issue.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  While the Court does not suggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using such classifications.  The districts have also failed to show they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.  Narrow tailoring requires serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives, id., at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plansmany of which would not have used express racial classificationswere rejected with little or no consideration.  Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications.  Pp.2528. 


the Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded for additional reasons in Parts IIIB and IV that the plans at issue are unconstitutional under this Courts precedents.  Pp.1725, 2841. 


1.The Court need not resolve the parties dispute over whether racial diversity in schools has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits because it is clear that the racial classifications at issue are not narrowly tailored to the asserted goal.  In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.  They are tied to each districts specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits.  Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the required diversity number in each district.  The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective districts, or rather the districts white/nonwhite or black/other balance, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans.  In Grutter, the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined meaningful number necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335336, and the Court concluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant pool to arrive at that number, id., at 335336.  Here, in contrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits.  This is a fatal flaw under the Courts existing precedent.  See, e.g., Freeman, supra, at 494.  Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify imposing racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to the Courts repeated admonitions that this is unconstitutional.  While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promoteracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integrationthey offer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial balancing.  Pp.1725. 


2.If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts own terms, the costs are undeniable.  Government action dividing people by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility, Croson, supra, at 493, reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 657, and endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603 (OConnor, J., dissenting).  When it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard.  In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, the Court held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted inferiority.  Id., at 493494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in that case.  Id., at 494.  The districts here invoke the ultimate goal of those who filed Brown and subsequent cases to support their argument, but the argument of the plaintiff in Brown was that the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race, and that view prevailedthis Court ruled in its remedial opinion that Brown required school districts to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis.  Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300301 (emphasis added).  Pp.2841.


Justice Kennedy agreed that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases and that respondents student assignment plans are not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling goal of diversity properly defined, but concluded that some parts of the plurality opinion imply an unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when it may be taken into account.  Pp.19.


(a)As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are narrowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual students race are made in a challenged program.  The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate when it concedes it denied Joshuas requested kindergarten transfer on the basis of his race under its guidelines, yet also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to kindergartners.  This discrepancy is not some simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the districts use of individual racial classifications.  As becomes clearer when the districts plan is further considered, Jefferson County has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  In its briefing it fails to make cleareven in the limited respects implicated by Joshuas initial assignment and transfer denialwhether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and adhoc manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.  When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the government.  In the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions based on individual racial classifications, but it has nevertheless failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with only a minority of the students classified as white, it has employed the crude racial categories of white and non-white as the basis for its assignment decisions.  Far from being narrowly tailored, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the district has provided no convincing explanation for its design.  Pp.  26.


(b)The plurality opinion is too dismissive of governments legitimate interest in ensuring that all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.  In administering public schools, it is permissible to consider the schools racial makeup and adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition.  Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306.  School authorities concerned that their student bodies racial compositions interfere with offering an equal educational opportunity to all are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion based solely on a systematic, individual typing by race.  Such measures may include strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of neighborhood demographics; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.  


Each respondent has failed to provide the necessary support for the proposition that there is no other way than individual racial classifications to avoid racial isolation in their school districts.

The latter approach would be informed by Grutter, though the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the students age, the parents needs, and the schools role.  Pp.  69.

			"|"PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v. SEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05908.Argued December 4, 2006Decided June 28, 2007
Respondent school districts voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely on race to determine which schools certain children may attend.  The Seattle district, which has never operated legally segregated schools or been subject to court-ordered desegregation, classified children as white or nonwhite, and used the racial classifications as a tiebreaker to allocate slots in particular high schools.  The Jefferson County, Ky., district was subject to a desegregation decree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation to the greatest extent practicable.  In 2001, the district adopted its plan classifying students as black or other in order to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests.


Petitioners, an organization of Seattle parents (Parents Involved) and the mother of a Jefferson County student (Joshua), whose children were or could be assigned under the foregoing plans, filed these suits contending, inter alia, that allocating children to different public schools based solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amendments equal protection guarantee.  In the Seattle case, the District Court granted the school district summary judgment, finding, inter alia, that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In the Jefferson County case, the District Court found that the school district had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools, and that its plan was, in all relevant respects, narrowly tailored to serve that interest.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed.   
Held:The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded.
No. 05908, 426 F.3d 1162; No. 05915, 416 F.3d 513, reversed and remanded.
The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IIIA, and IIIC, concluding:


1.The Court has jurisdiction in these cases.  Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because its current members claimed injuries are not imminent and are too speculative in that, even if the district maintains its current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, those members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a high school that is oversubscribed and integration positive.  This argument is unavailing; the groups members have children in all levels of the districts schools, and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of members whose elementary and middle school children may be denied admission to the high schools of their choice in the future.  The fact that those children may not be denied such admission based on their race because of undersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them does not eliminate the injury claimed.  The group also asserted an interest in not being forced to compete in a race-based system that might prejudice its members children, an actionable form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200, 211.  The fact that Seattle has ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dispositive, since the district vigorously defends its programs constitutionality, and nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign students if it prevails.  See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189.  Similarly, the fact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the Courts jurisdiction; Jefferson Countys racial guidelines apply at all grade levels and he may again be subject to race-based assignment in middle school.  Pp.911.


2.The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of showing that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means they have chosendiscriminating among individual students based on race by relying upon racial classifications in making school assignments.  Pp.1117, 2528.  


(a)Because racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification, Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 537 (Stevens, J., dissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or benefits based on individual racial classifications are reviewed under strict scrutiny, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505506.  Thus, the school districts must demonstrate that their use of such classifications is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Adarand, supra, at 227.


Although remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination is a compelling interest under the strict scrutiny test, see Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494, that interest is not involved here because the Seattle schools were never segregated by law nor subject to court-ordered desegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jefferson County schools were previously subject has been dissolved.  Moreover, these cases are not governed by Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny purposes, a government interest in student body diversity in the context of higher education is compelling.  That interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed all factors that may contribute to student body diversity, id., at 337, including, e.g., having overcome personal adversity and family hardship, id., at 338.  Quoting Justice Powells articulation of diversity in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 314315, the Grutter Court noted that it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race, 539 U. S., at 324325, but a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element, id., at 325.  In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints, id., at 330; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone.  The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself.  It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor.  See Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 275.  Even as to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/other terms in Jefferson County.  The Grutter Court expressly limited its holdingdefining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher educationbut these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending Grutter to the sort of classifications at issue here.  Pp.1117.


(b)Despite the districts assertion that they employed individual racial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends, the minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments suggests that other means would be effective.  Seattles racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools.  Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its use of racial classifications has had a minimal effect, and claims only that its guidelines provide a firm definition of the goal of racially integrated schools, thereby providing administrators with authority to collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the desired range.  Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this Courts precedents and the Nations history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.  In Grutter, in contrast, the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law school there at issue.  See 539 U. S., at 320.  While the Court does not suggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using such classifications.  The districts have also failed to show they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.  Narrow tailoring requires serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives, id., at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plansmany of which would not have used express racial classificationswere rejected with little or no consideration.  Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications.  Pp.2528. 


the Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded for additional reasons in Parts IIIB and IV that the plans at issue are unconstitutional under this Courts precedents.  Pp.1725, 2841. 


1.The Court need not resolve the parties dispute over whether racial diversity in schools has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits because it is clear that the racial classifications at issue are not narrowly tailored to the asserted goal.  In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.  They are tied to each districts specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits.  Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the required diversity number in each district.  The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective districts, or rather the districts white/nonwhite or black/other balance, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans.  In Grutter, the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined meaningful number necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335336, and the Court concluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant pool to arrive at that number, id., at 335336.  Here, in contrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits.  This is a fatal flaw under the Courts existing precedent.  See, e.g., Freeman, supra, at 494.  Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify imposing racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to the Courts repeated admonitions that this is unconstitutional.  While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promoteracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integrationthey offer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial balancing.  Pp.1725. 


2.If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts own terms, the costs are undeniable.  Government action dividing people by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility, Croson, supra, at 493, reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin, Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 657, and endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603 (OConnor, J., dissenting).  When it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard.  In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, the Court held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted inferiority.  Id., at 493494.  It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in that case.  Id., at 494.  The districts here invoke the ultimate goal of those who filed Brown and subsequent cases to support their argument, but the argument of the plaintiff in Brown was that the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race, and that view prevailedthis Court ruled in its remedial opinion that Brown required school districts to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis.  Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300301 (emphasis added).  Pp.2841.


Justice Kennedy agreed that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases and that respondents student assignment plans are not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling goal of diversity properly defined, but concluded that some parts of the plurality opinion imply an unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when it may be taken into account.  Pp.19.


(a)As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are narrowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual students race are made in a challenged program.  The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate when it concedes it denied Joshuas requested kindergarten transfer on the basis of his race under its guidelines, yet also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to kindergartners.  This discrepancy is not some simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the districts use of individual racial classifications.  As becomes clearer when the districts plan is further considered, Jefferson County has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  In its briefing it fails to make cleareven in the limited respects implicated by Joshuas initial assignment and transfer denialwhether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and adhoc manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.  When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the government.  In the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions based on individual racial classifications, but it has nevertheless failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with only a minority of the students classified as white, it has employed the crude racial categories of white and non-white as the basis for its assignment decisions.  Far from being narrowly tailored, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the district has provided no convincing explanation for its design.  Pp.  26.


(b)The plurality opinion is too dismissive of governments legitimate interest in ensuring that all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race.  In administering public schools, it is permissible to consider the schools racial makeup and adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition.  Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306.  School authorities concerned that their student bodies racial compositions interfere with offering an equal educational opportunity to all are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion based solely on a systematic, individual typing by race.  Such measures may include strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of neighborhood demographics; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.  


Each respondent has failed to provide the necessary support for the proposition that there is no other way than individual racial classifications to avoid racial isolation in their school districts.  Cf. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 501.  In these cases, the fact that the number of students whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is small suggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends through different means, including the facially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might include race as a component.  The latter approach would be informed by Grutter, though the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the students age, the parents needs, and the schools role.  Pp.  69.

06-480|"LEEGIN CREATIVE LEATHER PRODUCTS, INC. v. PSKS, INC., dba KAYS KLOSET  KAYS SHOES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 06480.Argued March 26, 2007Decided June 28, 2007
Given its policy of refusing to sell to retailers that discount its goods below suggested prices, petitioner (Leegin) stopped selling to respondents (PSKS) store.  PSKS filed suit, alleging, inter alia, that Leegin violated the antitrust laws by entering into vertical agreements with its retailers to set minimum resale prices.  The District Court excluded expert testimony about Leegins pricing policys procompetitive effects on the ground that Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373, makes it per se illegal under 1 of the Sherman Act for a manufacturer and its distributor to agree on the minimum price the distributor can charge for the manufacturers goods.  At trial, PSKS alleged that Leegin and its retailers had agreed to fix prices, but Leegin argued that its pricing policy was lawful under 1.  The jury found for PSKS.   On appeal, the Fifth Circuit declined to apply the rule of reason to Leegins vertical price-fixing agreements and affirmed, finding that Dr. Miles per se rule rendered irrelevant any procompetitive justifications for Leegins policy. 
Held:Dr. Miles is overruled and vertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of reason.  Pp.528.
(a)The accepted standard for testing whether a practice restrains trade in violation of 1 is the rule of reason, which requires the factfinder to weigh all of the circumstances, Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 49, including specific information about the relevant business and the restraints history, nature, and effect, State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3, 10.  The rule distinguishes between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and those with procompetitive effect that are in the consumers best interest.  However, when a restraint is deemed unlawful per se, ibid., the need to study an individual restraints reasonableness in light of real market forces is eliminated, Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 723.  Resort to per se rules is confined to restraints that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output. Ibid.  Thus, a per se rule is appropriate only after courts have had considerable experience with the type of restraint at issue, see Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 9, and only if they can predict with confidence that the restraint would be invalidated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason, see Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U. S. 332, 344.  Pp.57.


(b)Because the reasons upon which Dr. Miles relied do not justify a per se rule, it is necessary to examine, in the first instance, the economic effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum resale prices and to determine whether the per se rule is nonetheless appropriate.  Were this Court considering the issue as an original matter, the rule of reason, not a per se rule of unlawfulness, would be the appropriate standard to judge vertical price restraints.  Pp.719.


(1)Economics literature is replete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturers use of resale price maintenance, and the few recent studies on the subject also cast doubt on the conclusion that the practice meets the criteria for a per se rule.  The justifications for vertical price restraints are similar to those for other vertical restraints.  Minimum resale price maintenance can stimulate interbrand competition among manufacturers selling different brands of the same type of product by reducing intrabrand competition among retailers selling the same brand.  This is important because the antitrust laws primary purpose  is to protect interbrand competition, Khan, supra, at 15.  A single manufacturers use of vertical price restraints tends to eliminate intrabrand price competition; this in turn encourages retailers to invest in services or promotional efforts that aid the manufacturers position as against rival manufacturers.  Resale price maintenance may also give consumers more options to choose among low-price, low-service brands; high-price, high-service brands; and brands falling in between.  Absent vertical price restraints, retail services that enhance interbrand competition might be underprovided because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the demand those services generate.  Retail price maintenance can also increase interbrand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms and brands and by encouraging retailer services that would not be provided even absent free riding.  Pp.912.


(2)Setting minimum resale prices may also have anticompetitive effects; and unlawful price fixing, designed solely to obtain monopoly profits, is an ever present temptation.  Resale price maintenance may, for example, facilitate a manufacturer cartel or be used to organize retail cartels.  It can also be abused by a powerful manufacturer or retailer.  Thus, the potential anticompetitive consequences of vertical price restraints must not be ignored or underestimated.  Pp.1214.


(3)Notwithstanding the risks of unlawful conduct, it cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that retail price maintenance always or almost always tend[s] to restrict competition and decrease output, Business Electronics, supra, at 723.  Vertical retail-price agreements have either procompetitive or anticompetitive effects, depending on the circumstances in which they were formed; and the limited empirical evidence available does not suggest efficient uses of the agreements are infrequent or hypothetical.  A per se rule should not be adopted for administrative convenience alone.  Such rules can be counterproductive, increasing the antitrust systems total cost by prohibiting procompetitive conduct the antitrust laws should encourage.  And a per se rule cannot be justified by the possibility of higher prices absent a further showing of anticompetitive conduct.  The antitrust laws primarily are designed to protect interbrand competition from which lower prices can later result.  Respondents argument overlooks that, in general, the interests of manufacturers and consumers are aligned with respect to retailer profit margins.  Resale price maintenance has economic dangers.  If the rule of reason were to apply, courts would have to be diligent in eliminating their anticompetitive uses from the market.  Factors relevant to the inquiry are the number of manufacturers using the practice, the restraints source, and a manufacturers market power.  The rule of reason is designed and used to ascertain whether transactions are anticompetitive or procompetitive.  This standard principle applies to vertical price restraints.  As courts gain experience with these restraints by applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more guidance to businesses.  Pp.1419.


(c)Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to the per se rule here.  Because the Sherman Act is treated as a common-law statute, its prohibition on restraint[s] of trade evolves to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions.  The rule of reasons case-by-case adjudication implements this common-law approach.  Here, respected economics authorities suggest that the per se rule is inappropriate.  And both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission recommend replacing the per se rule with the rule of reason.  In addition, this Court has overruled [its] precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings.  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443.  It is not surprising that the Court has distanced itself from Dr. Miles rationales, for the case was decided not long after the Sherman Act was enacted, when the Court had little experience with antitrust analysis.  Only eight years after Dr. Miles, the Court reined in the decision, holding that a manufacturer can suggest resale prices and refuse to deal with distributors who do not follow them, United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 307308; and more recently the Court has tempered, limited, or overruled once strict vertical restraint prohibitions, see, e.g., GTE Sylvania, supra, at 5759.  The Dr. Miles rule is also inconsistent with a principled framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed with the Courts other vertical restraint cases.  Deciding that procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance are insufficient to overrule Dr. Miles would call into question cases such as Colgate and GTE Sylvania.  Respondents arguments for reaffirming Dr. Miles based on stare decisis do not require a different result.  Pp.1928.

The rule of reason is designed and used to ascertain whether transactions are anticompetitive or procompetitive.  This standard principle applies to vertical price restraints.  As courts gain experience with these restraints by applying the rule of reason over the course of decisions, they can establish the litigation structure to ensure the rule operates to eliminate anticompetitive restraints from the market and to provide more guidance to businesses.  Pp.1419.


(c)Stare decisis does not compel continued adherence to the per se rule here.  Because the Sherman Act is treated as a common-law statute, its prohibition on restraint[s] of trade evolves to meet the dynamics of present economic conditions.  The rule of reasons case-by-case adjudication implements this common-law approach.  Here, respected economics authorities suggest that the per se rule is inappropriate.  And both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission recommend replacing the per se rule with the rule of reason.  In addition, this Court has overruled [its] precedents when subsequent cases have undermined their doctrinal underpinnings.  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443.  It is not surprising that the Court has distanced itself from Dr. Miles rationales, for the case was decided not long after the Sherman Act was enacted, when the Court had little experience with antitrust analysis.  Only eight years after Dr. Miles, the Court reined in the decision, holding that a manufacturer can suggest resale prices and refuse to deal with distributors who do not follow them, United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U. S. 300, 307308; and more recently the Court has tempered, limited, or overruled once strict vertical restraint prohibitions, see, e.g., GTE Sylvania, supra, at 5759.  The Dr. Miles rule is also inconsistent with a principled framework, for it makes little economic sense when analyzed with the Courts other vertical restraint cases.  Deciding that procompetitive effects of resale price maintenance are insufficient to overrule Dr. Miles would call into question cases such as Colgate and GTE Sylvania.  Respondents arguments for reaffirming Dr. Miles based on stare decisis do not require a different result.  Pp.1928.

DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, COR-RECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 066407.Argued April 18, 2007Decided June 28, 2007
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder in a Texas state court and sentenced to death despite his well-documented history of mental illness.  After the Texas courts denied relief on direct appeal, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U. S.C. 2254, but the District Court and the Fifth Circuit rejected his claims, and this Court denied certiorari.  In the course of these initial state and federal proceedings, petitioner did not argue that mental illness rendered him incompetent to be executed.  Once the state trial court set an execution date, petitioner filed a motion under Texas law claiming, for the first time, that he was incompetent to be executed because of mental illness.  The trial judge denied the motion without a hearing and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed petitioners appeal for lack of jurisdiction.


He then filed another federal habeas petition under 2254, and the District Court stayed his execution to allow the state trial court time to consider evidence of his then-current mental state.  Once the state court began its adjudication, petitioner submitted 10 motions in which he requested, inter alia, a competency hearing and funds for a mental health expert.  The court indicated it would rule on the outstanding motions once it had received the report written by the experts that it had appointed to review petitioners mental condition.  The experts subsequently filed this report, which concluded, inter alia, that petitioner had the ability to understand the reason he was to be executed.  Without ruling on the outstanding motions, the judge found petitioner competent and closed the case.  Petitioner then returned to the Federal District Court, seeking a resolution of his pending 2254 petition.  The District Court concluded that the state-court competency proceedings failed to comply with Texas law and were constitutionally inadequate in light of the procedural requirements mandated by Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 410, where this Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States from inflicting the death penalty upon insane prisoners.  Although the court therefore reviewed petitioners incompetency claim without deferring to the state courts finding of competency, it nevertheless granted no relief, finding that petitioner had not demonstrated that he met the standard for incompetency.  Under Fifth Circuit precedent, the court explained, petitioner was competent to be executed so long as he knew the fact of his impending execution and the factual predicate for it.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 
1.This Court has statutory authority to adjudicate the claims raised in petitioners second federal habeas application.  Because 2244(b)(2) requires that [a] claim presented in a second or successive  [2254] application  that was not presented in a prior application  be dismissed, the State maintains that the failure of petitioners first 2254 application to raise a Ford-based incompetency claim deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.  The results this argument would produce show its flaws.  Were the States interpretation of second or successive correct, a prisoner would have two options: forgo the opportunity to raise a Ford claim in federal court; or raise the claim in a first federal habeas application even though it is premature.  Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637, 644.  The dilemma would apply not only to prisoners with mental conditions that, at the time of the initial habeas filing, were indicative of incompetency but also to all other prisoners, including those with no early sign of mental illness.  Because all prisoners are at risk of deteriorations in their mental state, conscientious defense attorneys would be obliged to file unripe (and, in many cases, meritless) Ford claims in each and every 2254 application.  This counterintuitive approach would add to the burden imposed on courts, applicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to any.  The more reasonable interpretation of 2244, suggested by this Courts precedents, is that Congress did not intend the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) addressing second or successive habeas petitions to govern a filing in the unusual posture presented here: a 2254 application raising a Ford-based incompetency claim filed as soon as that claim is ripe.  See, e.g., Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 643645.  This conclusion is confirmed by AEDPAs purposes of further[ing] comity, finality, and federalism, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 337, promot[ing] judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources,  and lend[ing] finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time, Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205206.  These purposes, and the practical effects of the Courts holdings, should be considered when interpreting AEDPA, particularly where, as here, petitioners run the risk under the proposed interpretation of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims, Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 275.  There is, finally, no argument in this case that petitioner proceeded in a manner that could be considered an abuse of the writ.  Cf. Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664.  To the contrary, the Court has suggested that it is generally appropriate for a prisoner to wait before seeking the resolution of unripe incompetency claims.  See, e.g., Martinez-Villareal, supra, at 644645.  Pp.915.  


2.The state court failed to provide the procedures to which petitioner was entitled under the Constitution.  Ford identifies the measures a State must provide when a prisoner alleges incompetency to be executed.  Justice Powells opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in Ford controls, see Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193, and constitutes clearly established governing law for AEDPA purposes, 2254(d)(1).  As Justice Powell elaborated, once a prisoner seeking a stay of execution has made a substantial threshold showing of insanity, 477 U. S., at 424, the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments entitle him to, inter alia, a fair hearing, ibid., including an opportunity to submit expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the States own psychiatric examination, id., at 427.  The procedures the state court provided petitioner were so deficient that they cannot be reconciled with any reasonable interpretation of the Ford rule.  It is uncontested that petitioner made a substantial showing of incompetency.  It is also evident from the record, however, that the state court reached its competency determination without holding a hearing or providing petitioner with an adequate opportunity to provide his own expert evidence.  Moreover, there is a strong argument that the court violated state law by failing to provide a competency hearing.  If so, the violation undermines any reliance the State might now place on Justice Powells assertion that the States should have substantial leeway to determine what process best balances the various interests at stake.  Id., at 427.  Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant habeas relief, as relevant, only if a state courts adjudication of [a] claim on the merits  resulted in a decision that  involved an unreasonable application of the relevant federal law.  2254(d)(1).  If the state courts adjudication is dependent on an antecedent unreasonable application of federal law, that requirement is satisfied, and the federal court must then resolve the claim without the deference AEDPA otherwise requires.  See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534.  Having determined that the state court unreasonably applied Ford when it accorded petitioner the procedures in question, this Court must now consider petitioners claim on the merits without deferring to the state courts competency finding.  Pp.1521.  


3.The Fifth Circuit employed an improperly restrictive test when it considered petitioners claim of incompetency on the merits.  Pp. 2128.


(a)The Fifth Circuits incompetency standard is too restrictive to afford a prisoner Eighth Amendment protections.  Petitioners experts in the District Court concluded that, although he claims to understand that the State says it wants to execute him for murder, his mental problems have resulted in the delusion that the stated reason is a sham, and that the State actually wants to execute him to stop him from preaching.  The Fifth Circuit held, based on its earlier decisions, that such delusions are simply not relevant to whether a prisoner can be executed so long as he is aware that the State has identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted.  This test ignores the possibility that even if such awareness exists, gross delusions stemming from a severe mental disorder may put that awareness in a context so far removed from reality that the punishment can serve no proper purpose.  It is also inconsistent with Ford, for none of the principles set forth therein is in accord with the Fifth Circuits rule.  Although the Ford opinions did not set forth a precise competency standard, the Court did reach the express conclusion that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the States power to take the life of an insane prisoner, 477 U. S., at 405, because, inter alia, such an execution serves no retributive purpose, id., at 408.  It might be said that capital punishment is imposed because it has the potential to make the offender recognize at last the gravity of his crime and to allow the community as a whole, including the victims surviving family and friends, to affirm its own judgment that the prisoners culpability is so serious that the ultimate penalty must be sought and imposed.  Both the potential for this recognition and the objective of community vindication are called into question, however, if the prisoners only awareness of the link between the crime and the punishment is so distorted by mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding shared by the community as a whole.  A prisoners awareness of the States rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it.  Ford does not foreclose inquiry into the latter.  To refuse to consider evidence of this nature is to mistake Fords holding and its logic.  Pp. 2128. 


(b)Although the Court rejects the Fifth Circuits standard, it does not attempt to set down a rule governing all competency determinations.  The record is not as informative as it might be because it was developed by the District Court under the rejected standard, and, thus, this Court finds it difficult to amplify its conclusions or to make them more precise.  It is proper to allow the court charged with overseeing the development of the evidentiary record the initial opportunity to resolve petitioners constitutional claim.  Pp. 2830.

06-157|"HEIN, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVES, etal. v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 06157.Argued February 28, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
The President, by executive orders, created a White House office and several centers within federal agencies to ensure that faith-based community groups are eligible to compete for federal financial support.  No congressional legislation specifically authorized these entities, which were created entirely within the Executive Branch, nor has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money to their activities, which are funded through general Executive Branch appropriations.  Respondents, an organization opposed to Government endorsement of religion and three of its members, brought this suit alleging that petitioners, the directors of the federal offices, violated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences that were designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups over secular ones.  The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers opposed to Executive Branch use of congressional appropriations for these conferences.  The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of standing, concluding that under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment Clause challenges to the constitutionality of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.I, 8.  Because petitioners acted on the Presidents behalf and were not charged with administering a congressional program, the court held that the challenged activities did not authorize taxpayer standing under Flast.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, reading Flast as granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are financed by a congressional appropriation, even where there is no statutory program and the funds are from appropriations for general administrative expenses.  According to the court, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency so long as the marginal or incremental cost to the public of the alleged Establishment Clause violation is greater than zero.    
Held:The judgment is reversed.
433 F.3d 989,  reversed.
Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that because the Seventh Circuits broad reading of Flast is incorrect, respondents lack standing.  Pp.625.


1.Federal-court jurisdiction is limited to actual Cases and Controversies.  U. S. Const., Art.III.  A controlling factor in the definition of such a case or controversy is standing, ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 613, the requisite elements of which are well established: A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751.  Pp.68. 


2.Generally, a federal taxpayers interest in seeing that Treasury funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution is too attenuated to give rise to the kind of redressable personal injury required for ArticleIII standing.  See, e.g., Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485486.  Pp.810. 


3.In Flast, the Court carved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing.  The taxpayer-plaintiff there alleged that the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under a federal statute violated the Establishment Clause.  The Court set out a two-part test for determining standing: First,  a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.I, 8. Secondly, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.I, 8.  392 U. S., at 102103.  The Court then held that the particular taxpayer had satisfied both prongs of the test.  Id., at 103104.  Pp.1112. 


4.Respondents broad reading of the Flast exception to cover any expenditure of Government funds in violation of the Establishment Clause fails to observe the rigor with which the Flast exception to the Frothingham principle ought to be applied.  Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 481.  Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in Flast was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite logical link between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.  392 U. S., at 102.  Their constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art.I, 8, to spend for the general welfare.  Id., at 103.  But Flast limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed only [at] exercises of congressional power under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  Valley Forge, supra, at 479.  Pp.1213. 


5.The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in Flast is missing here.  Respondents neither challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation nor ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional.  That is because the expenditures at issue were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress, but under general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund day-to-day activities.  These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures in question, which resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.  The Court has never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.  Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619620, distinguished.  Pp.1318. 


6.Respondents argue to no avail that distinguishing between money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of executive discretion is arbitrary because the injury to taxpayers in both situations is the same as that targeted by the Establishment Clause and Flastthe expenditure for the support of religion of funds exacted from taxpayers.  But Flast focused on congressional action, and the invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures must be declined.  The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the Flast exception has a narrow application, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. ___, ___, that only slightly lowered the bar on taxpayer standing, United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 173, and that must be applied with rigor, Valley Forge, supra, at 481.  Pp.1819. 


7.Also rejected is respondents argument that Executive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extractions.  Flast itself rejected this equivalence.  392 U. S., at 102.   Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal actionbe it a conference, proclamation, or speechto Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.  Respondents proposed rule would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns, enlisting the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials.  Pp.1921. 


8.Both the Seventh Circuit and respondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but neither has identified a workable limitation.  Taking the Circuits zero-marginal-cost test literallyi.e., that any marginal cost greater than zero sufficestaxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches by Government officials.  At a minimum, that approach would create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems.  Respondents proposal to require an expenditure to be fairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause, so that challenges to the content of any particular speech would be screened out, is too vague and ill-defined to be accepted.  Pp.2123.


9.None of the parade of horribles respondents claim could occur if Flast is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures has happened.  In the unlikely event any do take place, Congress can quickly step in.  And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs possessed of standing based on grounds other than their taxpayer status.  Pp. 2324.


10.This case does not require the Court to reconsider Flast.  The Seventh Circuit did not apply Flast; it extended it.  Valley Forge Christian Academy illustrates that a necessary concomitant of stare decisis is that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.  That is the approach taken here.  Flast is neither extended nor overruled.  It is simply left as it was.  Pp.2425.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the Courts judgment, concluding that Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, should be overruled as wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that are embodied in the standing doctrine.  Pp.121.


1.The Courts taxpayer-standing cases involving Establishment Clause challenges to government expenditures are notoriously inconsistent because they have inconsistently described the relevant injury in fact that Article III requires.  Some cases have focused on the financial effect on the taxpayers wallet, whereas Flast and the cases that follow its teaching have emphasized the mental displeasure the taxpayer suffers when his funds are extracted and spent in aid of religion.  There are only two logical routes available with respect to taxpayer standing.  If the mental displeasure created by Establishment Clause violations is concrete and particularized enough to constitute an Article III injury in fact, then Flast should be applied to (at a minimum) all challenges to government expenditures allegedly violating constitutional provisions that specifically limit the taxing and spending power; if not, Flast should be overturned.  Pp.212.


2.Todays plurality avails itself of neither principled option, instead accepting the Governments submission that Flast should be limited to challenges to expenditures that are expressly authorized or mandated by specific congressional enactment.  However, the plurality gives no explanation as to why the factual differences between this case and Flast are material.  (Whether the challenged government expenditure is expressly allocated by a specific congressional enactment is not relevant to the Article III criteria of injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.)  Yet the plurality is also unwilling to acknowledge that Flast erred by relying on purely mental injury.  Pp.1214. 


3.Respondents legal position is no more coherent than the pluralitys.  They refuse to admit that their argument logically implies that every expenditure of tax revenues that is alleged to violate the Establishment Clause is subject to suit under Flast.  Of course, that position finds no support in this Courts precedents or this Nations history.  Pp.1416. 


4.  Ataxpayers purely psychological disapproval that his funds are being spent in an allegedly unlawful manner is never sufficiently concrete and particularized to support Article III standing.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573574.  Although overruling precedents is a serious undertaking, stare decisis should not prevent the Court from doing so here.  Flast was inconsistent with the cases that came before it and undervalued the separation-of-powers function of standing.  Its lack of a logical theoretical underpinning has rendered the Courts taxpayer-standing doctrine so incomprehensible that appellate judges do not know what to make of it.  The case has engendered no reliance interests.  Few cases less warrant stare decisis effect.  It is past time to overturn Flast.  Pp. 1721.

			"|"HEIN, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVES, etal. v. FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 06157.Argued February 28, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
The President, by executive orders, created a White House office and several centers within federal agencies to ensure that faith-based community groups are eligible to compete for federal financial support.  No congressional legislation specifically authorized these entities, which were created entirely within the Executive Branch, nor has Congress enacted any law specifically appropriating money to their activities, which are funded through general Executive Branch appropriations.  Respondents, an organization opposed to Government endorsement of religion and three of its members, brought this suit alleging that petitioners, the directors of the federal offices, violated the Establishment Clause by organizing conferences that were designed to promote, and had the effect of promoting, religious community groups over secular ones.  The only asserted basis for standing was that the individual respondents are federal taxpayers opposed to Executive Branch use of congressional appropriations for these conferences.  The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of standing, concluding that under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, federal taxpayer standing is limited to Establishment Clause challenges to the constitutionality of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.I, 8.  Because petitioners acted on the Presidents behalf and were not charged with administering a congressional program, the court held that the challenged activities did not authorize taxpayer standing under Flast.  The Seventh Circuit reversed, reading Flast as granting federal taxpayers standing to challenge Executive Branch programs on Establishment Clause grounds so long as the activities are financed by a congressional appropriation, even where there is no statutory program and the funds are from appropriations for general administrative expenses.  According to the court, a taxpayer has standing to challenge anything done by a federal agency so long as the marginal or incremental cost to the public of the alleged Establishment Clause violation is greater than zero.    
Held:The judgment is reversed.
433 F.3d 989,  reversed.
Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that because the Seventh Circuits broad reading of Flast is incorrect, respondents lack standing.  Pp.625.


1.Federal-court jurisdiction is limited to actual Cases and Controversies.  U. S. Const., Art.III.  A controlling factor in the definition of such a case or controversy is standing, ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 613, the requisite elements of which are well established: A plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751.  Pp.68. 


2.Generally, a federal taxpayers interest in seeing that Treasury funds are spent in accordance with the Constitution is too attenuated to give rise to the kind of redressable personal injury required for ArticleIII standing.  See, e.g., Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485486.  Pp.810. 


3.In Flast, the Court carved out a narrow exception to the general constitutional prohibition against taxpayer standing.  The taxpayer-plaintiff there alleged that the distribution of federal funds to religious schools under a federal statute violated the Establishment Clause.  The Court set out a two-part test for determining standing: First,  a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of Art.I, 8. Secondly, the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power and not simply that the enactment is generally beyond the powers delegated to Congress by Art.I, 8.  392 U. S., at 102103.  The Court then held that the particular taxpayer had satisfied both prongs of the test.  Id., at 103104.  Pp.1112. 


4.Respondents broad reading of the Flast exception to cover any expenditure of Government funds in violation of the Establishment Clause fails to observe the rigor with which the Flast exception to the Frothingham principle ought to be applied.  Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 481.  Given that the alleged Establishment Clause violation in Flast was funded by a specific congressional appropriation and was undertaken pursuant to an express congressional mandate, the Court concluded that the taxpayer-plaintiffs had established the requisite logical link between [their taxpayer] status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.  392 U. S., at 102.  Their constitutional challenge [was] made to an exercise by Congress of its power under Art.I, 8, to spend for the general welfare.  Id., at 103.  But Flast limited taxpayer standing to challenges directed only [at] exercises of congressional power under the Taxing and Spending Clause.  Valley Forge, supra, at 479.  Pp.1213. 


5.The link between congressional action and constitutional violation that supported taxpayer standing in Flast is missing here.  Respondents neither challenge any specific congressional action or appropriation nor ask the Court to invalidate any congressional enactment or legislatively created program as unconstitutional.  That is because the expenditures at issue were not made pursuant to any Act of Congress, but under general appropriations to the Executive Branch to fund day-to-day activities.  These appropriations did not expressly authorize, direct, or even mention the expenditures in question, which resulted from executive discretion, not congressional action.  The Court has never found taxpayer standing under such circumstances.  Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 619620, distinguished.  Pp.1318. 


6.Respondents argue to no avail that distinguishing between money spent pursuant to congressional mandate and expenditures made in the course of executive discretion is arbitrary because the injury to taxpayers in both situations is the same as that targeted by the Establishment Clause and Flastthe expenditure for the support of religion of funds exacted from taxpayers.  But Flast focused on congressional action, and the invitation to extend its holding to encompass discretionary Executive Branch expenditures must be declined.  The Court has repeatedly emphasized that the Flast exception has a narrow application, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. ___, ___, that only slightly lowered the bar on taxpayer standing, United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 173, and that must be applied with rigor, Valley Forge, supra, at 481.  Pp.1819. 


7.Also rejected is respondents argument that Executive Branch expenditures in support of religion are no different from legislative extractions.  Flast itself rejected this equivalence.  392 U. S., at 102.   Because almost all Executive Branch activity is ultimately funded by some congressional appropriation, extending the Flast exception to purely executive expenditures would effectively subject every federal actionbe it a conference, proclamation, or speechto Establishment Clause challenge by any taxpayer in federal court.  Respondents proposed rule would also raise serious separation-of-powers concerns, enlisting the federal courts to superintend, at the behest of any federal taxpayer, the speeches, statements, and myriad daily activities of the President, his staff, and other Executive Branch officials.  Pp.1921. 


8.Both the Seventh Circuit and respondents implicitly recognize that unqualified federal taxpayer standing to assert Establishment Clause claims would go too far, but neither has identified a workable limitation.  Taking the Circuits zero-marginal-cost test literallyi.e., that any marginal cost greater than zero sufficestaxpayers might well have standing to challenge some (and perhaps many) speeches by Government officials.  At a minimum, that approach would create difficult and uncomfortable line-drawing problems.  Respondents proposal to require an expenditure to be fairly traceable to the conduct alleged to violate the Establishment Clause, so that challenges to the content of any particular speech would be screened out, is too vague and ill-defined to be accepted.  Pp.2123.


9.None of the parade of horribles respondents claim could occur if Flast is not extended to discretionary Executive Branch expenditures has happened.  In the unlikely event any do take place, Congress can quickly step in.  And respondents make no effort to show that these improbable abuses could not be challenged in federal court by plaintiffs possessed of standing based on grounds other than their taxpayer status.  Pp. 2324.


10.This case does not require the Court to reconsider Flast.  The Seventh Circuit did not apply Flast; it extended it.  Valley Forge Christian Academy illustrates that a necessary concomitant of stare decisis is that a precedent is not always expanded to the limit of its logic.  That is the approach taken here.  Flast is neither extended nor overruled.  It is simply left as it was.  Pp.2425.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concurred in the Courts judgment, concluding that Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, should be overruled as wholly irreconcilable with the Article III restrictions on federal-court jurisdiction that are embodied in the standing doctrine.  Pp.121.

06-219|"WILKIE etal. v. ROBBINS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 06219.Argued March 19, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
Plaintiff-respondent Robbinss Wyoming guest ranch is a patchwork of land parcels intermingled with tracts belonging to other private owners, the State of Wyoming, and the National Government.  The previous owner granted the United States an easement to use and maintain a road running through the ranch to federal land in return for a right-of-way to maintain a section of road running across federal land to otherwise isolated parts of the ranch.  When Robbins bought the ranch, he took title free of the easement, which the Bureau had not recorded.  Robbins continued to graze cattle and run guest cattle drives under grazing permits and a Special Recreation Use Permit (SRUP) issued by the Bureau of Land Management.  Upon learning that the easement was never recorded, a Bureau official demanded that Robbins regrant it, but Robbins declined.  Robbins claims that after negotiations broke down, defendant-petitioners (defendants) began a campaign of harassment and intimidation to force him to regrant the lost easement.


Robbinss suit for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief now includes a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim that defendants repeatedly tried to extort an easement from him and a similarly grounded Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, claim that defendants violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.  Ultimately, the District Court denied defendants motion to dismiss the RICO claim based on qualified immunity.  As to the Bivens claims, it dismissed what Robbins called his Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim and his Fifth Amendment due process claims, but declined to dismiss a Fifth Amendment claim of retaliation for the exercise of Robbinss rights to exclude the Government from his property and to refuse to grant a property interest without compensation.  It adhered to this denial on summary judgment.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed.
Held:
1.Robbins does not have a private action for damages of the sort recognized in Bivens.  Pp.923.


(a)In deciding whether to devise a Bivens remedy for retaliation against the exercise of ownership rights, the Courts first step is to ask whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.  Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 378.  But even absent an alternative, a Bivens remedy is a subject of judgment: the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common-law tribunal, paying particular heed  to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.  Ibid.  Pp.911.


(b)For purposes of step one, Robbinss difficulties with the Bureau can be divided into four categories.  The first, torts or tort-like injuries, includes an unauthorized survey of the desired easements terrain and an illegal entry into Robbinss lodge.  In each instance, he had a civil damages remedy for trespass, which he did not pursue.  The second category, charges brought against Robbins, includes administrative claims for trespass and other land-use violations, a fine for an unauthorized road repair, and two criminal charges.  Robbins had the opportunity to contest all of the administrative charges; he fought some of the land-use and trespass citations, and challenged the road repair fine as far as the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA), but did not seek judicial review after losing there.  He exercised his right to jury trial on the criminal complaints.  The fact that the jury took 30 minutes to acquit him tends to support his baseless-prosecution charge; but the federal trial judge did not find the Governments case thin enough to justify attorneys fees, and Robbins appealed that ruling late.  The third category, unfavorable agency actions, involved a 1995 cancellation of the right-of-way given to Robbinss predecessor in return for the Governments unrecorded easement, a 1995 decision to reduce the SRUP from five years to one, and in 1999, the SRUPs termination and a grazing permits revocation.  Administrative review was available for each claim, subject to ultimate judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Robbins did not appeal the 1995 decisions, stopped after an IBLA appeal of the SRUP denial, and obtained an IBLA stay of the grazing permit revocation.  The fourth category includes three events that elude classification.  An altercation between Robbins and his neighbor did not implicate the Bureau, and no criminal charges were filed.  Bureau employees videotaping of ranch guests during a cattle drive, though annoying and possibly bad for business, may not have been unlawful, depending, e.g., on whether the guests were on public or private land.  Also, the guests might be the proper plaintiffs in any tort action, and any tort might be chargeable against the Government, not its employees.  Likewise up in the air is the significance of an attempt to pressure a Bureau of Indian Affairs employee to impound Robbinss cattle.  An impoundments legitimacy would have depended on whether the cattle were on private or public land, and no impoundment actually occurred.  Thus, Robbins has an administrative, and ultimately a judicial, process for vindicating virtually all of his complaints.  This state of law gives him no intuitively meritorious case for a new constitutional cause of action, but neither does it plainly answer no to the question whether he should have it.  Pp.1114.


(c)This, then, is a case for Bivens step two, for weighing reasons for and against creating a new cause of action, as common law judges have always done.  Robbins concedes that any single action might have been brushed aside as a small imposition, but says that in the aggregate the campaign against him amounted to coercion to extract the easement and should be redressed collectively.  On the other side of the ledger is the difficulty in defining a workable cause of action.  Robbinss claim of retaliation for exercising his property right to exclude the Government does not fit this Courts retaliation cases, which involve an allegation of impermissible purpose and motivatione.g., an employee is fired after speaking out on matters of public concern, Board of Commrs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, 518 U. S. 668, 675and whose outcome turns on what for questionswhat was the Governments purpose in firing the employee and would he have been fired anyway.  Such questions have definite answers, and this Court has established methods to identify the presence of an illicit reason.  Robbins alleges not that the Governments means were illegitimate but that the defendants simply demanded too much and went too far.  However, a too much kind of liability standard can never be as reliable as a what for one.  Most of the offending actions are legitimate tactics designed to improve the Governments negotiating position.  Although the Government is no ordinary landowner, in many ways it deals with its neighbors as one owner among the rest.  So long as defendants had authority to withhold or withdraw Robbinss permission to use Government land and to enforce the trespass and land-use rules, they were within their rights to make it plain that Robbinss willingness to give an easement would determine how complaisant they would be about his trespasses on public land.  As for Robbinss more abstract claim, recognizing a Bivens action for retaliation against those who resist Government impositions on their property rights would invite claims in every sphere of legitimate governmental action affecting property interests, from negotiating tax claim settlements to enforcing Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.  Pp.1423.


2.RICO does not give Robbins a claim against defendants in their individual capacities.  Robbins argues that the predicate act for his RICO claim is a violation of the Hobbs Act, which criminalizes interference with interstate commerce by extortion, along with attempts or conspiracies, 18 U. S.C. 1951(a), and defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another, with his consent  under color of official right, 1951(b)(2).  Robbinss claim fails because the Hobbs Act does not apply when the National Government is the intended beneficiary of allegedly extortionate acts.  That Act does not speak explicitly to efforts to obtain property for the Government rather than a private party, so the question turns on the common law conception of extortion, which Congress is presumed to have incorporated into the Act in 1946, see, e.g., Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 402.  At common law, extortion by the public official was the rough equivalent of what [is] now describe[d] as taking a bribe.  Evans v. United States, 504 U. S. 255, 260.  While public officials were not immune from extortion charges at common law, that crime focused on the harm of public corruption, by selling public favors for private gain, not on the harm caused by overzealous efforts to obtain property on the Governments behalf.  The importance of the line between public and private beneficiaries is confirmed by this Courts case law, which is completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right undertaken for the sole benefit of the Government.  More tellingly, Robbins cites no decision by any court, much less this one, in the Hobbs Acts entire 60-year history finding extortion in Government employees efforts to get property for the Governments exclusive benefit.  United States v. Green, 350 U. S. 415, 420, which held that extortion as defined in the [Hobbs Act] in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property, does not support Robbinss claim that Congress could not have meant to prohibit extortionate acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but ignore them when the intended beneficiary is the Government.  Without some other indication from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that the Hobbs Act (let alone RICO) was intended to expose all federal employees to extortion charges whenever they stretch in trying to enforce Government property claims.  Because defendants conduct does not fit the traditional definition of extortion, it also does not survive as a RICO predicate offense on the theory that it is chargeable under [Wyoming] law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, 18 U. S.C. 1961(1)(A).  Pp. 2328.
433 F.3d 755, reversed and remanded.

Robbinss claim fails because the Hobbs Act does not apply when the National Government is the intended beneficiary of allegedly extortionate acts.  That Act does not speak explicitly to efforts to obtain property for the Government rather than a private party, so the question turns on the common law conception of extortion, which Congress is presumed to have incorporated into the Act in 1946, see, e.g., Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 402.  At common law, extortion by the public official was the rough equivalent of what [is] now describe[d] as taking a bribe.  Evans v. United States, 504 U. S. 255, 260.  While public officials were not immune from extortion charges at common law, that crime focused on the harm of public corruption, by selling public favors for private gain, not on the harm caused by overzealous efforts to obtain property on the Governments behalf.  The importance of the line between public and private beneficiaries is confirmed by this Courts case law, which is completely barren of an example of extortion under color of official right undertaken for the sole benefit of the Government.  More tellingly, Robbins cites no decision by any court, much less this one, in the Hobbs Acts entire 60-year history finding extortion in Government employees efforts to get property for the Governments exclusive benefit.  United States v. Green, 350 U. S. 415, 420, which held that extortion as defined in the [Hobbs Act] in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property, does not support Robbinss claim that Congress could not have meant to prohibit extortionate acts in the interest of private entities like unions, but ignore them when the intended beneficiary is the Government.  Without some other indication from Congress, it is not reasonable to assume that the Hobbs Act (let alone RICO) was intended to expose all federal employees to extortion charges whenever they stretch in trying to enforce Government property claims.  Because defendants conduct does not fit the traditional definition of extortion, it also does not survive as a RICO predicate offense on the theory that it is chargeable under [Wyoming] law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, 18 U. S.C. 1961(1)(A).  Pp. 2328.

06-278|"MORSE etal. v. FREDERICK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06278.Argued March 19, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
At a school-sanctioned and school-supervised event, petitioner Morse, the high school principal, saw students unfurl a banner stating BONG HiTS 4 JESUS, which she regarded as promoting illegal drug use.  Consistent with established school policy prohibiting such messages at school events, Morse directed the students to take down the banner.  When one of the students who had brought the banner to the eventrespondent Frederickrefused, Morse confiscated the banner and later suspended him.  The school superintendent upheld the suspension, explaining, inter alia, that Frederick was disciplined because his banner appeared to advocate illegal drug use in violation of school policy.  Petitioner school board also upheld the suspension.  Frederick filed suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the school board and Morse had violated his First Amendment rights.  The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, ruling that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that they had not infringed Fredericks speech rights.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.  Accepting that Frederick acted during a school-authorized activity and that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, the court nonetheless found a First Amendment violation because the school punished Frederick without demonstrating that his speech threatened substantial disruption.  It also concluded that Morse was not entitled to qualified immunity because Fredericks right to display the banner was so clearly established that a reasonable principal in Morses position would have understood that her actions were unconstitutional.  
Held:Because schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use, the school officials in this case did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending Frederick.  Pp.515. 
(a)Fredericks argument that this is not a school speech case is rejected.  The event in question occurred during normal school hours and was sanctioned by Morse as an approved social event at which the districts student-conduct rules expressly applied.  Teachers and administrators were among the students and were charged with supervising them.  Frederick stood among other students across the street from the school and directed his banner toward the school, making it plainly visible to most students.  Under these circumstances, Frederick cannot claim he was not at school.  Pp.56. 


(b)The Court agrees with Morse that those who viewed the banner would interpret it as advocating or promoting illegal drug use, in violation of school policy.  At least two interpretations of the banners wordsthat they constitute an imperative encouraging viewers to smoke marijuana or, alternatively, that they celebrate drug usedemonstrate that the sign promoted such use.  This pro-drug interpretation gains further plausibility from the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear.  Pp.68. 


(c)A principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.  In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, the Court declared, in holding that a policy prohibiting high school students from wearing antiwar armbands violated the First Amendment, id., at 504, that student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school, id., at 513.  The Court in Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, however, upheld the suspension of a student who delivered a high school assembly speech employing an elaborate, graphic, and explicit sexual metaphor, id., at 678.  Analyzing the case under Tinker, the lower courts had found no disruption, and therefore no basis for discipline.  478 U. S., at 679680.  This Court reversed, holding that the school was within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions  in response to [the students] offensively lewd and indecent speech.  Id., at 685.  Two basic principles may be distilled from Fraser.  First, it demonstrates that the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.  Id., at 682.  Had Fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school context, he would have been protected.  See, id., at 682683.  In school, however, his First Amendment rights were circumscribed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.  Tinker, supra, at 506.  Second, Fraser established that Tinkers mode of analysis is not absolute, since the Fraser Court did not conduct the substantial disruption analysis.  Subsequently, the Court has held in the Fourth Amendment context that while children assuredly do not shed their constitutional rights  at the schoolhouse gate,  the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school, Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 655656, and has recognized that deterring drug use by schoolchildren is an importantindeed, perhaps compelling interest, id., at 661.  Drug abuse by the Nations youth is a serious problem.  For example, Congress has declared that part of a schools job is educating students about the dangers of drug abuse, see, e.g., the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994, and petitioners and many other schools have adopted policies aimed at implementing this message.  Student speech celebrating illegal drug use at a school event, in the presence of school administrators and teachers, poses a particular challenge for school officials working to protect those entrusted to their care.  The special characteristics of the school environment, Tinker, 393 U. S., at 506, and the governmental interest in stopping student drug abuse allow schools to restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting such abuse.  Id., at 508, 509, distinguished.  Pp.815.

06-340|"NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS etal. v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06340.Argued April 17, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), petitioner Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially administers each States National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, but CWA 402(b) provides that the EPA shall approve transfer of permitting authority to a State upon application and a showing that the State has met nine specified criteria.  Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) requires federal agencies to consult with agencies designated by the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to insure that a proposed agency action is unlikely to jeopardize an endangered or threatened species.  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administer the ESA.  Once a consultation process is complete, a written biological opinion is issued, which may suggest alternative actions to protect a jeopardized species or its critical habitat.  When Arizona officials sought EPA authorization to administer the States NPDES program, the EPA initiated consultation with the FWS to determine whether the transfer would adversely affect any listed species.  The FWS regional office wanted potential impacts taken into account, but the EPA disagreed, finding that 402(b)s mandatory nature stripped it of authority to disapprove a transfer based on any other considerations.  The dispute was referred to the agencies national offices for resolution.  The FWSs biological opinion concluded that the requested transfer would not jeopardize listed species.  The EPA concluded that Arizona had met each of 402(b)s nine criteria and approved the transfer, noting that the biological opinion had concluded the consultation required by ESA 7(a)(2).  Respondents sought review in the Ninth Circuit, petitioner National Association of Home Builders intervened, and part of respondent Defenders of Wildlifes separate action was consolidated with the suit.  The court held that the EPAs transfer approval was arbitrary and capricious because the EPA had relied on contradictory positions regarding its 7(a)(2) responsibilities during the administrative process.  Rather than remanding the case for the agency to explain its decision, however, the court reviewed the EPAs substantive construction of the statutes.  It did not dispute that Arizona had met CWA 402(b)s nine criteria, but nevertheless concluded that ESA 7(a)(2) required the EPA to determine whether its transfer decision would jeopardize listed species, in effect adding a tenth criterion.  The court dismissed the argument that the EPAs approval was not subject to 7(a)(2) because it was not a discretionary action under 50 CFR 402.03, 7(a)(2)s interpretative regulation.  The court thus vacated the EPAs transfer decision.
Held:
1.The Ninth Circuits determination that the EPAs action was arbitrary and capricious is not fairly supported by the record.  This Court will not vacate an agencys decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard unless the agency relied on factors which Congress had not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43.  Here, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the EPAs decision was internally inconsistent in its statements during the review process.  Federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agencys final action, and the fact that a local agency representatives preliminary determination is later overruled at a higher agency level does not render the decisionmaking process arbitrary and capricious.  The EPAs final approval notice stating that 7(a)(2)s required consultation process had been concluded may be inconsistent with its previously expressed positionand position in this litigationthat 7(a)(2)s consultation requirement is not triggered by a 402 transfer application, but that is not the type of error requiring a remand.  By the time the statement was issued, the EPA and FWS had already consulted, and the question whether that consultation had been required was not germane to the final agency decision.  Thus, this Court need not further delay the permitting authority transfer by remanding to the agency for clarification.  Respondents suggest that the EPA nullified their right to participate in the application proceedings by altering its legal position during the pendency of the transfer decision and its associated litigation, but they do not suggest that they were deprived of their right to comment during the comment period made available under the EPAs regulations.  Pp.1014.


2.Because 7(a)(2)s no-jeopardy duty covers only discretionary agency actions, it does not attach to actions (like the NPDES permitting transfer authorization) that an agency is required by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.  Pp.1425.


(a)At first glance the legislative commands here are irreconcilable.  Section 402(b)s shall approve language is mandatory and its list exclusive; if the nine specified criteria are satisfied, the EPA does not have the discretion to deny a transfer application.  Section 7(a)(2)s similarly imperative language would literally add a tenth criterion to 402(b).  Pp.1415.


(b)While a later enacted statute (such as the ESA) can sometimes operate to amend or even repeal an earlier statutory provision (such as the CWA), repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the legislatures intention to repeal [is] clear and manifest.  Watt v. Alaska, 451 U. S. 259, 267.  Statutory repeal will not be inferred unless the later statute expressly contradict[s] the original act or such a construction is absolutely necessary [to give the later statutes words] any meaning at all.  Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U. S. 535, 548.  Otherwise, a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum.  Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U. S. 148, 153.  The Ninth Circuits reading of 7(a)(2) would effectively repeal 402(b)s mandate that the EPA shall issue a permit whenever all nine exclusive statutory prerequisites are met.  Section 402(b) does not just set minimum requirements; it affirmatively mandates a transfers approval, thus operating as a ceiling as well as a floor.  By adding an additional criterion, the Ninth Circuit raises that floor and alters the statutes command.  Read broadly, the Ninth Circuits construction would also partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it not jeopardize listed species.  Pp.1517.


(c)Title 50 CFR 402.03, promulgated by the NMFS and FWS and applying 7(a)(2) to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control (emphasis added), harmonizes the CWA and ESA by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  The Court owes some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the ESA, Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 703.  Deference is not due if Congress has made its intent clear in the statutory text, Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, but if the statute is silent or ambiguous  the question  is whether the agencys answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute, id., at 843.  Because the meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident  in context, FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132, 7(a)(2) must be read against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal were it construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  Such a reading leaves a fundamental ambiguity.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates of ESA 7(a)(2) and CWA 402(b), and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.  Thus, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which harmonizes the statutes by applying 7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.  This interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme and is therefore entitled to Chevron deference.  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is required to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize listed species.  The basic principle of Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U. S. 752that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to take, id., at 770supports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation.  Pp.1722.


(d)Respondents contrary position is not supported by TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, which had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  Pp. 2224.


(e)Also unavailing is the argument that EPAs decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented a discretionary agency action.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has shown that it can carry out 402(b)s enumerated criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in 402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of listed species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of 402(b)s criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species, Arizona has satisfied each of those criteria.  Respondents argument has also been disclaimed by the FWS and the NMFS, the agencies primarily charged with administering 7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section.  Pp. 2425.

Read broadly, the Ninth Circuits construction would also partially override every federal statute mandating agency action by subjecting such action to the further condition that it not jeopardize listed species.  Pp.1517.


(c)Title 50 CFR 402.03, promulgated by the NMFS and FWS and applying 7(a)(2) to all actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control (emphasis added), harmonizes the CWA and ESA by giving effect to the ESAs no-jeopardy mandate whenever an agency has discretion to do so, but not when the agency is forbidden from considering such extrastatutory factors.  The Court owes some degree of deference to the Secretarys reasonable interpretation of the ESA, Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 703.  Deference is not due if Congress has made its intent clear in the statutory text, Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842, but if the statute is silent or ambiguous  the question  is whether the agencys answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute, id., at 843.  Because the meaningor ambiguityof certain words or phrases may only become evident  in context, FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132, 7(a)(2) must be read against the statutory backdrop of the many mandatory agency directives whose operation it would implicitly abrogate or repeal were it construed as broadly as the Ninth Circuit did below.  Such a reading leaves a fundamental ambiguity.  An agency cannot simultaneously obey the differing mandates of ESA 7(a)(2) and CWA 402(b), and consequently the statutory languageread in light of the canon against implied repealsdoes not itself provide clear guidance as to which command must give way.  Thus, it is appropriate to look to the implementing agencys expert interpretation, which harmonizes the statutes by applying 7(a)(2) to guide agencies existing discretionary authority, but not reading it to override express statutory mandates.  This interpretation is reasonable in light of the statutes text and the overall statutory scheme and is therefore entitled to Chevron deference.  The regulations focus on discretionary actions accords with the commonsense conclusion that, when an agency is required to do something by statute, it simply lacks the power to insure that such action will not jeopardize listed species.  The basic principle of Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 U. S. 752that an agency cannot be considered the legal cause of an action that it has no statutory discretion not to take, id., at 770supports the reasonableness of the FWSs interpretation.  Pp.1722.


(d)Respondents contrary position is not supported by TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, which had no occasion to answer the question presented in these cases.  Pp. 2224.


(e)Also unavailing is the argument that EPAs decision to transfer NPDES permitting authority to Arizona represented a discretionary agency action.  While the EPA may exercise some judgment in determining whether a State has shown that it can carry out 402(b)s enumerated criteria, the statute clearly does not grant it the discretion to add another entirely separate prerequisite to that list.  Nothing in 402(b) authorizes the EPA to consider the protection of listed species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.  And to the extent that some of 402(b)s criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species, Arizona has satisfied each of those criteria.  Respondents argument has also been disclaimed by the FWS and the NMFS, the agencies primarily charged with administering 7(a)(2) and the drafters of the regulations implementing that section.

06-969|"FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION v. WISCONSIN RIGHT TO LIFE, INC.
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 06969.Argued April 25, 2007Decided June 25, 2007
Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), makes it a federal crime for a corporation to use its general treasury funds to pay for any electioneering communication, 2 U. S.C. 441b(b)(2), which BCRA defines as any broadcast that refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction where that candidate is running, 434(f)(3)(A).  In McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, this Court upheld 203 against a First Amendment facial challenge even though the section encompassed not only campaign speech, or express advocacy promoting a candidates election or defeat, but also issue advocacy, or speech about public issues more generally, that also mentions such a candidate.  The Court concluded there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Id., at 204205, 206.


On July 26, 2004, appellee Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), began broadcasting advertisements declaring that a group of Senators was filibustering to delay and block federal judicial nominees and telling voters to contact Wisconsin Senators Feingold and Kohl to urge them to oppose the filibuster.  WRTL planned to run the ads throughout August 2004 and finance them with its general treasury funds.  Recognizing, however, that as of August 15, 30 days before the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal electioneering communication[s] under BCRA 203, but believing that it nonetheless had a First Amendment right to broadcast them, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that 203s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the three ads in question, as well as any materially similar ads WRTL might run in the future.  Just before the BCRA blackout, the three-judge District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that McConnells reasoning that 203 was not facially overbroad left no room for such as-applied challenges.  WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period, and the court subsequently dismissed the complaint.  This Court vacated that judgment, holding that McConnell did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges to 203.  Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commn (WRTL I), 546 U. S. 410, 412.  On remand, the District Court granted WRTL summary judgment, holding 203 unconstitutional as applied to the three ads.  The court first found that adjudication was not barred by mootness because the controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review.  On the merits, it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads, not express advocacy or its functional equivalent under McConnell, and held that no compelling interest justified BCRAs regulation of such ads.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
466 F.Supp. 2d 195, affirmed.
The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases.  The FEC argues that the cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL neither asserts a continuing interest in running its ads nor identifies any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.  These cases, however, fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  That exception applies where (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again, Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17.  Both circumstances are present here.  First, it would be unreasonable to expect that WRTL could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time to air its ads during the BCRA blackout periods.  Indeed, two BCRA blackout periods have passed during the pendency of this action.  Second, there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur: WRTL has credibly claimed that it plans to run materially similar targeted ads during future blackout periods, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will refrain from prosecuting future BCRA violations.  Pp.710.


The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito, concluded that BCRA 203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads at issue in these cases.  Pp.1029.  


1.The speech at issue is not the functional equivalent of express campaign speech.  Pp.  1022.


(a)Appellants are wrong in arguing that WRTL has the burden of demonstrating that 203 is unconstitutional.  Because 203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny, see, e.g., McConnell, supra, at 205, under which the Government must prove that applying BCRA to WRTLs ads furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, see First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 786.  Given that McConnell, supra, at 206, already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent, the FECs burden is not onerous insofar as these ads fit this description.  Pp. 1011. 


(b)Contrary to the FECs contention, McConnell, 540 U. S., at 205206, did not establish an intent-and-effect test for determining if a particular ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Indeed, McConnell did not adopt any test for future as-applied challenges, but simply grounded its analysis in the evidentiary record, which included two key studies that separated ads based on whether they were intended to, or had the effect of, supporting candidates for federal office.  Id., at 308309.  More importantly, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14, 4344, rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates, and McConnell did not purport to overrule Buckley on this pointor even address what Buckley had to say on the subject.  Pp. 1115. 


(c)Because WRTLs ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore fall outside McConnells scope.  To safeguard freedom of speech on public issues, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA 203 must be objective, focusing on the communications substance rather than on amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See Buckley, supra, at 4344.  It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.  See Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119.  And it must eschew the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors, which invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.  Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547.  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269270.  In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  WRTLs three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy under this test.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: They focus and take a position on a legislative issue and exhort the public to adopt that position and to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: They do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they take no position on a candidates character, qualifications, or fitness for office.  Pp. 1522. 


2.Because WRTLs ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTLs speech, BCRA 203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  The section can be constitutionally applied only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.  E.g., McConnell, supra, at 205.  None of the interests that might justify regulating WRTLs ads are sufficiently compelling.  Although the Court has long recognized the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in election campaigns, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 45, it has invoked this interest as a reason for upholding contribution limits, id., at 2627, and suggested that it might also justify limits on electioneering expenditures posing the same dangers as large contributions, id., at 45.  McConnell arguably applied this interest to ads that were the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204206.  But to justify regulation of WRTLs ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Issue ads like WRTLs are not equivalent to contributions, and the corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  A second possible compelling interest lies in addressing the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the publics support for the corporations political ideas.  Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 660.  McConnell held that this interest justifies regulating the functional equivalent of campaign speech, 540 U. S., at 205206.  This interest cannot be extended further to apply to genuine issue ads like WRTLs, see, e.g., id., at 206, n. 88, because doing so would call into question this Courts holdings that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  WRTL I reinforced the validity of this point by holding 203 susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411412.  Pp. 2328.


3.These cases present no occasion to revisit McConnells holding that a corporations express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a banthe question herethe Court should give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  Pp. 2829.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas, agreed that the Court has jurisdiction in these cases and concurred in the Courts judgment because he would overrule that part of McConnell v. Federal Election Commn, 540 U. S. 93, upholding 203(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).  Pp.423.


1.The pertinent case law begins with Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, in which the Court held, inter alia, that a federal limitation on campaign expenditures not made in coordination with a candidates campaign (contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)) was unconstitutional, id., at 3951.  In light of vagueness concerns, the Court narrowly construed the independent-expenditure provision to cover only express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office by use of such magic words as vote for, elect,  vote against, defeat, reject.  Id., at 44, and n. 52.  This narrowing construction excluded so-called issue advocacy referring to a clearly identified candidates position on an issue, but not expressly advocating his election or defeat.  Even as narrowly construed, however, the Court struck the provision down.  Id., at 4546.  Despite Buckley, some argued that independent expenditures by corporations should be treated differently.  A post-Buckley case, First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776777, struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a state statute prohibiting corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum.  The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, upholding state restrictions on corporations independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates for state office, id., at 654655.  Austin was wrongly decided, but at least it was limited to express advocacy.  Nonexpress advocacy was presumed to remain protected under Buckley and Bellotti, even when engaged in by corporations, until McConnell.  McConnell held, inter alia, that the compelling governmental interest supporting restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacyi.e., Austins perceived corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth, 540 U. S., at 205also justified extending those restrictions to ads run during the BCRA blackout period to the extent  [they] are the functional equivalent of express advocacy, id., at 206 (emphasis added).  McConnell upheld BCRA 203(a) against a facial challenge.  Subsequently, in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commn, 546 U. S. 410, 411412, the Court held that McConnell did not foreclose as-applied challenges to 203.  Pp.410. 


2.McConnells holding concerning 203 was wrong.  The answer to whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious standard is McConnells, which asks whether an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 540 U. S., at 206.  The fundamental and inescapable problem with this test, with the principal opinions susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation standard, and with other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental First Amendment rights at issue.  Buckley itself compelled the conclusion that such tests fall short when it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 4344.  The only plausible explanation for Buckleys highly strained reading of FECA, McConnell, supra, at 280, is that the Court there eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECAs text and more effective at capturing campaign speech because those tests were all too vague.  If Buckley foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by 203 that 203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  Thus, McConnell (which presupposed the availability of as-applied challenges) was mistaken.  Pp.1018. 


3.Stare decisis would not prevent the Court from overruling McConnells 203 holding.  This Courts considered practice is not to apply that principle as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases, Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 543, and it has not hesitated to overrule a decision offensive to the First Amendment that was decided just a few years earlier, see West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642.  Pp.1922.
Roberts, C.J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, in which Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to Parts III and IV, in which Alito, J., joined.  Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., joined.  Souter, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.
Together with No. 06970, McCain, United States Senator, etal. v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., also on appeal from the same court.

Even as narrowly construed, however, the Court struck the provision down.  Id., at 4546.  Despite Buckley, some argued that independent expenditures by corporations should be treated differently.  A post-Buckley case, First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776777, struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a state statute prohibiting corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum.  The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, upholding state restrictions on corporations independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates for state office, id., at 654655.  Austin was wrongly decided, but at least it was limited to express advocacy.  Nonexpress advocacy was presumed to remain protected under Buckley and Bellotti, even when engaged in by corporations, until McConnell.  McConnell held, inter alia, that the compelling governmental interest supporting restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacyi.e., Austins perceived corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth, 540 U. S., at 205also justified extending those restrictions to ads run during the BCRA blackout period to the extent  [they] are the functional equivalent of express advocacy, id., at 206 (emphasis added).  McConnell upheld BCRA 203(a) against a facial challenge.  Subsequently, in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commn, 546 U. S. 410, 411412, the Court held that McConnell did not foreclose as-applied challenges to 203.  Pp.410. 


2.McConnells holding concerning 203 was wrong.  The answer to whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious standard is McConnells, which asks whether an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, 540 U. S., at 206.  The fundamental and inescapable problem with this test, with the principal opinions susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation standard, and with other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental First Amendment rights at issue.  Buckley itself compelled the conclusion that such tests fall short when it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 4344.  The only plausible explanation for Buckleys highly strained reading of FECA, McConnell, supra, at 280, is that the Court there eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECAs text and more effective at capturing campaign speech because those tests were all too vague.  If Buckley foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by 203 that 203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  Thus, McConnell (which presupposed the availability of as-applied challenges) was mistaken.  Pp.1018. 


3.Stare decisis would not prevent the Court from overruling McConnells 203 holding.  This Courts considered practice is not to apply that principle as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases, Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 543, and it has not hesitated to overrule a decision offensive to the First Amendment that was decided just a few years earlier, see West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642.

ASSOCIATION v. BRENTWOOD ACADEMY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 06427.Argued April 18, 2007Decided June 21, 2007
Petitioner association (TSSAA) regulates interscholastic sports among its members, Tennessee public and private high schools.  TSSAA sanctioned respondent (Brentwood), one of those private schools, because its football coach sent eighth-grade boys a letter that violated TSSAAs rule prohibiting members from using undue influence in recruiting middle school students for their athletic programs.  Following internal TSSAA review, Brentwood sued TSSAA and its executive director under 42 U. S.C. 1983, claiming, inter alia, that enforcement of the antirecruiting rule was state action violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and that TSSAAs flawed adjudication of its appeal deprived Brentwood of due process.  The District Court granted Brentwood relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that TSSAA was a private voluntary association that did not act under color of state law.  This Court reversed that determination, Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 531 U. S. 288, and the District Court again ruled for Brentwood on remand.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the antirecruiting rule is a content-based regulation of speech that is not narrowly tailored to serve its permissible purposes and that the TSSAA board improperly considered ex parte evidence, thereby violating Brentwoods due process rights.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
442 F.3d 410, reversed and remanded.
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIB, III, and IV, concluding:


1.Enforcing a rule that prohibits high school coaches from recruiting middle school athletes does not violate the First Amendment.  Brentwood made a voluntary decision to join TSSAA and to abide by its antirecruiting rule.  See 531 U. S., at  291.  An athletic leagues interest in enforcing its rules may warrant curtailing the speech of its voluntary participants.  See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568.  TSSAA does not have unbounded authority to condition membership on the relinquishment of constitutional rights, see Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. ___, ___, and can impose only those conditions that are necessary to managing an efficient and effective state-sponsored high school athletic league.  That necessity is obviously present here.  No empirical data is needed to credit TSSAAs commonsense conclusion that hard-sell tactics directed at middle school students could lead to exploitation, distort competition between high school teams, and foster an environment in which athletics are prized more highly than academics.  TSSAAs rule discourages precisely the sort of conduct that might lead to those harms, any one of which would detract from a high school sports leagues ability to operate efficiently and effectively.  Garcetti, 547 U. S., at ___.  Pp.78.


2.TSSAA did not violate Brentwoods due process rights.  The sanction decision was preceded by an investigation, several meetings, correspondence, the TSSAA executive directors adverse written determination, a hearing before the director and an advisory panel, and a de novo review by the entire TSSAA board.  During the investigation, Brentwood was notified of all the charges against it.  At each of the hearings, it was represented by counsel and given the opportunity to adduce evidence, none of which was excluded.  The Court rejects Brentwoods argument that its due process rights were nevertheless violated when the full TSSAA board, acting ex parte, heard from investigators and other witnesses and considered the investigators notes and other evidence concerning a separate incident in which a basketball coach named King, who was not a Brentwood employee, pushed a middle school basketball star to attend Brentwood.  Even accepting the questionable holding that TSSAAs closed-door deliberations were unconstitutional, any due process violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is unlikely the King allegations increased the severity of the penalties leveled against Brentwood.  More importantly, Brentwoods prejudice claim rests on the unsupported premise that it would have adopted a different and more effective strategy at the board hearing had it been given an opportunity to cross-examine the investigators and review their notes.  Brentwood has identified nothing the investigators shared with the Board that Brentwood did not already know.  Pp.812.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 06484.Argued March 28, 2007Decided June 21, 2007
As a check against abusive litigation in private securities fraud actions, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) includes exacting pleading requirements.  The Act requires plaintiffs to state with particularity both the facts constituting the alleged violation, and the facts evidencing scienter, i.e., the defendants intention to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.  Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, and n. 12.  As set out in 21D(b)(2), plaintiffs must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.  15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(2).  Congress left the key term strong inference undefined.


Petitioner Tellabs, Inc., manufactures specialized equipment for fiber optic networks.  Respondents (Shareholders) purchased Tellabs stock between December 11, 2000, and June 19, 2001.  They filed a class action, alleging that Tellabs and petitioner Notebaert, then Tellabs chief executive officer and president, had engaged in securities fraud in violation of 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5, and that Notebaert was a controlling person under the 1934 Act, and therefore derivatively liable for the companys fraudulent acts.  Tellabs moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the Shareholders had failed to plead their case with the particularity the PSLRA requires.  The District Court agreed, dismissing the complaint without prejudice.  The Shareholders then amended their complaint, adding references to 27 confidential sources and making further, more specific, allegations concerning Notebaerts mental state.  The District Court again dismissed, this time with prejudice.  The Shareholders had sufficiently pleaded that Notebaerts statements were misleading, the court determined, but they had insufficiently alleged that he acted with scienter.  The Seventh Circuit reversed in relevant part.  Like the District Court, it found that the Shareholders had pleaded the misleading character of Notebaerts statements with sufficient particularity.  Unlike the District Court, however, it concluded that the Shareholders had sufficiently alleged that Notebaert acted with the requisite state of mind.  In evaluating whether the PSLRAs pleading standard is met, the Circuit said, courts should examine all of the complaints allegations to decide whether collectively they establish an inference of scienter; the complaint would survive, the court stated, if a reasonable person could infer from the complaints allegations that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind. 
Held:To qualify as strong within the intendment of 21D(b)(2), an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonableit must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.  Pp.618.
(a)Setting a uniform pleading standard for 10(b) actions was among Congress objectives in enacting the PSLRA.  Designed to curb perceived abuses of the 10(b) private action, the PSLRA installed both substantive and procedural controls.  As relevant here, 21D(b) of the PSLRA impose[d] heightened pleading requirements in [10(b) and Rule 10b5] actions.  Dabit, 547 U. S., at 81.  In the instant case, the District Court and the Seventh Circuit agreed that the complaint sufficiently specified Notebaerts alleged misleading statements and the reasons why the statements were misleading.  But those courts disagreed on whether the Shareholders, as required by 21D(b)(2), state[d] with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that [Notebaert] acted with [scienter], 78u4(b)(2).  Congress did not shed much light on what facts would create a strong inference or how courts could determine the existence of the requisite inference.  With no clear guide from Congress other than its inten[tion] to strengthen existing pleading requirements, H.R. Conf. Rep., at 41, Courts of Appeals have diverged in construing the term strong inference.  Among the uncertainties, should courts consider competing inferences in determining whether an inference of scienter is strong?  This Courts task is to prescribe a workable construction of the strong inference standard, a reading geared to the PSLRAs twin goals: to curb frivolous, lawyer-driven litigation, while preserving investors ability to recover on meritorious claims.  Pp.610.


(b)The Court establishes the following prescriptions: First, faced with a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a 10(b) action, courts must, as with any motion to dismiss for failure to plead a claim on which relief can be granted, accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164.  Second, courts must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  The inquiry is whether all of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter, not whether any individual allegation, scrutinized in isolation, meets that standard.  Third, in determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter, the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.  The Seventh Circuit expressly declined to engage in such a comparative inquiry.  But in 21D(b)(2), Congress did not merely require plaintiffs to allege facts from which an inference of scienter rationally could be drawn.  Instead, Congress required plaintiffs to plead with particularity facts that give rise to a strongi.e., a powerful or cogentinference.  To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts giving rise to the requisite strong inference, a court must consider plausible nonculpable explanations for the defendants conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.  The inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, but it must be more than merely reasonable or permissibleit must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations.  A complaint will survive only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any plausible opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.  Pp.1113.


(c)Tellabs contends that when competing inferences are considered, Notebaerts evident lack of pecuniary motive will be dispositive.  The Court agrees that motive can be a relevant consideration, and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference.  The absence of a motive allegation, however, is not fatal for allegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the complaints entirety.  Tellabs also maintains that several of the Shareholders allegations are too vague or ambiguous to contribute to a strong inference of scienter.  While omissions and ambiguities count against inferring scienter, the courts job is not to scrutinize each allegation in isolation but to access all the allegations holistically.  Pp.  1315.


(d)The Seventh Circuit was unduly concerned that a courts comparative assessment of plausible inferences would impinge upon the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.  Congress, as creator of federal statutory claims, has power to prescribe what must be pleaded to state the claim, just as it has power to determine what must be proved to prevail on the merits.  It is the federal lawmakers prerogative, therefore, to allow, disallow, or shape the contours ofincluding the pleading and proof requirements for10(b) private actions.  This Court has never questioned that authority in general, or suggested, in particular, that the Seventh Amendment inhibits Congress from establishing whatever pleading requirements it finds appropriate for federal statutory claims.  Provided that the Shareholders have satisfied the congressionally prescribe[d]  means of making an issue, Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Md. v. United States, 187 U. S. 315, 320, the case will fall within the jurys authority to assess the credibility of witnesses, resolve genuine issues of fact, and make the ultimate determination whether Notebaert and, by imputation, Tellabs acted with scienter.  Under this Courts construction of the strong inference standard, a plaintiff is not forced to plead more than she would be required to prove at trial.  A plaintiff alleging fraud under 10(b) must plead facts rendering an inference of scienter at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.  At trial, she must then prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence.  Pp.1517.


(e)Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to consider whether the Shareholders allegations warrant a strong inference that [Notebaert and Tellabs] acted with the required state of mind, 15 U. S.C. 78u4(b)(2), in light of the prescriptions announced today.  Thus, the case is remanded for a determination under this Courts construction of 21D(b)(2).  P.18.
437 F.3d 588, vacated and remanded.

06-5754|"RITA v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 065754.Argued February 20, 2007Decided June 21, 2007
Petitioner Rita sought a sentence lower than the recommended Federal Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months based on his physical condition, likely vulnerability in prison, and military experience.  The judge concluded that the appropriate sentence was 33 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range.  In affirming, the Fourth Circuit observed that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. 
Held:  
1.A court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence within the Guidelines.  Pp.716.


(a)Such a presumption is not binding.  It does not reflect strong judicial deference of the kind that leads appeals court to grant greater factfinding leeway to an expert agency than to a district judge.  It reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task that Congress set for the Sentencing Commission and how the Commission carries out that task.  In 18 U. S.C. 3553(a), Congress instructed the sentencing judge to consider (1) offense and offender characteristics; (2) the need for a sentence to reflect the basic aims of sentencing, (3) the sentences legally available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines; (5) Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted disparities; and (7) the need for restitution.  Statutes then tell the Commission to write Guidelines that will carry out the same basic 3553(a) objectives.  The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sentencing Commission examined tens of thousands of sentences and had the help of the law enforcement community over a long period in an effort to fulfill this statutory mandate.  They also reflect the fact that judges (and others) can differ as to how best to reconcile the disparate ends of punishment.  The resulting Guidelines seek to embody the 3553(a) considerations, both in principle and in practice, and it is fair to assume that they, insofar as practicable, reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve 3553(a)s objectives.  An individual sentence reflects the sentencing judges determination that the Commissions application of 3553(a) is appropriate in the mine run of cases, that the individual case does not differ significantly, and consequently that a Guidelines sentence reflects a proper application of 3553(a) in the case at hand.  The reasonableness presumption simply recognizes these real-world circumstances.  It applies only on appellate review.  The sentencing court does not enjoy the presumptions benefit when determining the merits of the arguments by prosecution or defense that a Guidelines sentence should not apply.  Pp.712.


(b)Even if the presumption increases the likelihood that the judge, not the jury, will find sentencing facts, it does not violate the Sixth Amendment.  This Courts Sixth Amendment cases do not forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and increase the sentence accordingly to take account of the Sentencing Commissions factual findings or recommended sentences.  The relevant Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a law forbids a judge to increase a sentence unless the judge finds facts that the jury did not find.  A nonbinding appellate reasonableness presumption for Guidelines sentences does not require the sentencing judge to impose a Guidelines sentence.  Still less does it forbid the judge to impose a sentence higher than the Guidelines provide for the jury-determined facts standing alone.  In addition, any general conflict between 3353(a) and the Guidelines for appellate review purposes is alleviated where judge and Commission both determine that the Guidelines sentence is appropriate in the case at hand, for that sentence likely reflects 3353(a)s factors.  Pp.1216.


2.The District Court properly analyzed the relevant sentencing factors, and given the record, its ultimate sentence was reasonable.  Section 3353(c) calls for the judge to state his reasons, but does not insist on a full opinion in every case.  The appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances.  The law leaves much, in this respect, to the judges own professional judgment.  In the present context, the sentencing judge should articulate enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.  He may say less when his decision rests upon the Commissions own reasoning that the Guidelines sentence is proper in the typical case, and the judge has found that the case before him is typical.  But where a party presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.  Here, the sentencing judges statement of reasons was brief but legally sufficient.  The record makes clear that the judge listened to each of Ritas arguments for a downward departure and considered the supporting evidence before finding those circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range.  Where, as here, the matter is conceptually simple and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, the law does not require a judge to write more extensively.  Pp.1620.


3.The Fourth Circuit, after applying the presumption, was legally correct in holding that Ritas sentence was not unreasonable.  Like the District Court and the Fourth Circuit, this Court  simply cannot say that Ritas special circumstanceshis health, fear of retaliation, and military recordare special enough, in light of 3553(a), to require a sentence lower than the one the Guidelines provide.  Ritas argument that the Guidelines sentence is not reasonable under 3553(a) because it expressly declines to consider various personal characteristics, such as his physical condition, employment record, and military service, was not raised below and will not be considered here.  Pp.2021.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 051157.Argued March 27, 2007Decided June 18, 2007
Respondent investors filed suit, alleging that petitioner investment banks, acting as underwriters, violated antitrust laws when they formed syndicates to help execute initial public offerings (IPOs) for several hundred technology-related companies.  Respondents claim that the underwriters unlawfully agreed that they would not sell newly issued securities to a buyer unless the buyer committed (1) to buy additional shares of that security later at escalating prices (known as laddering), (2) to pay unusually high commissions on subsequent security purchases from the underwriters, or (3) to purchase from the underwriters other less desirable securities (known as tying).  The underwriters moved to dismiss, claiming that federal securities law impliedly precludes application of antitrust laws to the conduct in question.  The District Court dismissed the complaints, but the Second Circuit reversed.  
Held:The securities law implicitly precludes the application of the antitrust laws to the conduct alleged in this case.  Pp.420.
(a)Where regulatory statutes are silent in respect to antitrust, courts must determine whether, and in what respects, they implicitly preclude the antitrust laws application.  Taken together, Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341; Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659; and United States v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 422 U. S. 694 (NASD) make clear that a court deciding this preclusion issue is deciding whether, given context and likely consequences, there is a clear repugnancy between the securities law and the antitrust complaint, i.e., whether the two are clearly incompatible.  Moreover, Gordon and NASD, in finding sufficient incompatibility to warrant an implication of preclusion, treated as critical: (1) the existence of regulatory authority under the securities law to supervise the activities in question; (2) evidence that the responsible regulatory entities exercise that authority; and (3) a resulting risk that the securities and antitrust laws, if both applicable, would produce conflicting guidance, requirements, duties, privileges, or standards of conduct.  In addition, (4) in Gordon and NASD the possible conflict affected practices that lie squarely within an area of financial market activity that securities law seeks to regulate.  Pp.410.


(b)Several considerationsthe underwriters efforts jointly to promote and sell newly issued securities is central to the proper functioning of well-regulated capital markets; the law grants the SEC authority to supervise such activities; and the SEC has continuously exercised its legal authority to regulate this type of conductshow that the first, second, and fourth conditions are satisfied in this case.  This leaves the third condition: whether there is a conflict rising to the level of incompatibility.  Pp.1012.


(c)The complaints here can be read as attacking the manner in which the underwriters jointly seek to collect excessive commissions through the practices of laddering, tying, and collecting excessive commissions, which according to respondents the SEC itself has already disapproved and, in all likelihood, will not approve in the foreseeable future.  Nonetheless, certain considerations, taken together, lead to the conclusion that securities law and antitrust law are clearly incompatible in this context.  Pp.1219.


(1)First, to permit antitrust actions such as this threatens serious securities-related harm.  For one thing, a fine, complex, detailed line separates activity that the SEC permits or encourages from activity that it forbids.  And the SEC has the expertise to distinguish what is forbidden from what is allowed.  For another thing, reasonable but contradictory inferences may be drawn from overlapping evidence that shows both unlawful antitrust activity and lawful securities marketing activity.  Further, there is a serious risk that antitrust courts, with different nonexpert judges and different nonexpert juries, will produce inconsistent results.  Together these factors mean there is no practical way to confine antitrust suits so that they challenge only the kind of activity the investors seek to target, which is presently unlawful and will likely remain unlawful under the securities law.  Rather, these considerations suggest that antitrust courts are likely to make unusually serious mistakes in this respect.  And that threat means that underwriters must act to avoid not simply conduct that the securities law forbids, but also joint conduct that the securities law permits or encourages.  Thus, allowing an antitrust lawsuit would threaten serious harm to the efficient functioning of the securities market.  Pp.1417.


(2)Second, any enforcement-related need for an antitrust lawsuit is unusually small.  For one thing, the SEC actively enforces the rules and regulations that forbid the conduct in question.  For another, investors harmed by underwriters unlawful practices may sue and obtain damages under the securities law.  Finally, the fact that the SEC is itself required to take account of competitive considerations when it creates securities-related policy and embodies it in rules and regulations makes it somewhat less necessary to rely on antitrust actions to address anticompetitive behavior.   Pp. 1718.


(3)In sum, an antitrust action in this context is accompanied by a substantial risk of injury to the securities markets and by a diminished need for antitrust enforcement to address anticompetitive conduct.  Together these considerations indicate a serious conflict between application of the antitrust laws and proper enforcement of the securities law.  The Solicitor Generals proposal to avoid this conflict does not convincingly address these concerns.  Pp.1819.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 0585.Argued April 16, 2007Decided June 18, 2007
Plaintiffs-respondents filed state-court suits alleging that various companies in Californias energy market had conspired to fix prices in violation of state law.  Some of the defendants filed cross-claims seeking indemnity from, inter alios, two United States Government agencies (BPA and WAPA); a Canadian corporation (BC Hydro) wholly owned by British Columbia and thus a foreign state under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA); and petitioner Powerex, a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Hydro.  The cross-defendants removed the entire case to federal court, with BC Hydro and petitioner relying on the FSIA.  Plaintiffs-respondents moved to remand, arguing that petitioner was not a foreign state and that the cross-claims against BPA, WAPA, and BC Hydro were barred by sovereign immunity.  The District Court agreed and remanded.  As relevant here, petitioner appealed, arguing that it was a foreign sovereign under the FSIA, but plaintiffs-respondents rejoined that the appeal was jurisdictionally barred by 28 U. S.C. 1447(d), which provides that [a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.  The Ninth Circuit held that 1447(d) did not preclude it from reviewing substantive issues of law that preceded the remand order, but affirmed the holding as to petitioners foreign-state status.
Held:Section 1447(d) bars appellate consideration of petitioners claim that it is a foreign state for FSIA purposes.  Pp.314.
(a)Appellate courts authority to review district-court orders remanding removed cases to state court is substantially limited by statute.  Section 1447(d) is read in pari materia with 1447(c), so that only remands based on the grounds specified in the latter are shielded by the review bar mandated by the former.  Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, 345346.  For purposes of this case, it is assumed that the grounds specified in 1447(c) are lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and defects in removal procedure.  Cf. Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 711712.  Given the proceedings below, review of the remand order is barred only if it was based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Pp.35.


(b)Nothing in 1447(c)s text supports the claim that a case cannot be remanded for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction within the meaning of that provision if the case was properly removed in the first instance.  Indeed, statutory history conclusively refutes the argument that 1447(c) is implicitly limited in such a manner.  When a district court remands a properly removed case because it nonetheless lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the remand is covered by 1447(c) and shielded from review by 1447(d).  Pp.57.


(c)The District Court relied upon a ground that is colorably characterized as subject-matter jurisdiction and so 1447(d) bars appellate review.  As an initial matter, it is clear from the record that the court was purporting to remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Even assuming that 1447(d) permits appellate courts to look behind a district courts characterization of the basis for the remand, such review is hereby limited to ascertaining whether the characterization was colorable.  In this case, the only plausible explanation of the District Courts remand was that it believed that it lacked the power to adjudicate the claims against petitioner once it had determined that petitioner was not a foreign state and that the other cross-defendants had sovereign immunity.  It is unnecessary to determine whether that belief was correct; it was at least debatable.  Petitioner contends instead that the District Court was actually remanding based on Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U. S. 343, 357, which authorizes remand when a district court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.  This is implausible.  The District Court never mentioned the possibility of supplemental jurisdiction, and petitioner does not appear to have argued that the claims against it could be retained based on supplemental jurisdiction.  Pp.710.


(d)The Ninth Circuit held that 1447(d) does not preclude reviewing a district courts substantive determinations that precede a remand order, a holding that appears to be premised on Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U. S. 140.  Waco, however, does not permit an appeal when, as here, there is no order separate from the unreviewable remand order.  Pp.1011.


(e)Petitioners contention that Congress did not intend 1447(d) to govern suits removed under the FSIA is flatly refuted by this Courts longstanding precedent that [a]bsent a clear statutory command to the contrary, [the Court] assume[s] that Congress is aware of the universality of th[e] practice of denying appellate review of remand orders when Congress creates a new ground for removal.  Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U. S. 124, 128.  Pp.1213.

When a district court remands a properly removed case because it nonetheless lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the remand is covered by 1447(c) and shielded from review by 1447(d).  Pp.57.


(c)The District Court relied upon a ground that is colorably characterized as subject-matter jurisdiction and so 1447(d) bars appellate review.  As an initial matter, it is clear from the record that the court was purporting to remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Even assuming that 1447(d) permits appellate courts to look behind a district courts characterization of the basis for the remand, such review is hereby limited to ascertaining whether the characterization was colorable.  In this case, the only plausible explanation of the District Courts remand was that it believed that it lacked the power to adjudicate the claims against petitioner once it had determined that petitioner was not a foreign state and that the other cross-defendants had sovereign immunity.  It is unnecessary to determine whether that belief was correct; it was at least debatable.  Petitioner contends instead that the District Court was actually remanding based on Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U. S. 343, 357, which authorizes remand when a district court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.  This is implausible.  The District Court never mentioned the possibility of supplemental jurisdiction, and petitioner does not appear to have argued that the claims against it could be retained based on supplemental jurisdiction.  Pp.710.


(d)The Ninth Circuit held that 1447(d) does not preclude reviewing a district courts substantive determinations that precede a remand order, a holding that appears to be premised on Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U. S. 140.  Waco, however, does not permit an appeal when, as here, there is no order separate from the unreviewable remand order.  Pp.1011.


(e)Petitioners contention that Congress did not intend 1447(d) to govern suits removed under the FSIA is flatly refuted by this Courts longstanding precedent that [a]bsent a clear statutory command to the contrary, [the Court] assume[s] that Congress is aware of the universality of th[e] practice of denying appellate review of remand orders when Congress creates a new ground for removal.  Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U. S. 124, 128.  Pp.1213.

06-8120|"BRENDLIN v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california
No. 068120.Argued April 23, 2007Decided June 18, 2007
After officers stopped a car to check its registration without reason to believe it was being operated unlawfully, one of them recognized petitioner Brendlin, a passenger in the car.  Upon verifying that Brendlin was a parole violator, the officers formally arrested him and searched him, the driver, and the car, finding, among other things, methamphetamine paraphernalia.  Charged with possession and manufacture of that substance, Brendlin moved to suppress the evidence obtained in searching his person and the car, arguing that the officers lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to make the traffic stop, which was an unconstitutional seizure of his person.  The trial court denied the motion, but the California Court of Appeal reversed, holding that Brendlin was seized by the traffic stop, which was unlawful.  Reversing, the State Supreme Court held that suppression was unwarranted because a passenger is not seized as a constitutional matter absent additional circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable person that he was the subject of the officers investigation or show of authority.
Held:When police make a traffic stop, a passenger in the car, like the driver, is seized for Fourth Amendment purposes and so may challenge the stops constitutionality.  Pp.413.
(a)A person is seized and thus entitled to challenge the governments action when officers, by physical force or a show of authority, terminate or restrain the persons freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.  Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 434; Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 597.  There is no seizure without that persons actual submission.  See, e.g., California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 626, n. 2.  When police actions do not show an unambiguous intent to restrain or when an individuals submission takes the form of passive acquiescence, the test for telling when a seizure occurs is whether, in light of all the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave.  E.g., United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 554 (principal opinion).  But when a person has no desire to leave for reasons unrelated to the police presence, the coercive effect of the encounter can be measured better by asking whether a reasonable person would feel free to decline the officers requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.  Bostick, supra, at 435436.  Pp.46. 


(b)Brendlin was seized because no reasonable person in his position when the car was stopped would have believed himself free to terminate the encounter between the police and himself.  Bostick, supra, at 436.  Any reasonable passenger would have understood the officers to be exercising control to the point that no one in the car was free to depart without police permission.  A traffic stop necessarily curtails a passengers travel just as much as it halts the driver, diverting both from the stream of traffic to the side of the road, and the police activity that normally amounts to intrusion on privacy and personal security does not normally (and did not here) distinguish between passenger and driver.  United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 554.  An officer who orders a particular car to pull over acts with an implicit claim of right based on fault of some sort, and a sensible person would not expect the officer to allow people to come and go freely from the physical focal point of an investigation into faulty behavior or wrongdoing.  If the likely wrongdoing is not the driving, the passenger will reasonably feel subject to suspicion owing to close association; but even when the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be subject to some scrutiny, and his attempt to leave would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.  It is also reasonable for passengers to expect that an officer at the scene of a crime, arrest, or investigation will not let people move around in ways that could jeopardize his safety.  See, e.g., Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 414415.  The Courts conclusion comports with the views of all nine Federal Courts of Appeals, and nearly every state court, to have ruled on the question.  Pp.69. 


(c)The State Supreme Courts contrary conclusion reflects three premises with which this Court respectfully disagrees.  First, the view that the police only intended to investigate the cars driver and did not direct a show of authority toward Brendlin impermissibly shifts the issue from the intent of the police as objectively manifested to the motive of the police for taking the intentional action to stop the car.  Applying the objective Mendenhall test resolves any ambiguity by showing that a reasonable passenger would understand that he was subject to the police display of authority.  Second, the state courts assumption that Brendlin, as the passenger, had no ability to submit to the police show of authority because only the driver was in control of the moving car is unavailing.  Brendlin had no effective way to signal submission while the car was moving, but once it came to a stop he could, and apparently did, submit by staying inside.  Third, there is no basis for the state courts fear that adopting the rule this Court applies would encompass even those motorists whose movement has been impeded due to the traffic stop of another car.  An occupant of a car who knows he is stuck in traffic because another car has been pulled over by police would not perceive the show of authority as directed at him or his car.  Pp.913.


(d)The state courts are left to consider in the first instance whether suppression turns on any other issue.  P.13.
38 Cal. 4th 1107, 136 P.3d 845, vacated and remanded.

05-1589|"DAVENPORT etal. v. WASHINGTON EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
certiorari to the surpeme court of washington
No. 051589.Argued January 10, 2007Decided June 14, 2007
The National Labor Relations Act permits States to regulate their labor relationships with public employees.  Many States authorize public-sector unions to negotiate agency-shop agreements that entitle a union to levy fees on employees who are not union members but whom the union represents in collective bargaining.  However, the First Amendment prohibits public-sector unions from using objecting nonmembers fees for ideological purposes not germane to the unions collective-bargaining duties, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 235236, and such unions must therefore observe various procedural requirements to ensure that an objecting nonmember can keep his fees from being used for such purposes, Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 304310.  Washington State allows public-sector unions to charge nonmembers an agency fee equivalent to membership dues and to have the employer collect that fee through payroll deductions.  An initiative approved by state voters (hereinafter 760) requires a union to obtain the nonmembers affirmative authorization before using their fees for election-related purposes.  Respondent, a public-sector union, sent a Hudson packet to all nonmembers twice a year detailing their right to object to the use of fees for nonchargeable expenditures; respondent held any disputed fees in escrow until the Hudson process was complete.  In separate lawsuits, petitioners alleged that respondent had failed to obtain the affirmative authorization required by 760 before spending nonmembers agency fees for electoral purposes.  In No. 051657, the trial court found a 760 violation and awarded the State monetary and injunctive relief.  In No. 051589, another judge held that 760 provided a private right of action, certified a class of nonmembers, and stayed the proceedings pending interlocutory appeal.  The State Supreme Court held that although a nonmembers failure to object after receiving the Hudson packet did not satisfy 760s affirmative-authorization requirement, that requirement violated the First Amendment.
Held:It does not violate the First Amendment for a State to require its public-sector unions to receive affirmative authorization from a nonmember before spending that nonmembers agency fees for election-related purposes.  Pp.513.
(a)It is undeniably unusual for a government agency to give a private entity the power to tax government employees.  The notion that 760s modest limitation upon that extraordinary benefit violates the First Amendment is counterintuitive, because it is undisputed that Washington could have restricted public-sector agency fees to the portion of union dues devoted to collective bargaining, or even eliminated them entirely.  Washingtons far less restrictive limitation on respondents authorization to exact money from government employees is of no greater constitutional concern.  P. 5.


(b)The State Supreme Court extended this Courts agency-fee cases well beyond their proper ambit in concluding that those cases, having balanced the constitutional rights of unions and nonmembers, required a nonmember to shoulder the burden of objecting before a union can be barred from spending his fees for purposes impermissible under Abood.  The agency-fee cases did not balance constitutional rights in such a manner because unions have no constitutional entitlement to nonmember-employees fees.  The Court has never suggested that the First Amendment is implicated whenever governments limit a unions entitlement to agency fees above and beyond what Abood and Hudson require.  The constitutional floor for unions collection and spending of agency fees is not also a constitutional ceiling for state-imposed restrictions.  Hudsons admonition that dissent is not to be presumed, 475 U. S., at 306, n.16, means only that it would be improper for a court to enjoin the expenditures of all nonmembers agency fees when a narrower remedy could satisfy statutory or constitutional limitations.  Pp.57.


(c)Contrary to respondents argument, 760 is not unconstitutional under this Courts campaign-finance cases.  For First Amendment purposes, it is immaterial that 760 restricts a unions use of funds only after they are within the unions possession.  The fees are in the unions possession only because Washington and its union-contracting government agencies have compelled their employees to pay those fees.  The campaign-finance cases deal instead with governmental restrictions on how a regulated entity may spend money that has come into its possession without such coercion.  Pp.78.


(d) While content-based speech regulations are presumptively invalid, see, e.g., R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382, strict scrutiny is unwarranted when the risk that the government may drive ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace is attenuated, such as when the government acts in a capacity other than as regulator.  Thus, the government can make content-based distinctions when subsidizing speech, see, e.g., Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 548550, and can exclude speakers based on reasonable, viewpoint-neutral subject-matter grounds when permitting speech on government property that is a nonpublic forum, see, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 799800, 806.  The principle underlying those cases is applicable here.  Washington voters did not impermissibly distort the marketplace of ideas when they placed a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral limitation on the States authorization.  They were seeking to protect the integrity of the election process, and their restriction was thus limited to the state-created harm that they sought to remedy.  The First Amendment did not compel them to limit public-sector unions extraordinary entitlement to nonmembers agency fees more broadly than necessary to vindicate that concern.  Pp.811.


(e) Section 760 is constitutional as applied to public-sector unions.  There is no need in these cases to consider its application to private-sector unions.  Pp.1113.

06-134|"PERMANENT MISSION OF INDIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS etal. v. CITY OF NEW YORK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 06134.Argued April 24, 2007Decided June 14, 2007
Under New York law, real property owned by a foreign government is exempt from taxation when used exclusively for diplomatic offices or quarters for ambassadors or ministers plenipotentiary to the United Nations.  For years, respondent (City) has levied property taxes against petitioner foreign governments for that portion of their diplomatic office buildings used to house lower level employees and their families.  Petitioners have refused to pay the taxes.  By operation of state law, the unpaid taxes converted into tax liens held by the City against the properties.  The City filed a state-court suit seeking declaratory judgments to establish the liens validity, but petitioners removed the cases to federal court, where they argued that they were immune under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court, Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 439.  The District Court disagreed, relying on an FSIA exception withdrawing a foreign states immunity from jurisdiction where rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.  28 U. S.C. 1605(a)(4).  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the immovable property exception applied, and thus the District Court had jurisdiction over the Citys suits.
Held:The FSIA does not immunize a foreign government from a lawsuit to declare the validity of tax liens on property held by the sovereign for the purpose of housing its employees.  Pp.38.
(a)Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presumptively immune from suit unless a specific exception applies.  In determining the immovable property exceptions scope, the Court begins, as always, with the statutes text.  Contrary to petitioners position, 1605(a)(4) does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is title, ownership, or possession, or specifically exclude cases in which a liens validity is at issue.  Rather, it focuses more broadly on rights in property.  At the time of the FSIAs adoption, lien was defined as a charge or security or incumbrance upon property, Blacks Law Dictionary 1072, and incumbrance was defined as [a]ny right to, or interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value, id., at 908.  New York law defines tax lien in accordance with these general definitions.  A liens practical effects bear out the definitions of liens as interests in property.  Because a lien on real property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent purchasers, a tax lien inhibits a quintessential property ownership rightthe right to convey.  It is thus plain that a suit to establish a tax liens validity implicates rights in immovable property.  Pp.35.


(b)This Courts reading is supported by two of the FSIAs related purposes.  First, Congress intended the FSIA to adopt the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, which recognizes immunity with regard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) of a state, but not  private acts (jure gestionis).  Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 711.  Property ownership is not an inherently sovereign function.  The FSIA was also meant to codify the real property exception recognized by international practice at the time of its enactment.  That practice supports the Citys view that petitioners are not immune, as does the contemporaneous restatement of foreign relations law.  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, on which both parties rely, does not unambiguously support either party, and, in any event, does nothing to deter this Court from its interpretation.  Pp. 58.
446 F.3d 365, affirmed and remanded.

The City filed a state-court suit seeking declaratory judgments to establish the liens validity, but petitioners removed the cases to federal court, where they argued that they were immune under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), which is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court, Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 439.  The District Court disagreed, relying on an FSIA exception withdrawing a foreign states immunity from jurisdiction where rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.  28 U. S.C. 1605(a)(4).  The Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the immovable property exception applied, and thus the District Court had jurisdiction over the Citys suits.
Held:The FSIA does not immunize a foreign government from a lawsuit to declare the validity of tax liens on property held by the sovereign for the purpose of housing its employees.  Pp.38.
(a)Under the FSIA, a foreign state is presumptively immune from suit unless a specific exception applies.  In determining the immovable property exceptions scope, the Court begins, as always, with the statutes text.  Contrary to petitioners position, 1605(a)(4) does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is title, ownership, or possession, or specifically exclude cases in which a liens validity is at issue.  Rather, it focuses more broadly on rights in property.  At the time of the FSIAs adoption, lien was defined as a charge or security or incumbrance upon property, Blacks Law Dictionary 1072, and incumbrance was defined as [a]ny right to, or interest in, land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value, id., at 908.  New York law defines tax lien in accordance with these general definitions.  A liens practical effects bear out the definitions of liens as interests in property.  Because a lien on real property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent purchasers, a tax lien inhibits a quintessential property ownership rightthe right to convey.  It is thus plain that a suit to establish a tax liens validity implicates rights in immovable property.  Pp.35.


(b)This Courts reading is supported by two of the FSIAs related purposes.  First, Congress intended the FSIA to adopt the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, which recognizes immunity with regard to sovereign or public acts (jure imperii) of a state, but not  private acts (jure gestionis).  Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 711.  Property ownership is not an inherently sovereign function.  The FSIA was also meant to codify the real property exception recognized by international practice at the time of its enactment.  That practice supports the Citys view that petitioners are not immune, as does the contemporaneous restatement of foreign relations law.  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, on which both parties rely, does not unambiguously support either party, and, in any event, does nothing to deter this Court from its interpretation.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 065306.Argued March 26, 2007Decided June 14, 2007
Having failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the Federal District Courts denial of habeas relief, petitioner Bowles moved to reopen the filing period pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), which allows a district court to grant a 14-day extension under certain conditions, see 28 U. S.C. 2107(c).  The District Court granted Bowles motion but inexplicably gave him 17 days to file his notice of appeal.  He filed within the 17 days allowed by the District Court, but after the 14-day period allowed by Rule 4(a)(6) and 2107(c).  The Sixth Circuit held that the notice was untimely and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the case under this Courts precedent. 
Held:Bowles untimely notice of appealthough filed in reliance upon the District Courts orderdeprived the Sixth Circuit of jurisdiction.  Pp. 210.
(a)The taking of an appeal in a civil case within the time prescribed by statute is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (per curiam).  There is a significant distinction between time limitations set forth in a statute such as 2107, which limit a courts jurisdiction, see, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 453, and those based on court rules, which do not, see, e.g., id., at 454.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 505, and Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 314, distinguished.  Because Congress decides, within constitutional bounds, whether federal courts can hear cases at all, it can also determine when, and under what conditions, federal courts can hear them.  See United States v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 113.  And when an appeal has not been prosecuted in the manner directed, within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  Id., at 113.  The resolution of this case follows naturally from this reasoning.  Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in 2107(c), Bowles failure to file in accordance with the statute deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.  And because Bowles error is one of jurisdictional magnitude, he cannot rely on forfeiture or waiver to excuse his lack of compliance.  Pp. 48.


(b)Bowles reliance on the unique circumstances doctrine, rooted in Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U. S. 215 (per curiam) and applied in Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384 (per curiam), is rejected.  Because this Court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements, use of the doctrine is illegitimate.  Harris Truck Lines and Thompson are overruled to the extent they purport to authorize an exception to a jurisdictional rule.  Pp. 89.

05-1284|"WATSON etal. v. PHILIP MORRIS COS., INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 051284.Argued April 25, 2007Decided June 11, 2007
Petitioners filed a state-court suit claiming that respondents (Philip Morris) violated Arkansas unfair business practice laws by advertising certain cigarette brands as light when, in fact, Philip Morris had manipulated testing results to register lower levels of tar and nicotine in the advertised cigarettes than would be delivered to consumers.  Philip Morris removed the case to Federal District Court under the federal officer removal statute, which permits removal of an action against any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, 28 U. S.C. 1442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The federal court upheld the removal, ruling that the complaint attacked Philip Morris use of the Governments method of testing cigarettes and thus that petitioners had sued Philip Morris for acting under the Federal Trade Commission.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing the FTCs detailed supervision of the cigarette testing process and likening the case to others in which lower courts permitted removal by heavily supervised Government contractors.  
Held:The fact that a federal agency directs, supervises, and monitors a companys activities in considerable detail does not bring that company within 1442(a)(1)s scope and thereby permit removal.  Pp. 314.
(a)Section 1442(a)(1)s words acting under are broad, and the statute must be liberally construed.  Colorado v. Symes, 286 U. S. 510, 517.  But broad language is not limitless.  And a liberal construction nonetheless can find limits in a texts language, context, history, and purposes.  The statutes history and this Courts cases demonstrate that its basic purpose is to protect the Federal Government from the interference with its operations that would ensue were a State able, for example, to arres[t] and bring to trial in a State cour[t] for an alleged offense against the law of the State, officers and agents of the Government acting  within the scope of their authority.  Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, 406 (internal quotation marks omitted).  State-court proceedings may reflect local prejudice against unpopular federal laws or officials, e.g., Maryland v. Soper, 270 U. S. 9, 32, and States hostile to the Government may impede enforcement of federal law, see, e.g., Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U. S. 257, 263, or deprive federal officials of a federal forum in which to assert federal immunity defenses, see, e.g., Willingham, supra, at 407.  The removal statute applies to private persons who lawfully assist a federal officer in the performance of his official duty, Davis v. South Carolina, 107 U. S. 597, 600, but only if the private parties were authorized to act with or for [federal officers or agents] in affirmatively executing duties under  federal law, City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U. S. 808, 824.  Pp. 37. 


(b)The relevant relationship here is that of a private person acting under a federal officer or agency.  1442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  In this context, under must refer to what the dictionaries describe as a relationship involving acting in a certain capacity, considered in relation to one holding a superior position or office, and typically includes subjection, guidance, or control.  Precedent and statutory purpose also make clear that the private persons acting under must involve an effort to assist, or to help carry out, the federal superiors duties or tasks.  See, e.g., Davis v. South Carolina, supra, at 600.  Such aid does not include simply complying with the law.  When a company complies with a regulatory order, it does not ordinarily create a significant risk of state-court prejudice.  Cf. Soper, supra, at 32.  A state-court suit brought against such a company is not likely to disable federal officials from taking necessary action designed to enforce federal law, cf. Tennessee v. Davis, supra, at 262263, nor to deny a federal forum to an individual entitled to assert a federal immunity claim, see, e.g., Willingham, supra, at 407.  Thus, a private firms compliance (or noncompliance) with federal laws, rules, and regulations does not by itself fall within the scope of the statutory phrase acting  under a federal official, even if the regulation is highly detailed and even if the private firms activities are highly supervised and monitored.  A contrary determination would expand the statutes scope considerably, potentially bringing within it state-court actions filed against private firms in many highly regulated industries.  Nothing in the statutes language, history, or purpose indicates a congressional intent to do so.  Pp. 79. 


(c)Philip Morris two arguments to the contrary are rejected.  First, it contends that if close supervision is sufficient to turn a Gov-
ernment contractor into a private firm acting under a Government agency or officer, as lower courts have held, it is sufficient to transform a company subjected to intense regulation.  The answer to this argument is that the assistance that private contractors provide federal officers goes beyond simple compliance with the law and helps the officers fulfill other basic governmental tasks.  Second, Philip Morris argues that it is acting under FTC officers when it conducts cigarette testing because, after initially testing cigarettes for tar and nicotine, the FTC delegated authority for that task to the tobacco industry in 1987 and has thereafter extensively supervised and closely monitored testing.  This argument contains a fatal flaw of omission.  Although it uses the word delegation, there is no evidence of any delegation of legal authority from the FTC to the tobacco industry to undertake testing on the Government agencys behalf, or evidence of any contract, payment, employer/employee relationship, or principal/agent arrangement.  The existence of detailed FTC rules indicates regulation, not delegation.  The usual regulator/regulated relationship cannot be construed as bringing Philip Morris within the statutes terms.  Pp. 914. 
420 F.3d 852, reversed and remanded.

UNION etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 051448.Argued April 24, 2007Decided June 11, 2007
Respondent PACE International Union represented employees covered by single-employer defined-benefit pension plans sponsored and administered by Crown, which had filed for bankruptcy.  Crown rejected the unions proposal to terminate the plans by merging them with the unions own multiemployer plan, opting instead for a standard termination through the purchase of annuities, which would allow Crown to retain a $5 million reversion after satisfying its obligations to plan participants and beneficiaries.  The union and respondent plan participants (hereinafter, collectively, PACE) filed an adversary action in the Bankruptcy Court, alleging that Crowns directors had breached their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S.C. 1001 et seq., by neglecting to give diligent consideration to PACEs merger proposal.  The court ruled for PACE, and petitioner bankruptcy trustee appealed to the District Court, which affirmed in relevant part, as did the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the decision to terminate a pension plan is a business decision not subject to ERISAs fiduciary obligations, but reasoned that the implementation of a termination decision is fiduciary in nature.  It then determined that merger was a permissible termination method and that Crown therefore had a fiduciary obligation to consider PACEs merger proposal seriously, which it had failed to do.  
Held:Crown did not breach its fiduciary obligations in failing to consider PACEs merger proposal because merger is not a permissible form of plan termination under ERISA.  Section 1341(b)(3)(A) provides: In  any final distribution of assets pursuant to  standard termination , the plan administrator shall  (i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or  (ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan.  The parties agree that clause (i) refers to the purchase of annuities, and that clause (ii) allows for lump-sum distributions.  These are by far the most common distribution methods.  To decide that merger is also a permissible method, the Court would have to disagree with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the entity administering the federal insurance program that protects plan benefits, which takes the position that 1341(b)(3)(A) does not permit merger as a method of termination because merger is an alternative to (rather than an example of) plan termination.  The Court has traditionally deferred to the PBGC when interpreting ERISA.  Here, the Court believes that the PBGCs policy is based upon a construction of the statute that is permissible, and indeed the more plausible.


  PACE argues that 1341(b)(3)(A)(ii)s residual provision referring to an asset distribution that otherwise fully provide[s] all benefit liabilities under the plan covers merger because annuities (covered by 1341(b)(3)(A)(i)) are an example of a permissible means of provid[ing] . . . benefit liabilities, and merger is the legal equivalent of annuitization.  Even assuming that PACE is right about the meaning of the word otherwise, the clarity necessary to disregard the PBGCs considered views is lacking for three reasons.  First, terminating a plan through purchase of annuities formally severs ERISAs applicability to plan assets and employer obligations, whereas merging the Crown plans into PACEs multiemployer plan would result in the former plans assets remaining within ERISAs purview, where they could be used to satisfy the benefit liabilities of the multiemployer plans other participants and beneficiaries.  Second, although ERISA expressly allows the employer to (under certain circumstances) recoup surplus funds in a standard termination, 1344(d)(1), (3), as Crown sought to do here, merger would preclude the receipt of such funds by reason of 1103(c), which prohibits employers from misappropriating plan assets for their own benefit.  Third, merger is nowhere mentioned in 1341, but is instead dealt with in an entirely different set of statutory sections setting forth entirely different rules and procedures, 1058, 1411, and 1412.  PACEs argument that the procedural differences could be reconciled by requiring a plan sponsor intending to use merger as a termination method to follow the rules for both merger and termination is condemned by the confusion it would engender and by the fact that it has no apparent basis in ERISA.  Even from a policy standpoint, the PBGCs construction of the statute is eminently reasonable because termination by merger could have detrimental consequences for the participants and beneficiaries of a single-employer plan, as well as for plan sponsors.

No. 065247.Argued March 20, 2007Decided June 11, 2007
The trial judge presiding over petitioners criminal trial excluded the testimony of defense-witness Pamela Maples.  After his conviction, petitioner argued on appeal, inter alia, that the exclusion of Maples testimony violated Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, which held that a combination of erroneous evidentiary rulings rose to the level of a due-process violation.  The California Court of Appeal did not explicitly address that argument in affirming, but stated, without specifying which harmless-error standard it was applying, that no possible prejudice could have resulted in light of the cumulative nature of Maples testimony.  The State Supreme Court denied discretionary review.  Petitioner then filed a federal habeas petition raising the due-process and other claims.  The Magistrate Judge found the state appellate courts failure to recognize Chambers error an unreasonable application of clearly established law as set forth by this Court, and disagreed with the finding of no possible prejudice, but concluded there was an insufficient showing that the improper exclusion of Maples testimony had a substantial and injurious effect on the jurys verdict under Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 631.  Agreeing, the District Court denied relief, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:In 28 U. S.C. 2254 proceedings, a federal court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under Brechts substantial and injurious effect standard, whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24.  Pp. 38.
(a) That Brecht applies in 2254 cases even if the state appellate court has not found, as did the state appellate court in Brecht, that the error was harmless under Chapman, is indicated by this Courts Brecht opinion, which did not turn on whether the state court itself conducted Chapman review, but instead cited concerns about finality, comity, and federalism as the primary reasons for adopting a less onerous standard on collateral review.  507 U. S., at 637.  Since each of these concerns applies with equal force whether or not the state court reaches the Chapman question, it would be illogical to make the standard of review turn upon that contingency.  Brecht, supra, at 636, distinguished.  Petitioner presents a false analogy in arguing that, if Brecht applies whether or not the state appellate court conducted Chapman review, then Brecht would apply even if a State eliminated appellate review altogether.  The Court also rejects petitioners contention that, even if Brecht adopted a categorical rule, post-Brecht developmentsthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), as interpreted in Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U. S. 12require a different review standard.  That result is not suggested by Esparza, which had no reason to decide the point, nor by AEDPA, which sets forth a precondition, not an entitlement, to the grant of habeas relief.  Pp. 37. 


(b)Petitioners argument that the judgment below must still be reversed because excluding Maples testimony substantially and injuriously affected the jurys verdict is rejected as not fairly encompassed by the question presented.  Pp.78.

06-562|"UNITED STATES v. ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 06562.Argued April 23, 2007Decided June 11, 2007
Sections 107(a) and 113(f) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 allow private parties to recover expenses associated with cleaning up contaminated sites.  Section 107(a) defines four categories of potentially responsible parties (PRPs) and makes them liable for, among other things, (A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan and (B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with [such] plan, 107(a)(4)(A)(B).  Originally, some courts interpreted 107(a)(4)(B) as providing a cause of action for a private party to recover voluntarily incurred response costs and to seek contribution after having been sued.  However, after the enactment of 113(f), which authorizes one PRP to sue another for contribution, many courts held it to be the exclusive remedy for PRPs.  In Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161, this Court held that a private party could seek contribution under 113(f) only after being sued under 106 or 107(a). 


After respondent Atlantic Research cleaned up a Government site it leased and contaminated while doing Government work, it sued the Government to recover some of its costs under, as relevant here, 107(a).  The District Court dismissed the case, but the Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that 113(f) does not provide the exclusive remedy for recovering cleanup costs and that 107(a)(4)(B) provided a cause of action to any person other than those permitted to sue under 107(a)(4)(A). 
Held:Because 107(a)(4)(B)s plain terms allow a PRP to recover costs from other PRPs, the statute provides Atlantic Research with a cause of action.  Pp.411.
(a)Applying the maxim that statutes must be read as a whole, King v. St. Vincents Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221, subparagraph (B)s language can be understood only with reference to subparagraph (A).  The provisions are adjacent and have similar structures, and the text denotes a relationship between them.  Subparagraph (B)s phrase other necessary costs refers to and differentiates the relevant costs from those listed in subparagraph (A).  Thus, it is natural to read the phrase any other person by referring to the immediately preceding subparagraph (A).  Accepting the Governments interpretationthat any other person refers only to a person not identified as a PRP in 107(a)(1)(4)would destroy the symmetry of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and render subparagraph (B) internally confusing.  Moreover, because the statute defines PRPs so broadly as to sweep in virtually all persons likely to incur cleanup costs, accepting that interpretation would reduce the number of potential plaintiffs to almost zero, rendering subparagraph (B) a dead letter.  Pp.47.


(b)Contrary to the Governments argument, this interpretation will not create friction between 107(a) and 113(f).  Their two clearly distinct remedies complement each other: 113(f)(1) authorizes a contribution action to PRPs with common liability stemming from an action instituted under 106 or 107(a), while 107(a) permits cost recovery (as distinct from contribution) by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs.  Thus, at least in the case of reimbursement, a PRP cannot choose 107(a)s longer statute of limitations for recovery actions over 113(f)s shorter one for contribution claims.  Similarly, a PRP could not avoid 113(f)s equitable distribution of reimbursement costs among PRPs by instead choosing to impose joint and several liability under 107(a).  That choice of remedies simply does not exist, and in any event, a defendant PRP in a 107(a) suit could blunt any such distribution by filing a 113(f) counterclaim.  Finally, permitting PRPs to seek recovery under 107(a) will not eviscerate 113(f)(2), which prohibits 113(f) contribution claims against [a] person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement .  Although that settlement bar does not by its terms protect against 107(a) cost-recovery liability, a district court applying traditional equity rules would undoubtedly consider any prior settlement in the liability calculus; the settlement bar continues to provide significant protection from contribution suits by PRPs that have inequitably reimbursed costs incurred by another party; and settlement carries the inherent benefit of finally resolving liability as to the United States or a State.  Pp.711.
459 F.3d 827, affirmed.

06-593|"LONG ISLAND CARE AT HOME, LTD., etal. v. COKE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 06593.Argued April 16, 2007Decided June 11, 2007
The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 exempted from the minimum wage and maximum hours rules of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) persons employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for individuals  unable to care for themselves.  29 U. S.C. 213(a)(15).  Under a Labor Department (DOL) regulation labeled an Interpretatio[n] (hereinafter third-party regulation), the exemption includes those companionship workers employed by an  agency other than the family or household using their services.  29 CFR 552.109(a).  However, DOLs General Regulations also define the statutory term domestic service employment as services of a household nature performed by an employee in or about a private home  of the person by whom he or she is employed.  552.3 (emphasis added).  Respondent, a companionship services provider to the elderly and infirm, sued petitioners, her former employer Long Island Care and its owner, seeking minimum and overtime wages they allegedly owed her.  The parties assume the FLSA requires the payments only if its companionship services exemption does not apply to workers paid by third-party agencies such as Long Island Care.  The District Court dismissed the suit, finding the third-party regulation valid and controlling.  The Second Circuit found the regulation unenforceable and set the judgment aside.  
Held:The third-party regulation is valid and binding.  Pp. 416.  
(a)An agencys power to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.  Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843.  When an agency fills such a gap reasonably, and in accordance with other applicable (e.g., procedural) requirements, that result is legally binding.  Id., at 843844.  On its face, the third-party regulation seems to fill a statutory gap.  Pp.45. 


(b)The regulation does not exceed DOLs delegated rulemaking authority.  The FLSA explicitly leaves gaps as to the scope and definition of its domestic service employment and companionship services terms, 29 U. S.C. 213(a)(15), and empowers the DOL to fill these gaps through regulations, 1974 Amendments, 29(b).  Whether to include workers paid by third parties is one of the details left to the DOL to work out.  Although the pre-1974 FLSA already covered some third-party-paid companionship workers, e.g., those employed by large private enterprises, it did not then cover others, e.g., those employed directly by the aged persons family or by many smaller private agencies.  Thus, whether, or how, the statutory definition should apply to such workers raises a set of complex questions, e.g., should the FLSA cover all of them, some of them, or none of them?  How should the need for a simple, uniform application of the exemption be weighed against the fact that some (but not all) of the workers were previously covered?  Given the DOLs expertise, satisfactory answers to the foregoing questions may well turn upon its thorough knowledge of the area and ability to consult at length with affected parties.  It is therefore reasonable to infer that Congress intended its broad grant of definitional authority to the DOL to include the authority to answer such questions.  Respondents reliance on the Social Security statute, whose text expressly answers a third party coverage question, and on conflicting statements in the 1974 Amendments legislative history, is unavailing.  Pp.58. 


(c)Although the literal language of the third-party regulation and the General Regulation, 552.3, conflicts as to whether third-party-paid workers are included within the statutory exemption, several reasons compel the Court to agree with the DOLs position, set forth in an Advisory Memorandum explaining (and defending) the third-party regulation, that that regulation governs here.  First, a decision that 552.3 controls would create serious problems as to the coverage of particular domestic service employees by the statutory exemption or by the FLSA as a whole.  Second, given that the third-party regulations sole purpose is to explain how the companionship services exemption applies to persons employed by third-party entities, whereas 552.3s primary purpose is to describe the kind of work that must be performed to qualify someone as a domestic service employee, the third-party regulation is the more specific with respect to the question at issue and therefore governs, see, e.g., Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 384385.  Third, that the DOL may have interpreted the two regulations differently at different times in their history is not a ground for disregarding the present interpretation, which the DOL reached after proposing a different interpretation through notice-and-comment rulemaking, making any unfair surprise unlikely, cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 212.  Fourth, while the Advisory Memorandum was issued only to DOL personnel and written in response to this litigation, this Court has accepted such an interpretation where, as here, an agencys course of action indicates that its interpretation of its own regulation reflects its considered views on the matter in question and there is no reason to suspect that its interpretation is merely a post hoc rationalization.  Pp.811. 


(d)Several factors compel the Court to reject respondents argument that the third-party regulation is an interpretation not meant to fill a statutory gap, but simply to describe the DOLs view of what the FLSA means, and thus is not entitled to Chevron deference, cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 232.  For one thing, the regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, affecting individual rights and obligations.  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 302.  When promulgating the regulation and when considering amending it, the DOL has always employed full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) need not be used when producing an interpretive rule, 5 U. S.C. 553(b)(A).  And for the past 30 years, according to the Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the DOL has treated the regulation as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority.  For another thing, the DOL may have placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B of Part 552, entitled Interpretations, rather than in Subpart A, General Regulations, because Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying Subpart As more general definitions.  Indeed, Subpart Bs other regulationsinvolving, e.g., employer credit[s] against minimum wages for provision of food, lodging, and drycleaningstrongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statutes language, are at issue.  Finally, the Court assumes Congress meant and expected courts to treat a regulation as within a delegation of gap-filling authority where, as here, the rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue and uses full notice-and-comment procedures, and the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority and is reasonable.  Mead, supra, at 229233.  Pp.1114. 


(e)The Court disagrees with respondents claim that the DOLs 1974 notice-and-comment proceedings were legally defective because the DOLs notice and explanation were inadequate.  Fair notice is the object of the APA requirement that a notice of proposed rulemaking contain either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved, 5 U. S.C. 553(b)(3).  The Circuits have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed.  Initially, the DOLs proposed regulation would have placed outside the 213(a)(15) exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by the large enterprise third-party employers covered before 1974.  Since that was simply a proposal, however, its presence meant that the DOL was considering the matter and might later choose to keep the proposal or to withdraw it.  The DOL finally withdrew it, resulting in a determination exempting all third-party-employed companionship workers from the FLSA, and that possibility was reasonably foreseeable.  There is also no significant legal problem with the DOLs explanation that its final interpretation is more consistent with FLSA language.  No one seems to have objected to this explanation at the time, and it still remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation.  Pp.1416. 
462 F.3d 48, reversed and remanded.
Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 232.  For one thing, the regulation directly governs the conduct of members of the public, affecting individual rights and obligations.  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 302.  When promulgating the regulation and when considering amending it, the DOL has always employed full public notice-and-comment procedures, which under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) need not be used when producing an interpretive rule, 5 U. S.C. 553(b)(A).  And for the past 30 years, according to the Advisory Memorandum (and not disputed by respondent), the DOL has treated the regulation as a legally binding exercise of its rulemaking authority.  For another thing, the DOL may have placed the third-party regulation in Subpart B of Part 552, entitled Interpretations, rather than in Subpart A, General Regulations, because Subpart B contains matters of detail, interpreting and applying Subpart As more general definitions.  Indeed, Subpart Bs other regulationsinvolving, e.g., employer credit[s] against minimum wages for provision of food, lodging, and drycleaningstrongly indicate that such details, not a direct interpretation of the statutes language, are at issue.  Finally, the Court assumes Congress meant and expected courts to treat a regulation as within a delegation of gap-filling authority where, as here, the rule sets forth important individual rights and duties, the agency focuses fully and directly upon the issue and uses full notice-and-comment procedures, and the resulting rule falls within the statutory grant of authority and is reasonable.  Mead, supra, at 229233.  Pp.1114. 


(e)The Court disagrees with respondents claim that the DOLs 1974 notice-and-comment proceedings were legally defective because the DOLs notice and explanation were inadequate.  Fair notice is the object of the APA requirement that a notice of proposed rulemaking contain either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved, 5 U. S.C. 553(b)(3).  The Circuits have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule must be a logical outgrowth of the rule proposed.  Initially, the DOLs proposed regulation would have placed outside the 213(a)(15) exemption (and hence left subject to FLSA wage and hour rules) individuals employed by the large enterprise third-party employers covered before 1974.  Since that was simply a proposal, however, its presence meant that the DOL was considering the matter and might later choose to keep the proposal or to withdraw it.  The DOL finally withdrew it, resulting in a determination exempting all third-party-employed companionship workers from the FLSA, and that possibility was reasonably foreseeable.  There is also no significant legal problem with the DOLs explanation that its final interpretation is more consistent with FLSA language.  No one seems to have objected to this explanation at the time, and it still remains a reasonable, albeit brief, explanation.  Pp.1416.

06-413|"UTTECHT, SUPERINTENDENT, WASHINGTON STATE PENITENTIARY v. BROWN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06413.Argued April 17, 2007Decided June 4, 2007
A Washington jury sentenced respondent Brown to death, and the state appellate courts affirmed.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court denied Browns habeas petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, and its progeny, the state trial court had violated Browns Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by excusing Jurors Z for cause on the ground that he could not be impartial in deciding whether to impose a death sentence.  
Held: 
1.Courts reviewing claims of error under Witherspoon and Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, especially federal habeas courts, owe deference to the trial court, which is in a superior position to determine a potential jurors demeanor and qualifications.  This Courts precedents establish at least four relevant principles.  First, a criminal defendant has the right to an impartial jury drawn from a venire that has not been tilted in favor of capital punishment by selective prosecutorial challenges for cause.  Witherspoon, supra, at 521.  Second, the State has a strong interest in having jurors who are able to apply capital punishment within the framework state law prescribes.  Witt, 469 U. S., at 416.  Third, to balance these interests, a juror who is substantially impaired in the ability to impose the death penalty under the state-law framework can be excused for cause, but if the juror is not so impaired, removal for cause is impermissible.  Id., at 424.  Fourth, in determining whether a potential jurors removal would vindicate the States interest without violating the defendants right, the trial court bases its judgment in part on the jurors demeanor, a judgment owed deference by reviewing courts.  Id., at 424434.  The trial court is in a superior position to assess demeanor, a factor critical in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential jurors.  Id., at 428.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996s requirements provide additional, and binding, directions to accord deference, creating an independent, high standard to be met before a federal court may issue a habeas writ to set aside state-court rulings.  By not according the required deference here, the Ninth Circuit failed to respect the limited role of federal habeas relief in this area.  Pp.27.


2.In applying the Witherspoon-Witt rule, it is instructive to consider the entire voir dire in Browns case and then turn to Juror Zs questioning.  Pp.712.


(a)Here, 11 days of voir dire were devoted to determining whether potential jurors were death qualified.  During that phase, 11 of the jurors the defense challenged for cause were excused.  The defense objected to 7 of the 12 jurors the State challenged for cause, and only 2 of those 7 were excused.  Before deciding a contested challenge, the court allowed each side to explain its position and recall a potential juror.  It also gave careful and measured explanations for its decisions.  Before individual oral examination, the court distributed a questionnaire asking jurors to explain their attitudes toward the death penalty and explained that Brown was only eligible for death or life in prison without possibility of release or parole.  It repeated the sentencing options before Juror Zs group was questioned.  Pp.710.


(b)The transcript reveals that, despite the preceding instructions and information, Juror Z had both serious misunderstandings about his responsibility as a juror and an attitude toward capital punishment that could have prevented him from returning a death sentence under the facts of this case.  He was told at least four times that Brown could not be released from prison and stated six times that he could follow the law.  But he also gave more equivocal statements that he would consider the death penalty only if there was no possibility that Brown would be released to reoffend.  When the State challenged Juror Z on the grounds that he was confused about the conditions under which death could be imposed and seemed to believe it only appropriate when there was a risk of release and recidivism, the defense volunteered that it had no objection.  Pp.1012.


3.The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that both the state trial courts excusal of Juror Z and the State Supreme Courts affirmance were contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  Pp.1219. 


(a)Contrary to the Ninth Circuits conclusion, the State Supreme Court explicitly found that Juror Z was substantially impaired.  Even absent this explicit finding, the only fair reading of the opinion is that the state court applied the Witt standard in assessing his excusal.  Regardless, there is no requirement in a case involving the Witt-Witherspoon rule that a state appellate court make particular reference to each jurors excusal, for it is the trial courts ruling that counts.  Pp.1214.


(b)On this record, the trial court acted well within its discretion in granting the States motion to excuse Juror Z.  His answers, on their face, could have led the trial court to believe that he would be substantially impaired in his ability to impose the death penalty absent the possibility that Brown would be released and would reoffend.  The trial court, furthermore, is entitled to deference because it had an opportunity to observe Juror Zs demeanor.  The States challenge, Browns waiver of an objection, and the trial courts excusal of Juror Z support the conclusion that the interested parties all felt that removal was appropriate under the Witherspoon-Witt rule.  While there is no independent federal requirement that a state-court defendant object to the prosecutions challenge to preserve a Witherspoon claim, voluntary acquiescence to, or confirmation of, a jurors removal can be taken into account.  The defense did not just deny a conscientious trial judge an opportunity to explain his judgment or correct an error; it also deprived reviewing courts of further factual findings to help explain the trial courts decision.  The need to defer to the trial courts demeanor decision does not foreclose the possibility of reversal where the record discloses no basis for a substantial impairment finding, but the record here does not show the trial court exceeded its discretion in excusing Juror Z.  The State Supreme Court recognized the deference owed and, contrary to the Ninth Circuits misreading of its opinion, identified the correct standard required by federal law and found it satisfied.  Pp.1417.


(c)The Court is not persuaded by Browns additional arguments to depart from the State Supreme Courts determination of the state law at issue or to ignore Browns failure to object to Juror Zs excusal.  Pp.1719.

06-531|"SOLE, SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, etal. v. WYNER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 06531.Argued April 17, 2007Decided June 4, 2007
In private actions under 42 U. S.C. 1983, federal district courts may allow the prevailing party  a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs.  1988(b).  Plaintiff-respondent Wyner notified the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in mid-January 2003, of her intention to create on Valentines Day, within MacArthur State Beach Park, an antiwar artwork consisting of nude individuals assembled into a peace sign.  Responding on February 6, DEP informed Wyner that her display would be lawful only if the participants complied with Floridas Bathing Suit Rule, which requires patrons of state parks to wear, at a minimum, a thong and, if female, a bikini top.  To safeguard her display, and future nude expressive activities, against police interference, Wyner and a coplaintiff (collectively Wyner or plaintiff) sued Florida officials in the Federal District Court on February 12.  Invoking the First Amendments protection of expressive conduct, Wyner requested immediate injunctive relief against interference with the peace sign display and permanent injunctive relief against interference with future activities similarly involving nudity.  An attachment to the complaint set out a 1995 settlement with DEP permitting Wyner to stage a play with nude performers at MacArthur Beach provided the area was screened off to shield beachgoers who did not wish to see the play.  Although disconcerted by the hurried character of the proceeding, the District Court granted Wyner a preliminary injunction on February 13, suggesting that a curtain or screen could satisfy the interests of both the State and Wyner.  The peace symbol display that took place the next day was set up outside a barrier apparently put up by the State.  Once disassembled from the peace symbol formation, participants went into the water in the nude.  Thereafter, Wyner pursued her demand for a permanent injunction, noting that she intended to put on another Valentines Day production at MacArthur Beach, again involving nudity.  After discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.  At a January 21, 2004 hearing, Wyners counsel acknowledged that the peace symbol display participants had set up in front of the barrier.  The court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted defendants motion for summary final judgment.  The deliberate failure of Wyner and her coparticipants to stay behind the screen at the 2003 Valentines Day display, the court concluded, demonstrated that the Bathing Suit Rules prohibition of nudity was essential to protect the visiting public.  While Wyner ultimately failed to prevail on the merits, the court added, she did obtain a preliminary injunction, and therefore qualified as a prevailing party to that extent.  Reasoning that the preliminary injunction could not be revisited at the second stage of the litigation because it had expired, the court awarded plaintiff counsel fees covering the first phase of the litigation.  The Florida officials appealed, challenging both the preliminary injunction and the counsel fees award.  The Eleventh Circuit held first that defendants challenges to the preliminary injunction were moot.  The court then affirmed the counsel fees award, reasoning that the preliminary order allowed Wyner to present the peace symbol display unimpeded by adverse state action.  
Held:Prevailing party status does not attend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.  Pp.  611.
(a)The touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry this Court has stated, is the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.  Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782, 792793.  At the preliminary injunction stage, the court is called upon to assess the probability of the plaintiffs ultimate success on the merits.  The foundation for that assessment will be more or less secure depending on the thoroughness of the exploration undertaken by the parties and the court.  In this case, the preliminary injunction hearing was necessarily hasty and abbreviated.  There was no time for discovery, nor for adequate review of documents or preparation and presentation of witnesses.  The provisional relief granted expired before appellate review could be gained, and the courts threshold ruling would have no preclusive effect in the continuing litigation, as both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered the preliminary injunction moot once the display took place.  The provisional reliefs tentative character, in view of the continuation of the litigation to definitively resolve the controversy, would have made a fee request at the initial stage premature.  Of controlling importance, the eventual ruling on the merits for defendants, after both sides considered the case fit for final adjudication, superseded the preliminary ruling.  Wyners temporary success rested on a premisethe understanding that a curtain or screen would adequately serve Floridas interest in shielding the public from nuditythat the District Court, with the benefit of a fuller record, ultimately rejected.  Wyner contends that the preliminary injunction was not undermined by the subsequent merits adjudication because the decision to grant preliminary relief was an as applied ruling based on the officials impermissible content-based administration of the Bathing Suit Rule.  But the District Court assumed content neutrality for purposes of its preliminary order.  The final decision in Wyners case rejected the same claim she advanced in her preliminary injunction motion: that the state law banning nudity in parks was unconstitutional as applied to expressive, nonerotic nudity.  At the end of the fray, Floridas Bathing Suit Rule remained intact.  Wyner had gained no enduring chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between herself and the state officials she sued.  See Texas State Teachers Assn., 489 U. S., at 792.  Pp.610.


(b)Wyner is not a prevailing party, for her initial victory was ephemeral.  This Court expresses no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.  It decides only that a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction does not qualify for an award of counsel fees under 1988(b) if the merits of the case are ultimately decided against her.  Pp.1011.

06-7317|"WILLIAM ERICKSON v. BARRY J. PARDUS etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 067317.Decided June 4, 2007
Per Curiam.

Imprisoned by the State of Colorado and alleging violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, William Erickson, the petitioner in this Court, filed suit against prison officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  He alleged that a liver condition resulting from hepatitis C required a treatment program that officials had commenced but then wrongfully terminated, with life-threatening consequences.  Deeming these allegations, and others to be noted, to be conclusory, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of petitioners complaint.  198 Fed. Appx. 694, 698 (2006).  The holding departs in so stark a manner from the pleading standard mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that we grant review.  We vacate the courts judgment and remand the case for further consideration. 


Petitioner was incarcerated in the Limon Correctional Facility in Limon, Colorado, where respondents Barry Pardus and Dr. Anita Bloor were working as prison officials.  After Dr. Bloor removed petitioner from the hepatitis C treatment he had been receiving, petitioner sued under 42 U. S.C. 1983, complaining, inter alia, that Dr. Bloor had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by demonstrating deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.  See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104105 (1976) ([D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment, and this includes indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoners needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 3537 (1993). 


Petitioner based his claim on the following allegations, which we assume to be true for purposes of review here:  Officials at Colorados Department of Corrections (Department) diagnosed petitioner as requiring treatment for hepatitis C.  After completing the necessary classes and otherwise complying with the protocols set forth by the Department, petitioner began treatment for the disease.  The treatment, which would take a year to complete, involved weekly self-injections of medication by use of a syringe.  Soon after petitioner began this treatment, prison officials were unable to account for one of the syringes made available to petitioner (and other prisoners) for medical purposes.  Upon searching, they found it in a communal trash can, modified in a manner suggestive of use for injection of illegal drugs.  Prisoner Complaint in Civ. Action No. 05CV00405LTBMJW (D. Colo.), p. 3 (hereinafter Petitioners Complaint).


Prison officials, disbelieving petitioners claim not to have taken the syringe, found that his conduct constituted a violation of the Colorado Code of Penal Discipline for possession of drug paraphernalia.  Letter from Anthony A. DeCesaro to William Erickson (Sept. 30, 2004), attached to Petitioners Complaint.  This conduct, according to the officials, led to the reasonable inference that petitioner had intended to use drugs, so the officials removed petitioner from his hepatitis C treatment.  Ibid.  The successful treatment of Hepatitis C is incumbent upon the individual remaining drug and alcohol free to give the liver a better chance of recovery, they indicated, ibid., an explanation they later offered to defend against petitioners allegations of cruel and unusual punishment, see Defendants Motion to Dismiss in Civ. Action No. 05CV00405LTBMJW, p. 10.  Assuming that a person in the course of this treatment takes illicit drugs, the prisons protocol mandates a waiting period of one year followed by a mandatory drug education class lasting six months.  Brief in Opposition 4.  Petitioner therefore could face a delay of some 18 months before he would be able to restart treatment.


In his complaint petitioner alleged Dr. Bloor had removed [him] from [his] hepatitis C treatment in violation of department protocol, thus endangering [his] life.  Petitioners Complaint 2.  Petitioner attached to the complaint certain grievance forms.  In these he claimed, among other things, he was suffering from continued damage to [his] liver as a result of the nontreatment.  Colorado Dept. of Corrections Offender Grievance Form (June 30, 2004).  The complaint requested relief including damages and an injunction requiring that the Department treat petitioner for hepatitis C under the standards of the treatment [protocol] established by [the Department].  Petitioners Complaint8.


Three months after filing his complaint, and well before the District Court entered a judgment against him, petitioner filed a Motion for Expedited Review Due to Imminent Danger, in Civ. Action No. 05B405 (MJW) (D.Colo.).  Indicating it was undisputed that he had hepatitis C, that he met the Departments standards for treatment of the disease, and that furtherance of this disease can cause irreversible damage to [his] liver and possible death, petitioner alleged that numerous inmates in his prison community had died of the disease and that he was in imminent danger himself due to [the Departments] refusal to treat him.  Ibid.  He had identified similar allegations in an earlier filing, explaining that his liver is suffering irreversible damage due to the decision to remove him from treatment and that he will suffer irreparable damage if his disease goes untreated.  Plaintiffs Objections to the Magistrates Recommendations in Civ. Action No. 05CV00405LTBMJW, p. 3.


Respondents answered these filings with a motion to dismiss.  The Magistrate Judge recommended, as relevant, that the District Court dismiss the complaint on the ground it failed to allege Dr. Bloors actions had caused petitioner substantial harm.  Recommendation on Defendants Motion To Dismiss, p. 12.  The District Court issued a short order indicating its agreement with the Magistrate Judge and dismissing the complaint.


The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It quoted extensively from the Magistrate Judges discussion of substantial harm before holding that petitioner had made only conclusory allegations to the effect that he has suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the [hepatitis C] treatment program.  198 Fed. Appx., at 698.  Acknowledging decisions by courts that have found Eighth Amendment violations when delays in medical treatment have involved life-threatening situations and instances in which it is apparent that delay would exacerbate the prisoners medical problems (and that have, moreover, indicated the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm to an inmate), id., at 697 (internal quotation marks omitted), the court nevertheless found petitioners complaint deficient: Petitioner had, according to the court, failed to allege that as a result of the discontinuance of the treatment itself shortly after it began or the interruption of treatment for approximately eighteen months he suffered any harm, let alone substantial harm, [other] than what he already faced from the Hepatitis C itself, id., at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Having reached this conclusion, the court saw no need to address whether the complaint alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Bloor had made her decisions with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.  Id., at 697, 698 (internal quotation marks omitted).


It may in the final analysis be shown that the District Court was correct to grant respondents motion to dismiss.  That is not the issue here, however.  It was error for the Court of Appeals to conclude that the allegations in question, concerning harm caused petitioner by the termination of his medication, were too conclusory to establish for pleading purposes that petitioner had suffered a cognizable independent harm as a result of his removal from the hepatitis C treatment program.  Id., at 698.


Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only  give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.   Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550  U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 78) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957)).  In addition, when ruling on a defendants motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.  Bell Atlantic Corp., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 89) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 506, 508, n. 1 (2002); Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319, 327 (1989); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 236 (1974)).


The complaint stated that Dr. Bloors decision to remove petitioner from his prescribed hepatitis C medication was endangering [his] life.  Petitioners Complaint 2.  It alleged this medication was withheld shortly after petitioner had commenced a treatment program that would take one year, that he was still in need of treatment for this disease, and that the prison officials were in the meantime refusing to provide treatment.  Id., at 3, 4.  This alone was enough to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2).  Petitioner, in addition, bolstered his claim by making more specific allegations in documents attached to the complaint and in later filings.


The Court of Appeals departure from the liberal pleading standards set forth by Rule 8(a)(2) is even more pronounced in this particular case because petitioner has been proceeding, from the litigations outset, without counsel.  A document filed pro se is to be liberally construed, Estelle, 429 U. S., at 106, and a pro se complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers, ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(f) (All pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice).


Whether petitioners complaint is sufficient in all respects is a matter yet to be determined, for respondents raised multiple arguments in their motion to dismiss.  In particular, the proper application of the controlling legal principles to the facts is yet to be determined.  The case cannot, however, be dismissed on the ground that petitioners allegations of harm were too conclusory to put these matters in issue.  Certiorari and leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.

06-84|"SAFECO INSURANCE CO. OF AMERICA etal. v. BURR etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 0684.Argued January 16, 2007Decided June 4, 2007
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires notice to a consumer subjected to adverse action  based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer [credit] report.  15 U. S.C. 1681m(a).  As applied to insurance companies, adverse action is a denial or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for, or a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for.  1681a(k)(1)(B)(i).  FCRA provides a private right of action against businesses that use consumer reports but fail to comply.  A negligent violation entitles a consumer to actual damages, 1681o(a), and a willful one entitles the consumer to actual, statutory, and even punitive damages, 1681n(a).  


Petitioners in No. 06100 (GEICO) use an applicants credit score to select the appropriate subsidiary insurance company and the particular rate at which a policy may be issued.  GEICO sends an adverse action notice only if a neutral credit score would have put the applicant in a lower priced tier or company; the applicant is not otherwise told if he would have gotten better terms with a better credit score.  Respondent Edos credit score was taken into account when GEICO issued him a policy, but GEICO sent no adverse action notice because his company and tier placement would have been the same with a neutral score.  Edo filed a proposed class action, alleging willful violation of 1681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under 1681n(a).  The District Court granted GEICO summary judgment, finding no adverse action because the premium would have been the same had Edos credit history not been considered.  Petitioners in No. 06100 (Safeco) also rely on credit reports to set initial insurance premiums.  Respondents Burr and Masseywhom Safeco offered higher than the best rates possible without sending adverse action noticesjoined a proposed class action, alleging willful violation of 1681m(a) and seeking statutory and punitive damages under 1681n(a).  The District Court granted Safeco summary judgment on the ground that offering a single, initial rate for insurance cannot be adverse action.  The Ninth Circuit reversed both judgments.  In GEICOs case, it held that an adverse action occurs whenever a consumer would have received a lower rate had his consumer report contained more favorable information.  Since that would have happened to Edo, GEICOs failure to give notice was an adverse action.  The court also held that an insurer willfully fails to comply with FCRA if it acts in reckless disregard of a consumers FCRA rights, remanding for further proceedings on the reckless disregard issue.  Relying on its decision in GEICOs case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the District Courts position in the Safeco case and remanded for further proceedings. 
Held:
1.Willful failure covers a violation committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation.  Where willfulness is a statutory condition of civil liability, it is generally taken to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but reckless ones as well.  See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 133.  This construction reflects common law usage.  The standard civil usage thus counsels reading 1681n(a)s phrase willfully fails to comply as reaching reckless FCRA violations, both on the interpretive assumption that Congress knows how this Court construes statutes and expects it to run true to form, see Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159, and under the rule that a common law term in a statute comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way, Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494, 500501.  Petitioners claim that 1681n(a)s drafting history points to a reading that liability attaches only to knowing violations, but the text as finally adopted points to the traditional understanding of willfulness in the civil sphere.  Their other textual and structural arguments are also unpersuasive.  Pp.610.


2.Initial rates charged for new insurance policies may be adverse actions.  Pp.1017.


(a)Reading the phrase increase in any charge for  any insurance, existing or applied for, 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i), to include a disadvantageous rate even with no prior dealing fits with the ambitious objective of FCRAs statement of purpose, which uses expansive terms to describe the adverse effects of unfair and inaccurate credit reporting and the responsibilities of consumer reporting agencies.  See 1681(a).  These descriptions do nothing to suggest that remedies for consumers disadvantaged by unsound credit ratings should be denied to first-time victims, and the legislative histories of both FCRAs original enactment and a 1996 amendment reveal no reason to confine attention to customers and businesses with prior dealings.  Finally, nothing about insurance contracts suggests that Congress meant to differentiate applicants from existing customers when it set the notice requirement; the newly insured who gets charged more owing to an erroneous report is in the same boat with the renewal applicant.  Pp.1013.


(b)An increased rate is not based in whole or in part on a credit report under 1681m(a) unless the report was a necessary condition of the increase.  In common talk, based on indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition.  Though some textual arguments point another way, it makes more sense to suspect that Congress meant to require notice and prompt a consumer challenge only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded.  Pp.1314.


(c)In determining whether a first-time rate is a disadvantageous increase, the baseline is the rate that the applicant would have received had the company not taken his credit score into account (the neutral score rate GEICO used in Edos case).  That baseline comports with the understanding that 1681m(a) notice is required only when the credit reports effect on the initial rate is necessary to put the consumer in a worse position than other relevant facts would have decreed anyway.  Congress was more likely concerned with the practical question whether the consumers rate actually suffered when his credit report was taken into account than the theoretical question whether the consumer would have gotten a better rate with the best possible credit score, the baseline suggested by the Government and respondent-plaintiffs.  The Governments objection to this reading is rejected.  Although the rate initially offered for new insurance is an increase calling for notice if it exceeds the neutral rate, once a consumer has learned that his credit report led the insurer to charge more, he need not be told with each renewal if his rate has not changed.  After initial dealing between the consumer and the insurer, the baseline for increase is the previous rate or charge, not the neutral baseline that applies at the start.  Pp.1517.


3.GEICO did not violate the statute, and while Safeco might have, it did not act recklessly.  Pp.1821.


(a)Because the initial rate GEICO offered Edo was what he would have received had his credit score not been taken into account, GEICO owed him no adverse action notice under 1681m(a).  P.18.


(b)Even if Safeco violated FCRA when it failed to give Burr and Massey notice on the mistaken belief that 1681m(a) did not apply to initial applications, the company was not reckless.  The common law has generally understood recklessness in the civil liability sphere as conduct violating an objective standard: action entailing an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 836.  There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, there is no reason to deviate from the common law understanding in applying the statute.  See Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S., at 500501.  Thus, a company does not act in reckless disregard of FCRA unless the action is not only a violation under a reasonable reading of the statute, but shows that the company ran a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with a reading that was merely careless.  The negligence/recklessness line need not be pinpointed here, for Safecos reading of the statute, albeit erroneous, was not objectively unreasonable.  Section 1681a(k)(1)(B)(i) is silent on the point from which to measure increase, and Safecos reading has a foundation in the statutory text and a sufficiently convincing justification to have persuaded the District Court to adopt it and rule in Safecos favor.  Before these cases, no court of appeals had spoken on the issue, and no authoritative guidance has yet come from the Federal Trade Commission.  Given this dearth of guidance and the less-than-pellucid statutory text, Safecos reading was not objectively unreasonable, and so falls well short of raising the unjustifiably high risk of violating the statute necessary for reckless liability.  Pp.1821.
No. 0684, 140 Fed. Appx. 746; No. 06100, 435 F.3d 1081, reversed and remanded.

05-1074|"LEDBETTER v. GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO., INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 051074.Argued November 27, 2006Decided May 29, 2007
During most of the time that petitioner Ledbetter was employed by respondent Goodyear, salaried employees at the plant where she worked were given or denied raises based on performance evaluations.  Ledbetter submitted a questionnaire to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998 and a formal EEOC charge in July 1998.  After her November 1998 retirement, she filed suit, asserting, among other things, a sex discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court allowed her Title VII pay discrimination claim to proceed to trial.  There, Ledbetter alleged that several supervisors had in the past given her poor evaluations because of her sex; that as a result, her pay had not increased as much as it would have if she had been evaluated fairly; that those past pay decisions affected the amount of her pay throughout her employment; and that by the end of her employment, she was earning significantly less than her male colleagues.  Goodyear maintained that the evaluations had been nondiscriminatory, but the jury found for Ledbetter, awarding backpay and damages.  On appeal, Goodyear contended that the pay discrimination claim was time barred with regard to all pay decisions made before September 26, 1997180 days before Ledbetter filed her EEOC questionnaireand that no discriminatory act relating to her pay occurred after that date.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a Title VII pay discrimination claim cannot be based on allegedly discriminatory events that occurred before the last pay decision that affected the employees pay during the EEOC charging period, and concluding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Goodyear had acted with discriminatory intent in making the only two pay decisions during that period, denials of raises in 1997 and 1998.  
Held:Because the later effects of past discrimination do not restart the clock for filing an EEOC charge, Ledbetters claim is untimely.  Pp.424.
(a)An individual wishing to bring a Title VII lawsuit must first file an EEOC charge within, as relevant here, 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.  42 U. S.C. 2000e2(a)(1).  In addressing the issue of an EEOC charges timeliness, this Court has stressed the need to identify with care the specific employment practice at issue.  Ledbetters argumentsthat the paychecks that she received during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and triggered a new EEOC charging periodfail because they would require the Court in effect to jettison the defining element of the disparate-treatment claim on which her Title VII recovery was based, discriminatory intent.  United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900, and National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, clearly instruct that the EEOC charging period is triggered when a discrete unlawful practice takes place.  A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.  But if an employer engages in a series of separately actionable intentionally discriminatory acts, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed.  Ledbetter makes no claim that intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or that discriminatory decisions occurring before that period were not communicated to her.  She argues simply that Goodyears nondiscriminatory conduct during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period.  But current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination.  Ledbetter should have filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory employment decision was made and communicated to her.  Her attempt to shift forward the intent associated with prior discriminatory acts to the 1998 pay decision is unsound, for it would shift intent away from the act that consummated the discriminatory employment practice to a later act not performed with bias or discriminatory motive, imposing liability in the absence of the requisite intent.  Her argument would also distort Title VIIs integrated, multistep enforcement procedure.  Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, 359.  The short EEOC filing deadline reflects Congress strong preference for the prompt resolution of employment discrimination allegations through voluntary conciliation and cooperation.  Id., at 367368.  Nothing in Title VII supports treating the intent element of Ledbetters disparate-treatment claim any differently from the employment practice element of the claim.  Pp.413.


(b)Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (per curiam), which concerned a disparate-treatment pay claim, is entirely consistent with Evans, Ricks, Lorance, and Morgan.  Bazemores rule is that an employer violates Title VII and triggers a new EEOC charging period whenever the employer issues paychecks using a discriminatory pay structure.  It is not, as Ledbetter contends, a paycheck accrual rule under which each paycheck, even if not accompanied by discriminatory intent, triggers a new EEOC charging period during which the complainant may properly challenge any prior discriminatory conduct that impacted that paychecks amount, no matter how long ago the discrimination occurred.  Because Ledbetter has not adduced evidence that Goodyear initially adopted its performance-based pay system in order to discriminate based on sex or that it later applied this system to her within the charging period with discriminatory animus, Bazemore is of no help to her.

			"|"LEDBETTER v. GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER CO., INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 051074.Argued November 27, 2006Decided May 29, 2007
During most of the time that petitioner Ledbetter was employed by respondent Goodyear, salaried employees at the plant where she worked were given or denied raises based on performance evaluations.  Ledbetter submitted a questionnaire to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998 and a formal EEOC charge in July 1998.  After her November 1998 retirement, she filed suit, asserting, among other things, a sex discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court allowed her Title VII pay discrimination claim to proceed to trial.  There, Ledbetter alleged that several supervisors had in the past given her poor evaluations because of her sex; that as a result, her pay had not increased as much as it would have if she had been evaluated fairly; that those past pay decisions affected the amount of her pay throughout her employment; and that by the end of her employment, she was earning significantly less than her male colleagues.  Goodyear maintained that the evaluations had been nondiscriminatory, but the jury found for Ledbetter, awarding backpay and damages.  On appeal, Goodyear contended that the pay discrimination claim was time barred with regard to all pay decisions made before September 26, 1997180 days before Ledbetter filed her EEOC questionnaireand that no discriminatory act relating to her pay occurred after that date.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a Title VII pay discrimination claim cannot be based on allegedly discriminatory events that occurred before the last pay decision that affected the employees pay during the EEOC charging period, and concluding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Goodyear had acted with discriminatory intent in making the only two pay decisions during that period, denials of raises in 1997 and 1998.  
Held:Because the later effects of past discrimination do not restart the clock for filing an EEOC charge, Ledbetters claim is untimely.  Pp.424.
(a)An individual wishing to bring a Title VII lawsuit must first file an EEOC charge within, as relevant here, 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.  42 U. S.C. 2000e2(a)(1).  In addressing the issue of an EEOC charges timeliness, this Court has stressed the need to identify with care the specific employment practice at issue.  Ledbetters argumentsthat the paychecks that she received during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and triggered a new EEOC charging periodfail because they would require the Court in effect to jettison the defining element of the disparate-treatment claim on which her Title VII recovery was based, discriminatory intent.  United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553, Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900, and National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101, clearly instruct that the EEOC charging period is triggered when a discrete unlawful practice takes place.  A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.  But if an employer engages in a series of separately actionable intentionally discriminatory acts, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed.  Ledbetter makes no claim that intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or that discriminatory decisions occurring before that period were not communicated to her.  She argues simply that Goodyears nondiscriminatory conduct during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period.  But current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination.  Ledbetter should have filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory employment decision was made and communicated to her.  Her attempt to shift forward the intent associated with prior discriminatory acts to the 1998 pay decision is unsound, for it would shift intent away from the act that consummated the discriminatory employment practice to a later act not performed with bias or discriminatory motive, imposing liability in the absence of the requisite intent.  Her argument would also distort Title VIIs integrated, multistep enforcement procedure.  Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, 359.  The short EEOC filing deadline reflects Congress strong preference for the prompt resolution of employment discrimination allegations through voluntary conciliation and cooperation.  Id., at 367368.  Nothing in Title VII supports treating the intent element of Ledbetters disparate-treatment claim any differently from the employment practice element of the claim.  Pp.413.


(b)Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385 (per curiam), which concerned a disparate-treatment pay claim, is entirely consistent with Evans, Ricks, Lorance, and Morgan.  Bazemores rule is that an employer violates Title VII and triggers a new EEOC charging period whenever the employer issues paychecks using a discriminatory pay structure.  It is not, as Ledbetter contends, a paycheck accrual rule under which each paycheck, even if not accompanied by discriminatory intent, triggers a new EEOC charging period during which the complainant may properly challenge any prior discriminatory conduct that impacted that paychecks amount, no matter how long ago the discrimination occurred.  Because Ledbetter has not adduced evidence that Goodyear initially adopted its performance-based pay system in order to discriminate based on sex or that it later applied this system to her within the charging period with discriminatory animus, Bazemore is of no help to her.

05-1126|"BELL ATLANTIC CORP. etal. v. TWOMBLY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 051126.Argued November 27, 2006Decided May 21, 2007
The 1984 divestiture of the American Telephone & Telegraph Companys (AT&T) local telephone business left a system of regional service monopolies, sometimes called Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), and a separate long-distance market from which the ILECs were excluded.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 withdrew approval of the ILECs monopolies, fundamentally restructur[ing] local telephone markets and subject[ing] [ILECs] to a host of duties intended to facilitate market entry.  AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 371.  It also authorized them to enter the long-distance market.  Central to the [new] scheme [was each ILECs] obligation  to share its network with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs).  Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U. S. 398, 402.  


Respondents (hereinafter plaintiffs) represent a class of subscribers of local telephone and/or high speed Internet services in this action against petitioner ILECs for claimed violations of 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits [e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.  The complaint alleges that the ILECs conspired to restrain trade (1) by engaging in parallel conduct in their respective service areas to inhibit the growth of upstart CLECs; and (2) by agreeing to refrain from competing against one another, as indicated by their common failure to pursue attractive business opportunities in contiguous markets and by a statement by one ILECs chief executive officer that competing in another ILECs territory did not seem right.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that parallel business conduct allegations, taken alone, do not state a claim under 1; plaintiffs must allege additional facts tending to exclude independent self-interested conduct as an explanation for the parallel actions.  Reversing, the Second Circuit held that plaintiffs parallel conduct allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss because the ILECs failed to show that there is no set of facts that would permit plaintiffs to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence.
Held: 
1.Stating a 1 claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made.  An allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice.  Pp.617.


(a)Because 1 prohibits only restraints effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy, Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 775, [t]he crucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stem[s] from independent decision or from an agreement, Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp., 346 U. S. 537, 540.  While a showing of parallel business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which agreement may be inferred, it falls short of conclusively establish[ing] agreement or  itself constitut[ing] a Sherman Act offense.  Id., at 540541.  The inadequacy of showing parallel conduct or interdependence, without more, mirrors the behaviors ambiguity: consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.  Thus, this Court has hedged against false inferences from identical behavior at a number of points in the trial sequence, e.g., at the summary judgment stage, see Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574.  Pp.67.


(b)This case presents the antecedent question of what a plaintiff must plead in order to state a 1 claim.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the  claim is and the grounds upon which it rests, Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47.  While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, ibid., a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of a cause of actions elements will not do.  Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the complaints allegations are true.  Applying these general standards to a 1 claim, stating a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter to suggest an agreement.  Asking for plausible grounds does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.  The need at the pleading stage for allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement reflects Rule 8(a)(2)s threshold requirement that the plain statement possess enough heft to sho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.  A parallel conduct allegation gets the 1 complaint close to stating a claim, but without further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility.  The requirement of allegations suggesting an agreement serves the practical purpose of preventing a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim from tak[ing] up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an in terrorem increment of the settlement value.  Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 347.  It is one thing to be cautious before dismissing an antitrust complaint in advance of discovery, but quite another to forget that proceeding to antitrust discovery can be expensive.  That potential expense is obvious here, where plaintiffs represent a putative class of at least 90 percent of subscribers to local telephone or high-speed Internet service in an action against Americas largest telecommunications firms for unspecified instances of antitrust violations that allegedly occurred over a 7-year period.  It is no answer to say that a claim just shy of plausible entitlement can be weeded out early in the discovery process, given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been modest.  Plaintiffs main argument against the plausibility standard at the pleading stage is its ostensible conflict with a literal reading of Conleys statement construing Rule 8: a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.  355 U. S., at 4546.  The no set of facts language has been questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough by courts and commentators, and is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.  Conley described the breadth of opportunity to prove what an adequate complaint claims, not the minimum standard of adequate pleading to govern a complaints survival.  Pp.717. 


2.Under the plausibility standard, plaintiffs claim of conspiracy in restraint of trade comes up short.  First, the complaint leaves no doubt that plaintiffs rest their 1 claim on descriptions of parallel conduct, not on any independent allegation of actual agreement among the ILECs.  The nub of the complaint is the ILECs parallel behavior, and its sufficiency turns on the suggestions raised by this conduct when viewed in light of common economic experience.  Nothing in the complaint invests either the action or inaction alleged with a plausible conspiracy suggestion.  As to the ILECs supposed agreement to disobey the 1996 Act and thwart the CLECs attempts to compete, the District Court correctly found that nothing in the complaint intimates that resisting the upstarts was anything more than the natural, unilateral reaction of each ILEC intent on preserving its regional dominance.  The complaints general collusion premise fails to answer the point that there was no need for joint encouragement to resist the 1996 Act, since each ILEC had reason to try and avoid dealing with CLECs and would have tried to keep them out, regardless of the other ILECs actions.  Plaintiffs second conspiracy theory rests on the competitive reticence among the ILECs themselves in the wake of the 1996 Act to enter into their competitors territories, leaving the relevant market highly compartmentalized geographically, with minimal competition.  This parallel conduct did not suggest conspiracy, not if history teaches anything.  Monopoly was the norm in telecommunications, not the exception.  Because the ILECs were born in that world, doubtless liked it, and surely knew the adage about him who lives by the sword, a natural explanation for the noncompetition is that the former Government-sanctioned monopolists were sitting tight, expecting their neighbors to do the same.  Antitrust conspiracy was not suggested by the facts adduced under either theory of the complaint, which thus fails to state a valid 1 claim.  This analysis does not run counter to Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U. S. 506, 508, which held that a complaint in an employment discrimination lawsuit [need] not contain specific facts establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.  Here, the Court is not requiring heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.  Because the plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.  Pp.1824. 
425 F.3d 99, reversed and remanded.

05-983|"WINKELMAN, a minor, by and through his parents and legal guardians, WINKELMAN et ux., etal. v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 05983.Argued February 27, 2007Decided May 21, 2007
Respondent school district receives federal funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), so it must provide children such as petitioner Winkelmans son Jacob a free appropriate public education, 20 U. S.C. 1400(d)(1)(A), in accordance with an individualized education program (IEP) that the parents, school officials, and others develop as members of the students IEP Team.  Regarding Jacobs IEP as deficient, the Winkelmans unsuccessfully appealed through IDEAs administrative review process.  Proceeding without counsel, they then filed a federal-court complaint on their own behalf and on Jacobs behalf.  The District Court granted respondent judgment on the pleadings.  The Sixth Circuit entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans subsequent appeal unless they obtained an attorney, citing Circuit precedent holding that because the right to a free appropriate public education belongs only to the child, and IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children, IDEA does not allow nonlawyer parents to proceed pro se in federal court.
Held: 
1.IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights, which are not limited to procedural and reimbursement-related matters but encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for their child.  Pp.417.


(a)IDEAs text resolves the question whether parents or only children have rights under the Act.  Proper interpretation requires considering the entire statutory scheme.  IDEAs goals include ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education and that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected, 20 U. S.C. 1400(d)(1)(A)(B), and many of its terms mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement.  Parents play a significant role, Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 53, in the development of each childs IEP, see 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).  They are IEP team members, 1414(d)(1)(B), and their concerns for enhancing [their childs] education must be considered by the team, 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii).  A State must, moreover, give any party who objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the IEPs construction, or related matter the opportunity to present a complaint ,  1415(b)(6), and engage in an administrative review process that culminates in an impartial due process hearing, 1415(f)(1)(A), before a hearing officer.  Any party aggrieved by the [hearing officers] findings and decision  [has] the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.  1415(i)(2)(A).  A court or hearing officer may require a state agency to reimburse the parents  for the cost of [private school] enrollment if  the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.  1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  IDEA also governs when and to what extent a court may award attorneys fees, see 1415(i)(3)(B), including an award to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability, 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).  Pp.59.


(b)These various provisions accord parents independent, enforceable rights.  Parents have enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert those rights in federal court at the adjudication stage.  Respondent argues that parental involvement is contemplated only to the extent parents represent their childs interests, but this view is foreclosed by the Acts provisions.  The grammatical structure of IDEAs purpose of protecting the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children, 1400(d)(1)(B), would make no sense unless rights refers to the parents rights as well as the childs.  Other provisions confirm this view.  See, e.g., 1415(a).  Even if this Court were inclined to ignore the Acts plain text and adopt respondents countertextual reading, the Court disagrees that sole purpose driving IDEAs involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a childs rights.  It is not novel for parents to have a recognized legal interest in their childs education and upbringing.  


The Acts provisions also contradict the variation on respondents argument that parents can be parties aggrieved for aspects of the hearing officers findings and decision relating to certain procedures and reimbursements, but not parties aggrieved with regard to any challenge not implicating those limited concerns.  The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEAs procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their childs educational program.  The Act also allows expansive challenge by parents of any matter related to the proceedings and requires that administrative resolution be based on whether the child received a free appropriate public education, 1415(f)(3(E), with judicial review to follow.  The text and structure of IDEA create in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by the process but also in the substantive decision to be made.  Incongruous results would follow, moreover, were the Court to accept the proposition that parents IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters.  It is difficult to disentangle the Acts procedural and reimbursement-related rights from its substantive ones, and attempting to do so would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might differentiate between these matters.  This bifurcated regime would also leave some parents without any legal remedy.  Pp.916.

			"|"WINKELMAN, a minor, by and through his parents and legal guardians, WINKELMAN et ux., etal. v. PARMA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 05983.Argued February 27, 2007Decided May 21, 2007
Respondent school district receives federal funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (Act or IDEA), so it must provide children such as petitioner Winkelmans son Jacob a free appropriate public education, 20 U. S.C. 1400(d)(1)(A), in accordance with an individualized education program (IEP) that the parents, school officials, and others develop as members of the students IEP Team.  Regarding Jacobs IEP as deficient, the Winkelmans unsuccessfully appealed through IDEAs administrative review process.  Proceeding without counsel, they then filed a federal-court complaint on their own behalf and on Jacobs behalf.  The District Court granted respondent judgment on the pleadings.  The Sixth Circuit entered an order dismissing the Winkelmans subsequent appeal unless they obtained an attorney, citing Circuit precedent holding that because the right to a free appropriate public education belongs only to the child, and IDEA does not abrogate the common-law rule prohibiting nonlawyer parents from representing minor children, IDEA does not allow nonlawyer parents to proceed pro se in federal court.
Held: 
1.IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights, which are not limited to procedural and reimbursement-related matters but encompass the entitlement to a free appropriate public education for their child.  Pp.417.


(a)IDEAs text resolves the question whether parents or only children have rights under the Act.  Proper interpretation requires considering the entire statutory scheme.  IDEAs goals include ensur[ing] that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education and that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected, 20 U. S.C. 1400(d)(1)(A)(B), and many of its terms mandate or otherwise describe parental involvement.  Parents play a significant role, Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 53, in the development of each childs IEP, see 1412(a)(4), 1414(d).  They are IEP team members, 1414(d)(1)(B), and their concerns for enhancing [their childs] education must be considered by the team, 1414(d)(3)(A)(ii).  A State must, moreover, give any party who objects to the adequacy of the education provided, the IEPs construction, or related matter the opportunity to present a complaint ,  1415(b)(6), and engage in an administrative review process that culminates in an impartial due process hearing, 1415(f)(1)(A), before a hearing officer.  Any party aggrieved by the [hearing officers] findings and decision  [has] the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint.  1415(i)(2)(A).  A court or hearing officer may require a state agency to reimburse the parents  for the cost of [private school] enrollment if  the agency had not made a free appropriate public education available to the child.  1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  IDEA also governs when and to what extent a court may award attorneys fees, see 1415(i)(3)(B), including an award to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability, 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I).  Pp.59.


(b)These various provisions accord parents independent, enforceable rights.  Parents have enforceable rights at the administrative stage, and it would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme to bar them from continuing to assert those rights in federal court at the adjudication stage.  Respondent argues that parental involvement is contemplated only to the extent parents represent their childs interests, but this view is foreclosed by the Acts provisions.  The grammatical structure of IDEAs purpose of protecting the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children, 1400(d)(1)(B), would make no sense unless rights refers to the parents rights as well as the childs.  Other provisions confirm this view.  See, e.g., 1415(a).  Even if this Court were inclined to ignore the Acts plain text and adopt respondents countertextual reading, the Court disagrees that sole purpose driving IDEAs involvement of parents is to facilitate vindication of a childs rights.  It is not novel for parents to have a recognized legal interest in their childs education and upbringing.  


The Acts provisions also contradict the variation on respondents argument that parents can be parties aggrieved for aspects of the hearing officers findings and decision relating to certain procedures and reimbursements, but not parties aggrieved with regard to any challenge not implicating those limited concerns.  The IEP proceedings entitle parents to participate not only in the implementation of IDEAs procedures but also in the substantive formulation of their childs educational program.  The Act also allows expansive challenge by parents of any matter related to the proceedings and requires that administrative resolution be based on whether the child received a free appropriate public education, 1415(f)(3(E), with judicial review to follow.  The text and structure of IDEA create in parents an independent stake not only in the procedures and costs implicated by the process but also in the substantive decision to be made.  Incongruous results would follow, moreover, were the Court to accept the proposition that parents IDEA rights are limited to certain nonsubstantive matters.  It is difficult to disentangle the Acts procedural and reimbursement-related rights from its substantive ones, and attempting to do so would impose upon parties a confusing and onerous legal regime, one worsened by the absence of any express guidance in IDEA concerning how a court might differentiate between these matters.  This bifurcated regime would also leave some parents without any legal remedy.  Pp.916.


(c)Respondent misplaces its reliance on Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U. S. ___, when it contends that because IDEA was passed pursuant to the Spending Clause, it must provide clear notice before it can be interpreted to provide independent rights to parents.

v. WILLIAM WEAVER
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
[May 21, 2007]
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari in this case, 549 U. S. ___ (2006), to decide whether the Court of Appeals had exceeded its authority under 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1) by setting aside a capital sentence on the ground that the prosecutors closing statement was unfairly inflammatory.  Weaver v. Bowersox, 438 F.3d 832, 841 (CA8 2006).  Our primary concern was whether the Court of Appeals application of the more stringent standard of review mandated by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, was consistent with our interpretation of that statute.  Cf. Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. ___ (2006).  We are now aware of circumstances that persuade us that dismissal of the writ is the appropriate manner in which to dispose of this case.


The argument made by the prosecutor in this case was essentially the same as the argument that he made in two other casesone of which involved respondents codefendant.  See Shurn v. Delo, 177 F.3d 662, 666 (CA8 1999); Newlon v. Armontrout, 693 F.Supp. 799 (WD Mo. 1988), affd, 885 F.2d 1328 (CA8 1989).  In each of those cases, the defendant received a death sentence.  Also in each case, the defendant filed a petition seeking federal habeas relief before AEDPAs effective date.  Federal habeas relief was granted in all three cases.  The State does not question the propriety of relief in the other two cases because it was clear at the time, as it is now, that AEDPA did not apply to either of them.


Respondent argues, for the following reasons, that AEDPA should not govern his case either.  Like the defendants in Newlon and Shurn, respondent filed his federal habeas petition before the effective date of AEDPA.  Instead of considering respondents claims, however, the District Court sU. S.onte stayed the habeas proceedings, noting that respondent had indicated his intention to file a petition for writ of certiorari seeking this Courts review of the state courts denial of postconviction relief.  Though the District Court recognized that respondent was not required to seek certiorari from this Court, it concluded that, if a state prisoner chooses to pursue writ of certiorari, he must first exhaust that remedy before filing a federal habeas corpus petition.  App. to Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 15.  Thus, the District Court put respondent to a choice: He could forgo filing a petition for certiorari, or his habeas petition would be dismissed.


Respondent moved for reconsideration and for the appointment of counsel.  The District Court denied both motions, reiterating its view that if respondent sought certiorari, his federal habeas petition would be premature.  When respondent notified the District Court that a petition for certiorari had been filed, the court made good on its promise: It dismissed respondents habeas petition without prejudice to his refiling following exhaustion of his state proceedings.  Id., at 13.  Though respondent had filed his habeas petition before AEDPA took effect, the District Court dismissed his petition after the statute was in force.


Still without an attorney, respondent requested a certificate of appealability from the District Court.  The court denied the request, opining that reasonable jurists could not disagree with the dismissal of respondents petition.  Id., at 56.  Respondent also filed a notice of appeal, which the Court of Appeals construed as a request for a certificate of appealability and rejected.*


Respondent refiled his habeas petition after this Court denied review of his state postconviction proceedings.  The Eighth Circuit eventually concluded that, because respondents petition was filed after AEDPAs effective date, his claims must be evaluated under that statutes strict standard of review.  See Weaver v. Bowersox, 241 F.3d 1024, 1029 (2001).


Our recent decision in Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), conclusively establishes that the District Court was wrong to conclude that, if respondent chose to seek certiorari, he had to exhaust that remedy before filing a federal habeas petition.  Lawrence clarified that [s]tate review ends when the state courts have finally resolved an application for state postconviction reliefeven if a prisoner files a certiorari petition.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see also id., at ______ (slip op., at 45) ([W]e have said that state prisoners need not petition for certiorari to exhaust state remedies (citing Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 435438 (1963))).  Thus, respondents habeas petition, which was fully exhausted when filed, did not become unexhausted upon his decision to seek certiorari.  Because the petition was not premature, the District Court had no cause to dismiss it.


Whether this unusual procedural history leads to the conclusion, as respondent colorably contends, that the AEDPA standard is simply inapplicable to this case, is a question we find unnecessary to resolve.  Regardless of the answer to that question, we find it appropriate to exercise our discretion to prevent these three virtually identically situated litigants from being treated in a needlessly disparate manner, simply because the District Court erroneously dismissed respondents pre-AEDPA petition.


Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted.

It is so ordered.
*Respondent did not seek rehearing or rehearing en banc in the Court of Appeals, nor did he file a petition for writ of certiorari from the denial of the certificate of appealability.  Pursuit of either would almost certainly have been futile.

06-376|"HINCK et ux. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 06376.Argued April 23, 2007Decided May 21, 2007
A 1986 amendment to the Internal Revenue Code permits the Treasury Secretary to abate interest that accrues on unpaid federal income taxes if the interest assessment is attributable to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) error or delay.  26 U. S.C. 6404(e)(1).  Subsequently, the federal courts uniformly held that the Secretarys decision not to abate was not subject to judicial review.  In 1996, Congress added what is now 6404(h), which states that the Tax Court has jurisdiction over any action brought by a taxpayer who meets the requirements referred to in section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) to determine whether the Secretarys failure to abate  was an abuse of discretion, and may order an abatement, if such action is brought within 180 days after the date of the mailing of the Secretarys final determination not to abate .  6404(h)(1).  Section 7430(c)(4)(A)(ii) in turn incorporates 28 U. S.C. 2412(d)(2)(B), which refers to individuals with a net worth not exceeding $2 million and businesses with a net worth not exceeding $7 million.  The IRS denied petitioner Hincks request for abatement of interest assessed in 1999 for the period March 21, 1989, to April 1, 1993.  The Hincks then filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking review of the refusal to abate.  The court granted the Governments motion to dismiss, and the Federal Circuit affirmed, holding that 6404(h) vests exclusive jurisdiction to review interest abatement claims in the Tax Court.
Held:The Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for judicial review of a failure to abate interest under 6404(e)(1).  This Courts analysis is governed by the well-established principle that, in most contexts, a precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies, EC Term of Years Trust v. United States, 550 U. S. ___, ___; it is also guided by the recognition that when Congress enacts a specific remedy when none was previously recognized, or when previous remedies were problematic, the remedy provided is generally regarded as exclusive, Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 285.  Section 6404(h) fits the bill on both counts.  In a single sentence, it provides a forum for adjudication, a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial relief; it was also enacted against a backdrop of decisions uniformly rejecting the possibility of any review of the Secretarys 6404(e)(1) determinations.  Though Congress failed explicitly to define the Tax Courts jurisdiction as exclusive, it is quite plain that the terms of 6404(h)a precisely drawn, detailed statute filling a perceived hole in the lawcontrol all requests for review of 6404(e)(1) decisions, including the forum for adjudication.  The Hincks correctly argue that Congresss provision of an abuse of discretion standard removed one of the obstacles courts had held foreclosed judicial review of such determinations, but Congress did not simply supply this single missing ingredient in enacting 6404(h).  Rather, it set out a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific provision, which also precisely defined the appropriate forum.  This Court will not isolate one feature of this statute and use it to permit taxpayers to circumvent the other limiting features in the same statute, such as a shorter statute of limitations than in general refund suits or a net-worth ceiling for plaintiffs eligible to bring suit.  Taxpayers could effortlessly evade these specific limitations by bringing interest abatement claims as tax refund actions in the district courts or the Court of Federal Claims, disaggregating a statute Congress plainly envisioned as a package deal.  EC Term of Years Trust, supra, at ___.  Equally unavailing are the Hincks contentions that reading 6404(h) to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Tax Court impliedly repeals the pre-existing jurisdiction of the district courts and Court of Federal Claims, runs contrary to the structure of tax controversy jurisdiction, and would lead to the unreasonable result that taxpayers with net worths exceeding the specified ceilings would be foreclosed from seeking judicial review of 6404(e)(1) refusals to abate.

MAX RETTELE etal.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06605.Decided May 21, 2007
Per Curiam.

Deputies of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department obtained a valid warrant to search a house, but they were unaware that the suspects being sought had moved out three months earlier.  When the deputies searched the house, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of a different race than the suspects.   The deputies ordered these innocent residents, who had been sleeping unclothed, out of bed.  The deputies required them to stand for a few minutes before allowing them to dress.


The residents brought suit under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S.C. 1983, naming the deputies and other parties and accusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  The District Court granted summary judgment to all named defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding both that the deputies violated the Fourth Amendment and that they were not entitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would have stopped the search upon discovering that respondents were of a different race than the suspects and because a reasonable deputy would not have ordered respondents from their bed.  We grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals by this summary disposition.
I

From September to December 2001, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Deputy Dennis Watters investigated a fraud and identity-theft crime ring.  There were four suspects of the investigation.  One had registered a 9-millimeter Glock handgun.  The four suspects were known to be African-Americans.
On December 11, Watters obtained a search warrant for two houses in Lancaster, California, where he believed he could find the suspects.  The warrant authorized him to search the homes and three of the suspects for documents and computer files.  In support of the search warrant an affidavit cited various sources showing the suspects resided at respondents home.  The sources included Department of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing address listings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone directory.  In this Court respondents do not dispute the validity of the warrant or the means by which it was obtained.


What Watters did not know was that one of the houses (the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a Max Rettele.  He had purchased the home and moved into it three months earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and Sadlers 17-year-old son Chase Hall.  All three, respondents here, are Caucasians.


On the morning of December 19, Watters briefed six other deputies in preparation for the search of the houses.  Watters informed them they would be searching for three African-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered handgun.  The possibility a suspect would be armed caused the deputies concern for their own safety.  Watters had not obtained special permission for a night search, so he could not execute the warrant until 7 a.m.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. 1533 (West 2000).  Around 7:15 Watters and six other deputies knocked on the door and announced their presence.  Chase Hall answered.  The deputies entered the house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground.


The deputies announcement awoke Rettele and Sadler.  The deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and ordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands.  They protested that they were not wearing clothes.  Rettele stood up and attempted to put on a pair of sweatpants, but deputies told him not to move.  Sadler also stood up and attempted, without success, to cover herself with a sheet.  Rettele and Sadler were held at gunpoint for one to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to retrieve a robe for Sadler.  He was then permitted to dress.  Rettele and Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes to sit on the couch in the living room.


By that time the deputies realized they had made a mistake.  They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them for not becoming upset, and left within five minutes.  They proceeded to the other house the warrant authorized them to search, where they found three suspects.  Those suspects were arrested and convicted.


Rettele and Sadler, individually and as guardians ad litem for Hall, filed this 1983 suit against Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Deputy Watters, and other members of the sheriffs department.  Respondents alleged petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights by obtaining a warrant in reckless fashion and conducting an unreasonable search and detention.  The District Court held that the warrant was obtained by proper procedures and the search was reasonable.  It concluded in the alternative that any Fourth Amendment rights the deputies violated were not clearly established and that, as a result, the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.


On appeal respondents did not challenge the validity of the warrant; they did argue that the deputies had conducted the search in an unreasonable manner.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an unpublished opinion.  186 Fed. Appx. 765 (2006).  The majority held that
because (1) no African-Americans lived in [respondents] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple, purchased the residence several months before the search and the deputies did not conduct an ownership inquiry; (3) the African-American suspects were not accused of a crime that required an emergency search; and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed naked and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched their bedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that the search and detention were unnecessarily painful, degrading, or prolonged, and involved an undue invasion of privacy, Franklin v. Foxworth, 31 F.3d 873, 876 (9th Cir. 1994).  Id., at 766.

Turning to whether respondents Fourth Amendment rights were clearly established, the majority held that a reasonable deputy should have known the search and detention were unlawful.


Judge Cowen dissented.  In his view the deputies had authority to detain respondents for the duration of the search and were justified in ordering respondents from their bed because weapons could have been concealed under the bedcovers.  He also concluded that, assuming a constitutional violation, the law was not clearly
established.


The Court of Appeals denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.
II

Because respondents were of a different race than the suspects the deputies were seeking, the Court of Appeals held that [a]fter taking one look at [respondents], the deputies should have realized that [respondents] were not the subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a threat to the deputies safety.  Ibid.  We need not pause long in rejecting this unsound proposition.  When the deputies ordered respondents from their bed, they had no way of knowing whether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house.  The presence of some Caucasians in the residence did not eliminate the possibility that the suspects lived there as well.  As the deputies stated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our society for people of different races to live together.  Just as people of different races live and work together, so too might they engage in joint criminal activity.  The deputies, who were searching a house where they believed a suspect might be armed, possessed authority to secure the premises before deciding whether to continue with the search.
In Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), this Court held that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.  Id., at 705.  In weighing whether the search in Summers was reasonable the Court first found that detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.  Id., at 703.  Against that interest, it balanced preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found; minimizing the risk of harm to the officers; and facilitating the orderly completion of the search.  Id., at 702703; see Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93 (2005).


In executing a search warrant officers may take reasonable action to secure the premises and to ensure their own safety and the efficacy of the search.  Id., at 98100; see also id., at 103 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Summers, supra, at 704705.  The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is an objective one.  Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 397 (1989) (addressing the reasonableness of a seizure of the person).  Unreasonable actions include the use of excessive force or restraints that cause unnecessary pain or are imposed for a prolonged and unnecessary period of time.  Mena, supra, at 100; Graham, supra, at 396399.


The orders by the police to the occupants, in the context of this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps necessary, to protect the safety of the deputies.  Blankets and bedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was known to own a firearm, factors which underscore this point.  The Constitution does not require an officer to ignore the possibility that an armed suspect may sleep with a weapon within reach.  The reports are replete with accounts of suspects sleeping close to weapons.  See United States v. Enslin, 327 F.3d 788, 791 (CA9 2003) (When [the suspect] put his hands in the air and began to sit up, his movement shifted the covers and the marshals could see a gun in the bed next to him); see also United States v. Jones, 336 F.3d 245, 248 (CA3 2003) (suspect kept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow while he slept); United States v. Hightower, 96 F.3d 211 (CA7 1996) (suspect kept a loaded five-shot handgun under his pillow); State v. Willis, 36,759KA, p.3 (La. App. 4/9/03), 843 So.2d 592, 595 (officers pulled back the bed covers and found a .38 caliber Model 10 Smith and Wesson revolver located near where defendants left hand had been); State v. Kypreos, 115 Wash. App. 207, 61 P.3d 352 (2002) (suspect kept a handgun in the bed).


The deputies needed a moment to secure the room and ensure that other persons were not close by or did not present a danger.  Deputies were not required to turn their backs to allow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing or to cover themselves with the sheets.  Rather, [t]he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.  Summers, 452 U. S., at 702703.


This is not to say, of course, that the deputies were free to force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless and standing for any longer than necessary.  We have recognized that special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention might render a search unreasonable.  See id., at 705, n. 21.  There is no accusation that the detention here was prolonged.  The deputies left the home less than 15 minutes after arriving.  The detention was shorter and less restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour handcuff detention upheld in Mena.  See 544 U. S., at 100.  And there is no allegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and Rettele from dressing longer than necessary to protect their safety.  Sadler was unclothed for no more than two minutes, and Rettele for only slightly more time than that.  Sadler testified that once the police were satisfied that no immediate threat was presented, they wanted us to get dressed and they were pressing us really fast to hurry up and get some clothes on.  Deposition of Judy Lorraine Sadler in No. CV0206262RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June 10, 2003), Doc. 26, Exh. 4, p. 55.


The Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue on probable cause, a standard well short of absolute certainty.  Valid warrants will issue to search the innocent, and people like Rettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the cost.  Officers executing search warrants on occasion enter a house when residents are engaged in private activity; and the resulting frustration, embarrassment, and humiliation may be real, as was true here.  When officers execute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to protect themselves from harm, however, the Fourth Amendment is not violated.


As respondents constitutional rights were not violated, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001).  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
Justice Souter would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.

After his discharge from employment with former Senator Dayton, appellee Hanson sued appellant, the Senators office (Office), invoking the District Courts jurisdiction under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (Act).  The court denied a motion to dismiss based on a claim of immunity under the Constitutions Speech or Debate Clause, and the D.C. Circuit affirmed.

05-1575|"SCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS v. LANDRIGAN aka HILL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 051575.Argued January 9, 2007Decided May 14, 2007
Respondent Landrigan refused to allow his counsel to present the testimony of his ex-wife and birth mother as mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing for a felony-murder conviction.  He also interrupted as counsel tried to proffer other evidence, and he told the Arizona trial judge he did not wish to present any mitigating evidence and to bring on the death penalty.  The court sentenced him to death, and the sentence was affirmed.  The state postconviction court rejected Landrigans claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct further investigation into mitigating circumstances, finding that he had instructed counsel at sentencing not to present any mitigating evidence at all.  Landrigan then filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U. S.C. 2254.  Exercising its discretion, the District Court refused to grant him an evidentiary hearing because he could not make out even a colorable ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  The en banc Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Landrigans counsels performance fell below the standard required by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.
Held:The District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Landrigan an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.615.
(a)The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) has not changed the basic rule that the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing is left to the district courts sound discretion, but it has changed the standards for granting federal habeas relief by prohibiting such relief unless a state courts adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this Court], 2254(d)(1), or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding, 2254(d)(2).  Because 2254s deferential standards control whether to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.  In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, a federal court must consider whether the hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petitions factual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.  It follows that if the record refutes the applicants factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.68.


(b)Contrary to the Ninth Circuits reasoning, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that, even with the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, Landrigan could not develop a factual record entitling him to federal habeas relief.  Pp.813.


(1)The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Arizona state courts findings that Landrigan had instructed his counsel not to offer any mitigating evidence took Landrigans sentencing colloquy out of context, amounting to an unreasonable determination of the facts.  However, the colloquys language plainly indicates that Landrigan told his counsel not to present any mitigating evidence, and the record conclusively dispels the Circuits conclusion that Landrigans statements referred to only his ex-wifes and birth mothers testimony.  On that record, the state courts determination that Landrigan refused to allow the presentation of any mitigating evidence was a reasonable determination of the facts.  Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that Landrigan could not overcome 2254(d)(2)s bar to granting federal habeas relief.  That court was entitled to conclude that regardless of what information counsel might have uncovered in his investigation, Landrigan would have interrupted and refused to allow him to present it.  Thus, it could conclude that because of his established recalcitrance, Landrigan could not demonstrate prejudice under Strickland even if granted an evidentiary hearing.  Pp.810.


(2)The Ninth Circuit also erred in finding two alternative reasons for its holding.  It concluded that the Arizona courts determination that Landrigans claims were frivolous and meritless was an unreasonable application of this Courts precedent, based on the belief, derived from Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, that his last minute decision to block testimony could not excuse his counsels failure to do an adequate investigation before sentencing.  However, this Court has never addressed a situation in which a client interferes with counsels efforts to present mitigating evidence to a sentencing court.  Thus, it was not objectively unreasonable for the Arizona postconviction court to conclude that a defendant who refused to allow any mitigating evidence to be presented could not establish Strickland prejudice based on his counsels failure to investigate further possible mitigating evidence.  The Ninth Circuit also found that the record does not indicate that Landrigans decision was informed and knowing, or that he understood its consequences.  This Court has never held that an informed and knowing requirement exists with respect to the decision to not introduce mitigating evidence.  But even assuming such a requirement exists in this case, Landrigan cannot benefit from it.  First, because he never developed his claim properly before the Arizona courts, 2254(e)(2) barred the District Court from granting an evidentiary hearing on that basis.  Second, his counsel told the sentencing court in Landrigans presence that he had carefully explained to Landrigan the importance of mitigating evidence in death penalty cases and his duty as counsel to disclose mitigating factors for consideration.  In light of Landrigans demonstrated propensity for interjecting himself into the proceedings, it is doubtful that he would have sat idly by while counsel lied about such discussions.  Third, it is apparent from Landrigans statement to the sentencing court to bring on the death penalty that he clearly understood the consequences of telling the judge that there were no relevant mitigating circumstances.  Pp.1113.


(c)The Ninth Circuit also erred in rejecting the District Courts finding that the poor quality of Landrigans alleged mitigating evidence prevented him from making a colorable prejudice claim.  Because most of the evidence that Landrigan now wishes to offer would have been offered by this birth mother and ex-wife had he allowed them to testify, and because the sentencing court had much of the evidence before it by way of counsels proffer, the District Court could reasonably conclude that any additional evidence would have made no difference in the sentencing.  Pp.1314.


(d)Even assuming the truth of all the facts Landrigan sought to prove at an evidentiary hearing, he still could not be granted federal habeas relief because the state courts factual determination that he would not have allowed counsel to present any mitigating evidence at sentencing is not an unreasonable determination of the facts under 2254(d)(2) and the mitigating evidence he seeks to introduce would not have changed the result.  Pp.1415.
441 F.3d 638, reversed and remanded.
Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Scalia, Kennedy, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

04-1350|"KSR INTERNATIONAL CO. v. TELEFLEX INC. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 041350.Argued November 28, 2006Decided April 30, 2007
To control a conventional automobiles speed, the driver depresses or releases the gas pedal, which interacts with the throttle via a cable or other mechanical link.  Because the pedals position in the footwell normally cannot be adjusted, a driver wishing to be closer or farther from it must either reposition himself in the seat or move the seat, both of which can be imperfect solutions for smaller drivers in cars with deep footwells.  This prompted inventors to design and patent pedals that could be adjusted to change their locations.  The Asano patent reveals a support structure whereby, when the pedal location is adjusted, one of the pedals pivot points stays fixed.  Asano is also designed so that the force necessary to depress the pedal is the same regardless of location adjustments.  The Redding patent reveals a different, sliding mechanism where both the pedal and the pivot point are adjusted.


In newer cars, computer-controlled throttles do not operate through force transferred from the pedal by a mechanical link, but open and close valves in response to electronic signals.  For the computer to know what is happening with the pedal, an electronic sensor must translate the mechanical operation into digital data.  Inventors had obtained a number of patents for such sensors.  The so-called 936 patent taught that it was preferable to detect the pedals position in the pedal mechanism, not in the engine, so the patent disclosed a pedal with an electronic sensor on a pivot point in the pedal assembly.  The Smith patent taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedals footpad.  Inventors had also patented self-contained modular sensors, which can be taken off the shelf and attached to any mechanical pedal to allow it to function with a computer-controlled throttle.  The 068 patent disclosed one such sensor.  Chevrolet also manufactured trucks using modular sensors attached to the pedal support bracket, adjacent to the pedal and engaged with the pivot shaft about which the pedal rotates.  Other patents disclose electronic sensors attached to adjustable pedal assemblies.  For example, the Rixon patent locates the sensor in the pedal footpad, but is known for wire chafing.


After petitioner KSR developed an adjustable pedal system for cars with cable-actuated throttles and obtained its 976 patent for the design, General Motors Corporation (GMC) chose KSR to supply adjustable pedal systems for trucks using computer-controlled throttles.  To make the 976 pedal compatible with the trucks, KSR added a modular sensor to its design.  Respondents (Teleflex) hold the exclusive license for the Engelgau patent, claim 4 of which discloses a position-adjustable pedal assembly with an electronic pedal position sensor attached a fixed pivot point.  Despite having denied a similar, broader claim, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had allowed claim 4 because it included the limitation of a fixed pivot position, which distinguished the design from Reddings.  Asano was neither included among the Engelgau patents prior art references nor mentioned in the patents prosecution, and the PTO did not have before it an adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point.  After learning of KSRs design for GMC, Teleflex sued for infringement, asserting that KSRs pedal system infringed the Engelgau patents claim 4.  KSR countered that claim 4 was invalid under 103 of the Patent Act, which forbids issuance of a patent when the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.


Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 1718, set out an objective analysis for applying 103: [T]he scope and content of the prior art are  determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are  ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.  Against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.  Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented.  While the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any particular case, the factors define the controlling inquiry.  However, seeking to resolve the obviousness question with more uniformity and consistency, the Federal Circuit has employed a teaching, suggestion, or motivation (TSM) test, under which a patent claim is only proved obvious if the prior art, the problems nature, or the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art reveals some motivation or suggestion to combine the prior art teachings.


The District Court granted KSR summary judgment.  After reviewing pedal design history, the Engelgau patents scope, and the relevant prior art, the court considered claim 4s validity, applying Grahams framework to determine whether under summary-judgment standards KSR had demonstrated that claim 4 was obvious.  The court found little difference between the prior arts teachings and claim 4: Asano taught everything contained in the claim except using a sensor to detect the pedals position and transmit it to a computer controlling the throttle.  That additional aspect was revealed in, e.g., the 068 patent and Chevrolets sensors.  The court then held that KSR satisfied the TSM test, reasoning (1) the state of the industry would lead inevitably to combinations of electronic sensors and adjustable pedals, (2) Rixon provided the basis for these developments, and (3) Smith taught a solution to Rixons chafing problems by positioning the sensor on the pedals fixed structure, which could lead to the combination of a pedal like Asano with a pedal position sensor.


Reversing, the Federal Circuit ruled the District Court had not applied the TSM test strictly enough, having failed to make findings as to the specific understanding or principle within a skilled artisans knowledge that would have motivated one with no knowledge of the invention to attach an electronic control to the Asano assemblys support bracket.  The Court of Appeals held that the District Courts recourse to the nature of the problem to be solved was insufficient because, unless the prior art references addressed the precise problem that the patentee was trying to solve, the problem would not motivate an inventor to look at those references.  The appeals court found that the Asano pedal was designed to ensure that the force required to depress the pedal is the same no matter how the pedal is adjusted, whereas Engelgau sought to provide a simpler, smaller, cheaper adjustable electronic pedal.  The Rixon pedal, said the court, suffered from chafing but was not designed to solve that problem and taught nothing helpful to Engelgaus purpose.  Smith, in turn, did not relate to adjustable pedals and did not necessarily go to the issue of motivation to attach the electronic control on the pedal assemblys support bracket.  So interpreted, the court held, the patents would not have led a person of ordinary skill to put a sensor on an Asano-like pedal.  That it might have been obvious to try that combination was likewise irrelevant.  Finally, the court held that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.
Held:The Federal Circuit addressed the obviousness question in a narrow, rigid manner that is inconsistent with 103 and this Courts precedents.  KSR provided convincing evidence that mounting an available sensor on a fixed pivot point of the Asano pedal was a design step well within the grasp of a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art and that the benefit of doing so would be obvious.  Its arguments, and the record, demonstrate that the Engelgau patents claim 4 is obvious.  Pp.1124.
1.Graham provided an expansive and flexible approach to the obviousness question that is inconsistent with the way the Federal Circuit applied its TSM test here.  Neither 103s enactment nor Grahams analysis disturbed the Courts earlier instructions concerning the need for caution in granting a patent based on the combination of elements found in the prior art.  See Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U. S. 147, 152.  Such a combination of familiar elements according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield predictable results.  See, e.g., United States v. Adams, 383 U. S. 39, 5052.  When a work is available in one field, design incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of it, either in the same field or in another.  If a person of ordinary skill in the art can implement a predictable variation, and would see the benefit of doing so, 103 likely bars its patentability.  Moreover, if a technique has been used to improve one device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same way, using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond that persons skill.  A court must ask whether the improvement is more than the predictable use of prior-art elements according to their established functions.  Following these principles may be difficult if the claimed subject matter involves more than the simple substitution of one known element for another or the mere application of a known technique to a piece of prior art ready for the improvement.  To determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the way a patent claims, it will often be necessary to look to interrelated teachings of multiple patents; to the effects of demands known to the design community or present in the marketplace; and to the background knowledge possessed by a person having ordinary skill in the art.  To facilitate review, this analysis should be made explicit.  But it need not seek out precise teachings directed to the challenged claims specific subject matter, for a court can consider the inferences and creative steps a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.  Pp.1114. 


(b)The TSM test captures a helpful insight: A patent composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each element was, independently, known in the prior art.  Although common sense directs caution as to a patent application claiming as innovation the combination of two known devices according to their established functions, it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the elements as the new invention does.  Inventions usually rely upon building blocks long since uncovered, and claimed discoveries almost necessarily will be combinations of what, in some sense, is already known.  Helpful insights, however, need not become rigid and mandatory formulas.  If it is so applied, the TSM test is incompatible with this Courts precedents.  The diversity of inventive pursuits and of modern technology counsels against confining the obviousness analysis by a formalistic conception of the words teaching, suggestion, and motivation, or by overemphasizing the importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents.  In many fields there may be little discussion of obvious techniques or combinations, and market demand, rather than scientific literature, may often drive design trends.  Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress and may, for patents combining previously known elements, deprive prior inventions of their value or utility.  Since the TSM test was devised, the Federal Circuit doubtless has applied it in accord with these principles in many cases.  There is no necessary inconsistency between the test and the Graham analysis.  But a court errs where, as here, it transforms general principle into a rigid rule limiting the obviousness inquiry.   Pp.1415.


(c)The flaws in the Federal Circuits analysis relate mostly to its narrow conception of the obviousness inquiry consequent in its application of the TSM test.  The Circuit first erred in holding that courts and patent examiners should look only to the problem the patentee was trying to solve.  Under the correct analysis, any need or problem known in the field and addressed by the patent can provide a reason for combining the elements in the manner claimed.  Second, the appeals court erred in assuming that a person of ordinary skill in the art attempting to solve a problem will be led only to those prior art elements designed to solve the same problem.  The court wrongly concluded that because Asanos primary purpose was solving the constant ratio problem, an inventor considering how to put a sensor on an adjustable pedal would have no reason to consider putting it on the Asano pedal.  It is common sense that familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes, and a person of ordinary skill often will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle.  Regardless of Asanos primary purpose, it provided an obvious example of an adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point, and the prior art was replete with patents indicating that such a point was an ideal mount for a sensor.  Third, the court erred in concluding that a patent claim cannot be proved obvious merely by showing that the combination of elements was obvious to try.  When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill in the art has good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp.  If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.  Finally, the court drew the wrong conclusion from the risk of courts and patent examiners falling prey to hindsight bias.  Rigid preventative rules that deny recourse to common sense are neither necessary under, nor consistent with, this Courts case law.  Pp.1518.


2.Application of the foregoing standards demonstrates that claim 4 is obvious.  Pp.1823. 


(a)The Court rejects Teleflexs argument that the Asano pivot mechanisms design prevents its combination with a sensor in the manner claim 4 describes.  This argument was not raised before the District Court, and it is unclear whether it was raised before the Federal Circuit.  Given the significance of the District Courts finding that combining Asano with a pivot-mounted pedal position sensor fell within claim 4s scope, it is apparent that Teleflex would have made clearer challenges if it intended to preserve this claim.  Its failure to clearly raise the argument, and the appeals courts silence on the issue, lead this Court to accept the District Courts conclusion.  Pp.1820.


(b)The District Court correctly concluded that when Engelgau designed the claim 4 subject matter, it was obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine Asano with a pivot-mounted pedal position sensor.  There then was a marketplace creating a strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior art taught a number of methods for doing so.  The Federal Circuit considered the issue too narrowly by, in effect, asking whether a pedal designer writing on a blank slate would have chosen both Asano and a modular sensor similar to the ones used in the Chevrolet trucks and disclosed in the 068 patent.  The proper question was whether a pedal designer of ordinary skill in the art, facing the wide range of needs created by developments in the field, would have seen an obvious benefit to upgrading Asano with a sensor.  For such a designer starting with Asano, the question was where to attach the sensor.  The 936 patent taught the utility of putting the sensor on the pedal device.  Smith, in turn, explained not to put the sensor on the pedal footpad, but instead on the structure.  And from Rixons known wire-chafing problems, and Smiths teaching that the pedal assemblies must not precipitate any motion in the connecting wires, the designer would know to place the sensor on a nonmoving part of the pedal structure.  The most obvious such point is a pivot point.  The designer, accordingly, would follow Smith in mounting the sensor there.  Just as it was possible to begin with the objective to upgrade Asano to work with a computer-controlled throttle, so too was it possible to take an adjustable electronic pedal like Rixon and seek an improvement that would avoid the wire-chafing problem.  Teleflex has not shown anything in the prior art that taught away from the use of Asano, nor any secondary factors to dislodge the determination that claim 4 is obvious.  Pp.2023.


3.The Court disagrees with the Federal Circuits holding that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.  The ultimate judgment of obviousness is a legal determination.  Graham, 383 U. S., at 17.  Where, as here, the prior arts content, the patent claims scope, and the level of ordinary skill in the art are not in material dispute and the claims obviousness is apparent, summary judgment is appropriate.  P.23.

			"|"KSR INTERNATIONAL CO. v. TELEFLEX INC. etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 041350.Argued November 28, 2006Decided April 30, 2007
To control a conventional automobiles speed, the driver depresses or releases the gas pedal, which interacts with the throttle via a cable or other mechanical link.  Because the pedals position in the footwell normally cannot be adjusted, a driver wishing to be closer or farther from it must either reposition himself in the seat or move the seat, both of which can be imperfect solutions for smaller drivers in cars with deep footwells.  This prompted inventors to design and patent pedals that could be adjusted to change their locations.  The Asano patent reveals a support structure whereby, when the pedal location is adjusted, one of the pedals pivot points stays fixed.  Asano is also designed so that the force necessary to depress the pedal is the same regardless of location adjustments.  The Redding patent reveals a different, sliding mechanism where both the pedal and the pivot point are adjusted.


In newer cars, computer-controlled throttles do not operate through force transferred from the pedal by a mechanical link, but open and close valves in response to electronic signals.  For the computer to know what is happening with the pedal, an electronic sensor must translate the mechanical operation into digital data.  Inventors had obtained a number of patents for such sensors.  The so-called 936 patent taught that it was preferable to detect the pedals position in the pedal mechanism, not in the engine, so the patent disclosed a pedal with an electronic sensor on a pivot point in the pedal assembly.  The Smith patent taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedals footpad.  Inventors had also patented self-contained modular sensors, which can be taken off the shelf and attached to any mechanical pedal to allow it to function with a computer-controlled throttle.  The 068 patent disclosed one such sensor.  Chevrolet also manufactured trucks using modular sensors attached to the pedal support bracket, adjacent to the pedal and engaged with the pivot shaft about which the pedal rotates.  Other patents disclose electronic sensors attached to adjustable pedal assemblies.  For example, the Rixon patent locates the sensor in the pedal footpad, but is known for wire chafing.


After petitioner KSR developed an adjustable pedal system for cars with cable-actuated throttles and obtained its 976 patent for the design, General Motors Corporation (GMC) chose KSR to supply adjustable pedal systems for trucks using computer-controlled throttles.  To make the 976 pedal compatible with the trucks, KSR added a modular sensor to its design.  Respondents (Teleflex) hold the exclusive license for the Engelgau patent, claim 4 of which discloses a position-adjustable pedal assembly with an electronic pedal position sensor attached a fixed pivot point.  Despite having denied a similar, broader claim, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had allowed claim 4 because it included the limitation of a fixed pivot position, which distinguished the design from Reddings.  Asano was neither included among the Engelgau patents prior art references nor mentioned in the patents prosecution, and the PTO did not have before it an adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point.  After learning of KSRs design for GMC, Teleflex sued for infringement, asserting that KSRs pedal system infringed the Engelgau patents claim 4.  KSR countered that claim 4 was invalid under 103 of the Patent Act, which forbids issuance of a patent when the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.


Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 1718, set out an objective analysis for applying 103: [T]he scope and content of the prior art are  determined; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are  ascertained; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved.  Against this background the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter is determined.  Such secondary considerations as commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, failure of others, etc., might be utilized to give light to the circumstances surrounding the origin of the subject matter sought to be patented.  While the sequence of these questions might be reordered in any particular case, the factors define the controlling inquiry.  However, seeking to resolve the obviousness question with more uniformity and consistency, the Federal Circuit has employed a teaching, suggestion, or motivation (TSM) test, under which a patent claim is only proved obvious if the prior art, the problems nature, or the knowledge of a person having ordinary skill in the art reveals some motivation or suggestion to combine the prior art teachings.


The District Court granted KSR summary judgment.  After reviewing pedal design history, the Engelgau patents scope, and the relevant prior art, the court considered claim 4s validity, applying Grahams framework to determine whether under summary-judgment standards KSR had demonstrated that claim 4 was obvious.  The court found little difference between the prior arts teachings and claim 4: Asano taught everything contained in the claim except using a sensor to detect the pedals position and transmit it to a computer controlling the throttle.  That additional aspect was revealed in, e.g., the 068 patent and Chevrolets sensors.  The court then held that KSR satisfied the TSM test, reasoning (1) the state of the industry would lead inevitably to combinations of electronic sensors and adjustable pedals, (2) Rixon provided the basis for these developments, and (3) Smith taught a solution to Rixons chafing problems by positioning the sensor on the pedals fixed structure, which could lead to the combination of a pedal like Asano with a pedal position sensor.

05-1056|"MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 051056.Argued February 21, 2007Decided April 30, 2007
It is the general rule under United States patent law that no infringement occurs when a patented product is made and sold in another country.  There is an exception.  Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one suppl[ies]  from the United States, for combination abroad, a patented inventions components.  35 U. S.C. 271(f)(1).  This case concerns the applicability of 271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.


AT&T holds a patent on a computer used to digitally encode and compress recorded speech.  Microsofts Windows operating system has the potential to infringe that patent because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by the patent.  Microsoft sells Windows to foreign manufacturers who install the software onto the computers they sell.  Microsoft sends each manufacturer a master version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission, which the manufacturer uses to generate copies.  Those copies, not the master version sent by Microsoft, are installed on the foreign manufacturers computers.  The foreign-made computers are then sold to users abroad.


AT&T filed an infringement suit charging Microsoft with liability for the foreign installations of Windows.  By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT&T contended, Microsoft supplie[d]  from the United States, for combination abroad, components of AT&Ts patented speech-processing computer, and, accordingly, was liable under 271(f).  Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a component of an invention under 271(f).  Microsoft also urged that the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not supplie[d]  from the United States.  Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under 271(f), and a divided Federal Circuit panel affirmed.  
Held:Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies of Windows installed on the foreign-made computers in question, Microsoft does not suppl[y]  from the United States components of those computers, and therefore is not liable under 271(f) as currently written.  Pp.719.
(a)A copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a component under 271(f).  Section 271(f) attaches liability to the supply abroad of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components.  271(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The provision thus applies only to such components as are combined to form the patented invention at issuehere, AT&Ts speech-processing computer.  Until expressed as a computer-readable copy, e.g., on a CD-ROM, Windowsindeed any software detached from an activating mediumremains uncombinable.  It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer.  Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match 271(f)s categorization: components amenable to combination.  Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is informationa detailed set of instructionsand thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything else containing design information).  A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component.  


The fact that it is easy to encode softwares instructions onto a computer-readable medium does not counsel a different answer.  The copy-producing step is what renders software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the extra step is essential.  Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device.  Those tools are not, however, components of the devices in which the parts are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term component.  Congress might have included within 271(f)s compass, for example, not only a patented inventions combinable components, but also information, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.  It did not.  Pp.912. 


(b)Microsoft did not suppl[y]  from the United States the foreign-made copies of Windows installed on the computers here involved.  Under a conventional reading of 271(f)s text, those copies were supplie[d] from outside the United States.  The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that for software components, the act of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying.  A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from exact copies, generated easily, inexpensively, and swiftly from the master.  Hence, sending a single copy of software abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes 271(f) liability for the foreign-made copies.  Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that supplying is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent copying, replicating, or reproducingin effect, manufacturing.  He further observed that the only true difference between software components and physical components of other patented inventions is that copies of software are easier to make and transport.  But nothing in 271(f)s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement.  The Court agrees.  Under 271(f)s text, the very components supplied from the United States, and not foreign-made copies thereof, trigger liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue.   While copying software abroad is indeed easy and inexpensive, the same can be said of other items, such as keys copied from a master.  Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless supplie[d]  from the United States.  The absence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master dispatched from the United States supplies the foreign-made copies from this country.  Pp.1214.


(c)Any doubt that Microsofts conduct falls outside 271(f)s compass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Foreign conduct is generally the domain of foreign law, and in the patent area, that law may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public.  Applied here, the presumption tugs strongly against construing 271(f) to encompass as a component not only a physical copy of software, but also softwares intangible code, and to render supplie[d]  from the United States not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.  Foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries.  If AT&T desires to prevent copying abroad, its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents.  Pp.1416.


(d)While reading 271(f) to exclude from coverage foreign-made copies of software may create a loophole in favor of software makers, the Court is not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of 271(f) is in order; the loophole is properly left for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such action warranted.  Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in U. S. patent law revealed by Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U. S. 518, where the items exported were kits containing all the physical, readily assemblable parts of a machine (not an intangible set of instructions), and those parts themselves (not foreign-made copies of them) would be combined abroad by foreign buyers.  Having attended to that gap, Congress did not address other arguable gaps, such as the loophole AT&T describes.  Given the expanded extraterritorial thrust AT&Ts reading of 271(f) entails, the patent-protective determination AT&T seeks must be left to Congress. Cf. Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, 431.  Congress is doubtless aware of the ease with which electronic media such as software can be copied, and has not left the matter untouched.  See the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U. S.C. 1201 et seq.

			"|"MICROSOFT CORP. v. AT&T CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 051056.Argued February 21, 2007Decided April 30, 2007
It is the general rule under United States patent law that no infringement occurs when a patented product is made and sold in another country.  There is an exception.  Section 271(f) of the Patent Act, adopted in 1984, provides that infringement does occur when one suppl[ies]  from the United States, for combination abroad, a patented inventions components.  35 U. S.C. 271(f)(1).  This case concerns the applicability of 271(f) to computer software first sent from the United States to a foreign manufacturer on a master disk, or by electronic transmission, then copied by the foreign recipient for installation on computers made and sold abroad.


AT&T holds a patent on a computer used to digitally encode and compress recorded speech.  Microsofts Windows operating system has the potential to infringe that patent because Windows incorporates software code that, when installed, enables a computer to process speech in the manner claimed by the patent.  Microsoft sells Windows to foreign manufacturers who install the software onto the computers they sell.  Microsoft sends each manufacturer a master version of Windows, either on a disk or via encrypted electronic transmission, which the manufacturer uses to generate copies.  Those copies, not the master version sent by Microsoft, are installed on the foreign manufacturers computers.  The foreign-made computers are then sold to users abroad.


AT&T filed an infringement suit charging Microsoft with liability for the foreign installations of Windows.  By sending Windows to foreign manufacturers, AT&T contended, Microsoft supplie[d]  from the United States, for combination abroad, components of AT&Ts patented speech-processing computer, and, accordingly, was liable under 271(f).  Microsoft responded that unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a component of an invention under 271(f).  Microsoft also urged that the foreign-generated copies of Windows actually installed abroad were not supplie[d]  from the United States.  Rejecting these responses, the District Court held Microsoft liable under 271(f), and a divided Federal Circuit panel affirmed.  
Held:Because Microsoft does not export from the United States the copies of Windows installed on the foreign-made computers in question, Microsoft does not suppl[y]  from the United States components of those computers, and therefore is not liable under 271(f) as currently written.  Pp.719.
(a)A copy of Windows, not Windows in the abstract, qualifies as a component under 271(f).  Section 271(f) attaches liability to the supply abroad of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components.  271(f)(1) (emphasis added).  The provision thus applies only to such components as are combined to form the patented invention at issuehere, AT&Ts speech-processing computer.  Until expressed as a computer-readable copy, e.g., on a CD-ROM, Windowsindeed any software detached from an activating mediumremains uncombinable.  It cannot be inserted into a CD-ROM drive or downloaded from the Internet; it cannot be installed or executed on a computer.  Abstract software code is an idea without physical embodiment, and as such, it does not match 271(f)s categorization: components amenable to combination.  Windows abstracted from a tangible copy no doubt is informationa detailed set of instructionsand thus might be compared to a blueprint (or anything else containing design information).  A blueprint may contain precise instructions for the construction and combination of the components of a patented device, but it is not itself a combinable component.  


The fact that it is easy to encode softwares instructions onto a computer-readable medium does not counsel a different answer.  The copy-producing step is what renders software a usable, combinable part of a computer; easy or not, the extra step is essential.  Moreover, many tools may be used easily and inexpensively to generate the parts of a device.  Those tools are not, however, components of the devices in which the parts are incorporated, at least not under any ordinary understanding of the term component.  Congress might have included within 271(f)s compass, for example, not only a patented inventions combinable components, but also information, instructions, or tools from which those components readily may be generated.  It did not.  Pp.912. 


(b)Microsoft did not suppl[y]  from the United States the foreign-made copies of Windows installed on the computers here involved.  Under a conventional reading of 271(f)s text, those copies were supplie[d] from outside the United States.  The Federal Circuit majority concluded, however, that for software components, the act of copying is subsumed in the act of supplying.  A master sent abroad, the majority observed, differs not at all from exact copies, generated easily, inexpensively, and swiftly from the master.  Hence, sending a single copy of software abroad with the intent that it be replicated invokes 271(f) liability for the foreign-made copies.  Judge Rader, dissenting, noted that supplying is ordinarily understood to mean an activity separate and distinct from any subsequent copying, replicating, or reproducingin effect, manufacturing.  He further observed that the only true difference between software components and physical components of other patented inventions is that copies of software are easier to make and transport.  But nothing in 271(f)s text, Judge Rader maintained, renders ease of copying a relevant, no less decisive, factor in triggering liability for infringement.  The Court agrees.  Under 271(f)s text, the very components supplied from the United States, and not foreign-made copies thereof, trigger liability when combined abroad to form the patented invention at issue.   While copying software abroad is indeed easy and inexpensive, the same can be said of other items, such as keys copied from a master.  Section 271(f) contains no instruction to gauge when duplication is easy and cheap enough to deem a copy in fact made abroad nevertheless supplie[d]  from the United States.  The absence of anything addressing copying in the statutory text weighs against a judicial determination that replication abroad of a master dispatched from the United States supplies the foreign-made copies from this country.  Pp.1214.


(c)Any doubt that Microsofts conduct falls outside 271(f)s compass would be resolved by the presumption against extraterritoriality.  Foreign conduct is generally the domain of foreign law, and in the patent area, that law may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public.  Applied here, the presumption tugs strongly against construing 271(f) to encompass as a component not only a physical copy of software, but also softwares intangible code, and to render supplie[d]  from the United States not only exported copies of software, but also duplicates made abroad.  Foreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries.  If AT&T desires to prevent copying abroad, its remedy lies in obtaining and enforcing foreign patents.  Pp.1416.


(d)While reading 271(f) to exclude from coverage foreign-made copies of software may create a loophole in favor of software makers, the Court is not persuaded that dynamic judicial interpretation of 271(f) is in order; the loophole is properly left for Congress to consider, and to close if it finds such action warranted.  Section 271(f) was a direct response to a gap in U. S. patent law revealed by Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.

05-1345|"UNITED HAULERS ASSOCIATION, INC., etal. v. ONEIDA-HERKIMER SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 051345.Argued January 8, 2007Decided April 30, 2007
Traditionally, municipalities in respondent Counties disposed of their own solid wastes, often via landfills that operated without permits and in violation of state regulations.  Facing an environmental crisis and an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, the Counties requested and the State created respondent Authority.  The Counties and the Authority agreed that the Authority would manage all solid waste in the Counties.  Private haulers could pick up citizens trash, but the Authority would process, sort, and send it off for disposal.  The Authority would also provide other services, including recycling.  If the Authoritys operating costs and debt service were not recouped through the tipping fees it charged, the Counties must make up the difference.  To avoid such liability, the Counties enacted flow control ordinances requiring private haulers to obtain permits to collect solid waste in the Counties and to deliver the waste to the Authoritys sites.


Petitioners, a trade association and individual haulers, filed suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983, alleging that the flow control ordinances violate the Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce.  They submitted evidence that without the ordinances and the associated tipping fees, they could dispose of solid waste at out-of-state facilities for far less.  Ruling in the haulers favor, the District Court held that nearly all flow control laws had been categorically rejected in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511 U. S. 383, where this Court held that an ordinance forcing haulers to deliver waste to a particular private facility discriminated against interstate commerce.  Reversing, the Second Circuit held that Carbone and other of this Courts so-called dormant Commerce Clause precedents allow for a distinction between laws that benefit public, as opposed to private, facilities.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.  
261 F.3d 245 and 438 F.3d 150, affirmed.
The Chief Justice delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IIA, IIB, and IIC, concluding that the Counties flow control ordinances, which treat in-state private business interests exactly the same as out-of-state ones, do not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Pp.613.


(a)To determine whether a law violates the dormant Commerce Clause, the Court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce.  In this context, discrimination simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99.  Discriminatory laws motivated by simple economic protectionism are subject to a virtually per se rule of invalidity, Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624, which can only be overcome by a showing that there is no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138.  P.6.  


(b)Carbone does not control this case.  Carbone involved a flow control ordinance requiring that all nonhazardous solid waste within a town be deposited, upon payment of an above-market tipping fee, at a transfer facility run by a private contractor under an agreement with the town.  See 511 U. S., at 387.  The dissent there opined that the ostensibly private transfer station was essentially a municipal facility, id., at 419, and that this distinction should have saved the ordinance because favoring local government is different from favoring a particular private company.  The majoritys failure to comment on the public-private distinction does not prove, as the haulers contend, that the majority agreed with the dissents characterization of the facility, but thought there was no difference under the dormant Commerce Clause between laws favoring private entities and those favoring public ones.  Rather, the Carbone majority avoided the issue because the transfer station was private, and therefore the question whether public facilities may be favored was not properly before the Court.  The majority viewed the ordinance as just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid, id., at 391, citing six local processing cases involving discrimination in favor of private enterprise.  If the Court were extending this line of cases to cover discrimination in favor of local government, it could be expected to have said so.  Thus, Carbone cannot be regarded as having decided the public-private question.  Pp.69. 


(c)The flow control ordinances in this case do not discriminate against interstate commerce.  Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors.  [A]ny notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities, General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298, whereas governments important responsibilities to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens set it apart from a typical private business, cf. id., at 313.  Moreover, in contrast to laws favoring in-state business over out-of-state competition, which are often the product of economic protectionism, laws favoring local government may be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism.  Here, the ordinances enable the Counties to pursue particular policies with respect to waste handling and treatment, while allocating the costs of those policies on citizens and businesses according to the volume of waste they generate.  The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government.  The Counties citizens could have left the entire matter of waste management services for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce.  But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort.  It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the voters decision in this regard. The Court is particularly hesitant to interfere here because waste disposal is typically and traditionally a function of local government exercising its police power.  Nothing in the Commerce Clause vests the responsibility for such a policy judgment with the Federal Judiciary.  Finally, while the Courts dormant Commerce Clause cases often find discrimination when the burden of state regulation falls on interests outside the State, the most palpable harm imposed by the ordinances at issuemore expensive trash removalwill likely fall upon the very people who voted for the laws, the Counties citizens.  There is no reason to step in and hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain through the political process.  Pp.1013.

05-1541|"EC TERM OF YEARS TRUST v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 051541.Argued February 26, 2007Decided April 30, 2007
Under 26 U. S.C. 7426(a)(1), if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) levies upon a third partys property to collect taxes owed by another, the third party may bring a wrongful levy action against the United States, so long as such action is brought before the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy, 6532(c)(1).  In contrast, the limitations period for a tax refund action under 28 U. S.C. 1346(a)(1) begins with an administrative claim that may be filed within at least two years, and may be brought to court within another two years after an administrative denial.  The IRS levied on a bank account in which petitioner (Trust) had deposited funds because the IRS assumed that the Trusts creators had transferred assets to the Trust to evade taxes.  The bank responded with a check to the Treasury.  Almost a year later, the Trust and others brought a 7426(a)(1) action claiming wrongful levies, but the District Court dismissed the complaint because it was filed after the 9-month limitations period had expired.  After unsuccessfully pursing a tax refund at the administrative level, the Trust filed a refund action under 1346(a)(1).  The District Court held that a wrongful levy claim under 7426(a)(1) was the sole remedy possible and dismissed, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The Trust missed 7426(a)(1)s deadline for challenging a levy, and may not bring the challenge as a tax refund claim under 1346(a)(1).  Section 7426(a)(1) provides the exclusive remedy for third-party wrongful levy claims.  [A] precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies,  Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 834, and it braces the preemption claim when resort to a general remedy would effectively extend the limitations period for the specific one, see id., at 833.  If third parties could avail themselves of 1346(a)(1)s general tax refund jurisdiction, they could effortlessly evade 7426(a)(1)s much shorter limitations period.  The Trust argues that, because United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, construed 1346(a)(1)s general jurisdictional grant expansively enough to cover third parties wrongful levy claims, treating 7426(a)(1) as the exclusive avenue for these claims would amount to a disfavored holding that 7426(a)(1) implicitly repealed 1346(a)(1)s pre-existing jurisdictional grant.  But this reads Williams too broadly.  Williams involved a lien and was decided on the specific understanding that no other remedy was open to the plaintiff.  Here, the Trust challenges a levy and could have made a timely claim under 7426(a)(1).  Even if the presumption against implied repeals applied here, 7426(a)(1)s 9-month limitations period cannot be reconciled with the notion that the same challenge would be open under 1346(a)(1) for up to four years.  Nor can the two statutory schemes be harmonized by construing 7426(a)(1)s filing deadline to cover only those actions seeking predeprivation remedies unavailable under 1346(a)(1).  On its face, 7426(a)(1) applies to predeprivation and postdeprivation claims alike.  Pp.47.
434 F.3d 807, affirmed.

But this reads Williams too broadly.  Williams involved a lien and was decided on the specific understanding that no other remedy was open to the plaintiff.  Here, the Trust challenges a levy and could have made a timely claim under 7426(a)(1).  Even if the presumption against implied repeals applied here, 7426(a)(1)s 9-month limitations period cannot be reconciled with the notion that the same challenge would be open under 1346(a)(1) for up to four years.  Nor can the two statutory schemes be harmonized by construing 7426(a)(1)s filing deadline to cover only those actions seeking predeprivation remedies unavailable under 1346(a)(1).  On its face, 7426(a)(1) applies to predeprivation and postdeprivation claims alike.  Pp.47.

No. 051631.Argued February 26, 2007Decided April 30, 2007
Deputy Timothy Scott, petitioner here, terminated a high-speed pursuit of respondents car by applying his push bumper to the rear of the vehicle, causing it to leave the road and crash.  Respondent was rendered quadriplegic.  He filed suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983 alleging, inter alia, the use of excessive force resulting in an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court denied Scotts summary judgment motion, which was based on qualified immunity.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on interlocutory appeal, concluding, inter alia, that Scotts actions could constitute deadly force under Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1; that the use of such force in this context would violate respondents constitutional right to be free from excessive force during a seizure; and that a reasonable jury could so find.
Held:Because the car chase respondent initiated posed a substantial and immediate risk of serious physical injury to others, Scotts attempt to terminate the chase by forcing respondent off the road was reasonable, and Scott is entitled to summary judgment.  Pp.313.
(a)Qualified immunity requires resolution of a threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officers conduct violated a constitutional right?  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201.  Pp.34. 


(b)The record in this case includes a videotape capturing the events in question.

(c)Viewing the facts in the light depicted by the videotape, it is clear that Deputy Scott did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Pp.813. 


(i)Garner did not establish a magical on/off switch that triggers rigid preconditions whenever an officers actions constitute deadly force.  The Court there simply applied the Fourth Amendments reasonableness test to the use of a particular type of force in a particular situation.  That case has scant applicability to this one, which has vastly different facts.  Whether or not Scotts actions constituted deadly force, what matters is whether those actions were reasonable.  Pp.810. 


(ii)In determining a seizures reasonableness, the Court balances the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individuals Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests allegedly justifying the intrusion.  United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696, 703.  In weighing the high likelihood of serious injury or death to respondent that Scotts actions posed against the actual and imminent threat that respondent posed to the lives of others, the Court takes account of the number of lives at risk and the relative culpability of the parties involved.  Respondent intentionally placed himself and the public in danger by unlawfully engaging in reckless, high-speed flight; those who might have been harmed had Scott not forced respondent off the road were entirely innocent.  The Court concludes that it was reasonable for Scott to take the action he did.  It rejects respondents argument that safety could have been assured if the police simply ceased their pursuit.

05-380|"GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. CARHART etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 05380.Argued November 8, 2006Decided April 18, 2007
Following this Courts Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U. S. 914, decision that Nebraskas partial birth abortion statute violated the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, and Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Act) to proscribe a particular method of ending fetal life in the later stages of pregnancy.  The Act does not regulate the most common abortion procedures used in the first trimester of pregnancy, when the vast majority of abortions take place.  In the usual second-trimester procedure, dilation and evacuation (D&E), the doctor dilates the cervix and then inserts surgical instruments into the uterus and maneuvers them to grab the fetus and pull it back through the cervix and vagina.  The fetus is usually ripped apart as it is removed, and the doctor may take 10 to 15 passes to remove it in its entirety.  The procedure that prompted the federal Act and various state statutes, including Nebraskas, is a variation of the standard D&E, and is herein referred to as intact D&E.  The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D&E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes, pulling out its entire body instead of ripping it apart.  In order to allow the head to pass through the cervix, the doctor typically pierces or crushes the skull.


The Act responded to Stenberg in two ways.  First, Congress found that unlike this Court in Stenberg, it was not required to accept the District Courts factual findings, and that that there was a moral, medical, and ethical consensus that partial-birth abortion is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.  Second, the Acts language differs from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in Stenberg.  Among other things, the Act prohibits knowingly perform[ing] a partial-birth abortion that is [not] necessary to save the life of a mother, 18 U. S.C. 1531(a).  It defines partial-birth abortion, 1531(b)(1), as a procedure in which the doctor: (A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the [mothers] body  , or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the [mothers] body  , for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and (B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the fetus.


In No. 05380, respondent abortion doctors challenged the Acts constitutionality on its face, and the Federal District Court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting petitioner Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable.  The court found the Act unconstitutional because it (1) lacked an exception allowing the prohibited procedure where necessary for the mothers health and (2) covered not merely intact D&E but also other D&Es.  Affirming, the Eighth Circuit found that a lack of consensus existed in the medical community as to the banned procedures necessity, and thus Stenberg required legislatures to err on the side of protecting womens health by including a health exception.  In No. 051382, respondent abortion advocacy groups brought suit challenging the Act.  The District Court enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act, concluding it was unconstitutional on its face because it (1) unduly burdened a womans ability to choose a second-trimester abortion, (2) was too vague, and (3) lacked a health exception as required by Stenberg.  The Ninth Circuit agreed and affirmed.  
Held:Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a womans right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception.  Pp.1439.
1.The Casey Court reaffirmed what it termed Roes three-part essential holding:First, a woman has the right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.  Second, the State has the power to restrict abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies endangering the womans life or health.  And third, the State has legitimate interests from the pregnancys outset in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.  505 U. S., at 846.  Though all three are implicated here, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion.  In deciding whether the Act furthers the Governments legitimate interest in protecting fetal life, the Court assumes, inter alia,  that an undue burden on the previability abortion right exists if a regulations purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the [womans] path, id., at 878, but that [r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State  may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the womans exercise of the right to choose, id., at 877.  Casey struck a balance that was central to its holding, and the Court applies Caseys standard here.  A central premise of Caseys joint opinionthat the government has a legitimate, substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal lifewould be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments below.  Pp.1416.


2.The Act, on its face, is not void for vagueness and does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth.  Pp.1626.


(a)The Acts text demonstrates that it regulates and proscribes performing the intact D&E procedure.  First, since the doctor must vaginally delive[r] a living fetus, 1531(b)(1)(A), the Act does not restrict abortions involving delivery of an expired fetus or those not involving vaginal delivery, e.g., hysterotomy or hysterectomy.  And it applies both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.  Second, because the Act requires the living fetus to be delivered to a specific anatomical landmark depending on the fetus presentation, ibid., an abortion not involving such partial delivery is permitted.  Third, because the doctor must perform an overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered fetus, 1531(b)(1)(B), the overt act must be separate from delivery.  It must also occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, since killing the partially delivered fetus, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been so delivered, ibid.  Fourth, given the Acts scienter requirements, delivery of a living fetus past an anatomical landmark by accident or inadvertence is not a crime because it is not deliberat[e] and intentiona[l], 1531(b)(1)(A).  Nor is such a delivery prohibited if the fetus [has not] been delivered for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].  Ibid.  Pp.1618.


(b)The Act is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  It satisfies both requirements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  First, it provides doctors of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108, setting forth relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct and providing objective criteria to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure, Posters N Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511 U. S. 513, 525526.  Second, it does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357.  Its anatomical landmarks establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement, Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574, and its scienter requirements narrow the scope of its prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion, see Kolender, supra, at 358.  Respondents arbitrary enforcement arguments, furthermore, are somewhat speculative, since this is a preenforcement challenge.  Pp.1820.


(c)The Court rejects respondents argument that the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad.  Pp.2026.


(i)The Acts text discloses that it prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D&E.  Its dual prohibitions correspond with the steps generally undertaken in this procedure:The doctor (1) delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation, see 1531(b)(1)(A), and (2) proceeds to the overt act of piercing or crushing the fetal skull after the partial delivery, see 1531(b)(1)(B).  The Acts scienter requirements limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D&E, with the intent to undertake both steps at the outset.  The Act excludes most D&Es in which the doctor intends to remove the fetus in pieces from the outset.  This interpretation is confirmed by comparing the Act with the Nebraska statute in Stenberg.  There, the Court concluded that the statute encompassed D&E, which often involve[s] a physician pulling a substantial portion of a still living fetus  , say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus, 530 U. S., at 939, and rejected the Nebraska Attorney Generals limiting interpretation that the statutes reference to a procedure that kill[s] the unborn child was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole, id., at 943.  It is apparent Congress responded to these concerns because the Act adopts the phrase delivers a living fetus, 18 U. S.C. 1531(b)(1)(A), instead of delivering  a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, 530 U. S., at 938, thereby targeting extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces; identifies specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered, 1531(b)(1)(A), thereby clarifying that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited; requires the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially outside the [mothers] body, 1531(b)(1)(A), thereby establishing that delivering a substantial portion of the fetus into the vagina would not subject a doctor to criminal sanctions; and adds the overt-act requirement, 1531(b)(1), thereby making the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced).  Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance, see, e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575, extinguishes any lingering doubt.  Interpreting the Act not to prohibit standard D&E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.  Pp.2024.


(ii)Respondents contrary arguments are unavailing.  The contention that any D&E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Acts anatomical landmarks because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the procedure does not take account of the Acts intent requirements, which preclude liability for an accidental intact D&E.  The evidence supports the legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance, belying any claim that a standard D&E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D&E.  That many doctors begin every D&E with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible based on their belief that this is safer does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D&E might violate the Act, thereby imposing an undue burden.  It demonstrates only that those doctors must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to an anatomical landmark.  Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before such a delivery will prohibit the vast majority of D&E abortions.  Pp.2426.


3.The Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, does not impose a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions, as prohibited by the Casey plurality, 505 U. S., at 878.  Pp.2637.


(a)The contention that the Acts congressional purpose was to create such an obstacle is rejected.  The Acts stated purposes are protecting innocent human life from a brutal and inhumane procedure and protecting the medical communitys ethics and reputation.  The government undoubtedly has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 731.  Moreover, Casey reaffirmed that the government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman.  See, e.g., 505 U. S., at 873.  The Acts ban on abortions involving partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Governments objectives.  Congress determined that such abortions are similar to the killing of a newborn infant.  This Court has confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned.  Glucksberg, supra, at 732735, and n. 23.  The Act also recognizes that respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in a mothers love for her child.  Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision, Casey, 505 U. S., at 852853, which some women come to regret.  In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence, some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the abortion procedure to be used.  It is, however, precisely this lack of information that is of legitimate concern to the State.  Id., at 873.  The States interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.  The objection that the Act accomplishes little because the standard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than intact D&E, is unpersuasive.  It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&E, undermines the publics perception of the doctors appropriate role during delivery, and perverts the birth process.  Pp.2630.


(b)The Acts failure to allow the banned procedures use where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the [mothers] health, Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 327328, does not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right.  The Court assumes the Acts prohibition would be unconstitutional, under controlling precedents, if it subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks. Id., at 328.  Whether the Act creates such risks was, however, a contested factual question below: The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their positions.  The Courts precedents instruct that the Act can survive facial attack when this medical uncertainty persists.  See, e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 360, n.3.  This traditional rule is consistent with Casey, which confirms both that the State has an interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy, and that abortion doctors should be treated the same as other doctors.  Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.  Other considerations also support the Courts conclusion, including the fact that safe alternatives to the prohibited procedure, such as D&E, are available.  In addition, if intact D&E is truly necessary in some circumstances, a prior injection to kill the fetus allows a doctor to perform the procedure, given that the Acts prohibition only applies to the delivery of a living fetus, 18 U. S.C. 1531(b)(1)(A).  Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 7779, distinguished.  The Court rejects certain of the parties arguments.  On the one hand, the Attorney Generals contention that the Act should be upheld based on the congressional findings alone fails because some of the Acts recitations are factually incorrect and some of the important findings have been superseded.  Also unavailing, however, is respondents contention that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception if substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger womens health, Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 938.  Interpreting Stenberg as leaving no margin for legislative error in the face of medical uncertainty is too exacting a standard.  Marginal safety considerations, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence where, as here, the regulation is rational and pursues legitimate ends, and standard, safe medical options are available.  Pp.3137.


4.These facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance.  In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge.  Cf. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commn, 546 U. S. ___, ___.  This is the proper manner to protect the womans health if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.  No as-applied challenge need be brought if the Acts prohibition threatens a womans life, because the Act already contains a life exception.  18 U. S.C. 1531(a).  Pp.3739.

S. 914, decision that Nebraskas partial birth abortion statute violated the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, and Roe v.

2.The Act, on its face, is not void for vagueness and does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth.  Pp.1626.


(a)The Acts text demonstrates that it regulates and proscribes performing the intact D&E procedure.  First, since the doctor must vaginally delive[r] a living fetus, 1531(b)(1)(A), the Act does not restrict abortions involving delivery of an expired fetus or those not involving vaginal delivery, e.g., hysterotomy or hysterectomy.  And it applies both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb.  Second, because the Act requires the living fetus to be delivered to a specific anatomical landmark depending on the fetus presentation, ibid., an abortion not involving such partial delivery is permitted.  Third, because the doctor must perform an overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered fetus, 1531(b)(1)(B), the overt act must be separate from delivery.  It must also occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, since killing the partially delivered fetus, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been so delivered, ibid.  Fourth, given the Acts scienter requirements, delivery of a living fetus past an anatomical landmark by accident or inadvertence is not a crime because it is not deliberat[e] and intentiona[l], 1531(b)(1)(A).  Nor is such a delivery prohibited if the fetus [has not] been delivered for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].  Ibid.  Pp.1618.


(b)The Act is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.  It satisfies both requirements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  First, it provides doctors of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108, setting forth relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct and providing objective criteria to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure, Posters N Things, Ltd. v. United States, 511 U. S. 513, 525526.  Second, it does not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357.  Its anatomical landmarks establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement, Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 574, and its scienter requirements narrow the scope of its prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion, see Kolender, supra, at 358.  Respondents arbitrary enforcement arguments, furthermore, are somewhat speculative, since this is a preenforcement challenge.  Pp.1820.


(c)The Court rejects respondents argument that the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad.  Pp.2026.


(i)The Acts text discloses that it prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D&E.  Its dual prohibitions correspond with the steps generally undertaken in this procedure:The doctor (1) delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation, see 1531(b)(1)(A), and (2) proceeds to the overt act of piercing or crushing the fetal skull after the partial delivery, see 1531(b)(1)(B).  The Acts scienter requirements limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D&E, with the intent to undertake both steps at the outset.  The Act excludes most D&Es in which the doctor intends to remove the fetus in pieces from the outset.  This interpretation is confirmed by comparing the Act with the Nebraska statute in Stenberg.  There, the Court concluded that the statute encompassed D&E, which often involve[s] a physician pulling a substantial portion of a still living fetus  , say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus, 530 U. S., at 939, and rejected the Nebraska Attorney Generals limiting interpretation that the statutes reference to a procedure that kill[s] the unborn child was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole, id., at 943.  It is apparent Congress responded to these concerns because the Act adopts the phrase delivers a living fetus, 18 U. S.C. 1531(b)(1)(A), instead of delivering  a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, 530 U. S., at 938, thereby targeting extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces; identifies specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered, 1531(b)(1)(A), thereby clarifying that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited; requires the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially outside the [mothers] body, 1531(b)(1)(A), thereby establishing that delivering a substantial portion of the fetus into the vagina would not subject a doctor to criminal sanctions; and adds the overt-act requirement, 1531(b)(1), thereby making the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced).  Finally, the canon of constitutional avoidance, see, e.g., Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575, extinguishes any lingering doubt.  Interpreting the Act not to prohibit standard D&E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.  Pp.2024.


(ii)Respondents contrary arguments are unavailing.  The contention that any D&E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Acts anatomical landmarks because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the procedure does not take account of the Acts intent requirements, which preclude liability for an accidental intact D&E.  The evidence supports the legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance, belying any claim that a standard D&E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D&E.  That many doctors begin every D&E with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible based on their belief that this is safer does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D&E might violate the Act, thereby imposing an undue burden.  It demonstrates only that those doctors must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to an anatomical landmark.  Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before such a delivery will prohibit the vast majority of D&E abortions.  Pp.2426.


3.The Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, does not impose a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions, as prohibited by the Casey plurality, 505 U. S., at 878.  Pp.2637.


(a)The contention that the Acts congressional purpose was to create such an obstacle is rejected.  The Acts stated purposes are protecting innocent human life from a brutal and inhumane procedure and protecting the medical communitys ethics and reputation.  The government undoubtedly has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 731.  Moreover, Casey reaffirmed that the government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman.  See, e.g., 505 U. S., at 873.  The Acts ban on abortions involving partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Governments objectives.  Congress determined that such abortions are similar to the killing of a newborn infant.  This Court has confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned.  Glucksberg, supra, at 732735, and n. 23.  The Act also recognizes that respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in a mothers love for her child.  Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision, Casey, 505 U. S., at 852853, which some women come to regret.  In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence, some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the abortion procedure to be used.  It is, however, precisely this lack of information that is of legitimate concern to the State.  Id., at 873.  The States interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.  The objection that the Act accomplishes little because the standard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than intact D&E, is unpersuasive.  It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D&E, undermines the publics perception of the doctors appropriate role during delivery, and perverts the birth process.  Pp.2630.


(b)The Acts failure to allow the banned procedures use where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the [mothers] health, Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 327328, does not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right.  The Court assumes the Acts prohibition would be unconstitutional, under controlling precedents, if it subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks. Id., at 328.  Whether the Act creates such risks was, however, a contested factual question below: The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their positions.  The Courts precedents instruct that the Act can survive facial attack when this medical uncertainty persists.  See, e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 360, n.3.  This traditional rule is consistent with Casey, which confirms both that the State has an interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy, and that abortion doctors should be treated the same as other doctors.  Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts.  Other considerations also support the Courts conclusion, including the fact that safe alternatives to the prohibited procedure, such as D&E, are available.  In addition, if intact D&E is truly necessary in some circumstances, a prior injection to kill the fetus allows a doctor to perform the procedure, given that the Acts prohibition only applies to the delivery of a living fetus, 18 U. S.C. 1531(b)(1)(A).  Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 7779, distinguished.  The Court rejects certain of the parties arguments.  On the one hand, the Attorney Generals contention that the Act should be upheld based on the congressional findings alone fails because some of the Acts recitations are factually incorrect and some of the important findings have been superseded.  Also unavailing, however, is respondents contention that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception if substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger womens health, Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 938.  Interpreting Stenberg as leaving no margin for legislative error in the face of medical uncertainty is too exacting a standard.  Marginal safety considerations, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence where, as here, the regulation is rational and pursues legitimate ends, and standard, safe medical options are available.  Pp.3137.


4.These facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance.  In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge.  Cf. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Commn, 546 U. S. ___, ___.  This is the proper manner to protect the womans health if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.  No as-applied challenge need be brought if the Acts prohibition threatens a womans life, because the Act already contains a life exception.  18 U. S.C. 1531(a).  Pp.3739.

05-9264|"JAMES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 059264.Argued November 7, 2006Decided April 18, 2007
Pleading guilty to possessing a firearm after a felony conviction in violation of 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), petitioner James admitted to the three prior felony convictions listed in his federal indictment, including a Florida state-law conviction for attempted burglary.  The Government argued at sentencing that those convictions subjected James to the 15-year mandatory minimum prison term provided by the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 924(e), for an armed defendant who has three prior violent felony convictions.  James objected that his attempted burglary conviction was not for a violent felony.  The District Court held that it was, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, is a violent felony under ACCA.  Pp.220.  
(a)James argument that ACCAs text and structure categorically exclude attempt offenses is rejected.  Pp.27.


(i)Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines violent felony as any crime punishable by imprisonment for [more than] one year  that  (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against  another  or  (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  Florida law defined burglary when James was convicted as entering or remaining in a structure  with the intent to commit an offense therein, Fla. Stat. 810.02(1), and declared: A person who  does any act toward the commission of [an offense] but fails in the perpetration or  execution thereof, commits the offense of criminal attempt, 777.04(1).  The attempted burglary conviction at issue was punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.  The parties agree that it does not qualify as a violent felony under clause (i) of 924(e)(2)(B) or as one of the specific crimes enumerated in clause (ii).  For example, it is not burglary because it does not meet the definition of generic burglary found in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 598: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.  Thus, the question here is whether attempted burglary, as defined by Florida, falls within clause (ii)s residual provision for crimes that otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  Pp.23.


(ii)ACCAs text does not exclude attempt offenses from the residual provisions scope.  James claim that clause (i)s express inclusion of attempts, combined with clause (ii)s failure to mention them, demonstrates an intent to categorically exclude them from clause (ii) would unduly narrow the residual provision, which does not suggest any intent to exclude attempts that otherwise meet the statutory criteria.  See, e.g., Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U. S. 73, 80.  James also argues to no avail that, under the ejusdem generis canon, the residual provision must be read to extend only to completed offenses because the specifically enumerated offensesburglary, arson, extortion, and explosives crimesall have that common attribute.  Rather, the most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses is that, while not technically crimes against the person, they nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury to others, or of violent confrontation that could lead to such injury.  See e.g., Taylor, supra, at 597.  The inclusion of the residual provision indicates Congress intent that the preceding enumerated offenses not be an exhaustive list.  Pp.36.   


(iii)Nor does the legislative history exclude attempt offenses from ACCAs residual provision.  Whatever weight might ordinarily be given the Houses 1984 rejection of language that would have included attempted robbery and attempted burglary as ACCA predicate offenses, it is not probative here because the 1984 action was not Congress last word on the subject.  Since clause (ii)s residual provision was added to ACCA in 1988, Congress 1984 rejection of the language including attempt offenses is not dispositive.  Pp.67.  


(b)Attempted burglary, as defined by Florida law, involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another under the residual provision.  Under the categorical approach it has used for other ACCA offenses, the Court considers whether the offenses elements are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the particular offenders specific conduct.  See, e.g., Taylor, supra, at 602.  Pp.718.   


(i)On its face, Floridas attempt statute requires only that a defendant take any act toward the commission of burglary.  But because the Florida Supreme Courts Jones decision considerably narrowed the application of this broad language in the context of attempted burglary, requiring an overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure, merely preparatory activity posing no real danger of harm to others, e.g., acquiring burglars tools or casing a structure, is not enough.  Pp.89.   


(ii)Overt conduct directed toward unlawfully entering or remaining in a dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony therein, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another under the residual provision of clause (ii).  The clauses enumerated offenses provide one baseline from which to measure whether similar conduct satisfies the quoted language.  Here, the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses, completed burglary.  See Taylor, supra, at 600, n.9.  The main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering anothers property, but from the possibility that an innocent person might confront the burglar during the crime.  Attempted burglary poses the same kind of risk.  Indeed, that risk may be even greater than the risk posed by a typical completed burglary.  Many completed burglaries do not involve confrontations, but attempted burglaries often do.  Every Court of Appeals that has construed an attempted burglary law similar to Floridas has held that attempted burglary qualifies as a violent felony.  Support is also found in the U. S. Sentencing Commissions determination that a predicate crime of violence for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines career offender enhancement include[s]  attempting to commit [an] offens[e].  See Guidelines Manual 4B1.2, comment., n.1.  Pp.913.


(iii)Neither ACCA nor Taylor supports James argument that, under the categorical approach, attempted burglary cannot be treated as an ACCA predicate offense unless all cases present a risk of physical injury to others.  ACCA does not require such certainty, and James argument misapprehends Taylor, under which the proper inquiry is not whether every factual offense conceivably covered by a statute necessarily presents a serious potential risk of injury, but whether the conduct encompassed by the offenses elements, in the ordinary case, presents such a risk.  Pp.1315.  


(c)James argument that the scope of Floridas underlying burglary statute itself precludes treating attempted burglary as an ACCA predicate offense is not persuasive.  Although the state-law definition of [d]welling to include the curtilage thereof, Fla. Stat. 810.011(2), takes Floridas underlying burglary offense outside Taylors generic burglary definition, 495 U. S., at 598, that is not dispositive because the Government does not argue that James conviction constitutes burglary under ACCA.  Rather, it relies on the residual provision, whichas Taylor recognizedcan cover conduct outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.  Id., at 600, n.9.  The Florida Supreme Courts Hamilton decision construed curtilage narrowly, requiring some form of enclosure for the area surrounding a residence. A burglar illegally attempting to enter the curtilage around a dwelling creates much the same risk of confrontation as one attempting to enter the structure itself.  Pp.1820.  


(d)Because the Court is here engaging in statutory interpretation, not judicial factfinding, James argument that construing attempted burglary as a violent felony raises Sixth Amendment issues under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, lacks merit.  P.20.   
430 F.3d 1150, affirmed.

v. WACHOVIA BANK, N.A., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 051342.Argued November 29, 2006Decided April 17, 2007
National banks business activities are controlled by the National Bank Act (NBA), 12 U. S.C. 1 et seq., and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), see 24, 93a, 371(a).  OCC is charged with supervision of the NBA and, thus, oversees the banks operations and interactions with customers.  See NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251, 254, 256.  The NBA grants OCC, as part of its supervisory authority, visitorial powers to audit the banks books and records, largely to the exclusion of other state or federal entities.  See 484(a); 12 CFR 7.4000.  The NBA specifically authorizes federally chartered banks to engage in real estate lending, 12 U. S.C. 371, and [t]o exercise  such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking, 24 Seventh.  Among incidental powers, national banks may conduct certain activities through operating subsidiaries, discrete entities authorized to engage solely in activities the bank itself could undertake, and subject to the same terms and conditions as the bank.  See 24a(g)(3)(A); 12 CFR 5.34(e).


Respondent Wachovia Bank is an OCC-chartered national banking association that conducts its real estate lending business through respondent Wachovia Mortgage Corporation, a wholly owned, North Carolina-chartered entity licensed as an operating subsidiary by OCC, and doing business in Michigan and elsewhere.  Michigan law exempts banks, both national and state, from state mortgage lending regulation, but requires their subsidiaries to register with the States Office of Insurance and Financial Services (OIFS) and submit to state supervision.  Although Wachovia Mortgage initially complied with Michigans requirements, it surrendered its Michigan registration once it became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Wachovia Bank.  Subsequently, petitioner Watters, the OIFS Commissioner, advised Wachovia Mortgage it would no longer be authorized to engage in mortgage lending in Michigan.  Respondents sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the NBA and OCCs regulations preempt application of the relevant Michigan mortgage lending laws to a national banks operating subsidiary.  Watters responded that, because Wachovia Mortgage was not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan laws were applicable and were not preempted.  She also argued that the Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibits OCCs exclusive regulation and supervision of national banks lending activities conducted through operating subsidiaries.  Rejecting those arguments, the Federal District Court granted the Wachovia plaintiffs summary judgment in relevant part, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  
Held:

(a)The NBA vests in nationally chartered banks enumerated powers and all necessary incidental powers.  12 U. S.C. 24 Seventh.  To prevent inconsistent or intrusive state regulation, the NBA provides that [n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law  .  484(a).  Federally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or purposes of the NBA.  But when state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA, the States regulations must give way.  E.g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 3234.  The NBA expressly authorizes national banks to engage in mortgage lending, subject to OCC regulation, 371(a).  State law may not significantly burden a banks exercise of that power, see, e.g., Barnett Bank, 517 U. S., at 3334.  In particular, real estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control: The NBA specifically vests exclusive authority to examine and inspect in OCC.  12 U. S.C. 484(a).  The Michigan provisions at issue exempt national banks themselves from coverage.  This is not simply a matter of the Michigan Legislatures grace.  For, as the parties recognize, the NBA would spare a national bank from state controls of the kind here involved.  Pp.510.


(b)Since 1966, OCC has recognized national banks incidental authority under 24 Seventh to do business through operating subsidiaries.  See 12 CFR 5.34(e)(1).  That authority is uncontested by Michigans Commissioner.  OCC licenses and oversees national bank operating subsidiaries just as it does national banks.  See, e.g., 5.34(e)(3); 12 U. S.C. 24a(g)(3)(A).  Just as duplicative state examination, supervision, and regulation would significantly burden national banks mortgage lending, so too those state controls would interfere with that same activity when engaged in by a national banks operating subsidiary.  This Court has never held that the NBAs preemptive reach extends only to a national bank itself; instead, the Court has focused on the exercise of a national banks powers, not on its corporate structure, in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank.  See, e.g., Barnett Bank, 517 U. S., at 32. And the Court has treated operating subsidiaries as equivalent to national banks with respect to powers exercised under federal law (except where federal law provides otherwise).  See, e.g., NationsBank, 513 U. S., at 256251.  Security against significant interference by state regulators is a characteristic condition of the business of banking conducted by national banks, and mortgage lending is one aspect of that business.  See, e.g., 12 U. S.C. 484(a).  That security should adhere whether the business is conducted by the bank itself or by an OCC-licensed operating subsidiary whose authority to carry on the business coincides completely with the banks.  


Watters contends that if Congress meant to deny States visitorial powers over operating subsidiaries, it would have written 484(a)s ban on state inspection to apply not only to national banks but also to their affiliates.  She points out that 481, which authorizes OCC to examine affiliates of national banks, does not speak to state visitorial powers.  This argument fails for two reasons.  First, any intention regarding operating subsidiaries cannot be ascribed to the 1864 Congress that enacted 481 and 484, or the 1933 Congress that added the affiliate examination provisions to 481 and the affiliate definition to 221a, because operating subsidiaries were not authorized until 1966.  Second, Watters ignores the distinctions Congress recognized among affiliates.  Unlike affiliates that may engage in functions not authorized by the NBA, an operating subsidiary is tightly tied to its parent by the specification that it may engage only in the business of banking, 24a(g)(3)(A).  Notably, when Congress amended the NBA to provide that operating subsidiaries may engag[e] solely in activities that national banks are permitted to engage in directly, ibid., it did so in an Act providing that other affiliates, authorized to engage in nonbanking financial activities, e.g., securities and insurance, are subject to state regulation in connection with those activities.  See, e.g., 1843(k), 1844(c)(4).  Pp.1015.


(c)Recognizing the necessary consequence of national banks authority to engage in mortgage lending through an operating subsidiary subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of such activities by national banks, 24a(g)(3)(A), OCC promulgated 12 CFR 7.4006: Unless otherwise provided by Federal law or OCC regulation, State laws apply to national bank operating subsidiaries to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank.  Watters disputes OCCs authority to promulgate this regulation and contends that, because preemption is a legal question for determination by courts, 7.4006 should attract no deference.  This argument is beside the point, for 7.4006 merely clarifies and confirms what the NBA already conveys: A national bank may engage in real estate lending through an operating subsidiary, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the bank itself; that power cannot be significantly impaired or impeded by state law.  Though state law governs incorporation-related issues, state regulators cannot interfere with the business of banking by subjecting national banks or their OCC-licensed operating subsidiaries to multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes.  Pp.1517.


2.Watters alternative argument, that 12 CFR 7.4006 violates the Tenth Amendment, is unavailing.  The Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation to the States of a power delegated to Congress in the Constitution, New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156.  Because regulation of national bank operations is Congress prerogative under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses, see Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc., 539 U. S. 52, 58, the Amendment is not implicated here.  P.17.

v. WACHOVIA BANK, N.A., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 051342.Argued November 29, 2006Decided April 17, 2007
National banks business activities are controlled by the National Bank Act (NBA), 12 U. S.C. 1 et seq., and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), see 24, 93a, 371(a).  OCC is charged with supervision of the NBA and, thus, oversees the banks operations and interactions with customers.  See NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U. S. 251, 254, 256.  The NBA grants OCC, as part of its supervisory authority, visitorial powers to audit the banks books and records, largely to the exclusion of other state or federal entities.  See 484(a); 12 CFR 7.4000.  The NBA specifically authorizes federally chartered banks to engage in real estate lending, 12 U. S.C. 371, and [t]o exercise  such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking, 24 Seventh.  Among incidental powers, national banks may conduct certain activities through operating subsidiaries, discrete entities authorized to engage solely in activities the bank itself could undertake, and subject to the same terms and conditions as the bank.  See 24a(g)(3)(A); 12 CFR 5.34(e).


Respondent Wachovia Bank is an OCC-chartered national banking association that conducts its real estate lending business through respondent Wachovia Mortgage Corporation, a wholly owned, North Carolina-chartered entity licensed as an operating subsidiary by OCC, and doing business in Michigan and elsewhere.  Michigan law exempts banks, both national and state, from state mortgage lending regulation, but requires their subsidiaries to register with the States Office of Insurance and Financial Services (OIFS) and submit to state supervision.  Although Wachovia Mortgage initially complied with Michigans requirements, it surrendered its Michigan registration once it became a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Wachovia Bank.  Subsequently, petitioner Watters, the OIFS Commissioner, advised Wachovia Mortgage it would no longer be authorized to engage in mortgage lending in Michigan.  Respondents sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that the NBA and OCCs regulations preempt application of the relevant Michigan mortgage lending laws to a national banks operating subsidiary.  Watters responded that, because Wachovia Mortgage was not itself a national bank, the challenged Michigan laws were applicable and were not preempted.  She also argued that the Tenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibits OCCs exclusive regulation and supervision of national banks lending activities conducted through operating subsidiaries.  Rejecting those arguments, the Federal District Court granted the Wachovia plaintiffs summary judgment in relevant part, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 
1.Wachovias mortgage business, whether conducted by the bank itself or through the banks operating subsidiary, is subject to OCCs superintendence, and not to the licensing, reporting, and visitorial regimes of the several States in which the subsidiary operates.  Pp.517.

05-1508|"ZUNI PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 89 etal. v. 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 051508.Argued January 10, 2007Decided April 17, 2007
The Federal Impact Aid Program provides financial assistance to local school districts whose ability to finance public school education is adversely affected by a federal presence.  The statute prohibits a State from offsetting this federal aid by reducing state aid to a local district.  To avoid unreasonably interfering with a state program that seeks to equalize per-pupil expenditures, the statute contains an exception permitting a State to reduce its own local funding on account of the federal aid where the Secretary of Education finds that the state program equalizes expenditures among local school districts.  20 U. S.C. 7709(b)(1).  The Secretary is required to use a formula that compares the local school district with the greatest per-pupil expenditures in a State to the school district with the smallest per-pupil expenditures.  If the former does not exceed the latter by more than 25 percent, the state program qualifies as one that equalizes expenditures.  In making this determination, the Secretary must, inter alia, disregard [school districts] with per-pupil expenditures  above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures in the State. 7709(b)(2)(B)(i).  Regulations first promulgated 30 years ago provide that the Secretary will first create a list of school districts ranked in order of per-pupil expenditure; then identify the relevant percentile cutoff point on that list based on a specific (95th or 5th) percentile of student populationessentially identifying those districts whose students account for the 5 percent of the States total student population that lies at both the high and low ends of the spending distribution; and finally compare the highest spending and lowest spending of the remaining school districts to see whether they satisfy the statutes requirement that the disparity between them not exceed 25 percent.


Using this formula, Department of Education officials ranked New Mexicos 89 local school districts in order of per-pupil spending for fiscal year 1998, excluding 17 schools at the top because they contained (cumulatively) less than 5 percent of the student population and an additional 6 districts at the bottom.  The remaining 66 districts accounted for approximately 90 percent of the States student population.  Because the disparity between the highest and lowest of the remaining districts was less than 25 percent, the States program equalize[d] expenditures, and the State could offset federal impact aid by reducing its aid to individual districts.  Seeking further review, petitioner school districts (Zuni) claimed that the calculations were correct under the regulations, but that the regulations were inconsistent with the authorizing statute because the Department must calculate the 95th and 5th percentile cutoffs based solely on the number of school districts without considering the number of pupils in those districts.  A Department Administrative Law Judge and the Secretary both rejected this challenge, and the en banc Tenth Circuit ultimately affirmed.
Held:The statute permits the Secretary to identify the school districts that should be disregard[ed] by looking to the number of the districts pupils as well as to the size of the districts expenditures per pupil.  Pp.717. 
(a)The disregard instructions history and purpose indicate that the Secretarys calculation formula is a reasonable method that carries out Congress likely intent in enacting the statutory provision.  For one thing, that method is the kind of highly technical, specialized interstitial matter that Congress does not decide itself, but delegates to specialized agencies to decide.  For another, the statutes history strongly supports the Secretary.  The present statutory language originated in draft legislation sent by the Secretary himself, which Congress adopted without comment or clarification.  No one at the timeno Member of Congress, no Department of Education official, no school district or Stateexpressed the view that this statutory language was intended to require, or did require, the Secretary to change the Departments system of calculation, a system that the Department and school districts across the Nation had followed for nearly 20 years.  Finally, the purpose of the disregard instruction, which is evident in the language of the present statute, is to exclude statistical outliers.  Viewed in terms of this purpose, the Secretarys calculation method is reasonable, while the reasonableness of Zunis proposed method is more doubtful as the then Commissioner of Education explained when he considered the matter in 1976.  Pp.711.


(b)The Secretarys method falls within the scope of the statutes plain language.  Neither the legislative history nor the reasonableness of the Secretarys method would be determinative if the statutes plain language unambiguously indicated Congress intent to foreclose the Secretarys interpretation.  See Chevron, supra, at 842843.  That is not the case here.  Section 7709(b)(2)(B)(i)s phrase above the 95th percentile  of  [per-pupil] expenditures (emphasis added) limits the Secretary to calculation methods involving per-pupil expenditures.  It does not tell the Secretary which of several possible methods the Department must use, nor rule out the Secretarys present formula, which distributes districts in accordance with per-pupil expenditures, while essentially weighting each district to reflect the number of pupils it contains.  This interpretation is supported by dictionary definitions of percentile, and by the fact that Congress, in other statutes, has clarified the matter at issue to avoid comparable ambiguity.  Moreover, [a]mbiguity is a creature not [just] of definitional possibilities but [also] of statutory context.  Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118.  Context here indicates that both students and school districts are of concern to the statute, and, thus, the disregard instruction can include within its scope the distribution of a ranked population consisting of pupils (or of school districts weighted by pupils), not just a ranked distribution of unweighted school districts alone.  Finally, this Court is reassured by the fact that no group of statisticians, nor any individual statistician, has said directly in briefs, or indirectly through citation, that the language in question cannot be read the way it is interpreted here.  Pp.1117.

05-705|"GLOBAL CROSSING TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. METROPHONES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05705.Argued October 10, 2006Decided April 17, 2007
Under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates interstate telephone communications using a traditional regulatory system similar to what other commissions have applied when regulating other common carriers.  Indeed, Congress largely copied language from the earlier Interstate Commerce Act, which authorized federal railroad regulation, when it wrote Communications Act 201(b) and 207, the provisions at issue.  Both Acts authorize their respective commissions to declare any carrier charge, regulation, or practice in connection with the carriers services to be unjust or unreasonable; declare an unreasonable, e.g., charge to be unlawful; authorize an injured person to recover damages for an unlawful charge or practice; and state that, to do so, the person may bring suit in a court of the United States.  Interstate Commerce Act 1, 8, 9; Communications Act 201(b), 206, 207.  The underlying regulatory problem here arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more competitively oriented approaches.  Legislation in 1990 required payphone operators to allow payphone users to obtain free access to the long-distance carrier of their choice, i.e., access without depositing coins.  But recognizing the free call would impose a cost upon the payphone operator, Congress required the FCC to promulgate regulations to provide compensation to such operators.  Using traditional ratemaking methods, the FCC ordered carriers to reimburse the operators in a specified amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed to a different amount.  The FCC subsequently determined that a carriers refusal to pay such compensation was an unreasonable practice and thus unlawful under 201(b).  Respondent payphone operator brought a federal lawsuit, claiming that petitioner long-distance carrier (hereinafter Global Crossing) had violated 201(b) by failing to pay compensation and that 207 authorized respondent to sue in federal court.  The District Court agreed that Global Crossings refusal to pay violated 201(b), thereby permitting respondent to sue under 207.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The FCCs application of 201(b) to the carriers refusal to pay compensation is lawful; and, given the linkage with 207, 207 authorizes this federal-court lawsuit.  Pp.719.
(a)The language of 201(b), 206, and 207 and those sections history, including that of their predecessors, Interstate Commerce Act 8 and 9, make clear that 207s purpose is to allow persons injured by 201(b) violations to bring federal-court damages actions.  The difficult question is whether the FCC regulation at issue lawfully implements 201(b)s unreasonable practice prohibition.  Pp.79.


(b)The FCCs 201(b) unreasonable practice determination is reasonable, and thus lawful.  See Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843844.  It easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase.  Moreover, the underlying regulated activity at issue resembles activity long regulated by both transportation and communications agencies.  Traditionally, the FCC, exercising its rate-setting authority, has divided revenues from a call among providers of segments of the call.  Transportation agencies have similarly divided revenues from a larger transportation service among providers of segments of the service.  The payphone operator and long-distance carrier resemble those joint providers of a communication or transportation service.  Differences between the present unreasonable practice classification and more traditional regulatory subject matter do not require a different outcome.  When Congress revised the telecommunications laws in 1996 to enhance the role of competition, creating a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon the role of tariffs in regulatory supervision, it left 201(b) in place.  In light of the absence of any congressional prohibition, and the similarities with traditional regulatory action, the Court finds nothing unreasonable about the FCCs 201(b) determination.

			"|"GLOBAL CROSSING TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. METROPHONES TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05705.Argued October 10, 2006Decided April 17, 2007
Under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates interstate telephone communications using a traditional regulatory system similar to what other commissions have applied when regulating other common carriers.  Indeed, Congress largely copied language from the earlier Interstate Commerce Act, which authorized federal railroad regulation, when it wrote Communications Act 201(b) and 207, the provisions at issue.  Both Acts authorize their respective commissions to declare any carrier charge, regulation, or practice in connection with the carriers services to be unjust or unreasonable; declare an unreasonable, e.g., charge to be unlawful; authorize an injured person to recover damages for an unlawful charge or practice; and state that, to do so, the person may bring suit in a court of the United States.  Interstate Commerce Act 1, 8, 9; Communications Act 201(b), 206, 207.  The underlying regulatory problem here arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more competitively oriented approaches.  Legislation in 1990 required payphone operators to allow payphone users to obtain free access to the long-distance carrier of their choice, i.e., access without depositing coins.  But recognizing the free call would impose a cost upon the payphone operator, Congress required the FCC to promulgate regulations to provide compensation to such operators.  Using traditional ratemaking methods, the FCC ordered carriers to reimburse the operators in a specified amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed to a different amount.  The FCC subsequently determined that a carriers refusal to pay such compensation was an unreasonable practice and thus unlawful under 201(b).  Respondent payphone operator brought a federal lawsuit, claiming that petitioner long-distance carrier (hereinafter Global Crossing) had violated 201(b) by failing to pay compensation and that 207 authorized respondent to sue in federal court.  The District Court agreed that Global Crossings refusal to pay violated 201(b), thereby permitting respondent to sue under 207.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:The FCCs application of 201(b) to the carriers refusal to pay compensation is lawful; and, given the linkage with 207, 207 authorizes this federal-court lawsuit.  Pp.719.
(a)The language of 201(b), 206, and 207 and those sections history, including that of their predecessors, Interstate Commerce Act 8 and 9, make clear that 207s purpose is to allow persons injured by 201(b) violations to bring federal-court damages actions.  The difficult question is whether the FCC regulation at issue lawfully implements 201(b)s unreasonable practice prohibition.  Pp.79.


(b)The FCCs 201(b) unreasonable practice determination is reasonable, and thus lawful.  See Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843844.  It easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase.  Moreover, the underlying regulated activity at issue resembles activity long regulated by both transportation and communications agencies.  Traditionally, the FCC, exercising its rate-setting authority, has divided revenues from a call among providers of segments of the call.  Transportation agencies have similarly divided revenues from a larger transportation service among providers of segments of the service.  The payphone operator and long-distance carrier resemble those joint providers of a communication or transportation service.  Differences between the present unreasonable practice classification and more traditional regulatory subject matter do not require a different outcome.  When Congress revised the telecommunications laws in 1996 to enhance the role of competition, creating a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon the role of tariffs in regulatory supervision, it left 201(b) in place.

05-1120|"MASSACHUSETTS etal. v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 051120.Argued November 29, 2006Decided April 2, 2007
Based on respected scientific opinion that a well-documented rise in global temperatures and attendant climatological and environmental changes have resulted from a significant increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, a group of private organizations petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to begin regulating the emissions of four such gases, including carbon dioxide, under 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, which requires that the EPA shall by regulation prescribe  standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class  of new motor vehicles  which in [the EPA Administrators] judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution  reasonably  anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, 42 U. S.C. 7521(a)(1).  The Act defines air pollutant to include any air pollution agent  , including any physical, chemical  substance  emitted into  the ambient air.  7602(g).  EPA ultimately denied the petition, reasoning that (1) the Act does not authorize it to issue mandatory regulations to address global climate change, and (2) even if it had the authority to set greenhouse gas emission standards, it would have been unwise to do so at that time because a causal link between greenhouse gases and the increase in global surface air temperatures was not unequivocally established.  The agency further characterized any EPA regulation of motor-vehicle emissions as a piecemeal approach to climate change that would conflict with the Presidents comprehensive approach involving additional support for technological innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and further research on climate change, and might hamper the Presidents ability to persuade key developing nations to reduce emissions.


Petitioners, now joined by intervenor Massachusetts and other state and local governments, sought review in the D.C. Circuit.  Although each of the three judges on the panel wrote separately, two of them agreed that the EPA Administrator properly exercised his discretion in denying the rulemaking petition.  One judge concluded that the Administrators exercise of judgment as to whether a pollutant could reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, 7521(a)(1), could be based on scientific uncertainty as well as other factors, including the concern that unilateral U. S. regulation of motor-vehicle emissions could weaken efforts to reduce other countries greenhouse gas emissions.  The second judge opined that petitioners had failed to demonstrate the particularized injury to them that is necessary to establish standing under Article III, but accepted the contrary view as the law of the case and joined the judgment on the merits as the closest to that which he preferred.  The court therefore denied review.  
Held:
1.Petitioners have standing to challenge the EPAs denial of their rulemaking petition.  Pp.1223.


(a)This case suffers from none of the defects that would preclude it from being a justiciable Article III Controvers[y].  See, e.g., Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1.  Moreover, the proper construction of a congressional statute is an eminently suitable question for federal-court resolution, and Congress has authorized precisely this type of challenge to EPA action, see 42 U. S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Contrary to EPAs argument, standing doctrine presents no insuperable jurisdictional obstacle here.  To demonstrate standing, a litigant must show that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that a favorable decision will likely redress that injury.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561.  However, a litigant to whom Congress has accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests, id., at 573, n. 7here, the right to challenge agency action unlawfully withheld, 7607(b)(1)can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy, ibid.  Only one petitioner needs to have standing to authorize review.  See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 52, n. 2.  Massachusetts has a special position and interest here.  It is a sovereign State and not, as in Lujan, a private individual, and it actually owns a great deal of the territory alleged to be affected.  The sovereign prerogatives to force reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, to negotiate emissions treaties with developing countries, and (in some circumstances) to exercise the police power to reduce motor-vehicle emissions are now lodged in the Federal Government.  Because congress has ordered EPA to protect Massachusetts (among others) by prescribing applicable standards, 7521(a)(1), and has given Massachusetts a concomitant procedural right to challenge the rejection of its rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious, 7607(b)(1), petitioners submissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the most demanding standards of the adversarial process.  EPAs steadfast refusal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions presents a risk of harm to Massachusetts that is both actual and imminent, Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560, and there is a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prompt EPA to take steps to reduce that risk, Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 79.  Pp.1217.


(b)The harms associated with climate change are serious and well recognized.  The Governments own objective assessment of the relevant science and a strong consensus among qualified experts indicate that global warming threatens, inter alia, a precipitate rise in sea levels, severe and irreversible changes to natural ecosystems, a significant reduction in winter snowpack with direct and important economic consequences, and increases in the spread of disease and the ferocity of weather events.  That these changes are widely shared does not minimize Massachusetts interest in the outcome of this litigation.  See Federal Election Commn v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11, 24.  According to petitioners uncontested affidavits, global sea levels rose between 10 and 20 centimeters over the 20th century as a result of global warming and have already begun to swallow Massachusetts coastal land.  Remediation costs alone, moreover, could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.  Pp.1719. 


(c)Given EPAs failure to dispute the existence of a causal connection between man-made greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, its refusal to regulate such emissions, at a minimum, contributes to Massachusetts injuries.  EPA overstates its case in arguing that its decision not to regulate contributes so insignificantly to petitioners injuries that it cannot be haled into federal court, and that there is no realistic possibility that the relief sought would mitigate global climate change and remedy petitioners injuries, especially since predicted increases in emissions from China, India, and other developing nations will likely offset any marginal domestic decrease EPA regulation could bring about.  Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one fell swoop, see Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489, but instead whittle away over time, refining their approach as circumstances change and they develop a more nuanced understanding of how best to proceed, cf. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, 202203.  That a first step might be tentative does not by itself negate federal-court jurisdiction.  And reducing domestic automobile emissions is hardly tentative.  Leaving aside the other greenhouse gases, the record indicates that the U. S. transportation sector emits an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Pp.2021. 


(d)While regulating motor-vehicle emissions may not by itself reverse global warming, it does not follow that the Court lacks jurisdiction to decide whether EPA has a duty to take steps to slow or reduce it.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 243, n.15.  Because of the enormous potential consequences, the fact that a remedys effectiveness might be delayed during the (relatively short) time it takes for a new motor-vehicle fleet to replace an older one is essentially irrelevant.  Nor is it dispositive that developing countries are poised to substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions: A reduction in domestic emissions would slow the pace of global emissions increases, no matter what happens elsewhere.  The Court attaches considerable significance to EPAs espoused belief that global climate change must be addressed.  Pp.2123.


2.The scope of the Courts review of the merits of the statutory issues is narrow.  Although an agencys refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not ordinarily subject to judicial review, Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, there are key differences between nonenforcement and denials of rulemaking petitions that are, as in the present circumstances, expressly authorized.  EPA concluded alternatively in its petition denial that it lacked authority under 7521(a)(1) to regulate new vehicle emissions because carbon dioxide is not an air pollutant under 7602, and that, even if it possessed authority, it would decline to exercise it because regulation would conflict with other administration priorities.  Because the Act expressly permits review of such an action, 7607(b)(1), this Court may reverse [it if it finds it to be] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, 7607(d)(9).  Pp. 2425.


3.Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Acts capacious definition of air pollutant, EPA has statutory authority to regulate emission of such gases from new motor vehicles.  That definitionwhich includes any air pollution agent  , including any physical, chemical,  substance  emitted into  the ambient air , 7602(g) (emphasis added)embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.  Moreover, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are undoubtedly physical [and] chemical  substance[s].  Ibid.  EPAs reliance on postenactment congressional actions and deliberations it views as tantamount to a command to refrain from regulating greenhouse gas emissions is unavailing.  Even if postenactment legislative history could shed light on the meaning of an otherwise-unambiguous statute, EPA identifies nothing suggesting that Congress meant to curtail EPAs power to treat greenhouse gases as air pollutants.  The Court has no difficulty reconciling Congress various efforts to promote interagency collaboration and research to better understand climate change with the agencys pre-existing mandate to regulate any air pollutant that may endanger the public welfare.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133, distinguished.  Also unpersuasive is EPAs argument that its regulation of motor-vehicle carbon dioxide emissions would require it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) that Congress has assigned to the Department of Transportation.  The fact that DOTs mandate to promote energy efficiency by setting mileage standards may overlap with EPAs environmental responsibilities in no way licenses EPA to shirk its duty to protect the public health and welfare, 7521(a)(1).  Pp.2530. 


4.EPAs alternative basis for its decisionthat even if it has statutory authority to regulate greenhouse gases, it would be unwise to do so at this timerests on reasoning  divorced from the statutory text.  While the statute conditions EPA action on its formation of a judgment, that judgment must relate to whether an air pollutant cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  7601(a)(1). Under the Acts clear terms, EPA can avoid promulgating regulations only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.  It has refused to do so, offering instead a laundry list of reasons not to regulate, including the existence of voluntary Executive Branch programs providing a response to global warming and impairment of the Presidents ability to negotiate with developing nations to reduce emissions.  These policy judgments have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and do not amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment.  Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regulate at this time.  If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment, it must say so.  The statutory question is whether sufficient information exists for it to make an endangerment finding.  Instead, EPA rejected the rulemaking petition based on impermissible considerations.  Its action was therefore arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law, 7607(d)(9).  On remand,  EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction in the statute.  Pp.3032.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 05848.Argued November 1, 2006Decided April 2, 2007
In the 1970s, Congress added two air pollution control schemes to the Clean Air Act (Act): New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), each of which covers modified, as well as new, stationary sources of air pollution.  The NSPS provisions define modification of such a source as a physical change to it, or a change in the method of its operation, that increases the amount of a pollutant discharged or emits a new one.  42 U. S.C. 7411(a)(4).  The PSD provisions require a permit before a major emitting facility can be constructed, 7475(a), and define such construction to include a modification (as defined in [NSPS]), 7479(2)(C).  Despite this definitional identity, the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) regulations interpret modification one way for NSPS but differently for PSD.  The NSPS regulations require a source to use the best available pollution-limiting technology, see Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 846, when a modification would increase the discharge of pollutants measured in kilograms per hour, 40 CFR 60.14(a), but the 1980 PSD regulations require a permit for a modification only when it is a major one, 51.166(b)(2)(i), and only when it would increase the actual annual emission of a pollutant above the actual average for the two prior years, 51.166(b)(21)(ii).


After respondent Duke Energy Corporation replaced or redesigned the workings of some of its coal-fired electric generating units, the United States filed this enforcement action, claiming, among other things, that Duke violated the PSD provisions by doing the work without permits.  Petitioner environmental groups intervened as plaintiffs and filed a complaint charging similar violations.  Duke moved for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that none of its projects was a major modification requiring a PSD permit because none increased hourly emissions rates.  Agreeing, the District Court entered summary judgment for Duke on all PSD claims.  The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Congresss decision to create identical statutory definitions of modification in the Acts NSPS and PSD provisions affirmatively mandated that this term be interpreted identically in the regulations promulgated under those provisions.  When the court sU. S.onte requested supplemental briefing on the relevance of this Courts decision in Rowan Cos. v. United States, 452 U. S. 247, 250, that the Government could not adopt different interpretations of the word wages in different statutory provisions, plaintiffs injected a new issue into the case, arguing that a claim that the 1980 PSD regulation exceeded statutory authority would be an attack on the regulations validity that could not be raised in an enforcement proceeding, see 42 U. S.C. 7607(b)(2), since judicial review for validity can be obtained only by a petition to the District of Columbia Circuit, generally within 60 days of EPAs rulemaking, 7607(b)(1).  The Fourth Circuit rejected this argument, ruling that its interpretation did not invalidate the PSD regulations because they can be interpreted to require an increase in the hourly emissions rate as an element of a major modification.  
Held:The Fourth Circuits reading of the PSD regulations in an effort to conform them with their NSPS counterparts on modification amounted to the invalidation of the PSD regulations, which must comport with the Clean Air Acts limits on judicial review of EPA regulations for validity.  Pp.817.
(a)Principles of statutory interpretation do not rigidly mandate identical regulation here.  Because [m]ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed, [even] when [they are] used more than once in the same statute or  section, the natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning  is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.  Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433.  A given term in the same statute may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory objects calling for different ways of implementation.  The point is the same even when the terms share a common statutory definition, if it is general enough.  See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 343344.  Robinson is not inconsistent with Rowan, where the Courts invalidation of the differing interpretations of wages, 452 U. S., at 252, turned not on the fact that a substantially identical definition of that word appeared in each of the statutory provisions at issue, but on the failure of the regulations in question to serve Congresss manifest concern for the interest of simplicity and ease of administration, id., at 255.  In fact, in a case close to Rowans facts, the Court recently declined to follow a categorical rule of resolving ambiguities in identical statutory terms identically regardless of their surroundings, United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213, but instead accorded substantial judicial deference to an agencys longstanding, reasonable, and differing interpretations of the statutory term at issue, id., at 218220.  It makes no difference here that the Clean Air Act does not merely repeat the same definition in its NSPS and PSD provisions, but that the PSD provisions refer back to the section defining modification for NSPS purposes.  Nothing in the text or legislative history of the statutory amendment that added the NSPS cross-reference suggests that Congress meant to eliminate customary agency discretion to resolve questions about a statutory definition by looking to the surroundings in which the defined term appears.  EPAs construction need do no more than fall within the outer limits of what is reasonable, as set by the Acts common definition.  Pp.912. 


(b)The Fourth Circuits construction of the 1980 PSD regulations to conform them to their NSPS counterparts was not a permissible reading of their terms.  The PSD regulations clearly do not define a major modification in terms of an increase in the hourly emissions rate. On its face, the definitional section specifies no rate at all, hourly or annual, merely requiring a physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result in a significant net emissions increase of any regulated pollutant.  40 CFR 51.166(b)(2)(i).  But even when the regulations mention a rate, it is annual, not hourly.  See, e.g., 51.166(b)(23)(i).  Further at odds with the idea that hourly rate is relevant is the mandate that [a]ctual emissions shall be calculated using the units actual operating hours, 51.166(b)(21)(ii), since actual emissions must be measured in a manner looking to the number of hours the unit is or probably will be actually running.  The Court of Appealss reasons for its different view are no match for these textual differences.  Consequently, the Court of Appealss construction of the 1980 PSD regulations must be seen as an implicit invalidation of those regulations, a form of judicial review implicating the provisions of 7607(b), which limit challenges to the validity of a regulation during enforcement proceedings when such review could have been obtained in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia within 60 days of EPA rulemaking.  Because the Court of Appeals did not believe that its analysis reached validity, it did not consider the applicability or effect of that limitation here.  The Court has no occasion itself at this point to consider the significance of 7607(b).  Pp.1217. 


(c)Dukes claim that, even assuming the Act and the 1980 regulations authorize EPA to construe a PSD modification as it has done, EPA has been inconsistent in its positions and is now retroactively targeting 20 years of accepted practice was not addressed below.  To the extent the claim is not procedurally foreclosed, Duke may press it on remand.  P.17.

on petitions for writs of certiorari to the united

columbia circuit
Nos. 061195 and 061196.Decided April 2, 2007
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter joins, and with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Part I, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.

I would grant the petitions for certiorari and expedite argument in these cases.
I

Petitioners, foreign citizens imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, raise an important question: whether the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109366, 120 Stat. 2600, deprives courts of jurisdiction to consider their habeas claims, and, if so, whether that deprivation is constitutional. I believe these questions deserve this Courts immediate attention.
First, the province of the Great Writ, shaped to guarantee the most fundamental of all rights, is to provide an effective and speedy instrument by which judicial inquiry may be had into the legality of the detention of a person.  Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234, 238 (1968) (emphasis added and footnote omitted).  Yet, petitioners have been held for more than five years.  They have not obtained judicial review of their habeas claims.  If petitioners are right about the law, immediate review may avoid an additional year or more of imprisonment.   If they are wrong, our review is nevertheless appropriate to help establish the boundaries of the constitutional provision for the writ of habeas corpus.  Cf. Carafas, supra.  Finally, whether petitioners are right or wrong, our prompt review will diminish the legal uncertainty that now surrounds the application to Guantanamo detainees of this fundamental constitutional principle.  Brief for Senator Arlen Specter as Amicus Curiae 19; see generally ibid. (favoring expedited consideration of these cases).  Doing so will bring increased clarity that in turn will speed review in other cases.


Second, petitioners plausibly argue that the lower courts reasoning is contrary to this Courts precedent. This Court previously held that federal jurisdiction lay to consider petitioners habeas claims.  Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 485 (2004) (providing several of these petitioners with the right to habeas review under law as it then stood).  Our analysis proceeded under the then-operative statute, but petitioners urge that our reasoning applies to the scope of the constitutional habeas right as well. In holding that the writ extended to the petitioners in Rasul, we said that Guantanamo was under the complete control and jurisdiction of the United States.  Id., at 480481; id., at 487 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (Guantanamo Bay is in every practical respect a United States territory).  We then observed that the writ at common law would have extended to petitioners:
Application of the habeas statute to persons detained at the base is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus.  At common law, courts exercised habeas jurisdiction over the claims of aliens detained within sovereign territory of the realm, as well as the claims of persons detained in the so-called exempt jurisdictions, where ordinary writs did not run, and all other dominions under the sovereigns control. [E]ven if a territory was no part of the realm, there was no doubt as to the courts power to issue writs of habeas corpus if the territory was under the subjection of the Crown.  Id., at 481482 (internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted).

Our reasoning may be applicable here.  The lower courts holding, petitioners urge, disregards these statements and reasoning.


Further, petitioners in Boumediene are natives of Algeria, and citizens of Bosnia, seized in Bosnia.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 061195, p.4.  Other detainees, including several petitioners in Al Odah, also are citizens of friendly nations, including Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Turkey, and the United Kingdom; and many were seized outside of any theater of hostility, in places like Pakistan, Thailand, and Zambia.  Pet. for Cert. in No. 061196, pp.23, and n.2; 476 F.3d 981, 1007 (CADC 2007) (Rogers, J., dissenting).  It is possible that these circumstances will make a difference in respect to our resolution of the constitutional questions presented.  Cf. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 509, 514, 521 (2004) (plurality opinion of OConnor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Kennedy and Breyer, JJ.) (holding military had authority to detain United States citizen enemy combatant, captured in a zone of active combat in a foreign theater of conflict, specifically Afghanistan, and stressing, in a narrow holding, that [a]ctive combat operations against Taliban fighters  [were] ongoing in Afghanistan (emphasis added)).


The Government, of course, contests petitioners arguments on the merits.  But I do not here say petitioners are correct; I say only that the questions presented are significant ones warranting our review.


If petitioners have the right of access to habeas corpus in the federal courts, this Court would then have to consider whether Congress provision in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Tit. X, 119 Stat. 2739, providing for review in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of those proceedings, is a constitutionally adequate substitute for habeas corpus. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, 381 (1977).  The Government argues that we should therefore wait for a case where, unlike petitioners here, the detainee seeking certiorari has actually sought and received review under these alternative means.  E.g., Brief in Opposition 1617.  Petitioners respond, however, that further proceedings in the Court of Appeals under the DTA could not possibly remedy a constitutional violation.  The lower court expressly indicated that no constitutional rights (not merely the right to habeas) extend to the Guantanamo detainees.  476 F. 3d, at 991992 (rejecting petitioners arguments under this Courts precedent that fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution extend to Guantanamo, and noting that [p]recedent in this circuit also forecloses the detainees claims to constitutional rights). Therefore, it is irrelevant, to petitioners, that the DTA provides for review in the D.C. Circuit of any constitutional infirmities in the proceedings under that Act, 1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 119 Stat. 2742; the lower court has already rendered that provision a nullity.


Nor will further percolation of the question presented offer elucidation as to either the threshold question whether petitioners have a right to habeas, or the question whether the DTA provides a constitutionally adequate substitute.  It is unreasonable to suggest that the D.C. Circuit in future proceedings under the DTA will provide review that affords petitioners the rights that the Circuit has already concluded they do not have.  Ordinarily, habeas petitioners need not exhaust a remedy that is inadequate to vindicate the asserted right. See Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U. S. 249, 250 (1971) (per curiam).


The Government, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), similarly argued for delay.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 52) (The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that  [petitioner] will be able to raise any such challenge following a final decision under the DTA).  That case, too, presented questions of the scope of the Guantanamo detainees right to federal-court review of DTA-authorized procedures.  We there rejected the Governments argument for delay as unsound. Id., at ______ (slip op., at 5253) ([C]ontrary to the Governments assertion, there is a basis to presume that the procedures  violate the law. Under these circumstances, review  in advance of a final decision  is appropriate).


Here, as in Hamdan, petitioners argue that the tribunals to which they have already been subjected were infirm (by, inter alia, denying Petitioners counsel and access to evidence, Pet. for Cert. in No. 061195, p.7).  Hamdan, supra, at ______ (slip op., 3536).  Here, as in Hamdan, petitioners assert that these procedural infirmities cannot be corrected by review under the DTA which provides for no augmentation of the record on appeal and, as noted above, will provide no remedy for any constitutional violation.  See DTA 1005(e)(2)(C), 119 Stat. 2742; 476 F.3d, at 1005 (Rogers, J., dissenting).  Here, as in Hamdan, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25), petitioners have a compelling interest in assuring in advance that the procedures to which they are subject are lawful.  And here, unlike Hamdan, the military tribunals in Guantanamo have completed their work; all that remains are the appeals.  For all these reasons, I would grant the petitions.
II

Moreover, I would expedite our consideration.  In the past, this Court has expedited other cases where important issues and a need for speedy consideration were at stake.  In Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), the Court decided that it should grant expedited consideration,
[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the] petitions and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.  Id., at 19.

See also Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651 (1996); New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952).


For these reasons, I would grant the petitions for certiorari and the motions to expedite the cases in accordance with the schedule deemed acceptable (in the alternative) by the Government.

06-1196|"ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. etal. v. UNITED STATES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 051272.Argued December 5, 2006Decided March 27, 2007
While employed as an engineer at a nuclear weapons plant run by petitioner Rockwell under a Government contract, respondent Stone predicted that Rockwells system for creating solid pondcrete blocks from toxic pond sludge and cement would not work because of problems in piping the sludge.  However, Rockwell successfully made such blocks and discovered insolid ones only after Stone was laid off in 1986.  In 1989, Stone filed a qui tam suit under the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting false or fraudulent payment claims to the United States, 31 U. S.C. 3729(a); permits remedial civil actions to be brought by the Attorney General, 3730(a), or by private individuals in the Governments name, 3730(b)(1); but eliminates federal-court jurisdiction over actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions  , unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information, 3730(e)(4)(A).  An original source has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action  based on the information.  3730(e)(4)(B).  In 1996, the Government intervened, and, with Stone, filed an amended complaint, which did not allege that Stones predicted piping-system defect caused the insolid blocks.  Nor was such defect mentioned in a statement of claims included in the final pretrial order, which instead alleged that the pondcrete failed because a new foreman used an insufficient cement-to-sludge ratio.  The jury found for respondents with respect to claims covering the pondcrete allegations, but found for Rockwell with respect to all other claims.  The District Court denied Rockwells postverdict motion to dismiss Stones claims, finding that Stone was an original source.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed in part, but remanded for the District Court to determine whether Stone had disclosed his information to the Government before filing the action.  The District Court found Stones disclosure inadequate, but the Tenth Circuit disagreed and held that Stone was an original source. 
Held:
1.Section 3730(e)(4)s original-source requirement is jurisdictional.  Thus, regardless of whether Rockwell conceded Stones original-source status, this Court must decide whether Stone meets this jurisdictional requirement.  Pp.811.


2.Because Stone does not meet 3730(e)(4)(B)s requirement that a relator have direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based, he is not an original source.  Pp.1218. 


(a)The information to which subparagraph (B) speaks is the information on which the relators allegations are based rather than the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations that triggered the public-disclosure bar are based.  The subparagraph standing on its own suggests that disposition.  And those allegations are not the same as the allegations referred to in subparagraph (A), which bars actions based on the public disclosure of allegations or transactions with an exception for cases brought by an original source of the information.  Had Congress wanted to link original-source status to information underlying public disclosure it would have used the identical phrase, allegations or transactions.  Furthermore, it is difficult to understand why Congress would care whether a relator knows about the information underlying a publicly disclosed allegation when the relator has direct and independent knowledge of different information supporting the same allegation.  Pp.1214.


(b)In determining which allegations are relevant, that term is not limited to allegations in the original complaint, but includes the allegations as amended.  The statute speaks of the relators allegations, simpliciter.  Absent some limitation of 3730(e)(4)s requirement to the initial complaint, this Court will not infer one.  Here, where the final pretrial order superseded prior pleadings, this Court looks to the final pretrial order to determine original-source status.  Pp.1417.


(c)Judged according to these principles, Stones knowledge falls short.  The only false claims found by the jury involved insolid pondcrete discovered after Stone left his employment.  Thus, he did not know that the pondcrete had failed; he predicted it.  And his prediction was a failed one, for Stone believed the piping system was defective when, in fact, the pondcrete problem would be caused by a foremans actions after Stone had left the plant.  Stones original-source status with respect to a separate, spray-irrigation claim did not provide jurisdiction over all of his claims.  Section 3730(e)(4) does not permit jurisdiction in gross just because a relator is an original source with respect to some claim.  Pp.1718.


3.The Governments intervention in this case did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to Stone.  The statute draws a sharp distinction between actions brought by a private person under 3730(b) and actions brought by the Attorney General under 3730(b).  An action originally brought by a private person, which the Attorney General has joined, becomes an action brought by the Attorney General only after the private person has been ousted.  Pp.1820.

			"|"ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. etal. v. UNITED STATES etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 051272.Argued December 5, 2006Decided March 27, 2007
While employed as an engineer at a nuclear weapons plant run by petitioner Rockwell under a Government contract, respondent Stone predicted that Rockwells system for creating solid pondcrete blocks from toxic pond sludge and cement would not work because of problems in piping the sludge.  However, Rockwell successfully made such blocks and discovered insolid ones only after Stone was laid off in 1986.  In 1989, Stone filed a qui tam suit under the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting false or fraudulent payment claims to the United States, 31 U. S.C. 3729(a); permits remedial civil actions to be brought by the Attorney General, 3730(a), or by private individuals in the Governments name, 3730(b)(1); but eliminates federal-court jurisdiction over actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions  , unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information, 3730(e)(4)(A).  An original source has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action  based on the information.  3730(e)(4)(B).  In 1996, the Government intervened, and, with Stone, filed an amended complaint, which did not allege that Stones predicted piping-system defect caused the insolid blocks.  Nor was such defect mentioned in a statement of claims included in the final pretrial order, which instead alleged that the pondcrete failed because a new foreman used an insufficient cement-to-sludge ratio.  The jury found for respondents with respect to claims covering the pondcrete allegations, but found for Rockwell with respect to all other claims.  The District Court denied Rockwells postverdict motion to dismiss Stones claims, finding that Stone was an original source.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed in part, but remanded for the District Court to determine whether Stone had disclosed his information to the Government before filing the action.  The District Court found Stones disclosure inadequate, but the Tenth Circuit disagreed and held that Stone was an original source. 
Held:
1.Section 3730(e)(4)s original-source requirement is jurisdictional.  Thus, regardless of whether Rockwell conceded Stones original-source status, this Court must decide whether Stone meets this jurisdictional requirement.  Pp.811.


2.Because Stone does not meet 3730(e)(4)(B)s requirement that a relator have direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based, he is not an original source.  Pp.1218. 


(a)The information to which subparagraph (B) speaks is the information on which the relators allegations are based rather than the information on which the publicly disclosed allegations that triggered the public-disclosure bar are based.  The subparagraph standing on its own suggests that disposition.  And those allegations are not the same as the allegations referred to in subparagraph (A), which bars actions based on the public disclosure of allegations or transactions with an exception for cases brought by an original source of the information.  Had Congress wanted to link original-source status to information underlying public disclosure it would have used the identical phrase, allegations or transactions.  Furthermore, it is difficult to understand why Congress would care whether a relator knows about the information underlying a publicly disclosed allegation when the relator has direct and independent knowledge of different information supporting the same allegation.  Pp.1214.


(b)In determining which allegations are relevant, that term is not limited to allegations in the original complaint, but includes the allegations as amended.  The statute speaks of the relators allegations, simpliciter.  Absent some limitation of 3730(e)(4)s requirement to the initial complaint, this Court will not infer one.  Here, where the final pretrial order superseded prior pleadings, this Court looks to the final pretrial order to determine original-source status.  Pp.1417.


(c)Judged according to these principles, Stones knowledge falls short.  The only false claims found by the jury involved insolid pondcrete discovered after Stone left his employment.  Thus, he did not know that the pondcrete had failed; he predicted it.  And his prediction was a failed one, for Stone believed the piping system was defective when, in fact, the pondcrete problem would be caused by a foremans actions after Stone had left the plant.  Stones original-source status with respect to a separate, spray-irrigation claim did not provide jurisdiction over all of his claims.  Section 3730(e)(4) does not permit jurisdiction in gross just because a relator is an original source with respect to some claim.  Pp.1718.


3.The Governments intervention in this case did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to Stone.  The statute draws a sharp distinction between actions brought by a private person under 3730(b) and actions brought by the Attorney General under 3730(b).  An action originally brought by a private person, which the Attorney General has joined, becomes an action brought by the Attorney General only after the private person has been ousted.  Pp.1820.

05-1272|"LIMTIACO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF GUAM v. CAMACHO, GOVERNOR OF GUAM
certiorari to the supreme court of guam
No. 06116.Argued January 8, 2007Decided March 27, 2007
The Guam Legislature authorized the Governor to issue bonds to fund the Territorys continuing obligations, but Guams attorney general refused to sign the necessary contracts, concluding that issuance would violate the debt-limitation provision of Guams Organic Act, which limits the Territorys public indebtedness to 10% of the aggregate tax valuation of the property in Guam, 48 U. S.C. 1423a.  The Governor sought a declaration from the Guam Supreme Court that issuance would not violate the provision, calculating the debt limitation based on the appraised value of property in Guam.  Agreeing, the Supreme Court rejected the attorney generals argument to base the limitation on assessed value.  The Ninth Circuit granted the attorney generals certiorari petition, but while the appeal was pending, Congress removed the Circuits jurisdiction over appeals from Guam.  Relying on its holding in Santos v. Guam, that Congress had stripped it of jurisdiction over pending appeals, the court dismissed the appeal.  The attorney general then filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, even though it was more than 90 days after the Guam Supreme Courts judgment.
Held:
1.The Guam Supreme Courts judgment did not become final, for purposes of this Courts review, until the Ninth Circuit issued its order dismissing the appeal.  Certiorari petitions must be filed within 90 days after the entry of, 28 U. S.C. 2101(c), a lower courts genuinely final judgment, Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 98.  In some cases, the actions of a party or a lower court suspend the finality of a judgment by rais[ing] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties rights.  Ibid.  By granting the petition for certiorari, the Ninth Circuit raised that possibility and thus suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Courts judgment.  Until the Circuit issued its order dismissing the case, the appeal remained pending, and the finality of the judgment remained suspended.  Contrary to the Governors arguments, the judgment was not made final either when Congress enacted the jurisdiction-depriving statute or when the Ninth Circuit decided Santos.  This holding is limited to the unique procedural circumstances here.  Pp. 35.


2.Guams debt limitation must be calculated according to the assessed valuation of property in the Territory.  The term tax valuation most naturally means the value to which the tax rate is applied.  It therefore means assessed valuationa term consistently defined as a valuation of property for tax purposes.  Appraised value is simply market value, which may or may not relate to taxation.  The Guam Supreme Courts contrary interpretationthat tax limits the kinds of property qualifying for inclusion in the debt-limitation calculationimpermissibly rearranges the statutory language.  Tax modifies valuation, not property.  Thus, tax valuation refers to the type of valuation to be conducted, not the object that is valued.  The court also erred in reasoning that, because the Virgin Islands debt-limitation provision explicitly refers to assessed value, Congress must have intended to base Guams limitation on some other value.  Congress rejection of assessed says no more than its rejection of actual or appraised, terms it could have used had it meant actual, market, or appraised value.  This Courts interpretation comports with most States practice of fixing the debt limitations of municipalities to assessed valuation.  States use clear language when departing from this approach, but Congress has not done so here.  The Governors additional argumentsthat this interpretation would result in no debt limitation at all because Guam may arbitrarily set its assessment rate above 100 percent of market value, and that this Court owes deference to the Guam Supreme Courts interpretation of the Organic Actare not persuasive.  Pp.58.
Reversed and remanded.

06-116|"TRAVELERS CASUALTY & SURETY CO. OF AMERICA v. PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 051429.Argued January 16, 2007Decided March 20, 2007
After respondent (PG&E) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, petitioner (Travelers), which had previously issued a surety bond to guarantee PG&Es payment of state workers compensation benefits, asserted a claim in the bankruptcy action to protect itself should PG&E default on the benefits.  With the Bankruptcy Courts approval, PG&E agreed to insert language into its reorganization plan and disclosure statement to protect Travelers in case of such a default.  Additional litigation over the negotiated language nevertheless ensued and was ultimately resolved by a court-approved stipulation stating, inter alia, that Travelers could assert a general unsecured claim for attorneys fees, which were authorized in the parties original indemnity agreements.  When Travelers filed an amended claim for such fees, PG&E objected based on the rule the Ninth Circuit adopted in its prior Fobian decision that where the litigated issues involve not basic contract enforcement questions, but issues peculiar to federal bankruptcy law, attorneys fees generally will not be awarded.  The Bankruptcy Court rejected Travelers claim on that basis, and the District Court and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.Federal bankruptcy law does not disallow contract-based claims for attorneys fees based solely on the fact that the fees were incurred litigating bankruptcy law issues.  Because the Fobian rule finds no support in federal bankruptcy law, the Ninth Circuit erred in disallowing Travelers claim.  Pp.412.


(a)The American rule that the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys fee from the loser, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247, may be overcome by, inter alia, an enforceable contract allocating such fees, Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 717.  A contract allocating attorneys fees that is enforceable under substantive, nonbankruptcy law is allowable in bankruptcy except where the Bankruptcy Code provides otherwise.  Cf. Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, 278 U. S. 149, 154.  The Code does not do so here.  Pp.45. 


(b)Under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankruptcy court shall allow a creditors claim except to the extent that the claim implicates any of nine enumerated exceptions.  11 U. S.C. 502(b).  Because Travelers attorneys fees claim has nothing to do with the exceptions set forth in 502(b)(2)(9), it must be allowed unless it is unenforceable under 502(b)(1), which disallows any claim that is unenforceable against the debtor and property of the debtor, under any agreement or applicable law for a reason other than because such claim is contingent or unmatured.  Pp.56.


(c)Section 502(b)(1) is most naturally understood to provide that, with limited exceptions, any defense to a claim that is available outside of the bankruptcy context is also available in bankruptcy.  This reading is consistent not only with the plain statutory text, but also with the settled principle that [c]reditors entitlements in bankruptcy arise in the first instance from the underlying substantive law creating the debtors obligation, subject to any qualifying or contrary provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530 U. S. 15, 20.  That principle requires bankruptcy courts to consult state law in determining the validity of most claims.  See ibid.  Thus, when the Code uses the word claimi.e., a right to payment, 101(5)(A)it is usually referring to a right to payment recognized under state law, [u]nless some federal interest requires a different result, Butner v. United States, 440 U. S. 48, 55.  Pp.67. 


(d)The Fobian rule finds no support in 502 or elsewhere in federal bankruptcy law.  The Fobian court did not identify any Code provision as presenting such support, but instead cited three of its own prior decisions, none of which identified any basis for disallowing a contractual claim for attorneys fees.  Nor did the court have occasion to do so; in each of those cases, the attorneys fees claim failed as a matter of state law.  The absence of such textual support is fatal for the Fobian rule.   See FCC v. NextWave Personal Communications Inc., 537 U. S. 293, 302.  In light of 502(b)(1)s broad, permissive scope, and the Courts prior recognition that the character of [a contractual] obligation to pay attorneys fees presents no obstacle to enforcing it in bankruptcy, it necessarily follows that the Fobian rule cannot stand. Security Mortgage, supra, at 154.  Pp.710.


2.The Court expresses no opinion as to PG&Es arguments that unsecured claims for contractual attorneys fees, such as Travelers, are categorically disallowed by 506(b), which expressly authorizes such fees [t]o the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property [whose] value [exceeds] the amount of such claim, and that such disallowance is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Codes structure and purpose, as examined against the backdrop of pre-Code bankruptcy law.  The Court ordinarily does not consider arguments, such as these, that were neither raised nor addressed below, Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 168169, and PG&E has not identified any circumstances warranting an exception to that rule here.  PG&Es insistence that its arguments are fairly included within the question presented in the certiorari petition is not persuasive.  Pp.1012.

05-1429|"SINOCHEM INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD. v. MALAYSIA INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 06102.Argued January 9, 2007Decided March 5, 2007
A contract between petitioner (Sinochem), a Chinese state-owned importer, and a domestic corporation not a party here (Triorient) provided that Sinochem would purchase steel coils and that Triorient would be paid under a letter of credit by producing a valid bill of lading certifying that the coils had been loaded for shipment to China on or before April 30, 2003.  Triorient subchartered a vessel owned by respondent (Malaysia International), a Malaysian company, to transport the coils, and hired a stevedoring company to load the coils in Philadelphia.  A bill of lading, dated April 30, 2003, triggered payment under the letter of credit.  Sinochem petitioned a Chinese admiralty court for preservation of a maritime claim against Malaysia International and arrest of the vessel, alleging that the Malaysian company had falsely backdated the bill of lading.  The Chinese court ordered the ship arrested, and Sinochem timely filed a complaint in that tribunal.  The Chinese admiralty court rejected Malaysia Internationals jurisdictional objections to Sinochems complaint and that ruling was affirmed on appeal.


Shortly after the Chinese admiralty court ordered the vessels arrest, Malaysia International filed this action in a United States District Court, asserting that Sinochems preservation petition to the Chinese court contained misrepresentations, and seeking compensation for losses sustained due to the ships arrest.  Sinochem moved to dismiss on several grounds, including lack of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction and the doctrine of forum non conveniens, under which a federal district court may dismiss an action if a court abroad is the more appropriate and convenient forum for adjudicating the controversy.  The District Court determined it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the cause, concluded it lacked personal jurisdiction over Sinochem under Pennsylvania law, conjectured that limited discovery might reveal that it had personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure4(k)(2), but dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds, finding that the case could be adjudicated adequately and more conveniently in the Chinese courts.  Agreeing that there was subject-matter jurisdiction and that personal jurisdiction could not be resolved sans discovery, the Third Circuit panel held that the District Court could not dismiss the case under the forum non conveniens doctrine unless and until it determined definitively that it had both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.  
Held:A district court has discretion to respond at once to a defendants forum non conveniens plea, and need not take up first any other threshold objection.  In particular, a court need not resolve whether it has authority to adjudicate the cause (subject-matter jurisdiction) or personal jurisdiction over the defendant if it determines that, in any event, a foreign tribunal is the more suitable arbiter of the merits of the case.  Pp.512.
(a)A federal court has discretion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear [the] case, and  trial in the chosen forum would establish  oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant  out of all proportion to plaintiffs convenience, or  the chosen forum [is] inappropriate because of considerations affecting the courts own administrative and legal problems.  American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 447448.  Such a dismissal reflects a courts assessment of a range of considerations, most notably the convenience to the parties and the practical difficulties that can attend the adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 723.  A defendant invoking forum non conveniens ordinarily bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiffs chosen forum.  When the plaintiffs choice is not its home forum, however, the presumption in the plaintiffs favor applies with less force, for the assumption that the chosen forum is appropriate is then less reasonable.  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 255256.  Pp.56.         


(b)Although a federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction over the cause (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the parties (personal jurisdiction), see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 93102, there is no mandatory sequencing of nonmerits issues, see Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 584.  A court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits, Id., at 585.    Pp.78.


(c) Forum non conveniens is a nonmerits ground for dismissal.  See American Dredging, 510 U. S., at 454; Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140, 148.  A district court therefore may dispose of an action by a forum non conveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of convenience, fairness, and judicial economy so warrant.  Forum non conveniens, like other threshold issues, may involve a brush with factual and legal issues of the underlying dispute.  Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 529.  But the critical point, rendering a forum non conveniens determination a nonmerits issue that can be determined before taking up jurisdictional inquiries is this: Resolving a forum non conveniens motion does not entail any assumption by the court of substantive law-declaring power.  Statements in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, that forum non conveniens can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction, id., at 504, and that [i]n all cases in which  forum non conveniens comes into play, it presupposes at least two forums in which the defendant is amenable to process, id., at 506507, account in large part for the Third Circuits conclusion.  Those statements draw their meaning from the context in which they were embedded.  Gulf Oil answered in the affirmative the question whether a court that had jurisdiction over the cause and the parties and was a proper venue could nevertheless dismiss the action under the forum non conveniens doctrine.  Gulf Oil did not address the issue decided here: whether a federal court can presume, rather than dispositively decide, its jurisdiction before dismissing under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  The quoted statements, confined to the setting in which they were made, are no hindrance to the decision reached today.  The Third Circuits further concernthat a court failing first to establish its jurisdiction could not condition a forum non conveniens dismissal on the defendants waiver of any statute of limitations defense or objection to the foreign forums jurisdiction, and thus could not shield the plaintiff against a foreign tribunals refusal to entertain the suitis not implicated on these facts.  Malaysia International faces no genuine risk that the more convenient forum will not take up the case.  This Court therefore need not decide whether a court conditioning a forum non conveniens dismissal on the waiver of jurisdictional or limitations defenses in the foreign forum must first determine its own authority to adjudicate the case.

			"|"SINOCHEM INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD. v. MALAYSIA INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit
No. 06102.Argued January 9, 2007Decided March 5, 2007
A contract between petitioner (Sinochem), a Chinese state-owned importer, and a domestic corporation not a party here (Triorient) provided that Sinochem would purchase steel coils and that Triorient would be paid under a letter of credit by producing a valid bill of lading certifying that the coils had been loaded for shipment to China on or before April 30, 2003.  Triorient subchartered a vessel owned by respondent (Malaysia International), a Malaysian company, to transport the coils, and hired a stevedoring company to load the coils in Philadelphia.  A bill of lading, dated April 30, 2003, triggered payment under the letter of credit.  Sinochem petitioned a Chinese admiralty court for preservation of a maritime claim against Malaysia International and arrest of the vessel, alleging that the Malaysian company had falsely backdated the bill of lading.  The Chinese court ordered the ship arrested, and Sinochem timely filed a complaint in that tribunal.  The Chinese admiralty court rejected Malaysia Internationals jurisdictional objections to Sinochems complaint and that ruling was affirmed on appeal.


Shortly after the Chinese admiralty court ordered the vessels arrest, Malaysia International filed this action in a United States District Court, asserting that Sinochems preservation petition to the Chinese court contained misrepresentations, and seeking compensation for losses sustained due to the ships arrest.  Sinochem moved to dismiss on several grounds, including lack of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction and the doctrine of forum non conveniens, under which a federal district court may dismiss an action if a court abroad is the more appropriate and convenient forum for adjudicating the controversy.  The District Court determined it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the cause, concluded it lacked personal jurisdiction over Sinochem under Pennsylvania law, conjectured that limited discovery might reveal that it had personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure4(k)(2), but dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds, finding that the case could be adjudicated adequately and more conveniently in the Chinese courts.  Agreeing that there was subject-matter jurisdiction and that personal jurisdiction could not be resolved sans discovery, the Third Circuit panel held that the District Court could not dismiss the case under the forum non conveniens doctrine unless and until it determined definitively that it had both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.  
Held:A district court has discretion to respond at once to a defendants forum non conveniens plea, and need not take up first any other threshold objection.  In particular, a court need not resolve whether it has authority to adjudicate the cause (subject-matter jurisdiction) or personal jurisdiction over the defendant if it determines that, in any event, a foreign tribunal is the more suitable arbiter of the merits of the case.  Pp.512.
(a)A federal court has discretion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear [the] case, and  trial in the chosen forum would establish  oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant  out of all proportion to plaintiffs convenience, or  the chosen forum [is] inappropriate because of considerations affecting the courts own administrative and legal problems.  American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 447448.  Such a dismissal reflects a courts assessment of a range of considerations, most notably the convenience to the parties and the practical difficulties that can attend the adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U. S. 706, 723.  A defendant invoking forum non conveniens ordinarily bears a heavy burden in opposing the plaintiffs chosen forum.  When the plaintiffs choice is not its home forum, however, the presumption in the plaintiffs favor applies with less force, for the assumption that the chosen forum is appropriate is then less reasonable.  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U. S. 235, 255256.  Pp.56.         


(b)Although a federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first determining that it has jurisdiction over the cause (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the parties (personal jurisdiction), see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 93102, there is no mandatory sequencing of nonmerits issues, see Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 584.  A court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits, Id., at 585.    Pp.78.


(c) Forum non conveniens is a nonmerits ground for dismissal.  See American Dredging, 510 U. S., at 454; Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp., 486 U. S. 140, 148.  A district court therefore may dispose of an action by a forum non conveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of convenience, fairness, and judicial economy so warrant.  Forum non conveniens, like other threshold issues, may involve a brush with factual and legal issues of the underlying dispute.  Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 529.  But the critical point, rendering a forum non conveniens determination a nonmerits issue that can be determined before taking up jurisdictional inquiries is this: Resolving a forum non conveniens motion does not entail any assumption by the court of substantive law-declaring power.  Statements in Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, that forum non conveniens can never apply if there is absence of jurisdiction, id., at 504, and that [i]n all cases in which  forum non conveniens comes into play, it presupposes at least two forums in which the defendant is amenable to process, id., at 506507, account in large part for the Third Circuits conclusion.  Those statements draw their meaning from the context in which they were embedded.  Gulf Oil answered in the affirmative the question whether a court that had jurisdiction over the cause and the parties and was a proper venue could nevertheless dismiss the action under the forum non conveniens doctrine.  Gulf Oil did not address the issue decided here: whether a federal court can presume, rather than dispositively decide, its jurisdiction before dismissing under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  The quoted statements, confined to the setting in which they were made, are no hindrance to the decision reached today.  The Third Circuits further concernthat a court failing first to establish its jurisdiction could not condition a forum non conveniens dismissal on the defendants waiver of any statute of limitations defense or objection to the foreign forums jurisdiction, and thus could not shield the plaintiff against a foreign tribunals refusal to entertain the suitis not implicated on these facts.  Malaysia International faces no genuine risk that the more convenient forum will not take up the case.  This Court therefore need not decide whether a court conditioning a forum non conveniens dismissal on the waiver of jurisdictional or limitations defenses in the foreign forum must first determine its own authority to adjudicate the case.  Pp.811.


(d)This is a textbook case for immediate forum non conveniens dismissal.  The District Courts subject-matter jurisdiction presented an issue of first impression in the Third Circuit, and was considered at some length by the courts below.

06-102|"KEITH LANCE etal. v. MIKE COFFMAN, COLORADO
SECRETARY OF STATE
on appeal from the united states district court for
the district of colorado
No. 06641.Decided March 5, 2007
Per Curiam.

The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.  Art. I, 4, cl.1 (emphasis added).  When Colorado legislators were unable to redraw congressional districts after the 2000 census to accommodate an additional Representative, a state court did it for them.  See Beauprez v. Avalos, 42 P.3d 642 (Colo. 2002) (en banc).  The legislature was able to pass a redistricting plan in 2003, which Colorados Governor signed into law.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. 21101.


Colorados attorney general, however, filed an original action in the Colorado Supreme Court to enjoin Colorados secretary of state from implementing this new plan, noting that Article V, 44, of the Colorado Constitution limits redistricting to once per census.  The Colorado General Assembly intervened in the action to defend its plan.  The Colorado Supreme Court granted the injunction, holding that judicially-created districts are just as binding and permanent as districts created by the General Assembly, and that the court-drawn plan must remain in effect until the next decennial census.  People ex rel. Salazar v. Davidson, 79 P.3d 1221, 1231 (2003) (en banc), cert. denied, 541 U. S. 1093 (2004).  The court further held that this result did not offend the Elections Clause of the United States Constitution.  79 P.3d, at 1232.


Immediately after Salazar was decided, four Colorado citizensnone of whom had participated in Salazarfiled the instant action in Federal District Court.  They argued that Article V, 44, of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted by the Colorado Supreme Court, violates their rights under the Elections Clause.


The District Court initially determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit in light of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, but we vacated and remanded for further proceedings.  Lance v. Dennis, 546 U. S. 459 (2006) (per curiam).  On remand, the District Court held that the citizen-plaintiffs had standing to bring their Elections Clause challenge.  Lance v. Dennis, 444 F.Supp. 2d 1149, 11541155 (2006).  The court went on, however, to hold that the suit was barred by issue preclusion because the plaintiffs stand in privity with the Secretary of State and the General Assembly, who were on the losing side in the Salazar litigation.  444 F.Supp. 2d, at 1161.  The concurring judge concluded that appellants lacked standing to sue in the first place.  Id., at 1162 (Porfilio, J., concurring in result).  Plaintiffs appeal once again.


Federal courts must determine that they have jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 9495 (1998).*  Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to Cases and Controversies.  One component of the case-or-controversy requirement is standing, which requires a plaintiff to demonstrate the now-familiar elements of injury in fact, causation, and redressability.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560561 (1992).  We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about governmentclaiming only harm to his and every citizens interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at largedoes not state an Article III case or controversy.  Id., at 573574.  See also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 8) (refusing to create an exception to the general prohibition on taxpayer standing for challenges to state tax or spending decisions, and observing that taxpayer standing has been rejected because the alleged injury is not concrete and particularized, but instead a grievance the taxpayer suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally (citation omitted)).


Our refusal to serve as a forum for generalized grievances has a lengthy pedigree.  In Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126 (1922), for example, a citizen sued the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to challenge the procedures by which the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified.  We dismissed the suit because it was not a case within the meaning of  Article III.  Id., at 129.  The plaintiff sought to assert only the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law and that the public moneys be not wasted.  Ibid.  Obviously, we held, this general right does not entitle a private citizen to institute [a suit] in the federal courts.  Id., at 129130.


Similarly, in Ex parte Lvitt, 302 U. S. 633 (1937) (per curiam), we dismissed a citizen suit claiming that Justice Blacks appointment to this Court contravened the Constitutions Ineligibility Clause, Art.I, 6, cl.2.  We found that the petitioner had no interest in the suit other than that of a citizen and a member of the bar of this Court.  302 U. S.,  at 634.  That was not enough.  To have standing, we observed, a plaintiff must have more than a general interest common to all members of the public.  Ibid.  See also Frothingham v. Mellon, decided with Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (taxpayer standing cannot be predicated upon an injury the plaintiff suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally).  Cf. Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U. S. 405, 406 (1900) ([E]ven in a proceeding which he prosecutes for the benefit of the public  [the plaintiff] must generally aver an injury peculiar to himself, as distinguished from the great body of his fellow citizens).


 A pair of more recent cases further illustrates the point.  In United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (1974), a federal taxpayer challenged the Governments failure to disclose certain CIA expenditures as a violation of the Constitutions Accounts Clause, which requires that a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.  Art.I, 9, cl.7.  Relying on Lvitt, this Court dismissed the claim as a generalized grievance that is plainly undifferentiated and common to all members of the public.  Richardson, 418 U. S., at 176177.  See also id., at 191 (Powell, J., concurring) (The power recognized in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), is a potent one.  Its prudent use seems to me incompatible with unlimited notions of taxpayer and citizen standing).


The same day, in Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), we addressed standing to bring a challenge under the Constitutions Incompatibility Clause, which provides that no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.  Art.I, 6, cl.2.  Citizen-taxpayers brought a lawsuit contending that Members of Congress who were also members of the military Reserves violated the Incompatibility Clause.  This Court dismissed for lack of standing.  It reaffirm[ed] Lvitt in holding that standing to sue may not be predicated upon an interest of the kind alleged here which is held in common by all members of the public, because of the necessarily abstract nature of the injury all citizens share.  418 U. S., at 220.  Refusing to entertain generalized grievances ensures that there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in a particular case, and it helps guarantee that courts fashion remedies no broader than required by the precise facts to which the courts ruling would be applied.  Id., at 221222.  In short, it ensures that courts exercise power that is judicial in nature.


The instant case parallels Fairchild, Lvitt, and their progeny.  The plaintiffs here are four Colorado voters.  Three days after the Colorado Supreme Court issued its decision in Salazar, they filed a complaint alleging that Article V, 44 of the Colorado Constitution, as interpreted in Salazar, violated [the Elections Clause] of the U. S. Constitution by depriving the state legislature of its responsibility to draw congressional districts.  Lance v. Davidson, 379 F.Supp. 2d 1117, 1122 (2005).  In light of the discussion above, the problem with this allegation should be obvious: The only injury plaintiffs allege is that the lawspecifically the Elections Clausehas not been followed.  This injury is precisely the kind of undifferentiated, generalized grievance about the conduct of government that we have refused to countenance in the past.  It is quite different from the sorts of injuries alleged by plaintiffs in voting rights cases where we have found standing.  See, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 207208 (1962).  Because plaintiffs assert no particularized stake in the litigation, we hold that they lack standing to bring their Elections Clause claim.


Our two decisions construing the term Legislature in the Elections Clause do not contradict this holding.  Each of these cases was filed by a relator on behalf of the State rather than private citizens acting on their own behalf, as is the case here.  See State ex rel. Smiley v. Holm, 184 Min. 647, 238 N.W. 792 (1931) (per curiam), revd subnom. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355 (1932); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565 (1916).  In neither case did we address whether a private citizen had alleged a concrete and particularized injury sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III.


The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is therefore vacated in part, and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the Elections Clause claim for lack of standing.  We affirm the District Courts dismissal of the Petition Clause claim.
It is so ordered.
*Our prior decision in this case did not violate this principle because Rooker-Feldman concerns a district courts subject-matter jurisdiction, Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 291 (2005), and there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy, Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S. 574, 578 (1999).

06-641|"WHORTON, DIRECTOR, NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS v. BOCKTING
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05595.Argued November 1, 2006Decided February 28, 2007
At respondents trial for sexual assault on his 6-year-old stepdaughter, the court determined that the child was too distressed to testify and allowed respondents wife and a police detective to recount her out-of-court statements about the assaults, as permitted by Nevada law, rejecting respondents claim that admitting this testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause.  He was convicted and sentenced to prison.  On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court found the childs statements constitutional under Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, then this Courts governing precedent, which had held that the Confrontation Clause permitted the admission of a hearsay statement made by a declarant unavailable to testify if the statement bore sufficient indicia of reliability, id., at 66.  Respondent renewed his Confrontation Clause claim in a subsequent federal habeas petition, which the District Court denied.  While his appeal was pending in the Ninth Circuit, this Court overruled Roberts in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, holding that testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial are admissible only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine [the witness], id., at 59, and concluding that Roberts interpretation of the Confrontation Clause was unsound, id., at 60.  Respondent contended that had Crawford been applied to his case, the childs statements would not have been admitted, and that it should have been applied because it was either an old rule in existence at the time of his conviction or a watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding, Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495 (quoting Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (plurality opinion)).  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Crawford was a new rule, but a watershed rule that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.
Held:Crawford announced a new rule of criminal procedure that does not fall within the Teague exception for watershed rules.  Pp.814.
(a)Under Teagues framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule generally applies only to cases still on direct review and applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if it (1) is substantive or (2) is a watershed rule that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.  Respondents conviction became final on direct appeal well before Crawford was decided, and Crawford announced a new rule, i.e., a rule that  was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendants conviction became final, Saffle, supra, at 488.  It is flatly inconsistent with Roberts, which it overruled.  The explicit overruling of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.  Saffle, supra, at 488.  Prior to Crawford, reasonable jurists, Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 467, could have concluded that Roberts governed the admission of testimonial hearsay statements made by an unavailable declarant.  Pp.89.


(b)Because Crawford announced a new rule and because that rule is procedural and not substantive, it cannot be applied here unless it is a watershed rul[e] that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.  This exception is extremely narrow, Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U. S. 348, 351, and since Teague, this Court has rejected every claim that a new rule has satisfied the requirements necessary to qualify as a watershed.  The Crawford rule does not meet those two requirements.  Pp.1014.


(1)First, the rule does not implicate the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding because it is not necessary to prevent an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction, Summerlin, supra, at 356.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, the only case that this Court has identified as qualifying under this exception, provides guidance.  There, the Court held that counsel must be appointed for an indigent defendant charged with a felony because, when such a defendant is denied representation, the risk of an unreliable verdict is intolerably high.  The Crawford rule is not comparable to the Gideon rule.  It is much more limited in scope, and its relationship to the accuracy of the factfinding process is far less direct and profound.  Crawford overruled Roberts because Roberts was inconsistent with the original understanding of the Confrontation Clause, not because the Crawford rules overall effect would be to improve the accuracy of factfinding in criminal trials.  With respect to testimonial out-of-court statements, Crawford is more restrictive than Roberts, which may improve the accuracy of factfinding in some criminal cases.  But whatever improvement in reliability Crawford produced must be considered together with Crawfords elimination of Confrontation Clause protection against the admission of unreliable out-of-court nontestimonial statements.  It is thus unclear whether Crawford decreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of-court statements that may be admitted in criminal trials.  But the question is not whether Crawford resulted in some net improvement in the accuracy of factfinding in criminal cases, but, as the dissent below noted, whether testimony admissible under Roberts is so much more unreliable that, without the Crawford rule, the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished, Summerlin, supra, at 352.  Crawford did not effect a change of this magnitude.  Pp.1113.


(2)Second, the Crawford rule did not alter [this Courts] understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding, Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242.  The Court has not hesitated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules than Gideons do not qualify.  Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 418.  The Crawford rule, while certainly important, is not in the same category with Gideon, which effected a profound and sweeping change.  Beard, supra, at 418.  Pp.1314.
399 F.3d 1010 and 408 F.3d 1127, reversed and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The Crawford rule does not meet those two requirements.  Pp.1014.


(1)First, the rule does not implicate the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding because it is not necessary to prevent an impermissibly large risk of an inaccurate conviction, Summerlin, supra, at 356.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, the only case that this Court has identified as qualifying under this exception, provides guidance.

It is thus unclear whether Crawford decreased or increased the number of unreliable out-of-court statements that may be admitted in criminal trials.  But the question is not whether Crawford resulted in some net improvement in the accuracy of factfinding in criminal cases, but, as the dissent below noted, whether testimony admissible under Roberts is so much more unreliable that, without the Crawford rule, the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished, Summerlin, supra, at 352.  Crawford did not effect a change of this magnitude.  Pp.1113.


(2)Second, the Crawford rule did not alter [this Courts] understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding, Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 242.  The Court has not hesitated to hold that less sweeping and fundamental rules than Gideons do not qualify.  Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 418.  The Crawford rule, while certainly important, is not in the same category with Gideon, which effected a profound and sweeping change.  Beard, supra, at 418.  Pp.1314.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 051240.Argued November 6, 2006Decided February 21, 2007
In January 1994, Chicago police arrested petitioner, a minor, for murder.  He was tried and convicted, but the charges were ultimately dropped in April 2002.  In April 2003, he filed this suit under 42 U. S.C. 1983 against the city and several of its officers, seeking damages for, inter alia, his unlawful arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed, ruling that the 1983 suit was time barred because petitioners cause of action accrued at the time of his arrest, not when his conviction was later set aside.  
Held:The statute of limitations upon a 1983 claim seeking damages for a false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, where the arrest is followed by criminal proceedings, begins to run at the time the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process.  Pp.212.
(a)The statute of limitations in a 1983 suit is that provided by the State for personal-injury torts, e.g., Owens v. Okure, 488 U. S. 235, 249250; here, two years under Illinois law.  For false imprisonment and its subspecies false arrest, [t]he  cause[s] of action provid[ing] the closest analogy to claims of the type considered here, Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 484, the statute of limitations begins to run when the alleged false imprisonment ends, see, e.g., 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts 899, Comment c, that is, in the present context, when the victim becomes held pursuant to legal process, see, e.g., Heck, supra, at 484.  Thus, petitioners false imprisonment did not end, as he contends, when he was released from custody after the State dropped the charges against him, but rather when he appeared before the examining magistrate and was bound over for trial.  Since more than two years elapsed between that date and the filing of this suiteven leaving out of the count the period before he reached his majoritythe action was time barred.  Pp.27.


(b)Petitioners contention that Heck compels the conclusion that his suit could not accrue until the State dropped its charges against him is rejected.  The Heck Court held that in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been [set aside].  A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under 1983.  512 U. S., at 486487.  Even assuming that the Heck deferred-accrual rule would be applied to the date petitioner was first held pursuant to legal process, there was in existence at that time no criminal conviction that the cause of action would impugn.  What petitioner seeks is the adoption of a principle going well beyond Heck: that an action which would impugn an anticipated future conviction cannot be brought until that conviction occurs and is set aside.  The impracticality of such a speculative rule is obvious.


The fact that 1983 actions sometimes accrue before the setting aside ofindeed, even before the existence ofthe related criminal conviction raises the question whether, assuming the Heck bar takes effect when the later conviction is obtained, the statute of limitations on the once valid cause of action is tolled as long as the Heck bar subsists.  However, this Court generally refers to state-law tolling rules, e.g., Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536, 538539, and is unaware of Illinois cases providing tolling in even remotely comparable circumstances.  Moreover, a federal tolling rule to this effect would create a jurisprudential limbo in which it would not be known whether tolling is appropriate by reason of the Heck bar until it is established that the newly entered conviction would be impugned by the not-yet-filed, and thus utterly indeterminate, 1983 claim. Pp.712.

05-1240|"MARRAMA v. CITIZENS BANK OF MASSACHUSETTS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 05996.Argued November 6, 2006Decided February 21, 2007
In filing his petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, petitioner Marrama misrepresented the value of his Maine property and that he had not transferred it during the preceding year.  Respondent DeGiacomo, the trustee of Marramas estate, stated his intention to recover the Maine property as an estate asset.  Thereafter, Marrama sought to convert the proceeding to Chapter 13, but the trustee and respondent bank, Marramas principal creditor, objected, contending that the request to convert was made in bad faith and would constitute an abuse of the bankruptcy process.  The Bankruptcy Judge denied Marramas request, finding bad faith.  Affirming, the First Circuits Bankruptcy Appellate Panel rejected Marramas argument that he had an absolute right to convert under 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that a Chapter 7 debtor may convert a case so long as it has not been converted previously, and that a waiver of the right to convert is unenforceable.  The First Circuit also rejected that argument, emphasizing, inter alia, that a bankruptcy court has the authority to dismiss a Chapter 13 petition based on a debtors bad faith, and that a first-time motion to convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13 should not be treated differently from the filing of a Chapter 13 petition in the first instance.  
Held:Marrama forfeited his right to proceed under Chapter 13.  The broad description of the right to convert as absolute in Senate and House Committee Reports fails to give full effect to the express limitation of 706(d), which provides that a case may not be converted to a case under another chapter of this title unless the debtor may be a debtor under such chapter.  That text expressly conditioned Marramas right to convert on his ability to qualify as a Chapter 13 debtor.  Marrama does not qualify as such a debtor under 1307(c), which provides that a Chapter 13 proceeding may be either dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding for cause.  Bankruptcy courts routinely treat dismissal for prepetition bad-faith conduct as implicitly authorized by the words for cause, and a ruling that an individuals Chapter 13 case should be dismissed or converted to Chapter 7 because of bad faith is tantamount to a ruling that the individual does not qualify as a Chapter 13 debtor.  Congress gave honest but unfortunate debtor[s] Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 287, the chance to repay their debts should they acquire the means to do so, and 706(a) protects a debtor from being forced to waive that right.  However, a provision protecting a borrower from waiver is not a shield against forfeiture.  Neither 706 nor 1307(c) limits a courts authority to take appropriate action in response to fraudulent conduct by the atypical litigant who has demonstrated that he is not entitled to the relief available to the typical debtor.  On the contrary, bankruptcy judges broad authority to take necessary or appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process described in Code 105(a) is adequate to authorize an immediate denial of a 706 motion to convert in lieu of a conversion order that merely postpones the allowance of equivalent relief and may give a debtor an opportunity to take action prejudicial to creditors.

05-996|"PHILIP MORRIS USA v. WILLIAMS, personal representative of ESTATE OF WILLIAMS, DECEASED
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 051256.Argued October 31, 2006Decided February 20, 2007
In this state negligence and deceit lawsuit, a jury found that Jesse Williams death was caused by smoking and that petitioner Philip Morris, which manufactured the cigarettes he favored, knowingly and falsely led him to believe that smoking was safe.  In respect to deceit, it awarded $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages to respondent, the personal representative of Williams estate.  The trial court reduced the latter award, but it was restored by the Oregon Court of Appeals.  The State Supreme Court rejected Philip Morris arguments that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could not punish Philip Morris for injury to persons not before the court, and that the roughly 100-to-1 ratio the $79.5 million award bore to the compensatory damages amount indicated a grossly excessive punitive award.  
Held:
1.A punitive damages award based in part on a jurys desire to punish a defendant for harming nonparties amounts to a taking of property from the defendant without due process.  Pp.410.


(a)While [p]unitive damages may properly be imposed to further a States legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition, BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559, 568, unless a State insists upon proper standards to cabin the jurys discretionary authority, its punitive damages system may deprive a defendant of fair notice  of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose, id., at 574; may threaten arbitrary punishments, State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U. S. 408, 416; and, where the amounts are sufficiently large, may impose one States (or one jurys) policy choice upon neighboring States with different public policies, BMW, supra, at 571572.  Thus, the Constitution imposes limits on both the procedures for awarding punitive damages and amounts forbidden as grossly excessive.  See Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415, 432.  The Constitutions procedural limitations are considered here.  Pp.45.


(b)The Due Process Clause forbids a State to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury inflicted on strangers to the litigation.  For one thing, a defendant threatened with punishment for such injury has no opportunity to defend against the charge.  See Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56, 66.  For another, permitting such punishment would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation and magnify the fundamental due process concerns of this Courts pertinent casesarbitrariness, uncertainty, and lack of notice.  Finally, the Court finds no authority to support using punitive damages awards to punish a defendant for harming others.  BMW, supra, at 568, n.11, distinguished.  Respondent argues that showing harm to others is relevant to a different part of the punitive damages constitutional equation, namely, reprehensibility.  While evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk to the general public, and so was particularly reprehensible, a jury may not go further and use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly for harms to those nonparties.  Given the risks of unfairness, it is constitutionally important for a court to provide assurance that a jury is asking the right question; and given the risks of arbitrariness, inadequate notice, and imposing one States policies on other States, it is particularly important that States avoid procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance.  Pp.58.  


(c)The Oregon Supreme Courts opinion focused on more than reprehensibility.  In rejecting Philip Morris claim that the Constitution prohibits using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties, it made three statements.  The firstthat this Court held in State Farm only that a jury could not base an award on dissimilar acts of a defendantwas correct, but this Court now explicitly holds that a jury may not punish for harm to others.  This Court disagrees with the second statementthat if a jury cannot punish for the conduct, there is no reason to consider itsince the Due Process Clause prohibits a States inflicting punishment for harm to nonparties, but permits a jury to consider such harm in determining reprehensibility.  The third statementthat it is unclear how a jury could consider harm to nonparties and then withhold that consideration from the punishment calculusraises the practical problem of how to know whether a jury punished the defendant for causing injury to others rather than just took such injury into account under the rubric of reprehensibility.  The answer is that state courts cannot authorize procedures that create an unreasonable and unnecessary risk of any such confusion occurring.  Although States have some flexibility in determining what kind of procedures to implement to protect against that risk, federal constitutional law obligates them to provide some form of protection where the risk of misunderstanding is a significant one.  Pp.810.


2.Because the Oregon Supreme Courts application of the correct standard may lead to a new trial, or a change in the level of the punitive damages award, this Court will not consider the question whether the award is constitutionally grossly excessive.  P.10.

05-1256|"WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. ROSS-SIMMONS HARDWOOD LUMBER CO., INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05381.Argued November 28, 2006Decided February 20, 2007
Respondent Ross-Simmons, a sawmill, filed suit under 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging that petitioner Weyerhaeuser drove it out of business by bidding up the price of sawlogs to a level that prevented Ross-Simmons from being profitable.  The District Court, inter alia, rejected Weyerhaeusers proposed predatory-bidding jury instructions that incorporated elements of the test applied to predatory-pricing claims in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209.  The jury returned a verdict against Weyerhaeuser.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Weyerhaeusers argument that Brooke Groups standard should apply to predatory-bidding claims.
Held:The test this Court applied to predatory-pricing claims in Brooke Group also applies to predatory-bidding claims.  Pp.413.
(a)Predatory pricing is a scheme in which the predator reduces the sale price of its product hoping to drive competitors out of business and, once competition has been vanquished, raises prices to a supracompetitive level.  Brooke Group established two prerequisites to recovery on a predatory-pricing claim: First, a plaintiff must show that the prices complained of are below cost, 509 U. S., at 222, because allowing recovery for above-cost price cutting could chill conductprice cuttingthat directly benefits consumers.  Second, a plaintiff must show that the alleged predator had a dangerous probability of recouping its investment in below-cost pricing, id., at 224, because without such a probability, it is highly unlikely that a firm would engage in predatory pricing.  The costs of erroneous findings of predatory-pricing liability are quite high because [t]he mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricinglowering pricesis the same mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition, and therefore, mistaken liability findings would chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.  Id., at 26.  Pp.47.


(b)Predatory bidding involves the exercise of market power on the markets buy, or input, side.  To engage in predatory bidding, a purchaser bids up the market price of an input so high that rival buyers cannot survive, thus acquiring monopsony power, which is market power on the buy side of the market.  Once a predatory bidder causes competing buyers to exit the market, it will attempt to drive down input prices to reap supracompetitive profits that will at least offset the losses it suffered in bidding up input prices.  Pp.78.


(c)Predatory-pricing and predatory-bidding claims are analytically similar.  And the close theoretical connection between monopoly and monopsony suggests that similar legal standards should apply to both sorts of claims.  Both involve the deliberate use of unilateral pricing measures for anticompetitive purposes and both require firms to incur certain short-term losses on the chance that they might later make supracompetitive profits.  More importantly, predatory bidding mirrors predatory pricing in respects deemed significant in Brooke Group.  Because rational businesses will rarely suffer short-term losses in hopes of reaping supracompetitive profits, Brooke Groups conclusion that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful, 509 U. S., at 226, applies with equal force to predatory-bidding schemes.  And like the predatory conduct in Brooke Group, actions taken in a predatory-bidding scheme are often the very essence of competition, ibid., because a failed predatory-bidding scheme can be a boon to consumers, see id., at 224.  Predatory bidding also presents less of a direct threat of consumer harm than predatory pricing, which achieves ultimate success by charging higher prices to consumers, because a predatory bidder does not necessarily rely on raising prices in the output market to recoup its losses.  Pp.812.


(d)Given these similarities, Brooke Groups two-pronged test should apply to predatory-bidding claims.  A predatory-bidding plaintiff must prove that the predators bidding on the buy side caused the cost of the relevant output to rise above the revenues generated in the sale of those outputs.  Because the risk of chilling procompetitive behavior with too lax a liability standard is as serious here as it was in Brooke Group, only higher bidding that leads to below-cost pricing in the relevant output market will suffice as a basis for predatory-bidding liability.  A predatory-bidding plaintiff also must prove that the defendant has a dangerous probability of recouping the losses incurred in bidding up input prices through the exercise of monopsony power.  Making such a showing will require a close analysis of both the scheme alleged by the plaintiff and the [relevant markets] structure and conditions, 509 U. S., at 226.  Pp.1213.


(e)Because Ross-Simmons has conceded that it has not satisfied the Brooke Group standard, its predatory-bidding theory of liability cannot support the jurys verdict.  P.13.

			"|"WEYERHAEUSER CO. v. ROSS-SIMMONS HARDWOOD LUMBER CO., INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05381.Argued November 28, 2006Decided February 20, 2007
Respondent Ross-Simmons, a sawmill, filed suit under 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging that petitioner Weyerhaeuser drove it out of business by bidding up the price of sawlogs to a level that prevented Ross-Simmons from being profitable.  The District Court, inter alia, rejected Weyerhaeusers proposed predatory-bidding jury instructions that incorporated elements of the test applied to predatory-pricing claims in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U. S. 209.  The jury returned a verdict against Weyerhaeuser.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Weyerhaeusers argument that Brooke Groups standard should apply to predatory-bidding claims.
Held:The test this Court applied to predatory-pricing claims in Brooke Group also applies to predatory-bidding claims.  Pp.413.
(a)Predatory pricing is a scheme in which the predator reduces the sale price of its product hoping to drive competitors out of business and, once competition has been vanquished, raises prices to a supracompetitive level.  Brooke Group established two prerequisites to recovery on a predatory-pricing claim: First, a plaintiff must show that the prices complained of are below cost, 509 U. S., at 222, because allowing recovery for above-cost price cutting could chill conductprice cuttingthat directly benefits consumers.  Second, a plaintiff must show that the alleged predator had a dangerous probability of recouping its investment in below-cost pricing, id., at 224, because without such a probability, it is highly unlikely that a firm would engage in predatory pricing.  The costs of erroneous findings of predatory-pricing liability are quite high because [t]he mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricinglowering pricesis the same mechanism by which a firm stimulates competition, and therefore, mistaken liability findings would chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.  Id., at 26.  Pp.47.


(b)Predatory bidding involves the exercise of market power on the markets buy, or input, side.  To engage in predatory bidding, a purchaser bids up the market price of an input so high that rival buyers cannot survive, thus acquiring monopsony power, which is market power on the buy side of the market.  Once a predatory bidder causes competing buyers to exit the market, it will attempt to drive down input prices to reap supracompetitive profits that will at least offset the losses it suffered in bidding up input prices.  Pp.78.


(c)Predatory-pricing and predatory-bidding claims are analytically similar.  And the close theoretical connection between monopoly and monopsony suggests that similar legal standards should apply to both sorts of claims.  Both involve the deliberate use of unilateral pricing measures for anticompetitive purposes and both require firms to incur certain short-term losses on the chance that they might later make supracompetitive profits.  More importantly, predatory bidding mirrors predatory pricing in respects deemed significant in Brooke Group.  Because rational businesses will rarely suffer short-term losses in hopes of reaping supracompetitive profits, Brooke Groups conclusion that predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful, 509 U. S., at 226, applies with equal force to predatory-bidding schemes.  And like the predatory conduct in Brooke Group, actions taken in a predatory-bidding scheme are often the very essence of competition, ibid., because a failed predatory-bidding scheme can be a boon to consumers, see id., at 224.  Predatory bidding also presents less of a direct threat of consumer harm than predatory pricing, which achieves ultimate success by charging higher prices to consumers, because a predatory bidder does not necessarily rely on raising prices in the output market to recoup its losses.  Pp.812.


(d)Given these similarities, Brooke Groups two-pronged test should apply to predatory-bidding claims.  A predatory-bidding plaintiff must prove that the predators bidding on the buy side caused the cost of the relevant output to rise above the revenues generated in the sale of those outputs.  Because the risk of chilling procompetitive behavior with too lax a liability standard is as serious here as it was in Brooke Group, only higher bidding that leads to below-cost pricing in the relevant output market will suffice as a basis for predatory-bidding liability.  A predatory-bidding plaintiff also must prove that the defendant has a dangerous probability of recouping the losses incurred in bidding up input prices through the exercise of monopsony power.  Making such a showing will require a close analysis of both the scheme alleged by the plaintiff and the [relevant markets] structure and conditions, 509 U. S., at 226.  Pp.1213.

05-381|"LAWRENCE v. FLORIDA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 058820.Argued October 31, 2006Decided February 20, 2007
The 1-year statute of limitations for seeking federal habeas relief from a state-court judgment is tolled while an application for State post-conviction or other collateral review is pending.  28 U. S.C. 2244(d)(2).  Petitioner Lawrence filed a state postconviction relief application 364 days after his conviction became final.  The trial court denied relief, the State Supreme Court affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  While the certiorari petition was pending, Lawrence filed the present federal habeas application.  Then-applicable Eleventh Circuit precedent foreclosed any argument that the limitations period was tolled by the pendency of the certiorari petition.  Thus, the District Court dismissed Lawrences application as untimely because he waited 113 days after the State Supreme Courts mandatewell beyond the one day that remained in the limitations periodto file the application.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
Held: 
1.Section 2244(d)(2) does not toll the 1-year limitations period during the pendency of a certiorari petition in this Court.  Pp.38.


(a) Read naturally, the statutes text means that the statute of limitations is tolled only while state courts review the application.  A state postconviction application remains pending until the application has achieved final resolution through the States postconviction procedures.  Carey v. Saffold, 536 U. S. 214, 220.  This Court is not a part of those procedures, which end when the state courts have finally resolved the application.  The application is therefore not pending after the state courts postconviction review is complete.  If it were, it is difficult to understand how a state prisoner could exhaust state postconviction remedies without filing a certiorari petition.  Yet state prisoners need not petition for certiorari to exhaust state remedies.  Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 435438.  Pp.35.


(b)Lawrence argues that 2244(d)(2) should be construed to have the same meaning as 2244(d)(1)(A), which refers to the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  (Emphasis added.)  While direct review has long included review by this Court, Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527528, 2244(d)(2) refers exclusively to State post-conviction or other collateral review, language not easily interpreted to include participation by a federal court.  And although the time for seeking direct review includes the period for filing a certiorari petition, 2244(d)(2) makes no reference to the time for seeking review of a state postconviction courts judgment.  Instead, it seeks to know when a state review application is pending.  A more analogous statutory provision, 2263(b)(2), contains a limitations period that is tolled from the date on which the first petition for post-conviction review or other collateral relief is filed until the final State court disposition of such petition.  Although this differs from 2244(d)(2)s language, the language used in both sections clearly provides that tolling hinges on the pendency of state review.  This interpretation of 2244(d)(2), results in few practical problems.  Because this Court rarely grants review of state postconviction proceedings, it is unlikely that a federal district court would duplicate this Courts work or analysis.  In any event, a district court concerned about duplication can stay a habeas application until this Court acts.  Even in the extremely rare case in which a state court grants relief and the State prevails on certiorari, a prisoner whose subsequent federal habeas petition may be entitled to equitable tolling in light of arguably extraordinary circumstances and the prisoners diligence.  See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418, and n. 8.  In contrast to these hypothetical problems, allowing the statute of limitations to be tolled by certiorari petitions would provide incentives for state prisoners to file such petitions as a delay tactic, regardless of the merit of their claims.  Pp. 58.


2.Assuming, without deciding, that 2244(d)(2) allows for equitable tolling, Lawrence falls far short of showing extraordinary circumstances, Pace, supra, at 418, necessary to support equitable tolling of his otherwise untimely claims.  Pp. 89.
421 F.3d 1221, affirmed.

05-8820|"OSBORN v. HALEY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 05593.Argued October 30, 2006Decided January 22, 2007
The federal statute commonly known as the Westfall Act accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts undertaken in the course of their official duties, 28 U. S.C. 2679(b)(1), and empowers the Attorney General to certify that a federal employee sued for wrongful or negligent conduct was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,  2679(d)(1), (2).  Upon such certification, the United States is substituted as defendant in place of the employee, and the action is thereafter governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act.  If the action commenced in state court, the Westfall Act calls for its removal to a federal district court, and renders the Attorney Generals certification conclusiv[e]  for purposes of removal.  2679(d)(2).


Plaintiff-petitioner Pat Osborn sued federal employee Barry Haley in state court.  Osborn alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor, that he conspired to cause her wrongful discharge, and that his efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment.  The United States Attorney, serving as the Attorney Generals delegate, certified that Haley was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the conduct alleged in Osborns complaint.  She thereupon removed the case to a federal district court, where she asserted that the alleged wrongdoing never occurred.  The District Court, relying in Osborns allegations, entered an order that rejected the Westfall Act certification, denied the Governments motion to substitute the United States as defendant in Haleys place, and remanded the case to the state court.  The Sixth Circuit vacated the District Courts order, holding that a Westfall Act certification is not improper simply because the United States denies the occurrence of the incident on which the plaintiff centrally relies.  Based on 2679(d)(2)s direction that certification is conclusiv[e]  for purposes of removal, the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to retain jurisdiction over the case.

Held: 
1.The Attorney Generals certification is conclusive for purposes of removal, i.e., once certification and removal are effected, exclusive competence to adjudicate the case resides in the federal court, and that court may not remand the suit to the state court.  Pp.917.


(a)The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the order rejecting the Attorney Generals certification and denying substitution of the United States as defendant.  Under the collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, the District Courts ruling, which effectively denied Haley Westfall Act protection, qualifies as a reviewable final decision under 28 U. S.C. 1291.  Meeting Cohens three criteria, the District Courts denial of certification and substitution conclusively decided a contested issue, the issue decided is important and separate from the merits of the action, and the District Courts disposition would be effectively unreviewable later in the litigation.  337 U. S., at 546.  Pp.911.


(b)The Sixth Circuit also had jurisdiction to review the District Courts remand order.  Pp.1117.


(1)The Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the District Courts remand order, notwithstanding 28 U. S.C. 1447(d), which states that [a]n order remanding a case to the State court  is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise .  This Court held, in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, that 1447(c) confines 1447(d)s scope.  Section 1447(c) provides that a case must be remanded if  it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.  Under Thermtron, only remand orders issued under 1447(c) and invoking the [mandatory ground] specified therein  are immune from review under 1447(d).  Id., at 346.  To determine whether Thermtrons reasoning controls here, the Westfall Acts design, particularly its prescriptions regarding the removal and remand of actions filed in state court, must be examined. 


When the Attorney General certifies that a federal employee named defendant in a state-court tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question, the action shall be removed to federal court and the United States must be substituted as the defendant.  2679(d)(2).  Of prime importance here, 2679(d)(2) concludes with the command that the certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.  (Emphasis added.)  This directive markedly differs from Congress instruction for cases in which the Attorney General refuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.  2679(d)(3).  In that event, the defendant-employee may petition the court in which the action is instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification.  If the employee so petitions in an action filed in state court, the Attorney General may, at his discretion, remove the action to federal court.  If removal has occurred, and thereafter the district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action  shall be remanded to the State court.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  


The Acts distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification and those in which he does not leads to the conclusion that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney Generals certification was unwarranted.  Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant for purposes of trial if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney Generals scope-of-employment certification was incorrect.  For purposes of establishing a forum for adjudication, however, 2679(d)(2) renders the Attorney Generals certification dispositive.  Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney Generals certification was erroneous, 2679(d)(2)s final instruction would be weightless.  Congress adopted the conclusiv[e]  for the purposes of removal language to foreclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another, Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 433, n.10.  The provision assures that once a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.  Id., at 440 (Souter, J., dissenting).  


Thermtron held that 1447(d) must be read together with 1447(c).  There is stronger cause to hold that 1447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted 2679(d)(2).  Both 1447(d) and 2679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions that aim to prevent prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.  United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 751.  Once the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum, 2679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.  By declaring certification conclusive as to the federal forums jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to state court based on the courts disagreement with the Attorney Generals scope-of-employment determination.  Of the two antishuttling commands, 1447(d) and 2679(d)(2), only one can prevail and the Court holds that the latter controls.  Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, 2679(d)(2) conclusively determines that the action shall be adjudicated in the federal forum, and may not be returned to the state system.  Pp.1116.


(2)The Westfall Acts command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to 2679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.  An Article III question could arise in this case only if, after full consideration, the District Court determined that Haley engaged in tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment.  Because, at that point, little would be left to adjudicate as to his liability, and because a significant federal question (whether he has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would aris[e] under federal law as that term is used in Article III.  Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have authority, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction.  Pp.1617.


2.Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Attorney General concludes, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.  Pp.1724. 


(a)Because the Westfall Acts purpose is to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is appropriate to afford protection to an employee on duty at the time and place of an incident alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred.  Just as the Governments certification that an employee was acting within the scope of his employment is subject to threshold judicial review, Lamagno, 515 U. S., at 434, so a complaints charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation.  Otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.  This position is supported by Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, which concerned 28 U. S.C. 1442, the federal officer removal statute.  Section 1442 allows a federal officer to remove a civil action from state court if the officer is sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.  The Court held in Willingham that the language of 1442 is broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.  395 U. S., at 406407.  There is no reason to conclude that the Attorney Generals ability to remove a suit to federal court under 2679(d)(2), unlike a federal officers ability to remove under 1442, should be controlled by the plaintiffs allegations.  Pp.1921.


(b)Tugging against this reading is a who decides concern.  If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, in fact, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial.  Upon the Attorney Generals certification, however, the action is deemed to be  brought against the United States, 2679(d)(2), and the Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in common-law suits, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign.  Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney Generals certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial.  The Westfall Acts core purposeto relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit and to place those burdens on the Governmentalso bears on the appropriate trier of any facts essential to certification.  Immunity-related issues should be decided at the earliest opportunity.  See, e.g., Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 228 (per curiam).  Pp.2224.  
422 F.3d 359, affirmed.

When the Attorney General certifies that a federal employee named defendant in a state-court tort action was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time in question, the action shall be removed to federal court and the United States must be substituted as the defendant.  2679(d)(2).  Of prime importance here, 2679(d)(2) concludes with the command that the certification of the Attorney General shall conclusively establish scope of office or employment for purposes of removal.  (Emphasis added.)  This directive markedly differs from Congress instruction for cases in which the Attorney General refuse[s] to certify scope of office or employment.  2679(d)(3).  In that event, the defendant-employee may petition the court in which the action is instituted to make the scope-of-employment certification.  If the employee so petitions in an action filed in state court, the Attorney General may, at his discretion, remove the action to federal court.  If removal has occurred, and thereafter the district court determines that the employee was not acting within the scope of his office or employment, the action  shall be remanded to the State court.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  


The Acts distinction between removed cases in which the Attorney General issues a scope-of-employment certification and those in which he does not leads to the conclusion that Congress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney Generals certification was unwarranted.  Section 2679(d)(2) does not preclude a district court from resubstituting the federal official as defendant for purposes of trial if the court determines, postremoval, that the Attorney Generals scope-of-employment certification was incorrect.  For purposes of establishing a forum for adjudication, however, 2679(d)(2) renders the Attorney Generals certification dispositive.  Were it open to a district court to remand a removed action on the ground that the Attorney Generals certification was erroneous, 2679(d)(2)s final instruction would be weightless.  Congress adopted the conclusiv[e]  for the purposes of removal language to foreclose needless shuttling of a case from one court to another, Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 515 U. S. 417, 433, n.10.  The provision assures that once a state tort action has been removed to a federal court after a certification by the Attorney General, it may never be remanded to the state system.  Id., at 440 (Souter, J., dissenting).  


Thermtron held that 1447(d) must be read together with 1447(c).  There is stronger cause to hold that 1447(c) and (d) must be read together with the later enacted 2679(d)(2).  Both 1447(d) and 2679(d)(2) are antishuttling provisions that aim to prevent prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.  United States v. Rice, 327 U. S. 742, 751.  Once the Attorney General certifies scope of employment, triggering removal of the case to a federal forum, 2679(d)(2) renders the federal court exclusively competent and categorically precludes a remand to the state court.  By declaring certification conclusive as to the federal forums jurisdiction, Congress has barred a district court from passing the case back to state court based on the courts disagreement with the Attorney Generals scope-of-employment determination.  Of the two antishuttling commands, 1447(d) and 2679(d)(2), only one can prevail and the Court holds that the latter controls.  Tailor-made for Westfall Act cases, 2679(d)(2) conclusively determines that the action shall be adjudicated in the federal forum, and may not be returned to the state system.  Pp.1116.


(2)The Westfall Acts command that a district court retain jurisdiction over a case removed pursuant to 2679(d)(2) does not run afoul of Article III.  An Article III question could arise in this case only if, after full consideration, the District Court determined that Haley engaged in tortious conduct outside the scope of his employment.  Because, at that point, little would be left to adjudicate as to his liability, and because a significant federal question (whether he has Westfall Act immunity) would have been raised at the outset, the case would aris[e] under federal law as that term is used in Article III.  Even if only state-law claims remained after resolution of the federal question, the District Court would have authority, consistent with Article III, to retain jurisdiction.  Pp.1617.


2.Westfall Act certification is proper when a federal officer charged with misconduct asserts, and the Attorney General concludes, that the incident or episode in suit never occurred.  Pp.1724. 


(a)Because the Westfall Acts purpose is to shield covered employees not only from liability but from suit, it is appropriate to afford protection to an employee on duty at the time and place of an incident alleged in a complaint who denies that the incident occurred.  Just as the Governments certification that an employee was acting within the scope of his employment is subject to threshold judicial review, Lamagno, 515 U. S., at 434, so a complaints charge of conduct outside the scope of employment, when contested, warrants immediate judicial investigation.  Otherwise, a federal employee would be stripped of suit immunity not by what the court finds, but by what the complaint alleges.  This position is supported by Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U. S. 402, which concerned 28 U. S.C. 1442, the federal officer removal statute.  Section 1442 allows a federal officer to remove a civil action from state court if the officer is sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.  The Court held in Willingham that the language of 1442 is broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of the duty to enforce federal law.  395 U. S., at 406407.  There is no reason to conclude that the Attorney Generals ability to remove a suit to federal court under 2679(d)(2), unlike a federal officers ability to remove under 1442, should be controlled by the plaintiffs allegations.  Pp.1921.


(b)Tugging against this reading is a who decides concern.  If the Westfall Act certification must be respected unless and until the District Court determines that Haley, in fact, engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment, then Osborn may be denied a jury trial.  Upon the Attorney Generals certification, however, the action is deemed to be  brought against the United States, 2679(d)(2), and the Seventh Amendment, which preserves the right to a jury trial in common-law suits, does not apply to proceedings against the sovereign.  Thus, at the time the district court reviews the Attorney Generals certification, the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial.  The Westfall Acts core purposeto relieve covered employees from the cost and effort of defending the lawsuit and to place those burdens on the Governmentalso bears on the appropriate trier of any facts essential to certification.  Immunity-related issues should be decided at the earliest opportunity.  See, e.g., Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 228 (per curiam).  Pp.2224.

05-593|"CUNNINGHAM v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district
No. 056551.Argued October 11, 2006Decided January 22, 2007
Petitioner Cunningham was tried and convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14.  Under Californias determinate sentencing law (DSL), that offense is punishable by one of three precise terms of imprisonment: a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years.  The DSL obliged the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12-year middle term unless the judge found one or more additional circumstances in aggravation.  Court Rules adopted to implement the DSL define circumstances in aggravation as facts that justify the upper term.  Those facts, the Rules provide, must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.  Based on a post-trial sentencing hearing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence six aggravating facts, including the particular vulnerability of the victim, and one mitigating fact, that Cunningham had no record of prior criminal conduct.  Concluding that the aggravators outweighed the sole mitigator, the judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The State Supreme Court denied review, but in a decision published nine days earlier, People v. Black, 35 Cal 4th 1230, 113 P.3d 534, that court held that the DSL survived Sixth Amendment inspection.
Held:The DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judges province, violates a defendants right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.822.
(a)In Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that, under the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than a prior conviction) that exposes a defendant to a sentence in excess of the relevant statutory maximum must be found by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence.  See 530 U. S. 466, 490.  The Court has applied the rule of Apprendi to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602, 609, facts permitting a sentence in excess of the standard range under Washingtons Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act), Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 304305, and facts triggering a sentence range elevation under the then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 243244.  Blakely and Booker bear most closely on the question presented here.  


The maximum penalty for Blakelys offense, under Washingtons Reform Act, was ten years imprisonment, but if no facts beyond those reflected in the jurys verdict were found by the trial judge, Blakely could not receive a sentence above a standard range of 49 to 53 months.  Blakely was sentenced to 90 months, more than three years above the standard range, based on the judges finding of deliberate cruelty.  Applying Apprendi, this Court held the sentence unconstitutional.  The State in Blakely endeavored to distinguish Apprendi, contending that Blakelys sentence was within the judges discretion based solely on the guilty verdict.  The Court dismissed that argument.  Blakely could not have been sentenced above the standard range absent an additional fact.  Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendments jury-trial guarantee.  It did not matter that Blakelys sentence, though outside the standard range, was within the 10-year maximum.  Because the judge could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range53 months, not 10 yearswas the relevant statutory maximum.  The Court also rejected the States arguments that Apprendi was satisfied because the Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of facts on which a judge might base a departure from the standard range, and because it ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judges discretion.


Booker was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The facts found by the jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed without undertaking additional factfinding.  The judge did so, making a finding that boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range.  This Court held Bookers sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amendment.  There was no distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in [Blakely].  543 U. S., at 233.  Both were mandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.  Ibid.  All Members of the Court agreed, however, that the Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amendment if they were advisory.  Ibid.  Facing the remedial question, the Court concluded that rendering the Guidelines advisory came closest to what Congress would have intended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth Amendment challenge.  Under the advisory Guidelines system described in Booker, judges would no longer be confined to the sentencing range dictated by the Guidelines, but would be obliged to take account of that range along with the sentencing goals enumerated in the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA).  Id., at 259, 264.  In place of the SRA provision governing appellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, the Court installed a reasonableness standard of review.  Id., at 261.  Pp. 815.


(b)In all material respects, Californias DSL resembles the sentencing systems invalidated in Blakely and Booker.  Following the reasoning in those cases, the middle term prescribed under California law, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum.  Because aggravating facts that authorize the upper term are found by the judge, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, the DSL violates the rule of Apprendi.  


While that should be the end of the matter, Blakely, 542 U. S., at 313, in People v. Black, the California Supreme Court insisted that the DSL survives inspection under our precedents.  The Black court reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL did not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a judge), 35 Cal.4th, at 12551256, 113 P.3d, at 543544.  This Court cautioned in Blakely, however, that broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in a particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from the force of this Courts decisions.  The Black court also urged that the DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing scheme; because the system is fair to defendants; and because the DSL requires statutory sentence enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators) to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Black courts examination, in short, satisfied it that Californias sentencing system does not implicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendments jury-trial guarantee.  This Courts decisions, however, leave no room for such an examination.  Asking whether a defendants basic jury-trial right is preserved, though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge, is the very inquiry Apprendis bright-line rule was designed to exclude.  


Ultimately, the Black court relied on an equation of Californias DSL to the post-Booker federal system.  That attempted comparison is unavailing.  The Booker Court held the Federal Guidelines incompatible with the Sixth Amendment because they were mandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges, 543 U. S., at 233.  To remedy the constitutional infirmity, the Court excised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as advisory only.  The DSL, however, does not resemble the advisory system the Court in Booker had in view.  Under Californias system, judges are not free to exercise their discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range.  Ibid.  Californias Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them.  Cunninghams sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years, but had to impose 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless the judge found facts allowing a sentence of 6 or 16 years.  Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, this Courts decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.  


The Black court attempted to rescue the DSLs judicial factfinding authority by typing it a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint operative in the post-Booker federal system.  Reasonableness, however, is not the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis.  The reasonableness requirement Booker anticipated for the federal system operates within the constitutional constraints delineated in this Courts precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.  Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment.  Bookers remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for rendering this Courts Sixth Amendment case law toothless.  Further elaboration here on the federal reasonableness standard is neither necessary nor proper.  The Court has granted review in two casesto be argued and decided later this Termraising questions trained on that matter.  Claiborne v. United States, No. 065618; Rita v. United States, No. 065754.  Pp.1521.  


(c)As to the adjustment of Californias sentencing system in light of the Courts ruling, [t]he ball . . . lies in [Californias] court.  Booker, 543 U. S., at 265.  Several States have modified their systems in the wake of Apprendi and Blakely to retain determinate sentencing, by calling upon the jury to find any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated sentence.  Other States have chosen to permit judges genuinely to exercise broad discretion . . . within a statutory range, which, everyone agrees, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  Id., at 233.  California may follow the paths taken by its sister States or otherwise alter its system, so long as it observes Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Courts decisions.  Pp.2122.

05-6551|"JONES v. BOCK, WARDEN, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 057058.Argued October 30, 2006Decided January 22, 2007*
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), in order to address the large number of prisoner complaints filed in federal court, mandates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit.  42 U. S.C. 1997e(a).  Petitioners, inmates in Michigan prisons, filed grievances using the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) grievance process.  After unsuccessfully seeking redress through that process, petitioner Jones filed a 42 U. S.C. 1983 suit against six prison officials.  The District Court dismissed on the merits as to four of them and as to two others found that Jones had failed to adequately plead exhaustion in his complaint.  Petitioner Williams also filed a 1983 suit after his two MDOC grievances were denied.  The District Court found that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to one of the grievances because he had not identified any of the respondents named in the lawsuit during the grievance process.  While the court found Williamss other claim properly exhausted, it dismissed the entire suit under the Sixth Circuits total exhaustion rule for PLRA cases.  Petitioner Waltons 1983 lawsuit also was dismissed under the total exhaustion rule because his MDOC grievance named only one of the six defendants in his lawsuit.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed in each case, relying on its procedural rules that require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants identified in the prisoners grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.
Held:The Sixth Circuits rules are not required by the PLRA, and crafting and imposing such rules exceeds the proper limits of the judicial role.  Pp.1024.
(a)Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.  There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA, Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524, but it is less clear whether the prisoner must plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint or the defendant must raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense.  Failure to exhaust is better viewed as an affirmative defense.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a short and plain statement of the claim in a complaint, and PLRA claims are typically brought under 42 U. S.C. 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all.  The fact that the PLRA dealt extensively with exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded or is an affirmative defense, is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense, including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. ___, ___.  Courts should generally not depart from the Federal Rules usual practice based on perceived policy concerns.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163  Those courts that require prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion contend that prisoner complaints must be treated outside of the typical framework if the PLRAs screening requirement is to function effectively.  But the screening requirement does notexplicitly or implicitlyjustify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself.

The applicable procedural rules that a prisoner must properly exhaust, Woodford, supra, at ___, are defined not by the PLRA, but by the prison grievance process itself.  As the MDOCs procedures make no mention of naming particular officials, the Sixth Circuits rule imposing such a prerequisite to proper exhaustion is unwarranted.

			"|"JONES v. BOCK, WARDEN, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 057058.Argued October 30, 2006Decided January 22, 2007*
The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA), in order to address the large number of prisoner complaints filed in federal court, mandates early judicial screening of prisoner complaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison grievance procedures before filing suit.  42 U. S.C. 1997e(a).  Petitioners, inmates in Michigan prisons, filed grievances using the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) grievance process.  After unsuccessfully seeking redress through that process, petitioner Jones filed a 42 U. S.C. 1983 suit against six prison officials.  The District Court dismissed on the merits as to four of them and as to two others found that Jones had failed to adequately plead exhaustion in his complaint.  Petitioner Williams also filed a 1983 suit after his two MDOC grievances were denied.  The District Court found that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to one of the grievances because he had not identified any of the respondents named in the lawsuit during the grievance process.  While the court found Williamss other claim properly exhausted, it dismissed the entire suit under the Sixth Circuits total exhaustion rule for PLRA cases.  Petitioner Waltons 1983 lawsuit also was dismissed under the total exhaustion rule because his MDOC grievance named only one of the six defendants in his lawsuit.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed in each case, relying on its procedural rules that require a prisoner to allege and demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint, permit suit only against defendants identified in the prisoners grievance, and require courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.
Held:The Sixth Circuits rules are not required by the PLRA, and crafting and imposing such rules exceeds the proper limits of the judicial role.  Pp.1024.
(a)Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.  There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA, Porter v. Nussle, 534 U. S. 516, 524, but it is less clear whether the prisoner must plead and demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint or the defendant must raise lack of exhaustion as an affirmative defense.  Failure to exhaust is better viewed as an affirmative defense.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires simply a short and plain statement of the claim in a complaint, and PLRA claims are typically brought under 42 U. S.C. 1983, which does not require exhaustion at all.  The fact that the PLRA dealt extensively with exhaustion, but is silent on the issue whether exhaustion must be pleaded or is an affirmative defense, is strong evidence that the usual practice should be followed, and the practice under the Federal Rules is to regard exhaustion as an affirmative defense, including in the similar statutory scheme governing habeas corpus, Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. ___, ___.  Courts should generally not depart from the Federal Rules usual practice based on perceived policy concerns.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163  Those courts that require prisoners to plead and demonstrate exhaustion contend that prisoner complaints must be treated outside of the typical framework if the PLRAs screening requirement is to function effectively.  But the screening requirement does notexplicitly or implicitlyjustify deviating from the usual procedural practice beyond the departures specified by the PLRA itself.  Although exhaustion was a centerpiece of the PLRA, Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U. S. ___, ___, failure to exhaust was notably not added in terms to the enumerated grounds justifying dismissal upon early screening.  Section1997e(g)which allows defendants to waive their right to reply to a prisoner complaint without being deemed to have admitted the complaints allegationsshows that when Congress meant to depart from the usual procedural requirements, it did so expressly.  Given that the PLRA does not itself require plaintiffs to plead exhaustion, such a result must be obtained by  amending the Federal Rules, and not by judicial interpretation.

(b)Exhaustion is not per se inadequate under the PLRA when an individual later sued was not named in the grievance.  Nothing in the MDOC policy supports the conclusion that the grievance process was improperly invoked because an individual later named as a defendant was not named at the first step of the process; at the time each grievance was filed here, the MDOC policy did not specifically require a prisoner to name anyone in the grievance.

05-7058|"GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. DUENAS-ALVAREZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 051629.Argued December 5, 2006Decided January 17, 2007
Respondent, a permanent resident alien, was convicted of violating Cal. Veh. Code Ann. 10851(a), under which [a]ny person who drives or takes a vehicle not his or her own, without the consent of the owner  , or any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, is guilty of a public offense.  (Emphasis added.)  The Federal Government then sought to remove respondent from the United States as an alien convicted of a theft offense  for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year, 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G); 1227(a)(2)(A).  The Government claimed that the California conviction qualified as such a theft offense under the framework set forth in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575.  In Taylor, the Court considered whether a prior conviction for violating a state statute criminalizing certain burglary-like behavior fell within the term burglary for sentence-enhancement purposes under 18 U. S.C. 924(e).  This Court held that Congress meant that term to refer to burglary in the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States, id., at 598; and that a sentencing court seeking to determine whether a particular prior conviction was for generic burglary should normally look to the state statute defining the crime of conviction, not to the facts of the particular prior case, id., at 599600; but that where state law defines burglary broadly to include crimes falling outside generic burglary, the sentencer should go beyond the mere fact of conviction and examine, e.g., the charging document and jury instructions to determine whether the earlier jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary, id., at 602.  The Federal Immigration Judge and the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found respondent removable, but the Ninth Circuit, summarily remanded in light of its earlier Penuliar decision holding that aiding and abetting a theft is not itself a crime under the generic definition of theft.
Held:The term theft offense in 8 U. S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G) includes the crime of aiding and abetting a theft offense.  Pp.511.
(a)One who aids or abets a theft, like a principal who actually participates, commits a crime that falls within the scope of the generic theft definition accepted by the BIA and the Ninth and other Circuits: the taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.  Penuliar v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 961, 969.  Since, as the record shows, state and federal criminal law now uniformly treats principals and aiders and abettors alike, the generic sense in which the term theft is now used in the criminal codes of most States, Taylor, supra, at 598, covers such aiders and abettors as well as principals.  And the criminal activities of these aiders and abettors of a generic theft thus fall within the scope of the term theft in the federal statute.  Pp.56.


(b)The Court rejects respondents argument that Cal. Veh. Code 10851, through the California courts application of a natural and probable consequences doctrine, creates a subspecies of the crime falling outside the generic theft definition.  The fact that, under California law, an aider and abettor is criminally responsible not only for the crime he intends, but also for any crime that naturally and probably results from his intended crime, does not in itself show that the state statute covers a nongeneric theft crime.  Relatively few jurisdictions have expressly rejected the natural and probable consequences doctrine, and many States and the Federal Government apply some form or variation of that doctrine or permit jury inferences of intent in circumstances similar to those in which California has applied the doctrine.  To succeed, respondent must show something special about Californias version of the doctrine.  His attempt to show that, unlike most other States, California makes a defendant criminally liable for conduct he did not intend, not even as a known or almost certain byproduct of his intentional acts, fails because the California cases respondent cites do not show that Californias law is applied in such a way that is somehow broader in scope than other States laws.  Moreover, to find that state law creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct falling outside the generic definition.  To make that showing, an offender must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.  Respondent makes no such showing.  Pp.610.


(c)Respondents additional claimsthat 10851 (1) holds liable accessories after the fact, who need not be shown to have committed a theft, and (2) applies to joyriding, which falls outside the generic theft definitionare not considered here because they do not fall within the terms of the question presented, the lower court did not consider them, and this Court declines to reach them in the first instance.  Pp.1011.

05-1629|"NORFOLK SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO. v. SORRELL
certiorari to the court of appeals of missouri
No. 05746.Argued October 10, 2006Decided January 10, 2007
Respondent Sorrell was injured while working for the petitioner railroad (Norfolk), and sought damages for his injuries in Missouri state court under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), which makes a railroad liable for an employees injuries resulting in whole or in part from [the railroads] negligence, Section 1.  FELA reduces any damages awarded to an employee in proportion to the amount [of negligence] attributable to the employee, Section 3.  Missouris jury instructions apply different causation standards to railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence in FELA actions.  An employee will be found contributorily negligent if his negligence directly contributed to cause the injury, while railroad negligence is measured by whether the railroads negligence contributed in whole or in part to the injury.  After the trial court overruled Norfolks objection that the instruction on contributory negligence contained a different standard than the railroad negligence instruction, the jury awarded Sorrell $1.5 million.  The Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Norfolks contention that the same causation standard should apply to both parties negligence.
Held: 
1.Norfolks attempt to expand the question presented to encompass what the FELA causation standard should be, not simply whether the standard should be the same for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence, is rejected.  This Court is typically reluctant to permit parties to smuggle additional questions into a case after the grant of certiorari.  Although the Court could consider the question of what standard applies as anterior to the question whether the standards may differ, the substantive content of the causation standard is a significant enough issue that the Court prefers not to address it when it has not been fully presented.  Pp.46.


2.The same causation standard applies to railroad negligence under FELA Section 1 as to employee contributory negligence under Section 3.  Absent express language to the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common law, Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 182, and unless common-law principles are expressly rejected in FELAs text, they are entitled to great weight, Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, 512 U. S. 532, 544.  The prevailing common-law view at the time FELA was enacted was that the causation standards for negligence and contributory negligence were the same, and FELA did not expressly depart from this approach.  This is strong evidence against Missouris practice of applying different standards, which is apparently unique among the States.  Departing from the common-law practice would in any event have been a peculiar approach for Congress to take in FELA: As a practical matter, it is difficult to reduce damages in proportion to the employees negligence if the relevance of each partys negligence is measured by a different causation standard.  The Court thinks it far simpler for a jury to conduct the apportionment FELA mandates if the jury compares like with like.  Contrary to Sorrells argument, the use of the language in whole or in part with respect to railroad negligence in FELA Section 1, but not with respect to employee contributory negligence in Section 3, does not justify a departure from the common-law practice of applying a single causation standard.  It would have made little sense to include the in whole or in part language in Section 3; if the employees contributory negligence contributed in whole to his injury, there would be no recovery against the railroad in the first place.  The language made sense in Section 1, however, to clarify that there could be recovery against the railroad even if it were only partially responsible for the injury.  In any event, there is no reason to read the statute as a whole to encompass different causation standards, since Section 3 simply does not address causation.  Finally, FELAs remedial purpose cannot compensate for the lack of statutory text:FELA does not abrogate the common-law approach.  A review of FELA model instructions indicates that there are a variety of ways to instruct a jury to apply the same causation standard to railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence.  Missouri has the same flexibility as other jurisdictions in deciding how to do so, so long as it now joins them in applying a single standard.  On remand, the Missouri Court of Appeals should address Sorrells argument that any error in the jury instructions was harmless, and should determine whether a new trial is required.  Pp.614.

05-746|"MEDIMMUNE, INC. v. GENENTECH, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 05608.Argued October 4, 2006Decided January 9, 2007
After the parties entered into a patent license agreement covering, inter alia, respondents then-pending patent application, the application matured into the Cabilly II patent.  Respondent Genentech, Inc., sent petitioner a letter stating that Synagis, a drug petitioner manufactured, was covered by the Cabilly II patent and that petitioner owed royalties under the agreement.  Although petitioner believed no royalties were due because the patent was invalid and unenforceable and because Synagis did not infringe the patents claims, petitioner considered the letter a clear threat to enforce the patent, terminate the license agreement, and bring a patent infringement action if petitioner did not pay.  Because such an action could have resulted in petitioners being ordered to pay treble damages and attorneys fees and enjoined from selling Synagis, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its sales revenue, petitioner paid the royalties under protest and filed this action for declaratory and other relief.  The District Court dismissed the declaratory-judgment claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because, under Federal Circuit precedent, a patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an Article III case or controversy with regard to the patents validity, enforceability, or scope.

			"|"MEDIMMUNE, INC. v. GENENTECH, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 05608.Argued October 4, 2006Decided January 9, 2007
After the parties entered into a patent license agreement covering, inter alia, respondents then-pending patent application, the application matured into the Cabilly II patent.  Respondent Genentech, Inc., sent petitioner a letter stating that Synagis, a drug petitioner manufactured, was covered by the Cabilly II patent and that petitioner owed royalties under the agreement.  Although petitioner believed no royalties were due because the patent was invalid and unenforceable and because Synagis did not infringe the patents claims, petitioner considered the letter a clear threat to enforce the patent, terminate the license agreement, and bring a patent infringement action if petitioner did not pay.  Because such an action could have resulted in petitioners being ordered to pay treble damages and attorneys fees and enjoined from selling Synagis, which accounts for more than 80 percent of its sales revenue, petitioner paid the royalties under protest and filed this action for declaratory and other relief.  The District Court dismissed the declaratory-judgment claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because, under Federal Circuit precedent, a patent licensee in good standing cannot establish an Article III case or controversy with regard to the patents validity, enforceability, or scope.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  
Held: 
1.Contrary to respondents assertion that only a freestanding patent-invalidity claim is at issue, the record establishes that petitioner has raised and preserved the contract claim that, because of patent invalidity, unenforceability, and noninfringement, no royalties are owing.  Pp. 36.

05-608|"LONNIE LEE BURTON, PETITIONER v. BELINDA
STEWART, SUPERINTENDENT, STAFFORD
CREEK CORRECTIONS CENTER
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit
[January 9, 2007]
Per Curiam.

We granted certiorari in this case, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), to determine whether our decision in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), announced a new rule and, if so, whether it applies retroactively on collateral review.  We do not answer these questions, however, because petitionera state prisoner seeking postconviction relief from the federal courtsfailed to comply with the gatekeeping requirements of 28 U. S.C. 2244(b).  That failure deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to hear his claims.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss petitioners habeas corpus application for lack of jurisdiction.
I

On October 31, 1994, a Washington jury convicted petitioner Lonnie Burton of rape, robbery, and burglary.  App. 34.  The state trial court initially entered judgment and sentence on December 19, 1994 (1994 judgment).  In that judgment, the court sentenced Burton to a total of 562 months in prison.  State v. Burton, No. 357476I etc., 1997 WL 306429, *12 (Wash. App., June 9, 1997).  The trial court rested the 562-month sentence on two alternative grounds under Washingtons determinate sentencing scheme.  First, it sentenced Burton to within-guidelines sentences for each offense153 months for robbery, 105 months for burglary, and 304 months for rapeand directed that the sentences be served consecutively, for a total term of 562 months.  Id., at *13.  Under Washingtons multiple offense policy, imposition of consecutive sentences constitutes an exceptional sentence, Wash. Rev. Code 9.94A.120(18), 9.94A.400(1)(a) (2000),[Footnote 1] but the trial court justified such a sentence on the ground that running the three terms concurrently would result in a sentence clearly too lenient in light of the purposes of Washingtons sentencing scheme.  See 9.94A.390(2)(i).[Footnote 2]  The second basis on which the court calculated a 562-month term was by running the sentences concurrently but imposing an exceptional sentence of 562 months solely for the rape convictionagain on the ground that the total sentence would otherwise be clearly too lenient.  State v. Burton, 1997 WL 306429, at *13.
After an unrelated prior conviction was overturned, Burton requested resentencing.  Accordingly, over a year after the 1994 judgment, the trial court entered an amended judgment and sentence (1996 judgment), which, after recalculating Burtons offender scores, imposed a new sentence that relied solely on an exceptional 562-month sentence for the rape conviction, run concurrently with the other two terms.  Ibid.; App. 45.  On direct review, the Washington Court of Appeals upheld Burtons conviction, State v. Burton, supra, a decision the Washington Supreme Court declined to review, State v. Burton, 133 Wash. 2d 1025, 950 P.2d 475 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U. S. 1082 (1998).  The State Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing, however, because the trial courts exclusive reliance on the exceptional rape sentence decreased Burtons potential early release credits, raising vindictiveness concerns.  State v. Burton, 1997 WL 306429, at *14.


In response, on March 16, 1998, the trial court entered a second amended judgment and sentence (1998 judgment).  App. 3.  In this judgment, the trial court recited the jurys 1994 guilty verdicts, id., at 34, and again imposed a 562-month sentence, reverting to its original basis for doing sorunning the three within-guidelines sentences consecutively.  Id., at 7, 2932.  Burton sought review of this sentence, but the Washington courts eventually rejected his challenges both on direct review and in state postconviction proceedings.  Id., at 4355; App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a4a.


On December 28, 1998, while state review of his sentence was still pending, Burton filed a petition under 28 U. S.C. 2254 for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (1998 petition).  App. 34.  The standard form he filled out warned applicants that they must ordinarily first exhaust  available state court remedies as to each ground on which they sought action by the federal court, or run the risk of being barred from presenting additional grounds at a later date.  Id., at 3738.  Burton nonetheless challenged his custody only by disputing the constitutionality of his three convictions, not by pressing any sentencing claims.  Where the form requested the [d]ate of judgment of conviction, Burton listed Dec. 16, 1994, corresponding roughly to the date of the 1994 judgment.  Id., at 34.  The form asked whether the applicant had any petition or appeal now pending in any court, either state or federal, as to the judgment under attack, to which Burton answered Yes, explaining that [the] sentence I received at resentencing is on direct appeal.  Id., at 40 (emphasis added).  The District Court denied relief, id., at 42, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, Burton v. Walter, 21 Fed. Appx. 632 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U. S. 1060 (2002).


Over three years subsequent to filing the 1998 petition, after the Washington courts had rejected his sentencing challenges, Burton filed another federal habeas petition (2002 petition), again in the Western District of Washington.  This time, Burton claimed to be contesting the 1998 judgment, and challenged only the constitutionality of his sentence.  In particular, he alleged that it violated our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to the extent the sentencing court departed from a standard sentence based on its own factual determinations.  The District Court again denied the petition, App. 77, and the Ninth Circuit again affirmed, Burton v. Waddington, 142 Fed. Appx. 297 (2005).  Both courts rejected the States contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition because Burton had not obtained an order from the Court of Appeals authorizing him to file a second or successive habeas petition, as required by the habeas gatekeeping provisions, 28 U. S.C. 2244(b)(3).  On the merits, the Ninth Circuit rejected Burtons Apprendi claim and agreed with the State that Burton could not benefit from Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, because that decision announced a new rule that did not apply retroactively to Burtons sentence.  142 Fed. Appx., at 299.


It is this petition, the 2002 petition, that is before us today.  We conclude, though, that because the 2002 petition is a second or successive petition that Burton did not seek or obtain authorization to file in the District Court, the District Court never had jurisdiction to consider it in the first place.
II

The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) established a stringent set of procedures that a prisoner in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, 28 U. S.C. 2254(a), must follow if he wishes to file a second or successive habeas corpus application challenging that custody, 2244(b)(1).  In pertinent part, before filing the application in the district court, a prisoner shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.  2244(b)(3)(A).  A three-judge panel of the court of appeals may authorize the filing of the second or successive application only if it presents a claim not previously raised that satisfies one of the two grounds articulated in 2244(b)(2).  2244(b)(3)(C); Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 529530 (2005); see also Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 656657, 664 (1996).
Burtons 2002 petition was a second or successive habeas application for which he did not seek, much less obtain, authorization to file.  When Burton filed his first petition, the 1998 petition, he was being held in custody pursuant to the 1998 judgment, which had been entered some nine months earlier.  When he filed his second petition, the 2002 petition, he was still being held in custody pursuant to the same 1998 judgment.  In short, Burton twice brought claims contesting the same custody imposed by the same judgment of a state court.  As a result, under AEDPA, he was required to receive authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his second challenge.  Because he did not do so, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.


The Ninth Circuit determined that the 2002 petition was not second or successive because, under McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), Burton had a legitimate excuse for failing to raise his sentencing challenges in the 1998 petition.  142 Fed. Appx., at 299 (quoting McCleskey, supra, at 490; internal quotation marks omitted).  Specifically, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because Burton had not exhausted his sentencing claims in state court when he filed the 1998 petition, they were not ripe for federal habeas review at that time.  142 Fed. Appx., at 298.


We assume for purposes of this case, without deciding, that the Ninth Circuits legitimate excuse approach to determining whether a petition is second or successive is correct.  That courts ruling that Burton had a legitimate excuse, however, is inconsistent with the precise practice we have explained governs in circumstances such as Burtons.  The plurality opinion in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 520522 (1982), stated that district courts should dismiss mixed petitionsthose with exhausted and unexhausted claimsand that petitioners with such petitions have two options.  They may withdraw a mixed petition, exhaust the remaining claims, and return to district court with a fully exhausted petition.  We have held that in such circumstances the later filed petition would not be second or successive.  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 485486 (2000).


Alternatively, prisoners filing mixed petitions may proceed with only the exhausted claims, but doing so risks subjecting later petitions that raise new claims to rigorous procedural obstacles.  Lundy, supra, at 520521 (plurality opinion); see also Slack, supra, at 486487.  As noted, the form Burton used in filing his first petition warned of just that consequence.  App. 3738, supra, at 3.  There is no basis in our cases for supposing, as the Ninth Circuit did, that a petitioner with unexhausted claims who chooses the second of these optionswho elects to proceed to adjudication of his exhausted claimsmay later assert that a subsequent petition is not second or successive precisely because his new claims were unexhausted at the time he filed his first petition.  This reasoning conflicts with both Lundy and 2244(b) and would allow prisoners to file separate habeas petitions in the not uncommon situation where a conviction is upheld but a sentence is reversed.  Such a result would be inconsistent with both the exhaustion requirement, with its purpose of reducing piecemeal litigation, Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 180 (2001), and AEDPA, with its goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings.  Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 277 (2005).


Burton directs us to two decisions, Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637 (1998), and Slack, supra, in which we have not regarded subsequent petitions to be second or successive.  But these cases are readily distinguishable.  In Martinez-Villareal, we held that the claim of a capital prisoner that he was insane and therefore could not be put to death was necessarily unripe until the State issued a warrant for his execution, and so the prisoners subsequent request for consideration of that previously unripe claim was not second or successive for purposes of 2244(b).  523 U. S., at 644645.  But unlike Burton, the prisoner there had attempted to bring this claim in his initial habeas petition, prompting us to look to Lundy in concluding that the claim should be treated in the same manner as the claim of a petitioner who returns to a federal habeas court after exhausting state remedies, that is, characterizing it as not second or successive.  Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S., at 644.  Indeed, we expressly declined to address the situation where a petitioner fails to raise the claim in the initial petition.  See id., at 645, n.  In this case, Burton did not raise the relevant claims in his 1998 petition.  Without more, therefore, our holding in Martinez-Villareal does not support the conclusion that Burtons 2002 petition was not second or successive.


Slack is equally unhelpful to Burton; that decision merely confirmed that when a first petition is dismissed because it contains unexhausted claims, a prisoner returning later with a fully exhausted petition would not confront the second or successive bar.  529 U. S., at 485486.  We held that a petition filed after a mixed petition has been dismissed under Rose v. Lundy before the district court adjudicated any claims is to be treated as any other first petition and is not a second or successive petition.  Id., at 487 (emphasis added).  See also id., at 478 ([A] habeas petition which is filed after an initial petition was dismissed without adjudication on the merits for failure to exhaust state remedies is not a second or successive petition (emphasis added)).  Burtons case is quite differenthis first petition was not subject to dismissal as containing unexhausted claims, and in fact was adjudicated on the merits.


Moving beyond the ground relied upon by the Ninth Circuit, Burton argues that his 1998 and 2002 petitions challenged different judgments.  He notes that his 1998 petition identified the pertinent judgment as the 1994 judgment, App. 34, while the 2002 petition challenged the sentence imposed in the 1998 judgment.  The 1998 judgment, however, had been entered nine months before Burton filed his first petition.  That judgment, the same one challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition, was the judgment pursuant to which Burton was being detained.  Unlike Inre Taylor, 171 F.3d 185 (CA4 1999), cited by Burton, there was no new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions.  In his 1998 petition, Burton specifically described his unexhausted sentencing claims as claims as to the judgment under attack, App. 40, belying any notion that those claims arose from a judgment distinct from the one challenged in 1998.[Footnote 3]


Burton finally contends that had he not filed the 1998 petition when he did, and instead waited until state review of his sentencing claims was complete, he risked losing the opportunity to challenge his conviction in federal court due to AEDPAs 1-year statute of limitations.  See 2244(d)(1).  But this argument misreads AEDPA, which states that the limitations period applicable to a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall run from, as relevant here, the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.  2244(d)(1)(A).  Final judgment in a criminal case means sentence.  The sentence is the judgment.  Berman v. United States, 302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937).  Accordingly, Burtons limitations period did not begin until both his conviction and sentence became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such reviewwhich occurred well after Burton filed his 1998 petition.


Burton argues in rebuttal that this reasoning would necessarily mean the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the 1998 petition, but he is mistaken.  Section 2254(a) states that a district court shall entertain a habeas petition in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.  When he filed the 1998 petition, Burton assuredly was in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State courteven if, at that point, the 1998 judgment was not final for purposes of triggering AEDPAs statute of limitations.


The long and short of it is that Burton neither sought nor received authorization from the Court of Appeals before filing his 2002 petition, a second or successive petition challenging his custody, and so the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.
It is so ordered.
As we noted in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 298, n.1 (2004), Washington has since amended and recodified its criminal code.  Citations are to provisions in effect at the time of Burtons sentencing.
Specifically, the standard range sentences for rape, robbery, and burglary, if run concurrently, would have punished Burton as if he had committed only the rape.  State v. Burton, No. 357476I etc., 1997 WL 306429, *11*12 (Wash. App., June 9, 1997).
For the same reasons, Burtons reliance on Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375 (2003), is misplaced.  That case reversed a lower courts recharacterization of a motion requesting a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 as a first habeas petition.  Here Burton filed his first habeas petition as such in 1998; it involves no similar recharacterization to recognize that the judgment pursuant to which Burton was confined at the time was the same judgment that gave rise to the sentence later challenged in his second habeas petition.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 05998.Argued October 10, 2006Decided January 9, 2007
Respondent, a Mexican citizen, was charged with violating 8 U. S.C. 1326(a) by attempting to reenter the United States after having been deported.  The District Court denied his motion to have the indictment dismissed because it did not allege a specific overt act that he committed in seeking reentry.  In reversing, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the indictments omission of an overt act was a fatal flaw not subject to harmless-error review.
Held:Respondents indictment was not defective, and, thus, this Court need not reach the harmless-error issue.  While the Government does not dispute that respondent cannot be guilty of attempted reentry under 1326(a) unless he committed an overt act qualifying as a substantial step toward completing his goal or that [a]n indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it charges, Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 228, it contends that the instant indictment implicitly alleged that respondent engaged in the necessary overt act by alleging that he attempted to enter the country.  This Court agrees.  Not only does attempt as used in common parlance connote action rather than mere intent, but, more importantly, as used in the law for centuries, it encompasses both the overt act and intent elements.  Thus, an indictment alleging attempted reentry under 1326(a) need not specifically allege a particular overt act or any other component par[t] of the offense.  See Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117.  It was enough for the indictment to point to the relevant criminal statute and allege that respondent intentionally attempted to enter the United States  at or near San Louis  Arizona [o]n or about June 1, 2003.  App. 8.  An indictment has two constitutional requirements: first, [it must] contai[n] the elements of the offense charged and fairly infor[m] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, [it must] enabl[e] him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.  Hamling, 418 U. S., at 117.  Here, the use of the word attempt, coupled with the specification of the time and place of the alleged reentry, satisfied both.  Respondents argument that the indictment would have been sufficient only if it alleged any of three overt acts performed during his attempted reentrythat he walked into an inspection area; that he presented a misleading identification card; or that he lied to the inspectoris rejected.  Respondent is correct that some crimes must be charged with greater specificity than an indictment parroting a federal criminal statutes language, see Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, but the Russell Courts reasoning suggests that there was no infirmity in the present indictment, see id., at 764, 762, and respondents indictment complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1), which provides that an indictment must be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.  Pp.  59.
