certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 07562.Argued October 6, 2008Decided December 15, 2008
Respondents, smokers of petitioners light cigarettes, filed suit, alleging that petitioners violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act (MUTPA) by fraudulently advertising that their light cigarettes delivered less tar and nicotine than regular brands.  The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioners, finding the state-law claim pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (Labeling Act).  The First Circuit reversed, holding that the Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents fraud claim.
Held:Neither the Labeling Acts pre-emption provision nor the Federal Trade Commissions actions in this field pre-empt respondents state-law fraud claim.  Pp.520.
(a)Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statutes express language or through its structure and purpose.  See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525.  When the text of an express pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.  Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449.  The Labeling Acts stated purposes are to inform the public of the health risks of smoking while protecting commerce and the economy from the ill effects of nonuniform requirements to the extent consistent with the first goal.  Although fidelity to these purposes does not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question here is whether that result is nevertheless required by 15 U. S.C. 1334(b), which provides that [n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.  Pp.59.


(b)Respondents claim is not expressly pre-empted by 1334(b).  As determined in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, the phrase based on smoking and health modifies the state-law rule at issue rather than a particular application of that rule.  The Cipollone plurality concluded that the phrase based on smoking and health fairly but narrowly construed did not pre-empt the Cipollone plaintiffs common-law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepresented and concealed a material fact, because the claim alleged a violation of a duty not to deceivea duty that is not based on smoking and health.  505 U. S., at 528529.  Respondents here also allege a violation of the duty not to deceive as codified in the MUTPA, which, like the common-law duty in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smoking and health.  Respondents claim is not analogous to the warning neutralization claim found to be pre-empted in Cipollone.  Reilly is consistent with Cipollones analysis.  This Court disagrees with petitioners alternative argument that the express pre-emption framework of Cipollone and Reilly should be rejected.  American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, and Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, are distinguished.  Pp.916.


(c)Various Federal Trade Commission decisions with respect to statements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly pre-empt state deceptive practices rules like the MUTPA.  Pp.1720.

07-544|"ANTHONY HEDGPETH, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.
MICHAEL ROBERT PULIDO
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
[December 2, 2008]
Per Curiam.

A conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge if the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have relied on an invalid one.  See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931); Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957).  In this case the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that such an error is structural error, requiring that the conviction be set aside on collateral review without regard to whether the flaw in the instructions prejudiced the defendant.  The parties now agree that the Court of Appeals was wrong to categorize this type of error as structural.  They further agree that a reviewing court finding such error should ask whether the flaw in the instructions had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict.  Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 623 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We agree as well and so hold.


Respondent Michael Pulido was convicted by a California jury of felony murder.  On direct appeal, Pulido sought to vacate his conviction on the ground that the jury instructions were erroneous: They permitted the jury to find him guilty of felony murder if he formed the intent to aid and abet the underlying felony before the murder, but they also permitted the jury to find him guilty if he formed that intent only after the murder.  The California Supreme Court agreed with Pulido that the latter theory was invalid under California law, but upheld the conviction on the ground that Pulido was not prejudiced by the error.  People v. Pulido, 15 Cal.4th 713, 727, 936 P.2d 1235, 12431244 (1997).  Pulido sought federal habeas relief, which the District Court granted after concluding that instructing the jury on the invalid theory had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdict.  Pulido v. Lamarque, No. C994933 CW (RR) (ND Cal., Mar. 24, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a66a (quoting Brecht, supra, at 637).


The State appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Pulido v. Chrones, 487 F.3d 669 (2007) (per curiam).  On appeal, Pulido argued the District Courts Brecht analysis was correct, but in the alternative sought to avoid the harmless-error inquiry altogether.  In support of that alternative argument, he maintained that when a jury returns a general verdict after being instructed on both a valid and an invalid theory, the conviction must be automatically set aside, without asking whether the invalid instruction was harmless.  The Court of Appeals recognized that the Brecht substantial and injurious effect standard governs harmless-error analysis on federal habeas, 487 F.3d, at 673, n.3 (internal quotation marks omitted), but agreed with Pulido that instructing a jury on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is legally improper, was structural error exempting the instructions as a whole from harmless-error review, id., at 675676.  Such error instead required setting aside the conviction on habeas unless the reviewing court could determine with absolute certainty that the defendant was convicted under a proper theory.  Id., at 676 (citing Lara v. Ryan, 455 F.3d 1080, 1086 (CA9 2006)).  Because the instructions le[ft] open the possibility that the jury convicted Pulido on the impermissible ground, the court concluded that the verdict must be reversed.  487 F.3d, at 676.  We granted certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2008).


The Ninth Circuit precedent on which the Court of Appeals relied, see Lara v. Ryan, supra, based its structural-error analysis upon a line of our cases beginning with Stromberg.  Stromberg addressed the validity of a general verdict that rested on an instruction that the petitioner could be found guilty for displaying a red flag as a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to organized government, or [a]s an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action, or [a]s [a]n aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.  283 U. S., at 363.  After holding that the first clause of the instruction proscribed constitutionally protected conduct, we concluded that the petitioners conviction must be reversed because it [wa]s impossible to say under which clause of the [instruction] the conviction was obtained.  Id., at 368.  In Yates v. United States, supra, we extended this reasoning to a conviction resting on multiple theories of guilt when one of those theories is not unconstitutional, but is otherwise legally flawed.


Both Stromberg and Yates were decided before we concluded in Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), that constitutional errors can be harmless.  Accordingly, neither Stromberg nor Yates had reason to address whether the instructional errors they identified could be reviewed for harmlessness, or instead required automatic reversal.  In a series of post-Chapman cases, however, we concluded that various forms of instructional error are not structural but instead trial errors subject to harmless-error review.  See, e.g., Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999) (omission of an element of an offense); California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2 (1996) (per curiam) (erroneous aider and abettor instruction); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987) (misstatement of an element of an offense); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986) (erroneous burden-shifting as to an element of an offense).


Although these cases did not arise in the context of a jury instructed on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is improper, nothing in them suggests that a different harmless-error analysis should govern in that particular context.  To the contrary, we emphasized in Rose that while there are some errors to which [harmless-error analysis] does not apply, they are the exception and not the rule.  Id., at 578.  And Neder makes clear that harmless-error analysis applies to instructional errors so long as the error at issue does not categorically vitiat[e] all the jurys findings.  527 U. S., at 11 (quoting Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instructions constitute structural error)).  An instructional error arising in the context of multiple theories of guilt no more vitiates all the jurys findings than does omission or misstatement of an element of the offense when only one theory is submitted.


In fact, drawing a distinction between alternative-theory error and the instructional errors in Neder, Roy, Pope, and Rose would be patently illogical, given that such a distinction reduces to the strange claim that, because the jury  received both a good charge and a bad charge on the issue, the error was somehow more pernicious than  where the only charge on the critical issue was a mistaken one.  487 F.3d, at 677678 (OScannlain, J., concurring specially) (quoting Quigley v. Vose, 834 F.2d 14, 16 (CA1 1987) (per curiam)); see also Becht v. United States, 403 F.3d 541, 548 (CA8 2005) (same), cert. denied, 546 U. S. 1177 (2006).


Pulido now agrees with the State that the Court of Appeals erred by treating the instructional error in this case as structural, and that the required prejudice analysis should be governed by Brechts substantial and injurious effect standard.  See Brief for Respondent 17 ([t]he Ninth Circuit was mistaken in its structural defect nomenclature); Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (We acknowledge that this is a trial error and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard).  So do we.


Pulido nonetheless maintains we should affirm because the Court of Appeals effectively engaged in the Brecht analysis, despite its clear description of the error as structural.  But despite full briefing on the applicability of Brecht, the Court of Appeals mentioned Brecht only briefly in a footnote, see 487 F.3d, at 673, n.3, and then went on to agree with Pulidos alternative assertion that the instructional error was structural and therefore not subject to harmless error review, id., at 675676.  The court also stated that the conviction had to be overturned unless the court was absolutely certain that the jury relied on a valid ground.  Id., at 676.  Such a determination would appear to be a finding that no violation had occurred at all, rather than that any error was harmless.  In any event, an absolute certainty standard is plainly inconsistent with Brecht.  Accordingly, we express no view on whether Pulido is entitled to habeas relief, but rather remand to the Court of Appeals for application of Brecht in the first instance.*


The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
*The dissent maintains the Court of Appeals undertook a searching review of the parties evidence and the jury instructions to determine the errors effect on the jury.  Post, at 6 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  But the Court of Appeals reached its conclusion based solely on the existence of a typographical error in the special circumstances instructions, without addressing any of the States arguments that the typographical error was harmless in light of the record as a whole.  There was no need for that court to address those arguments, of course, because of its mistaken conclusion that the instructional error was structural.  Under such circumstances, remand is the appropriate course.

07-1239|"WINTER, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, etal. v NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 071239.Argued October 8, 2008Decided November 12, 2008
Antisubmarine warfare is one of the Navys highest priorities.  The Navys fleet faces a significant threat from modern diesel-electric submarines, which are extremely difficult to detect and track because they can operate almost silently.  The most effective tool for identifying submerged diesel-electric submarines is active sonar, which emits pulses of sound underwater and then receives the acoustic waves that echo off the target.  Active sonar is a complex technology, and sonar operators must undergo extensive training to become proficient in its use.


This case concerns the Navys use of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar during integrated training exercises in the waters off southern California (SOCAL).  In these exercises, ships, submarines, and aircraft train together as members of a strike group.  Due to the importance of antisubmarine warfare, a strike group may not be certified for deployment until it demonstrates proficiency in the use of active sonar to detect, track, and neutralize enemy submarines.  


The SOCAL waters contain at least 37 species of marine mammals.  The plaintiffsgroups and individuals devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitatsassert that MFA sonar causes serious injuries to these animals.  The Navy disputes that claim, noting that MFA sonar training in SOCAL waters has been conducted for 40 years without a single documented sonar-related injury to any marine mammal.  Plaintiffs sued the Navy, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the training exercises violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and other federal laws; in particular, plaintiffs contend that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) before conducting the latest round of SOCAL exercises.  


The District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Navy from using MFA sonar during its training exercises.  The Court of Appeals held that this injunction was overbroad and remanded to the District Court for a narrower remedy.  The District Court then entered another preliminary injunction, imposing six restrictions on the Navys use of sonar during its SOCAL training exercises.  As relevant to this case, the injunction required the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal was spotted within 2,200 yards of a vessel, and to power down sonar by 6 decibels during conditions known as surface ducting.


The Navy then sought relief from the Executive Branch.  The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) authorized the Navy to implement alternative arrangements to NEPA compliance in light of emergency circumstances.  The CEQ allowed the Navy to continue its training exercises under voluntary mitigation procedures that the Navy had previously adopted.


The Navy moved to vacate the District Courts preliminary injunction in light of the CEQs actions.  The District Court refused to do so, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Court of Appeals held that there was a serious question whether the CEQs interpretation of the emergency circumstances regulation was lawful, that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a possibility of irreparable injury, and that the preliminary injunction was appropriate because the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest favored the plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals emphasized that any negative impact of the injunction on the Navys training exercises was speculative, and determined that (1) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone was unlikely to affect naval operations, because MFA sonar systems are often shut down during training exercises; and (2) the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions was not unreasonable, because such conditions are rare and the Navy has previously certified strike groups not trained under these conditions.
Held:The preliminary injunction is vacated to the extent challenged by the Navy.  The balance of equities and the public interestwhich were barely addressed by the District Courttip strongly in favor of the Navy.  The Navys need to conduct realistic training with active sonar to respond to the threat posed by enemy submarines plainly outweighs the interests advanced by the plaintiffs.  Pp.1024.
(a)The lower courts held that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of success on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a possibility of irreparable harm.  The possibility standard is too lenient.  This Courts frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.


Even if plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable injury, such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navys interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors.  For the same reason, it is unnecessary to address the lower courts holding that plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits.  Pp.1014. 


(b)A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.  In each case, courts must balance the competing claims of injury and consider the effect of granting or withholding the requested relief, paying particular regard to the public consequences.  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312.  Military interests do not always trump other considerations, and the Court has not held that they do, but courts must give deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest.  Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U. S. 503, 507.


Here, the record contains declarations from some of the Navys most senior officers, all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat.  Those officers emphasized that realistic training cannot be accomplished under the two challenged restrictions imposed by the District Courtthe 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions.  The use of MFA sonar under realistic conditions during training exercises is clearly of the utmost importance to the Navy and the Nation.  The Court does not question the importance of plaintiffs ecological, scientific, and recreational interests, but it concludes that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest tip strongly in favor of the Navy.  The determination of where the public interest lies in this case does not strike the Court as a close question.  Pp.1416.


(c)The lower courts justifications for entering the preliminary injunction are not persuasive.  Pp.1621.


(1)The District Court did not give serious consideration to the balance of equities and the public interest.  The Court of Appeals did consider these factors and conclude that the Navys concerns about the preliminary injunction were speculative. But that is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendants conduct.  The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers specific, predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navys SOCAL training exercises.  Pp.1617.


(2)The District Court abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal is spotted within 2,200 yards of a sonar-emitting vessel.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the zone would not be overly burdensome because marine mammal sightings during training exercises are relatively rare.  But regardless of the frequency of such sightings, the injunction will increase the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards, which expands its surface area by a factor of over 100.  Moreover, because training scenarios can take several days to develop, each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days worth of training.  The Court of Appeals also concluded that the shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar several times during prior exercises when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navys self-imposed 200-yard zone.  But the court ignored undisputed evidence that these voluntary shutdowns only occurred during tactically insignificant times.  Pp.1820.


(3)The District Court also abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to power down MFA sonar by 6 decibels during significant surface ducting conditions.  When surface ducting occurs, active sonar becomes more useful near the surface, but less effective at greater depths.  Diesel-electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the power-down requirement was reasonable because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions.  This reasoning is backwards.  Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable, it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur.  Pp.2021.


(4)The Navy has previously taken voluntary measures to address concerns about marine mammals, and has chosen not to challenge four other restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case.  But that hardly means that other, more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war.  The Court of Appeals noted that the Navy could return to the District Court to seek modification of the preliminary injunction if it actually resulted in an inability to train.  The Navy is not required to wait until it is unable to train sufficient forces for national defense before seeking dissolution of the preliminary injunction.  By then it may be too late.  P.21.


(d)This Court does not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs claims, but the foregoing analysis makes clear that it would also be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction along the same lines as the preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS, not that it must cease sonar training.  There is accordingly no basis for enjoining such training pending preparation of an EISif one is determined to be requiredwhen doing so is credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security.  There are many other remedial tools available, including declaratory relief or an injunction specifically tailored to preparation of an EIS, that do not carry such dire consequences.  Pp.2123.

(b)A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.  In each case, courts must balance the competing claims of injury and consider the effect of granting or withholding the requested relief, paying particular regard to the public consequences.  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312.  Military interests do not always trump other considerations, and the Court has not held that they do, but courts must give deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest.  Goldman v. Weinberger, 475 U. S. 503, 507.


Here, the record contains declarations from some of the Navys most senior officers, all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat.  Those officers emphasized that realistic training cannot be accomplished under the two challenged restrictions imposed by the District Courtthe 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions.  The use of MFA sonar under realistic conditions during training exercises is clearly of the utmost importance to the Navy and the Nation.  The Court does not question the importance of plaintiffs ecological, scientific, and recreational interests, but it concludes that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest tip strongly in favor of the Navy.  The determination of where the public interest lies in this case does not strike the Court as a close question.  Pp.1416.


(c)The lower courts justifications for entering the preliminary injunction are not persuasive.  Pp.1621.


(1)The District Court did not give serious consideration to the balance of equities and the public interest.  The Court of Appeals did consider these factors and conclude that the Navys concerns about the preliminary injunction were speculative. But that is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendants conduct.  The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers specific, predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navys SOCAL training exercises.  Pp.1617.


(2)The District Court abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal is spotted within 2,200 yards of a sonar-emitting vessel.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the zone would not be overly burdensome because marine mammal sightings during training exercises are relatively rare.  But regardless of the frequency of such sightings, the injunction will increase the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards, which expands its surface area by a factor of over 100.  Moreover, because training scenarios can take several days to develop, each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days worth of training.  The Court of Appeals also concluded that the shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar several times during prior exercises when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navys self-imposed 200-yard zone.  But the court ignored undisputed evidence that these voluntary shutdowns only occurred during tactically insignificant times.  Pp.1820.


(3)The District Court also abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to power down MFA sonar by 6 decibels during significant surface ducting conditions.  When surface ducting occurs, active sonar becomes more useful near the surface, but less effective at greater depths.  Diesel-electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the power-down requirement was reasonable because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions.  This reasoning is backwards.  Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable, it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur.  Pp.2021.


(4)The Navy has previously taken voluntary measures to address concerns about marine mammals, and has chosen not to challenge four other restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case.  But that hardly means that other, more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war.  The Court of Appeals noted that the Navy could return to the District Court to seek modification of the preliminary injunction if it actually resulted in an inability to train.  The Navy is not required to wait until it is unable to train sufficient forces for national defense before seeking dissolution of the preliminary injunction.  By then it may be too late.  P.21.


(d)This Court does not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs claims, but the foregoing analysis makes clear that it would also be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction along the same lines as the preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS, not that it must cease sonar training.  There is accordingly no basis for enjoining such training pending preparation of an EISif one is determined to be requiredwhen doing so is credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security.  There are many other remedial tools available, including declaratory relief or an injunction specifically tailored to preparation of an EIS, that do not carry such dire consequences.  Pp.2123.

08-332|"JENNIFER BRUNNER, OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE v. OHIO REPUBLICAN PARTY etal.
on application for stay
[October 17, 2008]
Per Curiam.

On October 9, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) directing Jennifer Brunner, the Ohio Secretary of State, to update Ohios Statewide Voter Registration Database (SWVRD) to comply with Section 303 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), 116 Stat. 1708, 42 U. S.C. 15483(a)(5)(B)(i).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the Secretarys motion to vacate the TRO.  The Secretary has filed an application to stay the TRO with Justice Stevens as Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit, and he has referred the matter to the Court.  The Secretary argues both that the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter the TRO and that its ruling on the merits was erroneous.  We express no opinion on the question whether HAVA is being properly implemented.  Respondents, however, are not sufficiently likely to prevail on the question whether Congress has authorized the District Court to enforce Section 303 in an action brought by a private litigant to justify the issuance of a TRO.  See Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U. S. 273, 283 (2002); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286 (2001).  We therefore grant the application for a stay and vacate the TRO.

It is so ordered.
*Title 42 U. S.C. 15483(a)(5)(B)(i) (2000 ed., Supp. V) states, in relevant part:


The chief State election official and the official responsible for the State motor vehicle authority of a State shall enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.

07-10689|"JAMES ERIC MOORE v. UNITED STATES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 0710689.Decided October 14, 2008
Per Curiam.

James Eric Moore was convicted of one count of possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, a violation of 21 U. S.C. 841(a)(1) and (b)(1).  Given the quantity of crack cocaine, the presentence report calculated that Moores sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines was 151 to 188 months.  At sentencing, Moore asked the District Court to impose a below-Guidelines sentence in light of our decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and the Guidelines disparate treatment of similar amounts of crack and powder cocaine.


The District Court refused, saying:
With regard to the crack and powder cocaine difference, that is the law.  Im applying the law as it currently stands.  If that is going to be changed, that is a congressional matter.  Congress is the one who looks at the guidelines and decides whether or not they should be put inin force. It isnt the judges.  Its the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the law, and thats what I will do in this sentencing.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 5556.

The District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of imprisonment and six years of supervised release.


Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sentence.  United States v. Moore, 470 F.3d 767 (2006).  In response to his claim that the District Court should have considered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Appeals held that the district court was correct in concluding that neither Booker nor [18 U. S.C.] 3553(a) authorizes district courts to reject the powder cocaine to crack cocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected in the Guidelines.  Id., at 770 (quoting United States v. Spears, 469 F.3d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).  Moore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.  Pet. for Cert. in Moore v. United States, No. 069749.


While Moores certiorari petition was pending, this Court issued its opinion in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses when applying 18 U. S.C. 3553(a), even in a mine-run case.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 2, 21).  We granted Moores petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of Kimbrough.  Moore v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).


On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit affirmed again.  518 F.3d 577 (2008).  This time, the Court of Appeals concluded that [a]s there was then no circuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district court was aware that Booker granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.  Id., at 580.


Proceeding pro se, Moore again petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Eighth Circuits new characterization of the transcript is wrong, and that it is clear that the district court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject the Guidelines ratio.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States agrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United States 9, and so do we.


When the District Court said that [i]t isnt the judges but Congress that looks at the [G]uidelines and decides whether or not they should be put  in force, the court showed that it did not think it had the discretion later upheld by Kimbrough.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 56.  The Eighth Circuits first decision recognized this, describing the District Court as concluding (correctly under circuit precedent) that it was not authorize[d] . . . to reject the crack/powder disparity.  Moore, 470 F.3d, at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In light of the District Courts comments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have remanded the case to the District Court for resentencing under Kimbrough.  We express no views on how the District Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.


The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

06-1457|"MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL GROUP INC. v. PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICT NO. 1 OF SNOHOMISH COUNTY etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 061457.Argued February 19, 2008Decided June 26, 2008*
Under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) must presume that the electricity rate set in a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the just and reasonable requirement of the Federal Power Act (FPA), see 16 U. S.C. 824d(a), and the presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.  See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U. S. 332; FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U. S. 348.  Under FERCs current regulatory regime, a wholesale electricity seller may file a market-based tariff, which simply states that the utility will enter into freely negotiated contracts with purchasers.  Those contracts are not filed with FERC before they go into effect.  In 2000 and 2001, there was a dramatic increase in the price of electricity in the western United States.  As a result, respondents  entered into long-term contracts with petitioners that locked in rates that were very high by historical standards.  Respondents subsequently asked FERC to modify the contracts, contending that the rates should not be presumed just and reasonable under Mobile-Sierra.  The Administrative Law Judge concluded that the presumption applied and that the contracts did not seriously harm the public interest.  FERC affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit remanded.  The court held that contract rates are presumptively reasonable only where FERC has had an initial opportunity to review the contracts without applying the Mobile-Sierra presumption and therefore that the presumption should not apply to contracts entered into under market-based tariffs.  The court alternatively held that there is a different standard for overcoming the Mobile-Sierra presumption when a purchaser challenges a contract: whether the contract exceeds a zone of reasonableness.
Held: 
1.The Commission was required to apply the Mobile-Sierra presumption in evaluating the contracts here.  Sierra held that a rate set out in a contract must be presumed to be just and reasonable absent serious harm to the public interest, regardless of when the contract is challenged.  FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380, distinguished.  Also, the Ninth Circuits rule requiring FERC to ask whether a contract was formed in an environment of market dysfunction is not supported by this Courts cases and plainly undermines the role of contracts in the FPAs statutory scheme.  Pp.1519.


2.The Ninth Circuits zone of reasonableness test fails to accord an adequate level of protection to contracts.  The standard for a buyers rate-increase challenge must be the same, generally, as the standard for a sellers challenge: The contract rate must seriously harm the public interest.  The Ninth Circuit misread Sierra in holding that the standard for evaluating a high-rate challenge and setting aside a contract rate is whether consumers electricity bills were higher than they would have been had the contract rates equaled marginal cost.  Under the Mobile-Sierra presumption, setting aside a contract rate requires a finding of unequivocal public necessity, Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U. S. 747, 822, or extraordinary circumstances, Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, 453 U. S. 571, 582.  Pp.1923.


3.The judgment below is nonetheless affirmed on alternative grounds, based on two defects in FERCs analysis.  First, the analysis was flawed or incomplete to the extent FERC looked simply to whether consumers rates increased immediately upon conclusion of the relevant contracts, rather than determining whether the contracts imposed an excessive burden down the line, relative to the rates consumers could have obtained (but for the contracts) after elimination of the dysfunctional market.  Sierras excessive burden on customers was the current burden, not just the burden imposed at the contracts outset.  See 350 U. S., at 355.  Second, it is unclear from FERCs orders whether it found respondents evidence inadequate to support their claim that petitioners engaged in unlawful market manipulation that altered the playing field for contract negotiations.  In such a case, the Commission should not presume that a contract is just and reasonable.  Like fraud and duress, unlawful market activity directly affecting contract negotiations eliminates the premise on which the Mobile-Sierra presumption rests: that the contract rates are the product of fair, arms-length negotiations.  On remand, FERC should amplify or clarify its findings on these two points.  Pp. 2326.

07-290|"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA etal. v. HELLER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 07290.Argued March 18, 2008Decided June 26, 2008
District of Columbia law bans handgun possession by making it a crime to carry an unregistered firearm and prohibiting the registration of handguns; provides separately that no person may carry an unlicensed handgun, but authorizes the police chief to issue 1-year licenses; and requires residents to keep lawfully owned firearms unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.  Respondent Heller, a D.C. special policeman, applied to register a handgun he wished to keep at home, but the District refused.  He filed this suit seeking, on Second Amendment grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the bar on handgun registration, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home, and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of functional firearms in the home.  The District Court dismissed the suit, but the D.C. Circuit reversed, holding that the Second Amendment protects an individuals right to possess firearms and that the citys total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self-defense, violated that right.  
Held: 
1.The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp.253.


(a)The Amendments prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause.   The operative clauses text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.  Pp.222.  


(b)The prefatory clause comports with the Courts interpretation of the operative clause.  The militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.  The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule.  The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens militia would be preserved.  Pp.2228. 


 (c)The Courts interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment.  Pp.2830. 


(d)The Second Amendments drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms.  Pp.3032. 


(e)Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Courts conclusion.  Pp.3247. 


(f)None of the Courts precedents forecloses the Courts interpretation.  Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 264265, refutes the individual-rights interpretation.  United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.  Pp.4754. 


2. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.  It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.  The Courts opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.  Millers holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those in common use at the time finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.  Pp.5456.


3.The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment.  The Districts total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of arms that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense.  Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibitionin the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acutewould fail constitutional muster.  Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.  Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement.  Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.  Pp.5664.
478 F. 3d 370, affirmed.
Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined.

The Courts opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.  Millers holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those in common use at the time finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.  Pp.5456.


3.The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment.  The Districts total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of arms that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense.  Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibitionin the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acutewould fail constitutional muster.  Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.  Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement.  Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.  Pp.5664.

07-320|"DAVIS v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION
appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 07320.Argued April 22, 2008Decided June 26, 2008
Federal-law limits on the amount of contributions a House of Representatives candidate and his authorized committee may receive from an individual, and the amount his party may devote to coordinated campaign expenditures, 2 U. S.C. 441a(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A), (c), and (d), normally apply equally to all competitors for a seat and their authorized committees.  However, 319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S.C. 441a1(a), part of the so-called Millionaires Amendment, fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidates expenditure of personal funds, the opposition personal funds amount (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.  The OPFA is a statistic comparing competing candidates personal expenditures and taking account of certain other fundraising.  When a self-financing candidates personal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass $350,000, a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the normal limitations, but his opponent, the non-self-financing candidate, may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit from individuals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate contributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit.  See 441a1(a)(1)(A)(C).  Because calculating the OPFA requires certain information about the self-financing candidates campaign assets and personal expenditures, 319(b) requires him to file an initial declaration of intent revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000, and to make additional disclosures to the other candidates, their national parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as his personal expenditures exceed certain benchmarks.


Appellant Davis, a candidate for a House seat in 2004 and 2006 who lost both times to the incumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006 election, in compliance with 319(b), that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds.  After the FEC informed him it had reason to believe he had violated 319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the 2004 campaign, he filed this suit for a declaration that 319 is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the FEC from enforcing the section during the 2006 election.  The District Court concluded sU. S.onte that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the merits and granted the FEC summary judgment.  
Held: 
1.This Court has jurisdiction to hear Davis appeal.  Pp.610.


(a)Davis has standing to challenge 319(b)s disclosure requirements.  When he filed suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by 319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more than $350,000 in personal funds.  He also faced the imminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure with further notifications once he passed the $350,000 mark.  Securing a declaration that 319(b) is unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement would have spared him from making those disclosures and also would have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on alleged 319(b) violations during his 2004 campaign.  Davis also has standing to challenge 319(a)s asymmetrical contribution limits.  The standing inquiry focuses on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed, see, e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 180, and a party facing prospective injury has standing where the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct, see, e.g., Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102.  Davis faced the requisite injury from 319(a) when he filed suit: He had already declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden his personal expenditure by allowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo that opportunity.  Pp.68. 


(b)The FECs argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction because Davis claims are moot also fails.  In Federal Election Commn v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), 551 U. S. ___, this Court rejected a very similar claim of mootness, finding that the case fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  Id., at ___.  That exception applies where (1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.  Ibid.  First, despite BCRAs command that the case be expedited to the greatest possible extent and Davis request that his case be resolved before the 2006 election, the case could not be resolved before the 2006 election.  See id., at ___.  Second, the FEC has conceded that Davis 319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if he planned to self-finance another bid for a House seat, and he subsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do so.  See id., at ___ .  Pp.89.


2.Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the First Amendment.  If 319(a)s elevated contribution limits applied across the board to all candidates, Davis would have no constitutional basis for challenging them.  Section 319(a), however, raises the limits only for non-self-financing candidates and only when the self-financing candidates expenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded.  This Court has never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates competing against each other, and it agrees with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.  In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, the Court soundly rejected a cap on a candidates expenditure of personal funds to finance campaign speech, holding that a candidate  has a First Amendment right to  vigorously and tirelessly  advocate his own election, and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes a substantial, clea[r,] and direc[t] restraint on that right, id., at 5253.  It found the cap at issue not justified by [t]he primary governmental interest in the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political process, id., at 53, or by [t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing for elective office, id., at 54.  Buckley is instructive here.  While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidates expenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right, requiring him to choose between the right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.  The resulting drag on First Amendment rights is not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice.  Id., at 5457, and n. 65, distinguished.  The burden is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption, see id., at 53.  Nor can an interest in leveling electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth justify 319(a)s asymmetrical limits, see id., at 5657.  The Court has never recognized this interest as a legitimate objective and doing so would have ominous implications for the voters authority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for office.  Finally, the Court rejects the Governments argument that 319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects resulting from the tight limits federal election law places on individual campaign contributions and coordinated party expenditures.  Whatever this arguments merits as an original matter, it is fundamentally at war with Buckleys analysis of expenditure and contributions limits, which this Court has applied in subsequent cases.  Pp.1017.


(c)Because 319(a) is unconstitutional, 319(b)s disclosure requirements, which were designed to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits, are as well.  [C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment, Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, so the Court closely scrutinizes such requirements, id., at 75.  For significant encroachments to survive, there must be a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed and the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the burden on First Amendment rights.  Ibid.  Given 319(a)s unconstitutionality, the burden imposed by the 319(b) requirements cannot be justified.  P.18.

appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
No. 07320.Argued April 22, 2008Decided June 26, 2008
Federal-law limits on the amount of contributions a House of Representatives candidate and his authorized committee may receive from an individual, and the amount his party may devote to coordinated campaign expenditures, 2 U. S.C. 441a(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(A), (c), and (d), normally apply equally to all competitors for a seat and their authorized committees.  However, 319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S.C. 441a1(a), part of the so-called Millionaires Amendment, fundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidates expenditure of personal funds, the opposition personal funds amount (OPFA) exceeds $350,000.  The OPFA is a statistic comparing competing candidates personal expenditures and taking account of certain other fundraising.  When a self-financing candidates personal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass $350,000, a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play.  The self-financing candidate remains subject to the normal limitations, but his opponent, the non-self-financing candidate, may receive individual contributions at treble the normal limit from individuals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate contributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures without limit.  See 441a1(a)(1)(A)(C).  Because calculating the OPFA requires certain information about the self-financing candidates campaign assets and personal expenditures, 319(b) requires him to file an initial declaration of intent revealing the amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000, and to make additional disclosures to the other candidates, their national parties, and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as his personal expenditures exceed certain benchmarks.


Appellant Davis, a candidate for a House seat in 2004 and 2006 who lost both times to the incumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006 election, in compliance with 319(b), that he intended to spend $1 million in personal funds.

07-219|"EXXON SHIPPING CO. etal. v. BAKER etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07219.Argued February 27, 2008Decided June 25, 2008
In 1989, petitioners (collectively, Exxon) supertanker grounded on a reef off Alaska, spilling millions of gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.  The accident occurred after the tankers captain, Joseph Hazelwoodwho had a history of alcohol abuse and whose blood still had a high alcohol level 11 hours after the spillinexplicably exited the bridge, leaving a tricky course correction to unlicensed subordinates.  Exxon spent some $2.1 billion in cleanup efforts, pleaded guilty to criminal violations occasioning fines, settled a civil action by the United States and Alaska for at least $900 million, and paid another $303 million in voluntary payments to private parties.  Other civil cases were consolidated into this one, brought against Exxon, Hazelwood, and others to recover economic losses suffered by respondents (hereinafter Baker), who depend on Prince William Sound for their livelihoods.  At Phase I of the trial, the jury found Exxon and Hazelwood reckless (and thus potentially liable for punitive damages) under instructions providing that a corporation is responsible for the reckless acts of employees acting in a managerial capacity in the scope of their employment.  In Phase II, the jury awarded $287 million in compensatory damages to some of the plaintiffs; others had settled their compensatory claims for $22.6 million.  In Phase III, the jury awarded $5,000 in punitive damages against Hazelwood and $5 billion against Exxon.  The Ninth Circuit upheld the Phase I jury instruction on corporate liability and ultimately remitted the punitive damages award against Exxon to $2.5 billion.  
Held:
1.Because the Court is equally divided on whether maritime law allows corporate liability for punitive damages based on the acts of managerial agents, it leaves the Ninth Circuits opinion undisturbed in this respect.  Of course, this disposition is not precedential on the derivative liability question.  See, e.g., Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 192.  Pp.710.


2.The Clean Water Acts water pollution penalties, 33 U. S.C. 1321, do not preempt punitive-damages awards in maritime spill cases.  Section 1321(b) protects navigable waters  , adjoining shorelines,  [and] natural resources, subject to a saving clause reserving obligations  under any  law for damages to any  privately owned property resulting from [an oil] discharge, 1321(o).  Exxons admission that the CWA does not displace compensatory remedies for the consequences of water pollution, even those for economic harms, leaves the company with the untenable claim that the CWA somehow preempts punitive damages, but not compensatory damages, for economic loss.  Nothing in the statute points to that result, and the Court has rejected similar attempts to sever remedies from their causes of action, see Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 255256.  There is no clear indication of congressional intent to occupy the entire field of pollution remedies, nor is it likely that punitive damages for private harms will have any frustrating effect on the CWAs remedial scheme.  Pp. 1015. 


3.The punitive damages award against Exxon was excessive as a matter of maritime common law.  In the circumstances of this case, the award should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages.  Pp. 1542.


(a)Although legal codes from ancient times through the Middle Ages called for multiple damages for certain especially harmful acts, modern Anglo-American punitive damages have their roots in 18th-century English law and became widely accepted in American courts by the mid-19th century.  See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371.  Pp. 1617. 


(b)The prevailing American rule limits punitive damages to cases of enormity, Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371, in which a defendants conduct is outrageous, owing to gross negligence, willful, wanton, and reckless indifference for others rights, or even more deplorable behavior.  The consensus today is that punitive damages are aimed at retribution and deterring harmful conduct.  Pp. 1721. 


(c)State regulation of punitive damages varies.  A few States award them rarely, or not at all, and others permit them only when authorized by statute.  Many States have imposed statutory limits on punitive awards, in the form of absolute monetary caps, a maximum ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, or, frequently, some combination of the two.  Pp. 2123. 


(d)American punitive damages have come under criticism in recent decades, but the most recent studies tend to undercut much of it.  Although some studies show the dollar amounts of awards growing over time, even in real terms, most accounts show that the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards remains less than 1:1.  Nor do the data show a marked increase in the percentage of cases with punitive awards.  The real problem is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards.  Courts are concerned with fairness as consistency, and the available data suggest that the spread between high and low individual awards is unacceptable.  The spread in state civil trials is great, and the outlier cases subject defendants to punitive damages that dwarf the corresponding compensatories.  The distribution of judge-assessed awards is narrower, but still remarkable.  These ranges might be acceptable if they resulted from efforts to reach a generally accepted optimal level of penalty and deterrence in cases involving a wide range of circumstances, but anecdotal evidence suggests that is not the case, see, e.g., Gore, supra, at 565, n.8.  Pp. 2427. 


(e)This Courts response to outlier punitive damages awards has thus far been confined by claims that state-court awards violated due process.  See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U. S. 408, 425.  In contrast, todays enquiry arises under federal maritime jurisdiction and requires review of a jury award at the level of judge-made federal common law that precedes and should obviate any application of the constitutional standard.  In this context, the unpredictability of high punitive awards is in tension with their punitive function because of the implication of unfairness that an eccentrically high punitive verdict carries.  A penalty should be reasonably predictable in its severity, so that even Holmess bad man can look ahead with some ability to know what the stakes are in choosing one course of action or another.  And a penalty scheme ought to threaten defendants with a fair probability of suffering in like degree for like damage.  Cf. Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113.  Pp. 2829.


(f)The Court considers three approaches, one verbal and two quantitative, to arrive at a standard for assessing maritime punitive damages.  Pp. 2942. 


(i)The Court is skeptical that verbal formulations are the best insurance against unpredictable outlier punitive awards, in light of its experience with attempts to produce consistency in the analogous business of criminal sentencing.  Pp. 2932. 


(ii)Thus, the Court looks to quantified limits.  The option of setting a hard-dollar punitive cap, however, is rejected because there is no standard tort or contract injury, making it difficult to settle upon a particular dollar figure as appropriate across the board; and because a judicially selected dollar cap would carry the serious drawback that the issue might not return to the docket before there was a need to revisit the figure selected.  Pp. 3239.


(iii)The more promising alternative is to peg punitive awards to compensatory damages using a ratio or maximum multiple.  This is the model in many States and in analogous federal statutes allowing multiple damages.  The question is what ratio is most appropriate.  An acceptable standard can be found in the studies showing the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards.  Those studies reflect the judgments of juries and judges in thousands of cases as to what punitive awards were appropriate in circumstances reflecting the most down to the least blameworthy conduct, from malice and avarice to recklessness to gross negligence.  The data in question put the median ratio for the entire gamut at less than 1:1, meaning that the compensatory award exceeds the punitive award in most cases.  In a well-functioning system, awards at or below the median would roughly express jurors sense of reasonable penalties in cases like this one that have no earmarks of exceptional blameworthiness.  Accordingly, the Court finds that a 1:1 ratio is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases.  Pp. 3942.  


(iv)Applying this standard to the present case, the Court takes for granted the District Courts calculation of the total relevant compensatory damages at $507.5 million.  A punitive-to-compensatory ratio of 1:1 thus yields maximum punitive damages in that amount.  P. 42.  
472 F.3d 600 and 490 F.3d 1066, vacated and remanded.

2.The Clean Water Acts water pollution penalties, 33 U. S.C. 1321, do not preempt punitive-damages awards in maritime spill cases.  Section 1321(b) protects navigable waters  , adjoining shorelines,  [and] natural resources, subject to a saving clause reserving obligations  under any  law for damages to any  privately owned property resulting from [an oil] discharge, 1321(o).  Exxons admission that the CWA does not displace compensatory remedies for the consequences of water pollution, even those for economic harms, leaves the company with the untenable claim that the CWA somehow preempts punitive damages, but not compensatory damages, for economic loss.  Nothing in the statute points to that result, and the Court has rejected similar attempts to sever remedies from their causes of action, see Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 255256.  There is no clear indication of congressional intent to occupy the entire field of pollution remedies, nor is it likely that punitive damages for private harms will have any frustrating effect on the CWAs remedial scheme.  Pp. 1015. 


3.The punitive damages award against Exxon was excessive as a matter of maritime common law.  In the circumstances of this case, the award should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages.  Pp. 1542.


(a)Although legal codes from ancient times through the Middle Ages called for multiple damages for certain especially harmful acts, modern Anglo-American punitive damages have their roots in 18th-century English law and became widely accepted in American courts by the mid-19th century.  See, e.g., Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371.  Pp. 1617. 


(b)The prevailing American rule limits punitive damages to cases of enormity, Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371, in which a defendants conduct is outrageous, owing to gross negligence, willful, wanton, and reckless indifference for others rights, or even more deplorable behavior.  The consensus today is that punitive damages are aimed at retribution and deterring harmful conduct.  Pp. 1721. 


(c)State regulation of punitive damages varies.  A few States award them rarely, or not at all, and others permit them only when authorized by statute.  Many States have imposed statutory limits on punitive awards, in the form of absolute monetary caps, a maximum ratio of punitive to compensatory damages, or, frequently, some combination of the two.  Pp. 2123. 


(d)American punitive damages have come under criticism in recent decades, but the most recent studies tend to undercut much of it.  Although some studies show the dollar amounts of awards growing over time, even in real terms, most accounts show that the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards remains less than 1:1.  Nor do the data show a marked increase in the percentage of cases with punitive awards.  The real problem is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards.  Courts are concerned with fairness as consistency, and the available data suggest that the spread between high and low individual awards is unacceptable.  The spread in state civil trials is great, and the outlier cases subject defendants to punitive damages that dwarf the corresponding compensatories.  The distribution of judge-assessed awards is narrower, but still remarkable.  These ranges might be acceptable if they resulted from efforts to reach a generally accepted optimal level of penalty and deterrence in cases involving a wide range of circumstances, but anecdotal evidence suggests that is not the case, see, e.g., Gore, supra, at 565, n.8.  Pp. 2427. 


(e)This Courts response to outlier punitive damages awards has thus far been confined by claims that state-court awards violated due process.  See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U. S. 408, 425.  In contrast, todays enquiry arises under federal maritime jurisdiction and requires review of a jury award at the level of judge-made federal common law that precedes and should obviate any application of the constitutional standard.  In this context, the unpredictability of high punitive awards is in tension with their punitive function because of the implication of unfairness that an eccentrically high punitive verdict carries.  A penalty should be reasonably predictable in its severity, so that even Holmess bad man can look ahead with some ability to know what the stakes are in choosing one course of action or another.  And a penalty scheme ought to threaten defendants with a fair probability of suffering in like degree for like damage.  Cf. Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113.  Pp. 2829.


(f)The Court considers three approaches, one verbal and two quantitative, to arrive at a standard for assessing maritime punitive damages.  Pp. 2942. 


(i)The Court is skeptical that verbal formulations are the best insurance against unpredictable outlier punitive awards, in light of its experience with attempts to produce consistency in the analogous business of criminal sentencing.  Pp. 2932. 


(ii)Thus, the Court looks to quantified limits.  The option of setting a hard-dollar punitive cap, however, is rejected because there is no standard tort or contract injury, making it difficult to settle upon a particular dollar figure as appropriate across the board; and because a judicially selected dollar cap would carry the serious drawback that the issue might not return to the docket before there was a need to revisit the figure selected.  Pp. 3239.


(iii)The more promising alternative is to peg punitive awards to compensatory damages using a ratio or maximum multiple.  This is the model in many States and in analogous federal statutes allowing multiple damages.  The question is what ratio is most appropriate.  An acceptable standard can be found in the studies showing the median ratio of punitive to compensatory awards.  Those studies reflect the judgments of juries and judges in thousands of cases as to what punitive awards were appropriate in circumstances reflecting the most down to the least blameworthy conduct, from malice and avarice to recklessness to gross negligence.  The data in question put the median ratio for the entire gamut at less than 1:1, meaning that the compensatory award exceeds the punitive award in most cases.  In a well-functioning system, awards at or below the median would roughly express jurors sense of reasonable penalties in cases like this one that have no earmarks of exceptional blameworthiness.  Accordingly, the Court finds that a 1:1 ratio is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases.  Pp. 3942.  


(iv)Applying this standard to the present case, the Court takes for granted the District Courts calculation of the total relevant compensatory damages at $507.5 million.  A punitive-to-compensatory ratio of 1:1 thus yields maximum punitive damages in that amount.  P. 42.

07-343|"KENNEDY v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana
No. 07343.Argued April 16, 2008Decided June 25, 2008
Louisiana charged petitioner with the aggravated rape of his then-8-year-old stepdaughter.  He was convicted and sentenced to death under a state statute authorizing capital punishment for the rape of a child under 12.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioners reliance on Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, which barred the use of the death penalty as punishment for the rape of an adult woman but left open the question which, if any, other nonhomicide crimes can be punished by death consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Reasoning that children are a class in need of special protection, the state court held child rape to be unique in terms of the harm it inflicts upon the victim and society and concluded that, short of first-degree murder, there is no crime more deserving of death.  The court acknowledged that petitioner would be the first person executed since the state law was amended to authorize the death penalty for child rape in 1995, and that Louisiana is in the minority of jurisdictions authorizing death for that crime.  However, emphasizing that four more States had capitalized child rape since 1995 and at least eight others had authorized death for other nonhomicide crimes, as well as that, under Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, and Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, it is the direction of change rather than the numerical count that is significant, the court held petitioners death sentence to be constitutional.
Held:The Eighth Amendment bars Louisiana from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the victims death.  Pp.836.
1.The Amendments Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause draw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101.  The standard for extreme cruelty itself remains the same, but its applicability must change as the basic mores of society change.  Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 382.  Under the precept of justice that punishment is to be graduated and proportioned to the crime, informed by evolving standards, capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution. Roper, supra, at 568.  Applying this principle, the Court held in Roper and Atkins that the execution of juveniles and mentally retarded persons violates the Eighth Amendment because the offender has a diminished personal responsibility for the crime.  The Court also has found the death penalty disproportionate to the crime itself where the crime did not result, or was not intended to result, in the victims death.  See, e.g., Coker, supra; Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782.  In making its determination, the Court is guided by objective indicia of societys standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice with respect to executions.  Roper, supra, at 563.  Consensus is not dispositive, however.  Whether the death penalty is disproportionate to the crime also depends on the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and on the Courts own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendments text, history, meaning, and purpose.  Pp.810. 


2.A review of the authorities informed by contemporary norms, including the history of the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes and new enactments, and the number of executions since 1964, demonstrates a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape.  Pp.1123. 


(a)The Court follows the approach of cases in which objective indicia of consensus demonstrated an opinion against the death penalty for juveniles, see Roper, supra, mentally retarded offenders, see Atkins, supra, and vicarious felony murderers, see Enmund, supra.  Thirty-seven jurisdictions36 States plus the Federal Governmentcurrently impose capital punishment, but only six States authorize it for child rape.  In 45 jurisdictions, by contrast, petitioner could not be executed for child rape of any kind.  That number surpasses the 30 States in Atkins and Roper and the 42 in Enmund that prohibited the death penalty under the circumstances those cases considered.  Pp.1115. 


(b)Respondents argument that Cokers general discussion contrasting murder and rape, 433 U. S., at 598, has been interpreted too expansively, leading some States to conclude that Coker applies to child rape when in fact it does not, is unsound.  Cokers holding was narrower than some of its language read in isolation indicates.  The Coker plurality framed the question as whether, with respect to rape of an adult woman, the death penalty is disproportionate punishment, id., at 592, and it repeated the phrase adult woman or adult female eight times in discussing the crime or the victim.  The distinction between adult and child rape was not merely rhetorical; it was central to Cokers reasoning, including its analysis of legislative consensus.  See, e.g., id., at 595596.  There is little evidence to support respondents contention that state legislatures have understood Coker to state a broad rule that covers minor victims, and state courts have uniformly concluded that Coker did not address that crime.  Accordingly, the small number of States that have enacted the death penalty for child rape is relevant to determining whether there is a consensus against capital punishment for the rape of a child.  Pp.1520. 


(c)A consistent direction of change in support of the death penalty for child rape might counterbalance an otherwise weak demonstration of consensus, see, e.g., Atkins, 536 U. S., at 315, but no showing of consistent change has been made here.  That five States may have had pending legislation authorizing death for child rape is not dispositive because it is not this Courts practice, nor is it sound, to find contemporary norms based on legislation proposed but not yet enacted.  Indeed, since the parties submitted their briefs, the legislation in at least two of the five States has failed.  Further, evidence that, in the last 13 years, six new death penalty statutes have been enacted, three in the last two years, is not as significant as the data in Atkins, where 18 States between 1986 and 2001 had enacted legislation prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons.  See id., at 314315.  Respondent argues that this case is like Roper because, there, only five States had shifted their positions between 1989 and 2005, one less State than here.  See 543 U. S., at 565.  But the Roper Court emphasized that the slow pace of abolition was counterbalanced by the total number of States that had recognized the impropriety of executing juvenile offenders.  See id., at 566567.  Here, the fact that only six States have made child rape a capital offense is not an indication of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one in Roper.  The evidence bears a closer resemblance to that in Enmund, where the Court found a national consensus against death for vicarious felony murder despite eight jurisdictions having authorized it.  See 458 U. S., at 789, 792.  Pp.2022. 


(d)Execution statistics also confirm that there is a social consensus against the death penalty for child rape.  Nine States have permitted capital punishment for adult or child rape for some length of time between the Courts 1972 Furman decision and today; yet no individual has been executed for the rape of an adult or child since 1964, and no execution for any other nonhomicide offense has been conducted since 1963.  Louisiana is the only State since 1964 that has sentenced an individual to death for child rape, and petitioner and another man so sentenced are the only individuals now on death row in the United States for nonhomicide offenses.  Pp.2223. 


3.Informed by its own precedents and its understanding of the Constitution and the rights it secures, the Court concludes, in its independent judgment, that the death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the crime of child rape.  Pp.2335.  


(a)The Courts own judgment should be brought to bear on the death penaltys acceptability under the Eighth Amendment.  See, e.g., Coker, supra, at 597.  Rapes permanent and devastating impact on a child suggests moral grounds for questioning a rule barring capital punishment simply because the crime did not result in the victims death, but it does not follow that death is a proportionate penalty for child rape.  The constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments mandates that punishment be exercised within the limits of civilized standards.  Trop, 356 U. S., at 99100.  Evolving standards of decency counsel the Court to be most hesitant before allowing extension of the death penalty, especially where no life was taken in the commission of the crime.  See, e.g., Coker, 433 U. S., at 597598; Enmund, 458 U. S., at 797.  Consistent with those evolving standards and the teachings of its precedents, the Court concludes that there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individuals, even including child rape, on the other.  The latter crimes may be devastating in their harm, as here, but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, they cannot compare to murder in their severity and irrevocability, id, at 598. The Court finds significant the substantial number of executions that would be allowed for child rape under respondents approach.  Although narrowing aggravators might be used to ensure the death penaltys restrained application in this context, as they are in the context of capital murder, all such standards have the potential to result in some inconsistency of application.  The Court, for example, has acknowledged that the requirement of general rules to ensure consistency of treatment, see, e.g., Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, and the insistence that capital sentencing be individualized, see, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, have resulted in tension and imprecision.  This approach might be sound with respect to capital murder but it should not be introduced into the justice system where death has not occurred.  The Court has spent more than 32 years developing a foundational jurisprudence for capital murder to guide the States and juries in imposing the death penalty.  Beginning the same process for crimes for which no one has been executed in more than 40 years would require experimentation in an area where a failed experiment would result in the execution of individuals undeserving of death.  Pp.2430. 


(b)The Courts decision is consistent with the justifications offered for the death penalty, retribution and deterrence, see, e.g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 183.  Among the factors for determining whether retribution is served, the Court must look to whether the death penalty balances the wrong to the victim in nonhomicide cases.  Cf. Roper, supra, at 571.  It is not at all evident that the child rape victims hurt is lessened when the law permits the perpetrators death, given that capital cases require a long-term commitment by those testifying for the prosecution.  Societys desire to inflict death for child rape by enlisting the child victim to assist it over the course of years in asking for capital punishment forces a moral choice on the child, who is not of mature age to make that choice.  There are also relevant systemic concerns in prosecuting child rape, including the documented problem of unreliable, induced, and even imagined child testimony, which creates a special risk of wrongful execution in some cases.  Cf. Atkins, supra, at 321.  As to deterrence, the evidence suggests that the death penalty may not result in more effective enforcement, but may add to the risk of nonreporting of child rape out of fear of negative consequences for the perpetrator, especially if he is a family member.  And, by in effect making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent, a State may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill his victim.  Pp.3035. 


4.The concern that the Courts holding will effectively block further development of a consensus favoring the death penalty for child rape overlooks the principle that the Eighth Amendment is defined by the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, Trop, 356 U. S., at 101.  Confirmed by the Courts repeated, consistent rulings, this principle requires that resort to capital punishment be restrained, limited in its instances of application, and reserved for the worst of crimes, those that, in the case of crimes against individuals, take the victims life.  P.36.

07-411|"PLAINS COMMERCE BANK v. LONG FAMILY LAND & CATTLE CO., INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 07411.Argued April 14, 2008Decided June 25, 2008
Petitioner Plains Commerce Bank (Bank), a non-Indian bank, sold land it owned in fee simple on a tribal reservation to non-Indians.  Respondents the Longs, an Indian couple who had been leasing the land with an option to purchase, claim the Bank discriminated against them by selling the parcel to nonmembers of the Tribe on terms more favorable than the Bank offered to sell it to them.  The couple sued in Tribal Court, asserting, inter alia, discrimination, breach-of-contract, and bad-faith claims.  Over the Banks objection, the Tribal Court concluded that it had jurisdiction and proceeded to trial, where a jury ruled against the Bank on three claims, including the discrimination claim.  The court awarded the Longs damages plus interest.  In a supplemental judgment, the court also gave the Longs an option to purchase that portion of the fee land they still occupied, nullifying the Banks sale of the land to non-Indians.  After the Tribal Court of Appeals affirmed, the Bank filed suit in Federal District Court, contending that the tribal judgment was null and void because, as relevant here, the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over the Longs discrimination claim.  The District Court granted the Longs summary judgment, finding tribal court jurisdiction proper because the Banks consensual relationship with the Longs and their company (also a respondent here) brought the Bank within the first category of tribal civil jurisdiction over nonmembers outlined in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Tribe had authority to regulate the business conduct of persons voluntarily dealing with tribal members, including a nonmembers sale of fee land.  
Held: 
1.The Bank has Article III standing to pursue this challenge.  Both with respect to damages and the option to purchase, the Bank  was injured in fact, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560, by the Tribal Courts exercise of jurisdiction over the discrimination claim.  This Court is unpersuaded by the Longs claim that the damages award was premised entirely on their breach-of-contract verdict, which the Bank has not challenged, rather than on their discrimination claim.  Because the verdict form allowed the jury to make a damages award after finding liability as to any of the individual claims, the jury could have based its damages award, in whole or in part, on the discrimination finding.  The Bank was also injured by the option to purchase.  Only the Longs discrimination claim sought deed to the land as relief.  The fact that the remedial purchase option applied only to a portion of the total parcel does not eliminate the injury to the Bank, which had no obligation to sell any of the land to the Longs before the Tribal Courts judgment.  That judgment effectively nullified a portion of the sale to a third party.  These injuries can be remedied by a ruling that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction and that its judgment on the discrimination claim is null and void.  Pp.58.


2.The Tribal Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a discrimination claim concerning the non-Indian Banks sale of its fee land.  Pp.824.


(a)The general rule that tribes do not possess authority over non-Indians who come within their borders, Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 564, 565, restricts tribal authority over nonmember activities taking place on the reservation, and is particularly strong when the nonmembers activity occurs on land owned in fee simple by non-Indians, Strate v. A-1 Contractors, 520 U. S. 438, 446.  Once tribal land is converted into fee simple, the tribe loses plenary jurisdiction over it.  See County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 267268.  Moreover, when the tribe or its members convey fee land to third parties, the tribe loses any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed lands.  South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679, 689.  Thus, the tribe has no authority itself  to regulate the use of fee land.  Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 430.  Montana provides two exceptions under which tribes may exercise civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands, 450 U. S., at 565: (1) A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements, ibid.; and (2) a tribe may exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within the reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe, id., at 566.  Neither exception authorizes tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs discrimination claim.  Pp.811.


(b)The Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear that claim because the Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Banks sale of its fee land, and a tribes adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction, Strate, supra, at 453.  Montana does not permit tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.  Rather, it permits tribal regulation of nonmember conduct inside the reservation that implicates the tribes sovereign interests.  450 U. S., at 564565.  With only one exception, see Brendale, supra, this Court has never upheld under Montana the extension of tribal civil authority over nonmembers on non-Indian land, Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353, 360.  Nor has the Court found that Montana authorized a tribe to regulate the sale of such land.  This makes good sense, given the limited nature of tribal sovereignty and the liberty interests of nonmembers.  Tribal sovereign interests are confined to managing tribal land, see Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, protecting tribal self-government, and controlling internal relations, see Montana, supra, at 564.  Regulations approved under Montana all flow from these limited interests.  See, e.g., Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 696.  None of these interests justified tribal regulation of a nonmembers sale of fee land.  The Tribe cannot justify regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land by reference to its power to superintend tribal land because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to be tribal land.  Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the Tribes interest in protecting internal relations and self-government.  Any direct harm sustained because of a fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian hands.  Resale, by itself, causes no additional damage.  Regulating fee land sales also runs the risk of subjecting nonmembers to tribal regulatory authority without their consent.  Because the Bill of Rights does not apply to tribes and because nonmembers have no say in the laws and regulations governing tribal territory, tribal laws and regulations may be applied only to nonmembers who have consented to tribal authority, expressly or by action.  Even then the regulation must stem from the tribes inherent sovereign authority to set conditions on entry, preserve self-government, or control internal relations.  There is no reason the Bank should have anticipated that its general business dealings with the Longs would permit the Tribe to regulate the Banks sale of land it owned in fee simple.  The Longs attempt to salvage their position by arguing that the discrimination claim should be read to challenge the Banks whole course of commercial dealings with them is unavailing.  Their breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims involve the Banks general dealings; the discrimination claim does not.  The discrimination claim is tied specifically to the fee land sale.  And only the discrimination claim is before the Court.  Pp.1122.


(c)Because the second Montana exception stems from the same sovereign interests giving rise to the first, it is also inapplicable here.  The conduct covered by that exception must do more than injure a tribe; it must imperil the subsistence of the tribal community.  Montana, 450 U. S., at 566.  The land at issue has been owned by a non-Indian party for at least 50 years.  Its resale to another non-Indian hardly imperil[s] the subsistence or welfare of the tribe.  Ibid.  Pp. 2223.


(d)Contrary to the Longs argument, when the Bank sought the Tribal Courts aid in serving process on the Longs for the Banks pending state-court eviction action, the Bank did not consent to tribal court jurisdiction over the discrimination claim.  The Bank has consistently contended that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction.  P.23.

Moreover, when the tribe or its members convey fee land to third parties, the tribe loses any former right of absolute and exclusive use and occupation of the conveyed lands.  South Dakota v.

Montana provides two exceptions under which tribes may exercise civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indian fee lands, 450 U. S., at 565: (1) A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements, ibid.; and (2) a tribe may exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee lands within the reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe, id., at 566.  Neither exception authorizes tribal courts to exercise jurisdiction over the Longs discrimination claim.  Pp.811.


(b)The Tribal Court lacks jurisdiction to hear that claim because the Tribe lacks the civil authority to regulate the Banks sale of its fee land, and a tribes adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction, Strate, supra, at 453.  Montana does not permit tribes to regulate the sale of non-Indian fee land.

None of these interests justified tribal regulation of a nonmembers sale of fee land.  The Tribe cannot justify regulation of the sale of non-Indian fee land by reference to its power to superintend tribal land because non-Indian fee parcels have ceased to be tribal land.  Nor can regulation of fee land sales be justified by the Tribes interest in protecting internal relations and self-government.  Any direct harm sustained because of a fee land sale is sustained at the point the land passes from Indian to non-Indian hands.  Resale, by itself, causes no additional damage.

07-6053|"GILES v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california
No. 076053.Argued April 22, 2008Decided June 25, 2008
At petitioner Giles murder trial, the court allowed prosecutors to introduce statements that the murder victim had made to a police officer responding to a domestic violence call.  Giles was convicted.  While his appeal was pending, this Court held that the Sixth Amendments Confrontation Clause gives defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses who give testimony against them, except in cases where an exception to the confrontation right was recognized at the founding.  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 5354.  The State Court of Appeal concluded that the Confrontation Clause permitted the trial court to admit into evidence the unconfronted testimony of the murder victim under a doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.  It concluded that Giles had forfeited his right to confront the victims testimony because it found Giles had committed the murder for which he was on trialan intentional criminal act that made the victim unavailable to testify.  The State Supreme Court affirmed on the same ground.
Held:The California Supreme Courts theory of forfeiture by wrongdoing is not an exception to the Sixth Amendments confrontation requirement because it was not an exception established at the founding.  Pp.320; 2224.
(a)Common-law courts allowed the introduction of statements by an absent witness who was detained or kept away by means or procurement of the defendant.  Cases and treatises indicate that this rule applied only when the defendant engaged in conduct designed to prevent the witness from testifying.  Pp.47.


(b)The manner in which this forfeiture rule was applied makes plain that unconfronted testimony would not be admitted without a showing that the defendant intended to prevent a witness from testifying.  In cases where the evidence suggested that the defendant wrongfully caused the absence of a witness, but had not done so to prevent the witness from testifying, unconfronted testimony was excluded unless it fell within the separate common-law exception to the confrontation requirement for statements made by speakers who were both on the brink of death and aware that they were dying.  Pp.711.


(c)Not only was Californias proposed exception to the confrontation right plainly not an exceptio[n] established at the time of the founding, Crawford, supra, at 54; it is not established in American jurisprudence since the founding.  No case before 1985 applied forfeiture to admit statements outside the context of conduct designed to prevent a witness from testifying.  The view that the exception applies only when the defendant intends to make a witness unavailable is also supported by modern authorities, such as Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(6), which codifies the forfeiture doctrine, Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.813, 833.  Pp.1114. 


(d) The dissents contention that no testimony would come in at common law under a forfeiture theory unless it was confronted is not supported by the cases.  In any event, if the dissents theory were true, it would not support a broader forfeiture exception but would eliminate the forfeiture exception entirely.  Previously confronted testimony by an unavailable witness is always admissible, wrongful procurement or not.  See Crawford, supra, at 68.  Pp.1520.


(e) Acts of domestic violence are often intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help.  A defendants prior abuse, or threats of abuse, intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help would be highly relevant to determining the intent of a defendants subsequent act causing the witnesss absence, as would evidence of ongoing criminal proceedings at which the victim would have been expected to testify.  Here, the state courts did not consider Giles intent, which they found irrelevant under their interpretation of the forfeiture doctrine.  They are free to consider intent on remand.  Pp.  2324.

07-330|"GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 07330.Argued April 15, 2008Decided June 23, 2008
Petitioner Greenlaw was convicted of seven drug and firearms charges and was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months.  In calculating this sentence, the District Court made an error.  Overlooking this Courts controlling decision in Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132137, interpreting 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(C)(i), and over the Governments objection, the District Court imposed a 10-year sentence on a count that carried a 25-year mandatory minimum term.  Greenlaw appealed urging, inter alia, that the appropriate sentence for all his convictions was 15 years.  The Government neither appealed nor cross-appealed.  The Eighth Circuit found no merit in any of Greenlaws arguments, but went on to consider whether his sentence was too low.  The court acknowledged that the Government, while it had objected to the trial courts error at sentencing, had elected not to seek alteration of Greenlaws sentence on appeal.  Nonetheless, relying on the plain-error rule stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to enlarge Greenlaws sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term of 662 months.
Held:Absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the Eighth Circuit could not, on its own initiative, order an increase in Greenlaws sentence.  Pp.517.
(a)In both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, courts follow the principle of party presentation, i.e., the parties frame the issues for decision and the courts generally serve as neutral arbiters of matters the parties present.  To the extent courts have approved departures from the party presentation principle in criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a pro se litigants rights.  See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 381383.  The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation principle.  Under that rule, it takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee.  See McDonough v. Dannery, 3 Dall. 188.  This Court has called the rule inveterate and certain, Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185, 191, and has in no case ordered an exception to it, El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 480.  No exception is warranted here.  Congress has specified that when a United States Attorney files a notice of appeal with respect to a criminal sentence, [t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.  18 U. S. C. 3742(b).  This provision gives the top representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they may be.  Pp.58.


(b)The Eighth Circuit held that the plain-error rule, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), authorized it to order the sentence enhancement sU. S.onte.  Nothing in the text or history of Rule52(b), or in this Courts decisions, suggests that the plain-error rule was meant to override the cross-appeal requirement.  In every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modifying a judgment to the advantage of a party who did not seek this Courts review, the Court has invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.  See, e.g., Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191; Strunk v. United States, 412 U. S. 434.  Even if it would be proper for an appeals court to initiate plain-error review in some cases, sentencing errors that the Government has refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill.  In 3742(b), Congress assigned to leading Department of Justice officers responsibility for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing appeal is in order.  Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interference with the assessment of those officers.  Pp.810.


(c)Amicus curiae, invited by the Court to brief and argue the case in support of the Court of Appeals judgment, links argument based on Rule52(b) to similar argument based on 28 U. S.C. 2106.  For substantially the same reasons that Rule52(b) does not override the cross-appeal rule, 2106 does not do so either.  P.10.


(d)Amicus also argues that 18 U. S.C. 3742, which governs appellate review of criminal sentences, overrides the cross-appeal rule for sentences imposed in violation of law, 3742(e).  Amicus construction of 3742 is novel and complex, but ultimately unpersuasive.  At the time 3742 was enacted, the cross-appeal rule was a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice.  Congress had crafted explicit exceptions to the cross-appeal rule in earlier statutes governing sentencing appeals, i.e., the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  When Congress repealed those exceptions and enacted 3742, it did not similarly express in the text of 3742 any exception to the cross-appeal rule.  This drafting history suggests that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule and framed 3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with it.  Pp.1013.


(e)In increasing Greenlaws sentence sU. S.onte, the Eighth Circuit did not advert to the procedural rules setting firm deadlines for launching appeals and cross-appeals.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3(a)(1), 4(b)(1)(B)(ii), 4(b)(4), 26(b).  The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal serve, as the cross-appeal rule does, the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair warning and finality.  The time limits would be undermined if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of appeal.  In a criminal prosecution, moreover, the defendant would appeal at his peril, with nothing to alert him that, on his own appeal, his sentence would be increased until the appeals court so decreed.  Pp.1315.


(f)Nothing in this opinion requires courts to modify their current practice in sentencing package cases involving multicount indictments and a successful attack on some but not all of the counts of conviction.  The appeals court, in such cases, may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan.  On remand, trial courts have imposed a sentence on the remaining counts longer than the sentence originally imposed on those particular counts, but yielding an aggregate sentence no longer than the aggregate sentence initially imposed.  This practice is not at odds with the cross-appeal rule, which stops appellate judges from adding years to a defendants sentence on their own initiative.  In any event, this is not a sentencing package case.  Greenlaw was unsuccessful on all his appellate issues.  The Eighth Circuit, therefore, had no occasion to vacate his sentence and no warrant, in the absence of a cross-appeal, to order the addition of 15 years to his sentence.  Pp.1516.

			"|"GREENLAW v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 07330.Argued April 15, 2008Decided June 23, 2008
Petitioner Greenlaw was convicted of seven drug and firearms charges and was sentenced to imprisonment for 442 months.  In calculating this sentence, the District Court made an error.  Overlooking this Courts controlling decision in Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132137, interpreting 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1)(C)(i), and over the Governments objection, the District Court imposed a 10-year sentence on a count that carried a 25-year mandatory minimum term.  Greenlaw appealed urging, inter alia, that the appropriate sentence for all his convictions was 15 years.  The Government neither appealed nor cross-appealed.  The Eighth Circuit found no merit in any of Greenlaws arguments, but went on to consider whether his sentence was too low.  The court acknowledged that the Government, while it had objected to the trial courts error at sentencing, had elected not to seek alteration of Greenlaws sentence on appeal.  Nonetheless, relying on the plain-error rule stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), the Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to enlarge Greenlaws sentence by 15 years, yielding a total prison term of 662 months.
Held:Absent a Government appeal or cross-appeal, the Eighth Circuit could not, on its own initiative, order an increase in Greenlaws sentence.  Pp.517.
(a)In both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, courts follow the principle of party presentation, i.e., the parties frame the issues for decision and the courts generally serve as neutral arbiters of matters the parties present.  To the extent courts have approved departures from the party presentation principle in criminal cases, the justification has usually been to protect a pro se litigants rights.  See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 381383.  The cross-appeal rule, pivotal in this case, is both informed by, and illustrative of, the party presentation principle.  Under that rule, it takes a cross-appeal to justify a remedy in favor of an appellee.  See McDonough v. Dannery, 3 Dall. 188.  This Court has called the rule inveterate and certain, Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185, 191, and has in no case ordered an exception to it, El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U. S. 473, 480.  No exception is warranted here.  Congress has specified that when a United States Attorney files a notice of appeal with respect to a criminal sentence, [t]he Government may not further prosecute [the] appeal without the personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.  18 U. S. C. 3742(b).  This provision gives the top representatives of the United States in litigation the prerogative to seek or forgo appellate correction of sentencing errors, however plain they may be.  Pp.58.


(b)The Eighth Circuit held that the plain-error rule, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b), authorized it to order the sentence enhancement sU. S.onte.  Nothing in the text or history of Rule52(b), or in this Courts decisions, suggests that the plain-error rule was meant to override the cross-appeal requirement.  In every case in which correction of a plain error would result in modifying a judgment to the advantage of a party who did not seek this Courts review, the Court has invoked the cross-appeal rule to bar the correction.  See, e.g., Chittenden v. Brewster, 2 Wall. 191; Strunk v. United States, 412 U. S. 434.  Even if it would be proper for an appeals court to initiate plain-error review in some cases, sentencing errors that the Government has refrained from pursuing would not fit the bill.  In 3742(b), Congress assigned to leading Department of Justice officers responsibility for determining when Government pursuit of a sentencing appeal is in order.  Rule 52(b) does not invite appellate court interference with the assessment of those officers.  Pp.810.


(c)Amicus curiae, invited by the Court to brief and argue the case in support of the Court of Appeals judgment, links argument based on Rule52(b) to similar argument based on 28 U. S.C. 2106.  For substantially the same reasons that Rule52(b) does not override the cross-appeal rule, 2106 does not do so either.  P.10.


(d)Amicus also argues that 18 U. S.C. 3742, which governs appellate review of criminal sentences, overrides the cross-appeal rule for sentences imposed in violation of law, 3742(e).  Amicus construction of 3742 is novel and complex, but ultimately unpersuasive.  At the time 3742 was enacted, the cross-appeal rule was a solidly grounded rule of appellate practice.  Congress had crafted explicit exceptions to the cross-appeal rule in earlier statutes governing sentencing appeals, i.e., the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  When Congress repealed those exceptions and enacted 3742, it did not similarly express in the text of 3742 any exception to the cross-appeal rule.  This drafting history suggests that Congress was aware of the cross-appeal rule and framed 3742 expecting that the new provision would operate in harmony with it.  Pp.1013.

Rules App. Proc. 3(a)(1), 4(b)(1)(B)(ii), 4(b)(4), 26(b).  The strict time limits on notices of appeal and cross-appeal serve, as the cross-appeal rule does, the interests of the parties and the legal system in fair warning and finality.  The time limits would be undermined if an appeals court could modify a judgment in favor of a party who filed no notice of appeal.

07-440|"ROTHGERY v. GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXAS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 07440.Argued March 17, 2008Decided June 23, 2008
Texas police relied on erroneous information that petitioner Rothgery had a previous felony conviction to arrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm.  The officers brought Rothgery before a magistrate judge, as required by state law, for a so-called article 15.17 hearing, at which the Fourth Amendment probable-cause determination was made, bail was set, and Rothgery was formally apprised of the accusation against him.  After the hearing, the magistrate judge committed Rothgery to jail, and he was released after posting a surety bond.  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several unheeded oral and written requests for appointed counsel.  He was subsequently indicted and rearrested, his bail was increased, and he was jailed when he could not post the bail.  Subsequently, Rothgery was assigned a lawyer, who assembled the paperwork that prompted the indictments dismissal.


Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S.C. 1983 action against respondent County, claiming that if it had provided him a lawyer within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed.  He asserts that the Countys unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out on bond until an indictment is entered violates his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The District Court granted the County summary judgment, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, considering itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that the right to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing because the relevant prosecutors were not aware of, or involved in, Rothgerys arrest or appearance at the hearing, and there was no indication that the officer at Rothgerys appearance had any power to commit the State to prosecute without a prosecutors knowledge or involvement.  
Held:A criminal defendants initial appearance before a magistrate judge, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Attachment does not also require that a prosecutor (as distinct from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct.  Pp.520.  
(a)Texass article 15.17 hearing marks the point of attachment, with the consequent state obligation to appoint counsel within a reasonable time once a request for assistance is made.  This Court has twice held that the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance before a judicial officer at which a defendant is told of the formal accusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty.  See Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 629, n. 3; Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 398399.  Rothgerys hearing was an initial appearance:he was taken before a magistrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail.  Thus, Brewer and Jackson control.  Pp.510. 


(b)In McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 180181, the Court reaffirmed that [t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the first formal proceeding against an accused, and observed that in most States  free counsel is made available at that time.  That observation remains true today.  The overwhelming consensus practice conforms to the rule that the first formal proceeding is the point of attachment.  The Court is advised without contradiction that not only the Federal Government, including the District of Columbia, but 43 States take the first step toward appointing counsel before, at, or just after initial appearance.  To the extent the remaining 7 States have been denying appointed counsel at that time, they are a distinct minority.  Pp.1012. 


(c)Neither the Fifth Circuit nor the County offers an acceptable justification for the minority practice.  Pp.1219. 


(1)The Fifth Circuit found the determining factor to be that no prosecutor was aware of Rothgerys article 15.17 hearing or involved in it.  This prosecutorial awareness standard is wrong.  Neither Brewer nor Jackson said a word about the prosecutors involvement as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one.  Those cases left no room for the factual enquiry the Circuit would require, and with good reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment of a prosecutors first involvement would be wholly unworkable and impossible to administer, Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 496.  The Fifth Circuit derived its rule from the statement, in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U. S. 682, 689, that the right to counsel attaches when the government has committed itself to prosecute.  But what counts as such a commitment is an issue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power among state officials under state law, cf. Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 429, n.3, and under the federal standard, an accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the governments commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accuseds liberty, see, e.g., Kirby, supra, at 689.  Pp.1215. 


(2)The County relies on United States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, in arguing that in considering the initial appearances significance, this Court must ignore prejudice to a defendants pretrial liberty, it being the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment.  But the Countys suggestion that Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance was refuted by Jackson, 475 U. S., at 629, n.3.  And since the Court is not asked to extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in Gouveia), but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prosecutor is involved, Gouveia does not speak to the question at issue.  Pp.1517. 


(3)The Countys third tack gets it no further.  Stipulating that the properly formulated test is whether the State has objectively committed itself to prosecute, the County says that prosecutorial involvement is but one form of evidence of such commitment and that others include (1) the filing of formal charges or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file such charges, and (2) a court appearance following arrest on an indictment.  Either version runs up against Brewer and Jackson:an initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutors participation, indictment, information, or what the County calls a formal complaint.  The Countys assertions that Brewer and Jackson are vague and thus of limited, if any, precedential value are wrong.  Although the Court in those cases saw no need for lengthy disquisitions on the initial appearances significance, that was because it found the attachment issue an easy one.  See, e.g., Brewer, supra, at 399.  Pp.1719.
491 F.3d 293,  vacated and remanded.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 07552.Argued April 21, 2008Decided June 23, 2008
A payphone customer making a long-distance call with an access code or 1800 number issued by a long-distance carrier pays the carrier (which completes the call).  The carrier then compensates the payphone operator (which connects the call to the carrier in the first place).  The payphone operator can sue the long-distance carrier for any compensation that the carrier fails to pay for these dial-around calls.  Many payphone operators assign their dial-around claims to billing and collection firms (aggregators) so that, in effect, these aggregators can bring suit on their behalf.  A group of aggregators (respondents here) were assigned legal title to the claims of approximately 1,400 payphone operators.  The aggregators separately agreed to remit all proceeds to those operators, who would then pay the aggregators for their services.  After entering into these agreements, the aggregators filed federal-court lawsuits seeking compensation from petitioner long-distance carriers.  The District Court refused to dismiss the claims, finding that the aggregators had standing, and the D.C. Circuit ultimately affirmed.
Held:An assignee of a legal claim for money owed has standing to pursue that claim in federal court, even when the assignee has promised to remit the proceeds of the litigation to the assignor.  Pp.323.
(a)History and precedent show that, for centuries, courts have found ways to allow assignees to bring suit; where assignment is at issue, courtsboth before and after the foundinghave always permitted the party with legal title alone to bring suit; and there is a strong tradition specifically of suits by assignees for collection.  And while precedents of this Court, Waite v. Santa Cruz, 184 U. S. 302, Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 253 U. S. 117, and Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, do not conclusively resolve the standing question here, they offer powerful support for the proposition that suits by assignees for collection have long been seen as amenable to resolution by the judicial process, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 102.  Pp.316.


(b)Petitioners offer no convincing reason to depart from the historical tradition of suits by assignees, including assignees for collection.  In any event, the aggregators satisfy the Article III standing requirements articulated in this Courts more modern decisions.  Petitioners argue that the aggregators have not themselves suffered an injury and that assignments for collection do not transfer the payphone operators injuries.  But the operators assigned their claims lock, stock, and barrel, and precedent makes clear that an assignee can sue based on his assignors injuries.  Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765.  In arguing that the aggregators cannot satisfy the redressability requirement because they will remit their recovery to the payphone operators, petitioners misconstrue the nature of the redressability inquiry, which focuses on whether the injury that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigationnot on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money recovered.  See, e.g., id., at 771.  Petitioners claim that the assignments constitute nothing more than a contract for legal services is overstated.  There is an important distinction between simply hiring a lawyer and assigning a claim to a lawyer.  The latter confers a property right (which creditors might attach); the former does not.  Finally, as a practical matter, it would be particularly unwise to abandon history and precedent in resolving the question here, for any such ruling could be overcome by, e.g., rewriting the agreement to give the aggregator a tiny portion of the assigned claim itself, perhaps only a dollar or two.  Pp.1620


(c)Petitioners reasons for denying prudential standingthat the aggregators are seeking redress for third parties; that the litigation represents an effort by the aggregators and payphone operators to circumvent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23s class-action requirements; and that practical problems could arise because the aggregators are suing, e.g., payphone operators may not comply with discovery requests or honor judgmentsare unpersuasive.  And because there are no allegations that the assignments were made in bad faith and because the assignments were made for ordinary business purposes, any other prudential questions need not be considered here.  Pp.2023.
489 F.3d 1249, affirmed.

And while precedents of this Court, Waite v. Santa Cruz, 184 U. S. 302, Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 253 U. S. 117, and Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, do not conclusively resolve the standing question here, they offer powerful support for the proposition that suits by assignees for collection have long been seen as amenable to resolution by the judicial process, Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 102.  Pp.316.


(b)Petitioners offer no convincing reason to depart from the historical tradition of suits by assignees, including assignees for collection.  In any event, the aggregators satisfy the Article III standing requirements articulated in this Courts more modern decisions.  Petitioners argue that the aggregators have not themselves suffered an injury and that assignments for collection do not transfer the payphone operators injuries.  But the operators assigned their claims lock, stock, and barrel, and precedent makes clear that an assignee can sue based on his assignors injuries.  Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765.  In arguing that the aggregators cannot satisfy the redressability requirement because they will remit their recovery to the payphone operators, petitioners misconstrue the nature of the redressability inquiry, which focuses on whether the injury that a plaintiff alleges is likely to be redressed through the litigationnot on what the plaintiff ultimately intends to do with the money recovered.  See, e.g., id., at 771.  Petitioners claim that the assignments constitute nothing more than a contract for legal services is overstated.  There is an important distinction between simply hiring a lawyer and assigning a claim to a lawyer.  The latter confers a property right (which creditors might attach); the former does not.  Finally, as a practical matter, it would be particularly unwise to abandon history and precedent in resolving the question here, for any such ruling could be overcome by, e.g., rewriting the agreement to give the aggregator a tiny portion of the assigned claim itself, perhaps only a dollar or two.  Pp.1620


(c)Petitioners reasons for denying prudential standingthat the aggregators are seeking redress for third parties; that the litigation represents an effort by the aggregators and payphone operators to circumvent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23s class-action requirements; and that practical problems could arise because the aggregators are suing, e.g., payphone operators may not comply with discovery requests or honor judgmentsare unpersuasive.  And because there are no allegations that the assignments were made in bad faith and because the assignments were made for ordinary business purposes, any other prudential questions need not be considered here.  Pp.2023.

07-818|"ARMANDO NUNEZ v. UNITED STATES
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 07818.Decided June 23, 2008
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.  The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed May 12, 2008.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.
Petitioner pleaded guilty to federal narcotics offenses and waived appellate and collateral-review rights.  Despite that waiver, he demanded (the Court of Appeals assumed) that his attorney file a notice of appeal; his attorney refused.  Petitioner sought habeas relief, claiming that this failure was ineffective assistance of counsel.  See 495 F.3d 544, 545 (CA7 2007).  The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that petitioner had waived his right to raise even the ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review.  See id., at 546, 548549.  Petitioner has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking us to consider the ineffective-assistance claim.  The Government argues in response that the question is not presented because the Court of Appeals opinion rests on petitioners collateral-review waiver.  I agree with that response, and so would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.


Yet the Government urges us to GVRto grant the petition, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appealsbecause it believes that the Court of Appeals misconstrued the scope of petitioners collateral-review waiver.  A majority of the Court agrees to that course.  I do not.  In my view we have no power to set aside (vacate) another courts judgment unless we find it to be in error.  See Mariscal v. United States, 449 U. S. 405, 407 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  Even so, I have reluctantly acquiesced in our dubious yet well-entrenched habit of entering a GVR order without an independent examination of the merits when the Government, as respondent, confesses error in the judgment below.  See Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 182183 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But because we have no power to vacate a judgment that has not been shown to be (or been conceded to be) in error, Price v. United States, 537 U. S. 1152, 1153 (2003), I continue to resist GVR disposition when the Government, without conceding that a judgment is in error, merely suggests that the lower courts basis for the judgment is wrong, see Lawrence, supra, at 183, and n.3; cf. Alvarado v. United States, 497 U. S. 543, 545 (1990) (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).  That describes this case.  The Governments brief is entirely agnostic on the correctness of the Court of Appeals judgmenti.e., its affirmance of the District Courts denial of habeas relief.  Presumably, the Government believes the judgment is correct; it asked the Court of Appeals to affirm the District Courts judgment the first time around, and presumably will do the same on remand.


To make matters worse, the Governments suggestion that the Court of Appeals erred in construing the scope of petitioners waiver is not even convincing.  The collateral-review waiver in petitioners plea agreement is inartfully worded; it is perhaps susceptible of the Governments reading, but in my view the Court of Appeals reading is better.  In any event, during his plea colloquy petitioner orally agreed to a collateral-review waiver precisely in line with the Court of Appeals position.  Compare Brief for United States 34 (plea colloquy), with id., at 1617 (plea agreement).  It is bad enough to upend the judgment of a lower court because the Solicitor General, while not saying the judgment was wrong, opines that the expressed basis for it was wrong; it is absurd to do this when the Solicitor Generals gratuitous opinion is dubious on its face.


Finally, we should be especially reluctant to GVR on the Solicitor Generals say-so when, if that say-so is correct, the likely consequence will be to create a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  Before resting its judgment on petitioners collateral-review waiver, the Court of Appeals expressed its unfavorable view of petitioners ineffective-assistance claim, recognizing, however, that its view contradicted the view of at least six other Courts of Appeals.  See 495 F.3d, at 546548.  If, on remand, the Court of Appeals agrees with the Solicitor General that petitioners collateral-review waiver does not preclude his claim, the court in all likelihood will enter the same judgment by rejecting petitioners ineffective-assistance claim, thereby creating (absent reversal en banc) a split with those other courts.  I had thought that the main purpose of our certiorari jurisdiction was to eliminate circuit splits, not to create them.


For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Courts order.

The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed May 12, 2008.


Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.
Petitioner pleaded guilty to distributing crack cocaine.  He waived all appellate issues that might have been available if he had exercised his right to trial but reserved the right to appeal the validity of his guilty plea.  See No: 06C1304, Memorandum Opinion and Order (ED Ill., May 2, 2006), App. B to Pet. for Cert. 3.  Petitioner nonetheless (allegedly) asked his attorney to file a notice of appeal to argue that the substance he distributed was not crack cocaine.  His attorney filed nothing.  On collateral review, petitioner claimed that his attorneys failure was ineffective assistance of counsel.  The District Court denied the claim, finding that any appeal his attorney might have pursued was doomed because he waived his right to appeal and because petitioner had expressly identified the substance as crack cocaine in his guilty plea.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals asked the parties to address the effect of its decision in Nunez v. United States, 495 F.3d 544 (CA7 2007), which held that Nunezs plea agreement waived his right to bring an identical ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review.  The Government argued that petitioners case was materially indistinguishable from Nunez.  The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the District Courts judgment.


Petitioner asks us to consider his ineffective-assistance claim.  That claim does not warrant our review, so I would deny his petition for certiorari.  In the Brief for United States, the Solicitor General suggests that we GVRgrant the petition, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals.  He contends (contrary to the Governments position below) that petitioners waiver is less comprehensive than the waiver in Nunez.  And since he thinks that the Court of Appeals reading of the waiver in Nunez was wrong (he has asked us to GVR in Nunezs case for that very reason), the Solicitor General concludes that, inasmuch as the Court of Appeals might have agreed with the Governments (now repudiated) position below, the reasoning behind the judgment below may be wrong.  The Solicitor General does not challenge the judgment below, nor does he take a position on petitioners ineffective-assistance claim, insofar as that may have been the basis for the Court of Appeals summary order.


As I state in my dissent in Nunez v. United States, ante, at ___, the Solicitor Generals confession of error in the Court of Appeals reasoning, but not its judgment, does not justify entry of a GVR order.  That disposition is especially inappropriate in this case because we cannot even be sure that the Court of Appeals summary order was premised on the alleged error.  See Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 184186 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  For all we know, the Court of Appeals identified a difference in the plea agreements and therefore summarily affirmed because it agreed with the District Courts reasoning on the merits of petitioners ineffective-assistance claim.


I respectfully dissent.

06-1037|"KENTUCKY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS etal. v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 061037.Argued January 9, 2008Decided June 19, 2008
Kentucky permits hazardous position workers, e.g., policemen, to receive normal retirement benefits after working either 20 years or 5 years and attaining age 55 and pays disability retirement benefits to workers meeting specified requirements.  Kentuckys Plan calculates normal retirement benefits based on actual years of service.  The Plan calculates disability benefits by adding to an employees actual years of service the number of years that the employee would have had to continue working in order to become eligible for normal retirement benefits, adding no more than the number of years the employee had previously worked.  Charles Lickteig, who continued working after becoming eligible for retirement at age 55, became disabled and retired at age 61.  He filed an age discrimination complaint with respondent (EEOC) after the Plan based his pension on his actual years of service without imputing any additional years.  The EEOC filed suit against Kentucky and others (collectively Kentucky), arguing that the Plan failed to impute years solely because Lickteig became disabled after age 55.  The District Court granted Kentucky summary judgment, holding that the EEOC could not establish age discrimination, but the Sixth Circuit ultimately reversed on the ground that the Plan violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).  
Held:Kentuckys system does not discriminate against workers who become disabled after becoming eligible for retirement based on age.  Pp.414.
(a)The ADEA forbids an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individuals age.  29 U. S.C. 623(a)(1) (emphasis added).  A plaintiff claiming age-related disparate treatment (i.e., intentional discrimination) must prove that age actually motivated the employers decision.  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (emphasis added).  In Hazen Paper, the Court found that, without evidence of intent, a dismissal based on pension status was not a dismissal because  of age, id., at 611612, noting that, though pension status depended upon years of service, and years of service typically go hand in hand with age, the two concepts are analytically distinct, id., at 611.  And the dismissal at issue there, if based purely on pension status, would not embody the evils prompting the ADEA: It was not based on a prohibited stereotype of older workers, did not produce any attendant stigma to those workers, and was not the result of an inaccurate and denigrating generalization about age.  Id., at 612.  However, the Court noted that discrimination based on pension status could violate the ADEA if pension status was a proxy for age.  Id., at 613.  Pp.46.


(b)Applying Hazen Paper, the circumstances here, taken together, show that the differences in treatment in this particular instance were not actually motivated by age.  (1) Age and pension status remain analytically distinct concepts.  (2) Here, several background circumstances eliminate the possibility that pension status serves as a proxy for age.  Rather than an individual employment decision, at issue here are complex systemwide rules involving not wages, but pensionsa benefit the ADEA treats somewhat more flexibly and leniently in respect to age.  Further, Congress has otherwise approved programs, such as Social Security Disability Insurance, that calculate disability benefits using a formula that expressly takes account of age.  (3) The disparity here has a clear non-age-related rationale.  The Plans disability rules track Kentuckys normal retirement rules by imputing only those additional years of service needed to bring the disabled workers total to 20 or to the number of years that the individual would have worked had he worked to age 55.  Thus, the disability rules purpose is to treat a disabled worker as though he had become disabled after, rather than before, he had become eligible for normal retirement benefits.  Age factors into the disability calculation only because the normal retirement rules themselves permissibly consider age.  The Plan simply seeks to treat disabled employees as if they had worked until the point at which they would be eligible for a normal pension.  Thus, the disparity turns upon pension eligibility and nothing more.  (4) Although the Plan placed an older worker at a disadvantage here, in other cases, the rules can work to the advantage of older workers, who may get a bigger boost of imputed years than younger workers.  (5) Kentuckys system does not rely on the sorts of stereotypical assumptions, e.g., the work capacity of older workers relative to younger workers, that the ADEA sought to eradicate.  The Plans assumptions that no disabled worker would have continued to work beyond the point at which he was both disabled and pension eligible do not involve age-related stereotypes, but apply equally to all workers regardless of age.  (6) The nature of the Plans eligibility requirements means that, unless Kentucky were severely to cut the benefits to disabled workers who are not yet pension eligible, it would have to increase the benefits available to disabled, pension-eligible workers, while lacking any clear criteria for determining how many extra years to impute for those already 55 or older.  The difficulty of finding a remedy that can both correct the disparity and achieve the Plans legitimate objectiveproviding each disabled worker with a sufficient retirement benefitfurther suggests that this objective, not age, actually motivated the Plan.


The Courts opinion in no way unsettles the rule that a statute or policy that facially discriminates based on age suffices to show disparate treatment under the ADEA.  The Court is dealing with the quite special case of differential treatment based on pension status, where pension statuswith the explicit blessing of the ADEAitself turns, in part, on age.  Further, the rule for dealing with this sort of case is clear:Where an employer adopts a pension plan that includes age as a factor, and that employer then treats employees differently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a claim under the ADEA, must adduce sufficient evidence to show that the differential treatment was actually motivated by age, not pension status.  Pp.611.


(c)The Federal Governments additional arguments are rejected.  Since Hazen Paper provides the relevant precedent here, an ADEA amendment made in light of Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158, is beside the point.  And a contrary interpretation contained in an EEOC regulation and its compliance manual does not lead to a different conclusion.  Pp.1113.

Further, the rule for dealing with this sort of case is clear:Where an employer adopts a pension plan that includes age as a factor, and that employer then treats employees differently based on pension status, a plaintiff, to state a claim under the ADEA, must adduce sufficient evidence to show that the differential treatment was actually motivated by age, not pension status.  Pp.611.


(c)The Federal Governments additional arguments are rejected.  Since Hazen Paper provides the relevant precedent here, an ADEA amendment made in light of Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S. 158, is beside the point.  And a contrary interpretation contained in an EEOC regulation and its compliance manual does not lead to a different conclusion.  Pp.1113.

06-1505|"MEACHAM etal. v. KNOLLS ATOMIC POWER LABORATORY, aka KAPL, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 061505.Argued April 23, 2008Decided June 19, 2008
When the National Government ordered its contractor, respondent Knolls, to reduce its work force, Knolls had its managers score their subordinates on performance, flexibility, and critical skills; these scores, along with points for years of service, were used to determine who was laid off.  Of the 31 employees let go, 30 were at least 40 years old.  Petitioners (Meacham, for short) were among those laid off, and they filed this suit asserting, inter alia, a disparate-impact claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.C. 621 et seq.  To show such an impact, Meacham relied on a statistical experts testimony that results so skewed according to age could rarely occur by chance; and that the scores for flexibility and criticality, over which managers had the most discretionary judgment, had the firmest statistical ties to the outcomes.  The jury found for Meacham on the disparate-impact claim, and the Second Circuit initially affirmed.  This Court vacated the judgment and remanded in light of its intervening decision in Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228.  The Second Circuit then held for Knolls, finding its prior ruling untenable because it had applied a business necessity standard rather than a reasonableness test in assessing the employers reliance on factors other than age in the layoff decisions, and because Meacham had not carried the burden of persuasion as to the reasonableness of Knollss non-age factors.
Held:An employer defending a disparate-impact claim under the ADEA bears both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion for the reasonable factors other than age (RFOA) affirmative defense under 623(f)(1).  Pp.517.
(a)The ADEAs text and structure indicate that the RFOA exemption creates an affirmative defense, for which the burden of persuasion falls on the employer.  The RFOA exemption is listed alongside one for bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ), which the Court has recognized to be an affirmative defense: It shall not be unlawful for an employer  to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsections (a), (b), (c), or (e)  where age is a [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business, or where the differentiation is based on [RFOA]  .  623(f)(1).  Given that the statute lays out its exemptions in a provision separate from the general prohibitions in 623(a)(c), (e), and expressly refers to the prohibited conduct as such, it is no surprise that this Court has spoken of both the BFOQ and RFOA as being among the ADEAs five affirmative defenses, Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 122.  This reading follows the familiar principle that [w]hen a proviso  carves an exception out of the body of a statute or contract those who set up such exception must prove it, Javierre v. Central Altagracia, 217 U. S. 502, 508.  As this longstanding convention is part of the backdrop against which the Congress writes laws, the Court respects it unless there is compelling reason to think that Congress put the burden of persuasion on the other side.  See Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 5758.  The Court has given this principle particular weight in enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1968, Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188, 196197; and it has also recognized that the ADEA [is] enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures of the FLSA, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580.  Nothing in 623(f)(1) suggests that Congress meant it to march out of step with either the general or specifically FLSA default rules placing the burden of proving an exemption on the party claiming it.  Any further doubt would be dispelled by the natural implication of the otherwise prohibited language prefacing the BFOQ and RFOA defenses.  Pp.59. 


(b)Knolls argues that because the RFOA clause bars liability where action is taken for reasons other than age, it should be read as mere elaboration on an element of liability.  But City of Jackson confirmed that 623(a)(2)s prohibition extends to practices with a disparate impact, inferring this result in part from the presence of the RFOA provision.  544 U. S., at 239, 243.  And City of Jackson made it clear that action based on a factor other than age is the very premise for disparate-impact liability, not a negation of it or a defense to it.  Thus, it is assumed that a non-age factor was at work in such a case, and the focus of the RFOA defense is on whether the factor relied on was reasonable.  Pp.1011. 


(c)The business necessity test has no place in ADEA disparate-impact cases; applying both that test and the RFOA defense would entail a wasteful and confusing structure of proof.  The absence of a business necessity enquiry does not diminish, however, the reasons already given for reading the RFOA as an affirmative defense.  City of Jackson cannot be read as implying that the burden of proving any business-related defense falls on the plaintiff, for it confirmed that the BFOQ is an affirmative defense, see 544 U. S., at 233, n.3.  Moreover, in referring to Wards Coves interpretation of identical language [in Title VII], City of Jackson could not have had the RFOA clause in mind, for Title VII has no like-worded defense.  And as Wards Cove did not purport to construe any Title VII defenses, only an over-reading of City of Jackson would find in it an assumption that Wards Cove has anything to say about statutory defenses in the ADEA.  Pp.1215. 


(d)City of Jackson confirmed that an ADEA disparate-impact plaintiff must isolat[e] and identif[y] the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities.  544 U. S., at 241.  This is not a trivial burden, and it ought to allay some of the concern that recognizing an employers burden of persuasion on an RFOA defense will encourage strike suits or nudge plaintiffs with marginal cases into court; but in the end, such concerns have to be directed at Congress, which set the balance by both creating the RFOA exemption and writing it in the orthodox format of an affirmative defense.  Pp.1517.

06-923|"METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE CO. etal. v. GLENN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 06923.Argued April 23, 2008Decided June 19, 2008
Petitioner Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) is an administrator and the insurer of Sears, Roebuck & Companys long-term disability insurance plan, which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The plan gives MetLife (as administrator) discretionary authority to determine the validity of an employees benefits claim and provides that MetLife (as insurer) will pay the claims.  Respondent Wanda Glenn, a Sears employee, was granted an initial 24 months of benefits under the plan following a diagnosis of a heart disorder.  MetLife encouraged her to apply for, and she began receiving, Social Security disability benefits based on an agency determination that she could do no work.  But when MetLife itself had to determine whether she could work, in order to establish eligibility for extended plan benefits, it found her capable of doing sedentary work and denied her the benefits.  Glenn sought federal-court review under ERISA, see 29 U. S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B), but the District Court denied relief.  In reversing, the Sixth Circuit used a deferential standard of review and considered it a conflict of interest that MetLife both determined an employees eligibility for benefits and paid the benefits out of its own pocket.  Based on a combination of this conflict and other circumstances, it set aside MetLifes benefits denial. 
Held: 
1.Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, sets out four principles as to the appropriate standard of judicial review under 1132(a)(1)(B): (1) A court should be guided by principles of trust law, analogizing a plan administrator to a trustee and considering a benefit determination a fiduciary act, id., at 111113; (2) trust law principles require de novo review unless a benefits plan provides otherwise, id., at 115; (3) where the plan so provides, by granting the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility, a deferential standard of review [is] appropriate, id., at 111, 115; and (4) if the administrator or fiduciary having discretion is operating under a conflict of interest, that conflict must be weighed as a facto[r] in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion, id., at 115.  Pp.35.


2.A plan administrators dual role of both evaluating and paying benefits claims creates the kind of conflict of interest referred to in Firestone.  That conclusion is clear where it is the employer itself that both funds the plan and evaluates the claim, but a conflict also exists where, as here, the plan administrator is an insurance company.  For one thing, the employers own conflict may extend to its selection of an insurance company to administer its plan.  For another, ERISA imposes higher-than-marketplace quality standards on insurers, requiring a plan administrator to discharge [its] duties in respect to discretionary claims processing solely in the interests of the [plans] participants and beneficiaries, 29 U. S.C. 1104(a)(1); underscoring the particular importance of accurate claims processing by insisting that administrators provide a full and fair review of claim denials, Firestone, supra, at 113; and supplementing marketplace and regulatory controls with judicial review of individual claim denials, see 1132(a)(1)(B).  Finally, a legal rule that treats insurers and employers alike in respect to the existence of a conflict can nonetheless take account of different circumstances by treating the circumstances as diminishing the conflicts significance or severity in individual cases.  Pp.58.


3.The significance of the conflict of interest factor will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.  Firestones weighed as a factor language, 489 U. S., at 115, does not imply a change in the standard of review, say, from deferential to de novo.  Nor should this Court overturn Firestone by adopting a rule that could bring about near universal de novo review of most ERISA plan claims denials.  And it is not necessary or desirable for courts to create special burden-of-proof rules, or other special procedural or evidentiary rules, focused narrowly upon the evaluator/payor conflict.  Firestone means what the word factor implies, namely, that judges reviewing a benefit denials lawfulness may take account of several different considerations, conflict of interest being one.  This kind of review is no stranger to the judicial system.  Both trust law and administrative law ask judges to determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.  Any one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the others are closely balanced.  Here, the Sixth Circuit gave the conflict some weight, but focused more heavily on other factors: that MetLife had encouraged Glenn to argue to the Social Security Administration that she could do no work, received the bulk of the benefits of her success in doing so (being entitled to receive an offset from her retroactive Social Security award), and then ignored the agencys finding in concluding that she could do sedentary work; and that MetLife had emphasized one medical report favoring denial of benefits, had deemphasized other reports suggesting a contrary conclusion, and had failed to provide its independent vocational and medical experts with all of the relevant evidence.  These serious concerns, taken together with some degree of conflicting interests on MetLifes part, led the court to set aside MetLifes discretionary decision.  There is nothing improper in the way this review was conducted.  Finally, the Firestone standards elucidation does not consist of detailed instructions, because there are no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment.  Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 489.  Pp.813.
461 F.3d 660, affirmed.

06-939|"CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA etal. v. BROWN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06939.Argued March 19, 2008Decided June 19, 2008
Organizations whose members do business with California sued to enjoin enforcement of Assembly Bill 1889 (AB 1889), which, among other things, prohibits employers that receive state grants or more than $10,000 in state program funds per year from using the funds to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.  Cal. Govt. Code Ann. 16645.2(a), 16645.7(a).  The District Court granted the plaintiffs partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) pre-empts 16645.2 and 16645.7 because they regulate employer speech about union organizing under circumstances in which Congress intended free debate.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds.  
Held:Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted by the NLRA.  Pp.416.
(a)The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision, but this Court has held pre-emption necessary to implement federal labor policy where, inter alia, Congress intended particular conduct to be unregulated because left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces. Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commn, 427 U. S. 132, 140.  Pp.45.


(b)Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted under Machinists because they regulate within a zone protected and reserved for market freedom.  Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227.  In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act amended the NLRA by, among other things, adding 8(c), which protects from National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regulation noncoercive speech by both unions and employers about labor organizing.  The section both responded to prior NLRB rulings that employers attempts to persuade employees not to organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice by the previous version of 8 and manifested a congressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.  Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62.  Congress express protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case.  Californias policy judgment that partisan employer speech necessarily interferes with an employees choice about union representation is the same policy judgment that Congress renounced when it amended the NLRA to preclude regulation of noncoercive speech as an unfair labor practice.  To the extent 16645.2 and 16645.7 actually further AB 1889s express goal, they are unequivocally pre-empted.  Pp.58.


(c)The Ninth Circuits reasons for concluding that Machinists did not pre-empt 16645.2 and 16645.7(1) that AB 1889s spending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds, not to their receipt; (2) that Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all regulation, in that the NLRB still regulates employer speech on the eve of union elections; and (3) that California modeled AB 1889 on federal statutes, e.g., the Workforce Investment Actare not persuasive.

Organizations whose members do business with California sued to enjoin enforcement of Assembly Bill 1889 (AB 1889), which, among other things, prohibits employers that receive state grants or more than $10,000 in state program funds per year from using the funds to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.  Cal. Govt. Code Ann. 16645.2(a), 16645.7(a).  The District Court granted the plaintiffs partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) pre-empts 16645.2 and 16645.7 because they regulate employer speech about union organizing under circumstances in which Congress intended free debate.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Congress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds.  
Held:Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted by the NLRA.  Pp.416.
(a)The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision, but this Court has held pre-emption necessary to implement federal labor policy where, inter alia, Congress intended particular conduct to be unregulated because left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces. Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commn, 427 U. S. 132, 140.  Pp.45.


(b)Sections 16645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted under Machinists because they regulate within a zone protected and reserved for market freedom.  Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227.  In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act amended the NLRA by, among other things, adding 8(c), which protects from National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regulation noncoercive speech by both unions and employers about labor organizing.  The section both responded to prior NLRB rulings that employers attempts to persuade employees not to organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice by the previous version of 8 and manifested a congressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.  Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 62.  Congress express protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case.  Californias policy judgment that partisan employer speech necessarily interferes with an employees choice about union representation is the same policy judgment that Congress renounced when it amended the NLRA to preclude regulation of noncoercive speech as an unfair labor practice.  To the extent 16645.2 and 16645.7 actually further AB 1889s express goal, they are unequivocally pre-empted.  Pp.58.


(c)The Ninth Circuits reasons for concluding that Machinists did not pre-empt 16645.2 and 16645.7(1) that AB 1889s spending restrictions apply only to the use of state funds, not to their receipt; (2) that Congress did not leave the zone of activity free from all regulation, in that the NLRB still regulates employer speech on the eve of union elections; and (3) that California modeled AB 1889 on federal statutes, e.g., the Workforce Investment Actare not persuasive.  Pp.816.

07-208|"INDIANA v. EDWARDS
certiorari to the supreme court of indiana
No. 07208.Argued March 26, 2008Decided June 19, 2008
After Indiana charged respondent Edwards with attempted murder and other crimes for a shooting during his attempt to steal a pair of shoes, his mental condition became the subject of three competency proceedings and two self-representation requests, mostly before the same trial judge.  Referring to the lengthy record of psychiatric reports, the trial court noted that Edwards suffered from schizophrenia and concluded that, although it appeared he was competent to stand trial, he was not competent to defend himself at trial.  The court therefore denied Edwards self-representation request.  He was represented by appointed counsel at trial and convicted on two counts.  Indianas intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, agreeing with Edwards that the trial courts refusal to permit him to represent himself deprived him of his constitutional right of self-representation under the Sixth Amendment and Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806.  Although finding that the record provided substantial support for the trial courts ruling, the Indiana Supreme Court nonetheless affirmed the intermediate appellate court on the ground that Faretta and Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, required the State to allow Edwards to represent himself.  
Held:The Constitution does not forbid States from insisting upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.  Pp.413.
(a)This Courts precedents frame the question presented, but they do not answer it.  Dusky v. United States, 362 U. S. 402, and Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171, set forth the Constitutions mental competence standard forbidding the trial of an individual lacking a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.  But those cases did not consider the issue presented here, namely, the relation of that mental competence standard to the self-representation right.  Similarly the Courts foundational self-representation case, Faretta, suprawhich held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments include a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when a criminal defendant voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so, 422 U. S., at 807does not answer the question as to the scope of the self-representation right.  Finally, although Godinez, supra, presents a question closer to the one at issue in that it focused upon a borderline-competent defendant who had asked a state trial court to permit him to represent himself and to change his pleas from not guilty to guilty, Godinez provides no answer here because that defendants ability to conduct a defense at trial was expressly not at issue in that case, see 509 U. S., at 399400, and because the cases constitutional holding that a State may permit a gray-area defendant to represent himself does not tell a State whether it may deny such a defendant the right to represent himself at his trial.  Pp.48. 


(b)Several considerations taken together lead the Court to conclude that the Constitution permits a State to limit a defendants self-representation right by insisting upon trial counsel when the defendant lacks the mental competency to conduct his trial defense unless represented.  First, the Courts precedent, while not answering the question, points slightly in that direction.  By setting forth a standard that focuses directly upon a defendants ability to consult with his lawyer, Dusky and Drope assume representation by counsel and emphasize counsels importance, thus suggesting (though not holding) that choosing to forgo trial counsel presents a very different set of circumstances than the mental competency determination for a defendant to stand trial.  Also, Faretta rested its self-representation conclusion in part on pre-existing state cases that are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right.  See 422 U. S., at 813, and n.9.  Second, the nature of mental illnesswhich is not a unitary concept, but varies in degree, can vary over time, and interferes with an individuals functioning at different times in different wayscautions against using a single competency standard to decide both whether a defendant who is represented can proceed to trial and whether a defendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself.  Third, a self-representation right at trial will not affirm the dignity of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel, see McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168, 176177, and may undercut the most basic of the Constitutions criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.  The trial judgeparticularly one such as the judge in this case, who presided over one of Edwards competency hearings and his two trialswill often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the particular defendants individualized circumstances.  Pp.812. 


(c)Indianas proposed standard, which would deny a criminal defendant the right to represent himself at trial if he cannot communicate coherently with the court or a jury, is rejected because this Court is uncertain as to how that standard would work in practice.   The Court also declines Indianas request to overrule Faretta because todays opinion may well remedy the unfair trial concerns previously leveled against the case.  Pp.1213.

06-1181|"DADA v. MUKASEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 061181.Argued January 7, 2008Decided June 16, 2008
Petitioner, a native and citizen of Nigeria, alleges that he married an American citizen in 1999.  His wife filed an I130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf that was denied in 2003.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged Dada with being removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act for overstaying his temporary nonimmigrant visa.  The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the request for a continuance pending adjudication of a second I130 petition, found Dada eligible for removal, and granted his request for voluntary departure under 8 U. S.C. 1229c(b).  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed and ordered Dada to depart within 30 days or suffer statutory penalties.  Two days before the end of the 30-day period, Dada sought to withdraw his voluntary departure request and filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings under 8 U. S.C. 1229a(c)(7), contending that new and material evidence demonstrated a bona fide marriage and that his case should be continued until resolution of the second I130 petition.  After the voluntary departure period had expired, the BIA denied the request, reasoning that an alien who has been granted voluntary departure but does not depart in a timely fashion is statutorily barred from receiving adjustment of status.  It did not consider Dadas request to withdraw his voluntary departure request.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed. 
Held:An alien must be permitted an opportunity to withdraw a motion for voluntary departure, provided the request is made before expiration of the departure period.  Pp.520.
(a)Resolution of this case turns on the interaction of two aspects of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996the aliens right to file a motion to reopen in removal proceedings and the rules governing voluntary departure.  Pp.512.


(1)Voluntary departure is discretionary relief that allows certain favored aliens to leave the country willingly.  It benefits the Government by, e.g., expediting the departure process and avoiding deportation expenses, and benefits the alien by, e.g., facilitating readmission.  To receive these benefits, the alien must depart timely.  As relevant here, when voluntary departure is requested at the conclusion of removal proceedings, the departure period may not exceed 60 days.  8 U. S.C. 1229c(b)(2).  Pp.59.


(2)An alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen, 1229a(c)(7)(A), asking the BIA to change its decision because of newly discovered evidence or changed circumstances.  The motion generally must be filed within 90 days of a final administrative removal order, 1229a(c)(7)(C)(1).  Although neither the text of 1229c or 1229a(c)(7) nor the applicable legislative history indicates whether Congress intended for an alien granted voluntary departure to be permitted to pursue a motion to reopen, the statutory text plainly guarantees to each alien the right to file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section, 1229a(c)(7)(A).  Pp.912.


(b)Section 1229c(b)(2) unambiguously states that the voluntary departure period shall not be valid for more than 60 days, but says nothing about the motion to reopen; and nothing in the statutes or past usage indicates that voluntary departure or motions to reopen cannot coexist.  In reading a statute, the Court must not look merely to a particular clause, but consider in connection with it the whole statute.  Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U. S. 642, 650.  Reading the Act as a whole, and considering the statutory scheme governing voluntary departure alongside 1229a(c)(7)(A)s right to pursue one motion to reopen, the Governments position that an alien who has agreed to voluntarily depart is not entitled to pursue a motion to reopen is unsustainable.  It would render the statutory reopening right a nullity in most voluntary departure cases since it is foreseeable, and quite likely, that the voluntary departure time will expire long before the BIA decides a timely-filed motion to reopen.  Absent tolling or some other remedial action by this Court, then, the alien who is granted voluntary departure but whose circumstances have changed in a manner cognizable by a motion to reopen is between Scylla and Charybdis: The alien either may leave the United States in accordance with the voluntary departure order, with the effect that the motion to reopen is deemed withdrawn, or may stay in the United States to pursue the cases reopening, risking expiration of the departure period and ineligibility for adjustment of status, the underlying relief sought.  Because a motion to reopen is meant to ensure a proper and lawful disposition, this Court is reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute is designed to make reopening unavailable for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law, when the statutes plain text reveals no such limitation.  Pp.1216.


(c)It is thus necessary to read the Act to preserve the aliens right to pursue reopening while respecting the Governments interest in the voluntary departure arrangements quid pro quo.  There is no statutory authority for petitioners proposal to automatically toll the voluntary departure period during the motion to reopens pendency.  Voluntary departure is an agreed-upon exchange of benefits, much like a settlement agreement.  An alien who is permitted to stay past the departure date to wait out the motion to reopens adjudication cannot then demand the full benefits of voluntary departure, for the Governments benefita prompt and costless departurewould be lost.  It would also invite abuse by aliens who wish to stay in the country but whose cases are unlikely to be reopened.  Absent a valid regulation otherwise, the appropriate way to reconcile the voluntary departure and motion to reopen provisions is to allow an alien to withdraw from the voluntary departure agreement.  The Department of Justice, which has authority to adopt the relevant regulations, has made a preliminary determination that the Act permits an alien to withdraw a voluntary departure application before expiration of the departure period.  Although not binding in the present case, this proposed interpretation warrants respectful consideration.  Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v. Blumer, 534 U. S. 473, 497.  To safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before the departure period expires, without regard to the motion to reopens underlying merits.  The alien has the option either to abide by the voluntary departures terms, and receive its agreed-upon benefits; or, alternatively, to forgo those benefits and remain in the country to pursue an administrative motion.  An alien selecting the latter option gives up the possibility of readmission and becomes subject to the IJs alternative order of removal.  The alien may be removed by the DHS within 90 days, even if the motion to reopen has yet to be adjudicated.  But the alien may request a stay of the removal order, and, though the BIA has discretion to deny a motion for a stay based on the merits of the motion to reopen, it may constitute an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny a motion for stay where the motion states nonfrivolous grounds for reopening.  Though this interpretation still confronts the alien with a hard choice, it avoids both the quixotic results of the Governments proposal and the elimination of benefits to the Government that would follow from petitioners tolling rule.

07-312|"FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY CAFETERIAS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 07312.Argued March 26, 2008Decided June 16, 2008
After respondent (Piccadilly) declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11, but before its plan was submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, that court authorized Piccadilly to sell its assets, approved its settlement agreement with creditors, and granted it an exemption under 11 U. S.C. 1146(a), which provides a tax-stamp exemption for any asset transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129.  After the sale, Piccadilly filed its Chapter 11 plan, but before the plan could be confirmed, petitioner Florida Department of Revenue (Florida) objected, arguing that the stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of the transferred assets fell outside 1146(a)s exemption because the transfer had not been under a confirmed plan.  The court granted Piccadilly summary judgment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that 1146(a)s exemption applies to preconfirmation transfers necessary to the consummation of a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, provided there is some nexus between such transfers and the plan; that 1146(a)s text was ambiguous and should be interpreted consistent with the principle that a remedial statute should be construed liberally; and that this interpretation better accounted for the practicalities of Chapter 11 cases because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse a proposed plans confirmation.
Held:Because 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed, Piccadilly may not rely on that provision to avoid Floridas stamp taxes.  The most natural reading of 1146(a)s text, the provisions placement within the Bankruptcy Code, and applicable canons of statutory construction lead to this conclusion.  Pp.419.
(a)Floridas reading of 1146(a) is the most natural.  Contending that the text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan, Florida argues that plan confirmed denotes a plan confirmed in the past, and that under should be read to mean with the authorization of or inferior or subordinate to its referent, here the confirmed plan, see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135.  Piccadilly counters that the provision does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement, contending that had Congress intended plan confirmed to mean confirmed plan, it would have used that language, and that under is as easily read to mean in accordance with.  While both sides present credible interpretations, Floridas is the better one.  Congress could have used more precise language and thus removed all ambiguity, but the two readings are not equally plausible.  Piccadillys interpretation places greater strain on the statutory text than Floridas simpler construction.  And Piccadillys emphasis on the distinction between plan confirmed and confirmed plan is unavailing because 1146(a) specifies not only that a transfer be under a plan, but also that the plan be confirmed pursuant to 1129.  Ultimately this Court need not decide whether 1146(a) is unambiguous on its face, for, based on the parties other arguments, any ambiguity must be resolved in Floridas favor.  Pp.47.

If statutory context suggests anything, it is that 1146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers.  The provisions placement in a subchapter entitled POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS undermines Piccadillys view that it extends to preconfirmation transfers.

			"|"FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE v. PICCADILLY CAFETERIAS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 07312.Argued March 26, 2008Decided June 16, 2008
After respondent (Piccadilly) declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11, but before its plan was submitted to the Bankruptcy Court, that court authorized Piccadilly to sell its assets, approved its settlement agreement with creditors, and granted it an exemption under 11 U. S.C. 1146(a), which provides a tax-stamp exemption for any asset transfer under a plan confirmed under section 1129.  After the sale, Piccadilly filed its Chapter 11 plan, but before the plan could be confirmed, petitioner Florida Department of Revenue (Florida) objected, arguing that the stamp taxes it had assessed on certain of the transferred assets fell outside 1146(a)s exemption because the transfer had not been under a confirmed plan.  The court granted Piccadilly summary judgment.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that 1146(a)s exemption applies to preconfirmation transfers necessary to the consummation of a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, provided there is some nexus between such transfers and the plan; that 1146(a)s text was ambiguous and should be interpreted consistent with the principle that a remedial statute should be construed liberally; and that this interpretation better accounted for the practicalities of Chapter 11 cases because a debtor may need to transfer assets to induce relevant parties to endorse a proposed plans confirmation.
Held:Because 1146(a) affords a stamp-tax exemption only to transfers made pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed, Piccadilly may not rely on that provision to avoid Floridas stamp taxes.  The most natural reading of 1146(a)s text, the provisions placement within the Bankruptcy Code, and applicable canons of statutory construction lead to this conclusion.  Pp.419.
(a)Floridas reading of 1146(a) is the most natural.  Contending that the text unambiguously limits stamp-tax exemptions to postconfirmation transfers made under the authority of a confirmed plan, Florida argues that plan confirmed denotes a plan confirmed in the past, and that under should be read to mean with the authorization of or inferior or subordinate to its referent, here the confirmed plan, see Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135.  Piccadilly counters that the provision does not unambiguously impose a temporal requirement, contending that had Congress intended plan confirmed to mean confirmed plan, it would have used that language, and that under is as easily read to mean in accordance with.  While both sides present credible interpretations, Floridas is the better one.  Congress could have used more precise language and thus removed all ambiguity, but the two readings are not equally plausible.  Piccadillys interpretation places greater strain on the statutory text than Floridas simpler construction.  And Piccadillys emphasis on the distinction between plan confirmed and confirmed plan is unavailing because 1146(a) specifies not only that a transfer be under a plan, but also that the plan be confirmed pursuant to 1129.  Ultimately this Court need not decide whether 1146(a) is unambiguous on its face, for, based on the parties other arguments, any ambiguity must be resolved in Floridas favor.  Pp.47.


(b)Even on the assumption that 1146(a)s text is ambiguous, reading it in context with other relevant Code provisions reveals nothing justifying Piccadillys claims that had Congress intended 1146(a) to apply exclusively to postconfirmation transfers, it would have made its intent plain with an express temporal limitation, and that under should be construed broadly to mean in in accordance with.  If statutory context suggests anything, it is that 1146(a) is inapplicable to preconfirmation transfers.  The provisions placement in a subchapter entitled POSTCONFIRMATION MATTERS undermines Piccadillys view that it extends to preconfirmation transfers.  Piccadillys textual and contextual arguments, even if fully accepted, would establish at most that the statutory language is ambiguous, not that the purported ambiguity should be resolved in Piccadillys favor.

06-1195|"BOUMEDIENE etal. v. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 061195.Argued December 5, 2007Decided June 12, 2008*
In the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), Congress empowered the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those  he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks  on September 11, 2001.  In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 518, 588589, five Justices recognized that detaining individuals captured while fighting against the United States in Afghanistan for the duration of that conflict was a fundamental and accepted incident to war.  Thereafter, the Defense Department established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine whether individuals detained at the U. S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were enemy combatants.


Petitioners are aliens detained at Guantanamo after being captured in Afghanistan or elsewhere abroad and designated enemy combatants by CSRTs.  Denying membership in the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks and the Taliban regime that supported al Qaeda, each petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, which ordered the cases dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Guantanamo is outside sovereign U. S. territory.  The D.C. Circuit affirmed, but this Court reversed, holding that 28 U. S.C. 2241 extended statutory habeas jurisdiction to Guantanamo.  See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473.  Petitioners cases were then consolidated into two proceedings.  In the first, the district judge granted the Governments motion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that could be vindicated in a habeas action.  In the second, the judge held that the detainees had due process rights.


While appeals were pending, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 1005(e) of which amended 28 U. S.C. 2241 to provide that no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to  consider  an application for  habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained  at Guantanamo, and gave the D. C. Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review CSRT decisions.  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 576577, the Court held this provision inapplicable to cases (like petitioners) pending when the DTA was enacted.  Congress responded with the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), 7(a) of which amended 2241(e)(1) to deny jurisdiction with respect to habeas actions by detained aliens determined to be enemy combatants, while 2241(e)(2) denies jurisdiction as to any other action against the United States  relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of a detained alien determined to be an enemy combatant.  MCA 7(b) provides that the 2241(e) amendments shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply to all cases, without exception, pending on or after [that] date  which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained  since September 11, 2001.


The D. C. Court of Appeals concluded that MCA 7 must be read to strip from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners habeas applications; that petitioners are not entitled to habeas or the protections of the Suspension Clause,  U. S. Const., Art. I, 9, cl.2, which provides that [t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it; and that it was therefore unnecessary to consider whether the DTA provided an adequate and effective substitute for habeas. 
Held:
1.MCA 7 denies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas actions, like the instant cases, that were pending at the time of its enactment.  Section 7(b)s effective date provision undoubtedly applies to habeas actions, which, by definition, relate to  detention within that sections meaning.  Petitioners argue to no avail that 7(b) does not apply to a 2241(e)(1) habeas action, but only to any other action under 2241(e)(2), because it largely repeats that sections language.  The phrase other action in 2241(e)(2) cannot be understood without referring back to 2241(e)(1), which explicitly mentions the writ of habeas corpus.  Because the two paragraphs structure implies that habeas is a type of action relating to any aspect of  detention, etc., pending habeas actions are in the category of cases subject to the statutes jurisdictional bar.  This is confirmed by the MCAs legislative history.  Thus, if MCA 7 is valid, petitioners cases must be dismissed.  Pp.58. 


2.Petitioners have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus.  They are not barred from seeking the writ or invoking the Suspension Clauses protections because they have been designated as enemy combatants or because of their presence at Guantanamo.  Pp.841.


(a)A brief account of the writs history and origins shows that protection for the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights; in the system the Framers conceived, the writ has a centrality that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause.  That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken in the Suspension Clause to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: The writ may be suspended only when public safety requires it in times of rebellion or invasion.  The Clause is designed to protect against cyclical abuses of the writ by the Executive and Legislative Branches.  It protects detainee rights by a means consistent with the Constitutions essential design, ensuring that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the delicate balance of governance.  Hamdi, supra, at 536.  Separation-of-powers principles, and the history that influenced their design, inform the Clauses reach and purpose.  Pp.815. 


(b)A diligent search of founding-era precedents and legal commentaries reveals no certain conclusions.  None of the cases the parties cite reveal whether a common-law court would have granted, or refused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a habeas petition by a prisoner deemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the Defense Departments in these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over which the Government has total military and civil control.  The evidence as to the writs geographic scope at common law is informative, but, again, not dispositive.  Petitioners argue that the site of their detention is analogous to two territories outside England to which the common-law writ ran, the exempt jurisdictions and India, but critical differences between these places and Guantanamo render these claims unpersuasive.  The Government argues that Guantanamo is more closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover, where the writ did not run, but it is unclear whether the common-law courts lacked the power to issue the writ there, or whether they refrained from doing so for prudential reasons.  The parties arguments that the very lack of a precedent on point supports their respective positions are premised upon the doubtful assumptions that the historical record is complete and that the common law, if properly understood, yields a definite answer to the questions before the Court.  Pp.1522.


(c)The Suspension Clause has full effect at Guantanamo.  The Governments argument that the Clause affords petitioners no rights because the United States does not claim sovereignty over the naval station is rejected.  Pp.2242. 


(i)The Court does not question the Governments position that Cuba maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense, over Guantanamo, but it does not accept the Governments premise that de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction.  Common-law habeas history provides scant support for this proposition, and it is inconsistent with the Courts precedents and contrary to fundamental separation-of-powers principles.  Pp.2225.


(ii)Discussions of the Constitutions extraterritorial application in cases involving provisions other than the Suspension Clause undermine the Governments argument.  Fundamental questions regarding the Constitutions geographic scope first arose when the Nation acquired Hawaii and the noncontiguous Territories ceded by Spain after the Spanish-American War, and Congress discontinued its prior practice of extending constitutional rights to territories by statute.  In the so-called Insular Cases, the Court held that the Constitution had independent force in the territories that was not contingent upon acts of legislative grace.  See, e.g., Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138.  Yet because of the difficulties and disruption inherent in transforming the former Spanish colonies civil-law system into an Anglo-American system, the Court adopted the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in incorporated Territories surely destined for statehood but only in part in unincorporated Territories.  See, e.g., id., at 143.  Practical considerations likewise influenced the Courts analysis in Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, where, in applying the jury provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to American civilians being tried by the U. S. military abroad, both the plurality and the concurrences noted the relevance of practical considerations, related not to the petitioners citizenship, but to the place of their confinement and trial.  Finally, in holding that habeas jurisdiction did not extend to enemy aliens, convicted of violating the laws of war, who were detained in a German prison during the Allied Powers post-World War II occupation, the Court, in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, stressed the practical difficulties of ordering the production of the prisoners, id., at 779.  The Governments reading of Eisentrager as adopting a formalistic test for determining the Suspension Clauses reach is rejected because: (1) the discussion of practical considerations in that case was integral to a part of the Courts opinion that came before it announced its holding, see id., at 781; (2) it mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty only twice in its opinion, in contrast to its significant discussion of practical barriers to the running of the writ; and (3) if the Governments reading were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases (and later Reids) functional approach.  A constricted reading of Eisentrager overlooks what the Court sees as a common thread uniting all these cases: The idea that extraterritoriality questions turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.  Pp.2534. 


(iii)The Governments sovereignty-based test raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns, which are illustrated by Guantanamos political history.  Although the United States has maintained complete and uninterrupted control of Guantanamo for over 100 years, the Governments view is that the Constitution has no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed formal sovereignty in its 1903 lease with Cuba.  The Nations basic charter cannot be contracted away like this.  The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say what the law is.  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177.  These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspension Clause question here, for the habeas writ is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers.  Pp.3436.


(iv)Based on Eisentrager, supra, at 777, and the Courts reasoning in its other extraterritoriality opinions, at least three factors are relevant in determining the Suspension Clauses reach: (1) the detainees citizenship and status and the adequacy of the process through which that status was determined; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoners entitlement to the writ.  Application of this framework reveals, first, that petitioners status is in dispute: They are not American citizens, but deny they are enemy combatants; and although they have been afforded some process in CSRT proceedings, there has been no Eisentragerstyle trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war.  Second, while the sites of petitioners apprehension and detention weigh against finding they have Suspension Clause rights, there are critical differences between Eisentragers German prison, circa 1950, and the Guantanamo Naval Station in 2008, given the Governments absolute and indefinite control over the naval station.  Third, although the Court is sensitive to the financial and administrative costs of holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention abroad, these factors are not dispositive because the Government presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas courts had jurisdiction.  The situation in Eisentrager was far different, given the historical context and nature of the militarys mission in post-War Germany.  Pp.3641.


(d)Petitioners are therefore entitled to the habeas privilege, and if that privilege is to be denied them, Congress must act in accordance with the Suspension Clauses requirements.  Cf. Rasul, 542 U. S., at 564.  Pp.4142.


3.Because the DTAs procedures for reviewing detainees status are not an adequate and effective substitute for the habeas writ, MCA 7 operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.  Pp. 4264. 


(a)Given its holding that the writ does not run to petitioners, the D. C. Circuit found it unnecessary to consider whether there was an adequate substitute for habeas.  This Court usually remands for consideration of questions not decided below, but departure from this rule is appropriate in exceptional circumstances, see, e.g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 169, here, the grave separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact that petitioners have been denied meaningful access to a judicial forum for years.  Pp.4244.


(b)Historically, Congress has taken care to avoid suspensions of the writ.  For example, the statutes at issue in the Courts two leading cases addressing habeas substitutes, Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, and United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, were attempts to streamline habeas relief, not to cut it back.  Those cases provide little guidance here because, inter alia, the statutes in question gave the courts broad remedial powers to secure the historic office of the writ, and included saving clauses to preserve habeas review as an avenue of last resort.  In contrast, Congress intended the DTA and the MCA to circumscribe habeas review, as is evident from the unequivocal nature of MCA 7s jurisdiction-stripping language, from the DTAs text limiting the Court of Appeals jurisdiction to assessing whether the CSRT complied with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense, DTA 1005(e)(2)(C), and from the absence of a saving clause in either Act.  That Congress intended to create a more limited procedure is also confirmed by the legislative history and by a comparison of the DTA and the habeas statute that would govern in MCA 7s absence, 28 U. S.C. 2241.  In 2241, Congress authorized any justice or circuit judge to issue the writ, thereby accommodating the necessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case to a district court.  See 2241(b).  However, by granting the D. C. Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners cases, see DTA 1005(e)(2)(A), Congress has foreclosed that option in these cases.  Pp.4449. 


(c)This Court does not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate habeas substitute.  It is uncontroversial, however, that the habeas privilege entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 302, and the habeas court must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.  But more may be required depending on the circumstances.  Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs, the most relevant being the constraints upon the detainees ability to rebut the factual basis for the Governments assertion that he is an enemy combatant.  At the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Governments case, does not have the assistance of counsel, and may not be aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied upon to order his detention.  His opportunity to confront witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real, given that there are no limits on the admission of hearsay.  The Court therefore agrees with petitioners that there is considerable risk of error in the tribunals findings of fact.  And given that the consequence of error may be detention for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, the risk is too significant to ignore.  Accordingly, for the habeas writ, or its substitute, to function as an effective and meaningful remedy in this context, the court conducting the collateral proceeding must have some ability to correct any errors, to assess the sufficiency of the Governments evidence, and to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding.  In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 5, 8, and Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 2325, distinguished.  Pp. 4957. 


(d)Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the DTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substitute for habeas.  Among the constitutional infirmities from which the DTA potentially suffers are the absence of provisions allowing petitioners to challenge the Presidents authority under the AUMF to detain them indefinitely, to contest the CSRTs findings of fact, to supplement the record on review with exculpatory evidence discovered after the CSRT proceedings, and to request release.  The statute cannot be read to contain each of these constitutionally required procedures.  MCA 7 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.  There is no jurisdictional bar to the District Courts entertaining petitioners claims.  Pp.5764.


4.Nor are there prudential barriers to habeas review.  Pp.6470.


(a)Petitioners need not seek review of their CSRT determinations in the D. C. Circuit before proceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court.  If these cases involved detainees held for only a short time while awaiting their CSRT determinations, or were it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger.  But these qualifications no longer pertain here.  In some instances six years have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute demands.  To require these detainees to pursue the limited structure of DTA review before proceeding with habeas actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay.  This holding should not be read to imply that a habeas court should intervene the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs.  Except in cases of undue delay, such as the present, federal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy combatants habeas petition at least until after the CSRT has had a chance to review his status.  Pp.6467. 


(b)In effectuating todays holding, certain accommodationsincluding channeling future cases to a single district court and requiring that court to use its discretion to accommodate to the greatest extent possible the Governments legitimate interest in protecting sources and intelligence gathering methodsshould be made to reduce the burden habeas proceedings will place on the military, without impermissibly diluting the writs protections.  Pp.6768.


5.In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, the courts must accord proper deference to the political branches.  However, security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedoms first principles, chief among them being freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers.  Pp.6870.

			"|"BOUMEDIENE etal. v. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
No. 061195.Argued December 5, 2007Decided June 12, 2008*
In the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), Congress empowered the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those  he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks  on September 11, 2001.  In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 518, 588589, five Justices recognized that detaining individuals captured while fighting against the United States in Afghanistan for the duration of that conflict was a fundamental and accepted incident to war.  Thereafter, the Defense Department established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to determine whether individuals detained at the U. S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were enemy combatants.


Petitioners are aliens detained at Guantanamo after being captured in Afghanistan or elsewhere abroad and designated enemy combatants by CSRTs.  Denying membership in the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the September 11 attacks and the Taliban regime that supported al Qaeda, each petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court, which ordered the cases dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Guantanamo is outside sovereign U. S. territory.  The D.C. Circuit affirmed, but this Court reversed, holding that 28 U. S.C. 2241 extended statutory habeas jurisdiction to Guantanamo.  See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466, 473.  Petitioners cases were then consolidated into two proceedings.  In the first, the district judge granted the Governments motion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that could be vindicated in a habeas action.  In the second, the judge held that the detainees had due process rights.


While appeals were pending, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), 1005(e) of which amended 28 U. S.C. 2241 to provide that no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to  consider  an application for  habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained  at Guantanamo, and gave the D. C. Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review CSRT decisions.  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 576577, the Court held this provision inapplicable to cases (like petitioners) pending when the DTA was enacted.  Congress responded with the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), 7(a) of which amended 2241(e)(1) to deny jurisdiction with respect to habeas actions by detained aliens determined to be enemy combatants, while 2241(e)(2) denies jurisdiction as to any other action against the United States  relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of a detained alien determined to be an enemy combatant.  MCA 7(b) provides that the 2241(e) amendments shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply to all cases, without exception, pending on or after [that] date  which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained  since September 11, 2001.


The D. C. Court of Appeals concluded that MCA 7 must be read to strip from it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners habeas applications; that petitioners are not entitled to habeas or the protections of the Suspension Clause,  U. S. Const., Art. I, 9, cl.2, which provides that [t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it; and that it was therefore unnecessary to consider whether the DTA provided an adequate and effective substitute for habeas. 
Held:
1.MCA 7 denies the federal courts jurisdiction to hear habeas actions, like the instant cases, that were pending at the time of its enactment.  Section 7(b)s effective date provision undoubtedly applies to habeas actions, which, by definition, relate to  detention within that sections meaning.  Petitioners argue to no avail that 7(b) does not apply to a 2241(e)(1) habeas action, but only to any other action under 2241(e)(2), because it largely repeats that sections language.  The phrase other action in 2241(e)(2) cannot be understood without referring back to 2241(e)(1), which explicitly mentions the writ of habeas corpus.  Because the two paragraphs structure implies that habeas is a type of action relating to any aspect of  detention, etc., pending habeas actions are in the category of cases subject to the statutes jurisdictional bar.  This is confirmed by the MCAs legislative history.  Thus, if MCA 7 is valid, petitioners cases must be dismissed.  Pp.58. 


2.Petitioners have the constitutional privilege of habeas corpus.  They are not barred from seeking the writ or invoking the Suspension Clauses protections because they have been designated as enemy combatants or because of their presence at Guantanamo.  Pp.841.


(a)A brief account of the writs history and origins shows that protection for the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution that, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights; in the system the Framers conceived, the writ has a centrality that must inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause.  That the Framers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty is evident from the care taken in the Suspension Clause to specify the limited grounds for its suspension: The writ may be suspended only when public safety requires it in times of rebellion or invasion.  The Clause is designed to protect against cyclical abuses of the writ by the Executive and Legislative Branches.  It protects detainee rights by a means consistent with the Constitutions essential design, ensuring that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the delicate balance of governance.  Hamdi, supra, at 536.  Separation-of-powers principles, and the history that influenced their design, inform the Clauses reach and purpose.  Pp.815. 


(b)A diligent search of founding-era precedents and legal commentaries reveals no certain conclusions.  None of the cases the parties cite reveal whether a common-law court would have granted, or refused to hear for lack of jurisdiction, a habeas petition by a prisoner deemed an enemy combatant, under a standard like the Defense Departments in these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over which the Government has total military and civil control.  The evidence as to the writs geographic scope at common law is informative, but, again, not dispositive.  Petitioners argue that the site of their detention is analogous to two territories outside England to which the common-law writ ran, the exempt jurisdictions and India, but critical differences between these places and Guantanamo render these claims unpersuasive.  The Government argues that Guantanamo is more closely analogous to Scotland and Hanover, where the writ did not run, but it is unclear whether the common-law courts lacked the power to issue the writ there, or whether they refrained from doing so for prudential reasons.  The parties arguments that the very lack of a precedent on point supports their respective positions are premised upon the doubtful assumptions that the historical record is complete and that the common law, if properly understood, yields a definite answer to the questions before the Court.  Pp.1522.


(c)The Suspension Clause has full effect at Guantanamo.  The Governments argument that the Clause affords petitioners no rights because the United States does not claim sovereignty over the naval station is rejected.  Pp.2242. 


(i)The Court does not question the Governments position that Cuba maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense, over Guantanamo, but it does not accept the Governments premise that de jure sovereignty is the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction.  Common-law habeas history provides scant support for this proposition, and it is inconsistent with the Courts precedents and contrary to fundamental separation-of-powers principles.  Pp.2225.


(ii)Discussions of the Constitutions extraterritorial application in cases involving provisions other than the Suspension Clause undermine the Governments argument.  Fundamental questions regarding the Constitutions geographic scope first arose when the Nation acquired Hawaii and the noncontiguous Territories ceded by Spain after the Spanish-American War, and Congress discontinued its prior practice of extending constitutional rights to territories by statute.  In the so-called Insular Cases, the Court held that the Constitution had independent force in the territories that was not contingent upon acts of legislative grace.  See, e.g., Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138.  Yet because of the difficulties and disruption inherent in transforming the former Spanish colonies civil-law system into an Anglo-American system, the Court adopted the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in incorporated Territories surely destined for statehood but only in part in unincorporated Territories.  See, e.g., id., at 143.  Practical considerations likewise influenced the Courts analysis in Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, where, in applying the jury provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to American civilians being tried by the U. S. military abroad, both the plurality and the concurrences noted the relevance of practical considerations, related not to the petitioners citizenship, but to the place of their confinement and trial.  Finally, in holding that habeas jurisdiction did not extend to enemy aliens, convicted of violating the laws of war, who were detained in a German prison during the Allied Powers post-World War II occupation, the Court, in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, stressed the practical difficulties of ordering the production of the prisoners, id., at 779.  The Governments reading of Eisentrager as adopting a formalistic test for determining the Suspension Clauses reach is rejected because: (1) the discussion of practical considerations in that case was integral to a part of the Courts opinion that came before it announced its holding, see id., at 781; (2) it mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty only twice in its opinion, in contrast to its significant discussion of practical barriers to the running of the writ; and (3) if the Governments reading were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, but a complete repudiation of, the Insular Cases (and later Reids) functional approach.  A constricted reading of Eisentrager overlooks what the Court sees as a common thread uniting all these cases: The idea that extraterritoriality questions turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.  Pp.2534. 


(iii)The Governments sovereignty-based test raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns, which are illustrated by Guantanamos political history.  Although the United States has maintained complete and uninterrupted control of Guantanamo for over 100 years, the Governments view is that the Constitution has no effect there, at least as to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed formal sovereignty in its 1903 lease with Cuba.  The Nations basic charter cannot be contracted away like this.  The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say what the law is.  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177.  These concerns have particular bearing upon the Suspension Clause question here, for the habeas writ is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers.  Pp.3436.


(iv)Based on Eisentrager, supra, at 777, and the Courts reasoning in its other extraterritoriality opinions, at least three factors are relevant in determining the Suspension Clauses reach: (1) the detainees citizenship and status and the adequacy of the process through which that status was determined; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inherent in resolving the prisoners entitlement to the writ.  Application of this framework reveals, first, that petitioners status is in dispute: They are not American citizens, but deny they are enemy combatants; and although they have been afforded some process in CSRT proceedings, there has been no Eisentragerstyle trial by military commission for violations of the laws of war.  Second, while the sites of petitioners apprehension and detention weigh against finding they have Suspension Clause rights, there are critical differences between Eisentragers German prison, circa 1950, and the Guantanamo Naval Station in 2008, given the Governments absolute and indefinite control over the naval station.  Third, although the Court is sensitive to the financial and administrative costs of holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case of military detention abroad, these factors are not dispositive because the Government presents no credible arguments that the military mission at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas courts had jurisdiction.  The situation in Eisentrager was far different, given the historical context and nature of the militarys mission in post-War Germany.  Pp.3641.


(d)Petitioners are therefore entitled to the habeas privilege, and if that privilege is to be denied them, Congress must act in accordance with the Suspension Clauses requirements.  Cf. Rasul, 542 U. S., at 564.  Pp.4142.


3.Because the DTAs procedures for reviewing detainees status are not an adequate and effective substitute for the habeas writ, MCA 7 operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.  Pp. 4264. 


(a)Given its holding that the writ does not run to petitioners, the D. C. Circuit found it unnecessary to consider whether there was an adequate substitute for habeas.  This Court usually remands for consideration of questions not decided below, but departure from this rule is appropriate in exceptional circumstances, see, e.g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 169, here, the grave separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact that petitioners have been denied meaningful access to a judicial forum for years.  Pp.4244.


(b)Historically, Congress has taken care to avoid suspensions of the writ.  For example, the statutes at issue in the Courts two leading cases addressing habeas substitutes, Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S. 372, and United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, were attempts to streamline habeas relief, not to cut it back.  Those cases provide little guidance here because, inter alia, the statutes in question gave the courts broad remedial powers to secure the historic office of the writ, and included saving clauses to preserve habeas review as an avenue of last resort.  In contrast, Congress intended the DTA and the MCA to circumscribe habeas review, as is evident from the unequivocal nature of MCA 7s jurisdiction-stripping language, from the DTAs text limiting the Court of Appeals jurisdiction to assessing whether the CSRT complied with the standards and procedures specified by the Secretary of Defense, DTA 1005(e)(2)(C), and from the absence of a saving clause in either Act.  That Congress intended to create a more limited procedure is also confirmed by the legislative history and by a comparison of the DTA and the habeas statute that would govern in MCA 7s absence, 28 U. S.C. 2241.  In 2241, Congress authorized any justice or circuit judge to issue the writ, thereby accommodating the necessity for factfinding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge or Justice to transfer the case to a district court.  See 2241(b).  However, by granting the D. C. Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over petitioners cases, see DTA 1005(e)(2)(A), Congress has foreclosed that option in these cases.  Pp.4449. 


(c)This Court does not endeavor to offer a comprehensive summary of the requisites for an adequate habeas substitute.  It is uncontroversial, however, that the habeas privilege entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 302, and the habeas court must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained.  But more may be required depending on the circumstances.  Petitioners identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs, the most relevant being the constraints upon the detainees ability to rebut the factual basis for the Governments assertion that he is an enemy combatant.  At the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or present evidence to challenge the Governments case, does not have the assistance of counsel, and may not be aware of the most critical allegations that the Government relied upon to order his detention.  His opportunity to confront witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real, given that there are no limits on the admission of hearsay.  The Court therefore agrees with petitioners that there is considerable risk of error in the tribunals findings of fact.  And given that the consequence of error may be detention for the duration of hostilities that may last a generation or more, the risk is too significant to ignore.  Accordingly, for the habeas writ, or its substitute, to function as an effective and meaningful remedy in this context, the court conducting the collateral proceeding must have some ability to correct any errors, to assess the sufficiency of the Governments evidence, and to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding.  In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1, 5, 8, and Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1, 2325, distinguished.  Pp. 4957. 


(d)Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the DTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substitute for habeas.  Among the constitutional infirmities from which the DTA potentially suffers are the absence of provisions allowing petitioners to challenge the Presidents authority under the AUMF to detain them indefinitely, to contest the CSRTs findings of fact, to supplement the record on review with exculpatory evidence discovered after the CSRT proceedings, and to request release.  The statute cannot be read to contain each of these constitutionally required procedures.  MCA 7 thus effects an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.  There is no jurisdictional bar to the District Courts entertaining petitioners claims.  Pp.5764.


4.Nor are there prudential barriers to habeas review.  Pp.6470.


(a)Petitioners need not seek review of their CSRT determinations in the D. C. Circuit before proceeding with their habeas actions in the District Court.  If these cases involved detainees held for only a short time while awaiting their CSRT determinations, or were it probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary abstention or exhaustion of alternative remedies would be much stronger.  But these qualifications no longer pertain here.  In some instances six years have elapsed without the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute demands.  To require these detainees to pursue the limited structure of DTA review before proceeding with habeas actions would be to require additional months, if not years, of delay.  This holding should not be read to imply that a habeas court should intervene the moment an enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs.  Except in cases of undue delay, such as the present, federal courts should refrain from entertaining an enemy combatants habeas petition at least until after the CSRT has had a chance to review his status.  Pp.6467. 


(b)In effectuating todays holding, certain accommodationsincluding channeling future cases to a single district court and requiring that court to use its discretion to accommodate to the greatest extent possible the Governments legitimate interest in protecting sources and intelligence gathering methodsshould be made to reduce the burden habeas proceedings will place on the military, without impermissibly diluting the writs protections.  Pp.6768.


5.In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, the courts must accord proper deference to the political branches.  However, security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedoms first principles, chief among them being freedom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured by adherence to the separation of powers.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 061204.Argued March 17, 2008Decided June 12, 2008
A class action by and for human rights victims (Pimentel class) of Ferdinand Marcos, while he was President of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), led to a nearly $2 billion judgment in a United States District Court.  The Pimentel class then sought to attach the assets of Arelma, S.A. (Arelma), a company incorporated by Marcos, held by a New York broker (Merrill Lynch).  The Republic and a Philippine commission (Commission) established to recover property wrongfully taken by Marcos are also attempting to recover this and other Marcos property.  The Philippine National Banc (PNB) holds some of the disputed assets in escrow, awaiting the outcome of pending litigation in the Sandiganbayan, a Philippine court determining whether Marcos property should be forfeited to the Republic.  Facing claims from various Marcos creditors, including the Pimentel class, Merrill Lynch filed this interpleader action under 28 U. S.C. 1335, naming, among the defendants, the Republic, the Commission, Arelma, PNB (all petitioners here), and the Pimentel class (respondents here).  The Republic and the Commission asserted sovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, and moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(b), arguing that the action could not proceed without them.  Arelma and PNB also sought a Rule 19(b) dismissal.  The District Court refused, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the Republic and the Commission are entitled to sovereign immunity and are required parties under Rule 19(a), and it entered a stay pending the Sandiganbayan litigations outcome.  Finding that that litigation could not determine entitlement to Arelmas assets, the District Court vacated the stay and ultimately awarded the assets to the Pimentel class.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that dismissal was not warranted under Rule 19(b) because, though the Republic and the Commission were required parties, their claim had so little likelihood of success on the merits that the action could proceed without them.  The court found it unnecessary to consider whether prejudice to those entities might be lessened by a judgment or interim decree in the interpleader action, found the entities failure to obtain a judgment in the Sandiganbayan an equitable consideration counseling against dismissing the interpleader suit, and found that allowing the interpleader case to proceed would serve the Pimentel class interests.
Held: 
1.Because Arelma and PNB also seek review of the Ninth Circuits decision, this Court need not rule on the question whether the Republic and the Commission, having been dismissed from the suit, had the right to seek review of the decision that the suit could proceed in their absence.  As a general matter any party may move to dismiss an action under Rule 19(b).  Arelma and PNB have not lost standing to have the judgment vacated in its entirety on procedural grounds simply because they did not appeal, or petition for certiorari on, the underlying merits ruling denying them the interpleaded assets.  Pp.79.


2.Rule 19 requires dismissal of the interpleader action.  Pp. 920.


(a)Under Rule 19(a), nonjoinder even of a required person does not always result in dismissal.  When joinder is not feasible, the question whether an action should proceed turns on nonexclusive considerations in Rule 19(b), which asks whether in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.  The joinder issue can be complex, and the case-specific determinations involve multiple factors, some substantive, some procedural, some compelling by themselves, and some subject to balancing against opposing interests, Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U. S. 102, 119.  Pp.910.


(b)Here, Rule 19(a)s application is not contested: The Republic and the Commission are required entities.  And this Court need not decide the proper standard of review for Rule 19(b) decisions, because the Ninth Circuits errors of law require reversal.  Pp.1019.


(1)The first factor directs the court to consider, in determining whether the action may proceed, the prejudice to absent entities and present parties in the event judgment is rendered without joinder.  Rule 19(b)(1).  The Ninth Circuit gave insufficient weight to the sovereign status of the Republic and the Commission in considering whether they would be prejudiced if the case proceeded.  Giving full effect to sovereign immunity promotes the comity and dignity interests that contributed to the development of the immunity doctrine.  See, e.g., Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486.  These interests are concrete here.  The entities claims arise from historically and politically significant events for the Republic and its people, and the entities have a unique interest in resolving matters related to Arelmas assets.  A foreign state has a comity interest in using its courts for a dispute if it has a right to do so.  Its dignity is not enhanced if other nations bypass its courts without right or good cause.  A more specific affront could result if property the Republic and the Commission claim is seized by a foreign court decree.  This Court has not considered the precise question presented, but authorities involving the intersection of joinder and the United States governmental immunity, see, e.g., Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. Forrestal, 326 U. S. 371, 373375, instruct that where sovereign immunity is asserted, and the sovereigns claims are not frivolous, dismissal must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the absent sovereigns interests.  The claims of the Republic and the Commission were not frivolous, and the Ninth Circuit thus erred in ruling on their merits.  The privilege of sovereign immunity from suit is much diminished if an important and consequential ruling affecting the sovereigns substantial interest is determined, or at least assumed, by a federal court in its absence and over its objection. The Pimentel class interest in recovering its damages is not discounted, but important comity concerns are implicated by assertion of foreign sovereign immunity.  The error is not that the courts below gave too much weight to the Pimentel class interests, but that they did not accord proper weight to the compelling sovereign immunity claim.  Pp. 1116.


(2)The second factor is the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by relief or measures alternative to dismissal, Rule 19(b)(2), but no alternative remedies or forms of relief have been proposed or appear to be available.  As to the third factorwhether a judgment rendered without the absent party would be adequate, Rule 19(b)(3)adequacy refers not to satisfaction of the Pimentel class claims, but to the public stake in settling disputes by wholes, whenever possible, Provident Bank, supra, at 111.  Going forward with the action in the absence of the Republic and the Commission would not further this public interest because they could not be bound by a judgment to which they were not parties.  As to the fourth factorwhether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder, Rule 19(b)(4)the Ninth Circuit made much of the tort victims lack of an alternative forum.  But Merrill Lynch, not the Pimentel class, is the plaintiff as the stakeholder in the interpleader action.  See 28 U. S.C. 1335(a).  The Pimentel class interests are not irrelevant to Rule 19(b)s equitable balance, but the Rules other provisions are the relevant ones to consult.  A dismissal on the ground of nonjoinder will not provide Merrill Lynch with a judgment determining entitlement to the assets so it could be done with the matter, but it likely would give Merrill Lynch an effective defense against piecemeal litigation by various claimants and inconsistent, conflicting judgments.  Any prejudice to Merrill Lynch is outweighed by prejudice to the absent entities invoking sovereign immunity.  In the usual course, the Ninth Circuits failure to give sufficient weight to the likely prejudice to the Republic and the Commission would warrant reversal and remand for further determinations, but here, that error plus this Courts analysis under Rule 19(b)s additional provisions require the actions dismissal.  Pp. 1720.

The Multinational ForceIraq (MNFI) is an international coalition force composed of 26 nations, including the United States.  It operates in Iraq under the unified command of U. S. military officers, at the Iraqi Governments request, and in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolutions.  Pursuant to the U.N. mandate, MNFI forces detain individuals alleged to have committed hostile or warlike acts in Iraq, pending investigation and prosecution in Iraqi courts under Iraqi law.  


Shawqi Omar and Mohammad Munaf (hereinafter petitioners) are American citizens who voluntarily traveled to Iraq and allegedly committed crimes there.  They were each captured by military forces operating as part of the MNFI; given hearings before MNFI Tribunals composed of American officers, who concluded that petitioners posed threats to Iraqs security; and placed in the custody of the U. S. military operating as part of the MNF-I.  Family members filed next-friend habeas corpus petitions on behalf of both petitioners in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.


In Omars case, after the Department of Justice informed Omar that the MNFI had decided to refer him to the Central Criminal Court of Iraq for criminal proceedings, his attorney sought and obtained a preliminary injunction from the District Court barring Omars removal from United States or MNF-I custody.  Affirming, the D. C. Circuit first upheld the District Courts exercise of habeas jurisdiction, finding that Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197, did not preclude review because Omar, unlike the habeas petitioners in Hirota, had yet to be convicted by a foreign tribunal.


Meanwhile, the District Court in Munafs case dismissed his habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.  The court concluded that Hirota controlled and required that the petition be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the American forces holding Munaf were operating as part of an international forcethe MNF-I.  The D. C. Circuit agreed and affirmed.  It distinguished its prior decision in Omar, which upheld jurisdiction over Omars habeas petition, on the grounds that Munaf had been convicted by a foreign tribunal while Omar had not.
Held:
1.The habeas statute extends to American citizens held overseas by American forces operating subject to an American chain of command.  The Governments argument that the federal courts lack jurisdiction over the detainees habeas petitions in such circumstances because the American forces holding Omar and Munaf operate as part of a multinational force is rejected.  The habeas statute, 28 U. S.C. 2241(c)(1), applies to persons held in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.  The disjunctive or in 2241(c)(1) makes clear that actual Government custody suffices for jurisdiction, even if that custody could be viewed as under  color of another authority, such as the MNFI.  


The Court also rejects the Governments contention that the District Court lacks jurisdiction in these cases because the multinational character of the MNFI, like the multinational character of the tribunal at issue in Hirota, means that the MNF-I is not a United States entity subject to habeas.  The present cases differ from Hirota in several respects.  The Court in Hirota may have found it significant, in considering the nature of the tribunal established by General MacArthur, that in that case the Government argued that General MacArthur was not subject to United States authority, that his duty was to obey the Far Eastern Commission and not the U. S. War Department, and that no process this Court could issue would have any effect on his action.   Here, in contrast, the Government acknowledges that U. S. military commanders answer to the President.  These cases also differ from Hirota in that they concern American citizens, and the Court has indicated that habeas jurisdiction can depend on citizenship.  See e.g., Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 781.  Pp.711.  


2. Federal district courts, however, may not exercise their habeas jurisdiction to enjoin the United States from transferring individuals alleged to have committed crimes and detained within the territory of a foreign sovereign to that sovereign for criminal prosecution.  Because petitioners state no claim in their habeas petitions for which relief can be granted, their habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed, and no injunction should have been entered.  Pp.1128.  


(a)The District Court abused its discretion in granting Omar a preliminary injunction, which the D.C. Circuit interpreted as prohibiting the Government from (1) transferring Omar to Iraqi custody, (2) sharing with the Iraqi Government details concerning any decision to release him, and (3) presenting him to the Iraqi courts for investigation and prosecution, without even considering the merits of the habeas petition.  A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.  It should never be awarded as of right, Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 440, and requires a demonstration of, inter alia, a likelihood of success on the merits, Gonzales v. O Centro Esprita Beneficente Uni&abreve;o do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 428.   But neither the District Court nor the D. C. Circuit considered the likelihood of success as to the merits of Omars habeas petition.  Instead, the lower courts concluded that the jurisdictional issues implicated by Omars petition presented difficult and substantial questions.  A difficult question as to jurisdiction is, of course, no reason to grant a preliminary injunction.  


The foregoing analysis would require reversal and remand in each of these cases: The lower courts in Munaf erred in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, and the lower courts in Omar erred in issuing and upholding the preliminary injunction.  Our review of a preliminary injunction, however, is not confined to the act of granting the injunctio[n].  City and County of Denver v. New York Trust Co., 229 U. S. 123, 136.  Rather, a reviewing court has the power on appeal from an interlocutory order to examine the merits of the case  and upon deciding them in favor of the defendant to dismiss the bill.  North Carolina R. Co. v. Story, 268 U. S. 288, 292.  In short, there are occasions when it is appropriate for a court reviewing a preliminary injunction to proceed to the merits; given that the present cases implicate sensitive foreign policy issues in the context of ongoing military operations, this is one of them.  Pp.1114. 


(b)Petitioners argue that they are entitled to habeas relief because they have a legally enforceable right not to be transferred to Iraqi authorities for criminal proceedings and because they are innocent civilians unlawfully detained by the Government.  With respect to the transfer claim, they request an injunction prohibiting the Government from transferring them to Iraqi custody.  With respect to the unlawful detention claim, they seek release but only to the extent it would not result in unlawful transfer to Iraqi custody.  Because both requests would interfere with Iraqs sovereign right to punish offenses against its laws committed within its borders, Wilson v. Girard, 354 U. S. 524, 529, petitioners claims do not state grounds upon which habeas relief may be granted.  Their habeas petitions should have been promptly dismissed and no injunction should have been entered.  Pp.1428.  


(1)Habeas is governed by equitable principles.  Thus, prudential concerns may require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas  power. Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536, 539.   Here, the unusual nature of the relief sought by petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate.  Habeas is at its core a remedy for unlawful executive detention.  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, 536.  The typical remedy is, of course, release.  See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 484.  But the habeas petitioners in these cases do not want simple release; that would expose them to apprehension by Iraqi authorities for criminal prosecutionprecisely what they went to federal court to avoid.  


The habeas petitioners do not dispute that they voluntarily traveled to Iraq, that they remain detained within the sovereign territory of Iraq today, or that they are alleged to have committed serious crimes in Iraq.  Indeed, Omar and Munaf both concede that, if they were not in MNFI custody, Iraq would be free to arrest and prosecute them under Iraqi law.  Further, Munaf is the subject of ongoing Iraqi criminal proceedings and Omar would be but for the present injunction.  Given these facts, Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute them for crimes committed on its soil, even if its criminal process does not come with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, see Neely v. Henkel, 180 U. S. 109, 123.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained nearly two centuries ago, [t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.  Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136.  


This Court has twice applied that principle in rejecting claims that the Constitution precludes the Executive from transferring a prisoner to a foreign country for prosecution in an allegedly unconstitutional trial.  Wilson, supra, at 529530; Neely, supra, at 112113, 122.  Omar and Munaf concede that Iraq has a sovereign right to prosecute them for alleged violations of its law.  Yet they went to federal court seeking an order that would allow them to defeat precisely that sovereign authority.  But habeas corpus does not bar the United States from transferring a prisoner to the sovereign authority he concedes has a right to prosecute him.  Petitioners release claim adds nothing to their transfer claim and fails for the same reasons, given that the release they seek is release that would avoid transfer.


There is of course even more at issue here: Neely involved a charge of embezzlement and Wilson the peacetime actions of a serviceman.  The present cases concern individuals captured and detained within an allys territory during ongoing hostilities involving our troops.  It would be very odd to hold that the Executive can transfer individuals such as those in the Neely and Wilson cases, but cannot transfer to an ally detainees captured by our Armed Forces for engaging in serious hostile acts against that ally in what the Government refers to as an active theater of combat.  Pp.1523. 


(2)Petitioners allegations that their transfer to Iraqi custody is likely to result in torture are a matter of serious concern but those allegations generally must be addressed by the political branches, not the judiciary.  The recognition that it is for the democratically elected branches to assess practices in foreign countries and to determine national policy in light of those assessments is nothing new.  As Chief Justice Marshall explained in the Schooner Exchange, exemptions from territorial jurisdiction . . . must be derived from the consent of the sovereign of the territory and are rather questions of policy than of law,  they are for diplomatic, rather than legal discussion.  7 Cranch, at 143, 146.  In the present cases, the Government explains that it is the policy of the United States not to transfer an individual in circumstances where torture is likely to result and that the State Department has determined that the Justice Ministrythe department which has authority over Munaf and Omaras well as its prison and detention facilities, have generally met internationally accepted standards for basic prisoner needs.  The judiciary is not suited to second-guess such determinations.  Pp.2326.


(3)Petitioners argument that, under Valentine v. United States ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U. S. 5, the Executive lacks discretion to transfer a citizen to Iraqi custody unless legal authority to do so is given by act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty, id., at 9, is rejected.  Valentine was an extradition case; the present cases involve the transfer to a sovereigns authority of an individual captured and already detained in that sovereigns territory.  Wilson, supra, also forecloses petitioners contention.  A Status of Forces Agreement there seemed to give the habeas petitioner a right to trial by an American military tribunal, rather than a Japanese court, 354 U. S., at 529, but this Court found no constitutional or statutory impediment to the Governments waiver of its jurisdiction in light of Japans sovereign interest in prosecuting crimes committed within its borders, id., at 530.  Pp.2628.

Petitioner pleaded guilty to making a threatening interstate communication to his ex-wife, in violation of federal law.  Although the presentence report recommended a Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of 41-to-51 months in prison, the court imposed the statutory maximum sentence60 months in prison and 3 years of supervised releaserejecting petitioners objection that he was entitled to notice that the court was contemplating an upward departure.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, reasoning that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), which states that [b]efore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified  either in the presentence report or in a partys pre-hearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure, did not apply because the sentence was a variance, not a Guidelines departure.  
Held:Rule 32(h) does not apply to a variance from a recommended Guidelines range.  At the time that Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129, was decided, prompting Rule 32(h)s promulgation, the Guidelines were mandatory; the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 prohibited district courts from disregarding most of the Guidelines mechanical dictates, id., at 133.  Confronted with the constitutional problems that might otherwise arise, the Burns Court held that the Rule 32 provision allowing parties to comment on the appropriate sentencenow Rule 32(i)(1)(C)would be render[ed] meaningless unless the defendant were given notice of a contemplated departure.  Id. at 135136.  Any constitutionally protected expectation that a defendant will receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable Guidelines range did not, however, survive United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, which invalidated the Guidelines mandatory features.  Faced with advisory Guidelines, neither the Government nor the defendant may place the same degree of reliance on the type of expectancy that gave rise to a special need for notice in Burns.  Indeed, a sentence outside the Guidelines carries no presumption of unreasonableness.  Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___.  Thus, the due process concerns motivating the Court to require notice in a mandatory Guidelines world no longer provide a basis for extending the Burns rule either through an interpretation of Rule 32(h) itself or through Rule 32(i)(C)(1).  Nor does the rule apply to 18 U. S.C. 3553 variances by its terms.  Although the Guidelines, as the starting point and the initial benchmark, continue to play a role in the sentencing determination, see Gall, 552 U.

Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast seeking to restore a vintage airplane manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC), filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of technical documents related to the airplane.  The FAA denied his request based on FOIAs exemption for trade secrets, see 5 U. S.C. 552(b)(4).  Herrick took an administrative appeal, but when respondent Fairchild, FEACs successor, objected to the documents release, the FAA adhered to its original decision.  Herrick then filed an unsuccessful FOIA lawsuit to secure the documents.  Less than a month after that suit was resolved, petitioner Taylor, Herricks friend and an antique aircraft enthusiast himself, made a FOIA request for the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.  When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Holding the suit barred by claim preclusion, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA and to Fairchild, as intervenor in Taylors action.  The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herricks suit, but held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was virtually represented by a party.  The D.C. Circuit affirmed, announcing a five-factor test for virtual representation.  The first two factors of the D.C. Circuits testidentity of interests and adequate representationare necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.  In addition, at least one of three other factors must be established:a close relationship between the present party and his putative representative, substantial participation by the present party in the first case, or tactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.  The D. C. Circuit acknowledged the absence of any indication that Taylor participated in, or even had notice of, Herricks suit.  It nonetheless found the identity of interests, adequate representation, and close relationship factors satisfied because the two men sought release of the same documents, were close associates, had discussed working together to restore Herricks plane, and had used the same lawyer to pursue their suits.  Because these conditions sufficed to establish virtual representation, the court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in tactical maneuvering to avoid preclusion.
Held:
1.The theory of preclusion by virtual representation is disapproved.  The preclusive effects of a judgment in a federal-question case decided by a federal court should instead be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.  Pp.921.


(a)The preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment is determined by federal common law, subject to due process limitations.  Pp.913.


(1)Extending the preclusive effect of a judgment to a nonparty runs up against the deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.  Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U. S. 793, 798 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indicating the strength of that tradition, this Court has often repeated the general rule that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.  Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U. S. 32, 40.  Pp.910.


(2)The rule against nonparty preclusion is subject to exceptions, grouped for present purposes into six categories.  First, [a] person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the [agreements] terms.  Restatement (Second) of Judgments 40.  Second, nonparty preclusion may be based on a pre-existing substantive legal relationship between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment, e.g., assignee and assignor.  Third, in certain limited circumstances, a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was adequately represented by someone with the same interests who [wa]s a party to the suit.  Richards, 517 U. S., at 798.  Fourth, a nonparty is bound by a judgment if she assume[d] control over the litigation in which that judgment was rendered.  Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147, 154.  Fifth, a party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy.  Preclusion is thus in order when a person who did not participate in litigation later brings suit as the designated representative or agent of a person who was a party to the prior adjudication.  Sixth, a special statutory scheme otherwise consistent with due processe.g., bankruptcy proceedingsmay expressly foreclos[e] successive litigation by nonlitigants.  Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755, 762, n.2.  Pp.1013.


(b)Reaching beyond these six categories, the D.C. Circuit recognized a broad virtual representation exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.  None of the arguments advanced by that court, the FAA, or Fairchild justify such an expansive doctrine.  Pp.1322.


(1)The D.C. Circuit purported to ground its doctrine in this Courts statements that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment.  But the D. C. Circuits definition of adequate representation strayed from the meaning this Court has attributed to that term.  In Richards, the Alabama Supreme Court had held a tax challenge barred by a judgment upholding the same tax in a suit by different taxpayers.  517 U. S., at 795797.  This Court reversed, holding that nonparty preclusion was inconsistent with due process where there was no showing (1) that the court in the first suit took care to protect the interests of absent parties, or (2) that the parties to the first litigation understood their suit to be on behalf of absent [parties], id., at 802.  In holding that representation can be adequate for purposes of nonparty preclusion even where these two factors are absent, the D.C. Circuit misapprehended Richards.  Pp.1415.


(2)Fairchild and the FAA ask this Court to abandon altogether the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules for nonparty preclusion.  Instead, they contend, only an equitable and heavily fact-driven inquiry can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate.  This argument is rejected.  First, respondents balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach advanced by this Courts decisions, which have endeavored to delineate discrete, limited exceptions to the fundamental rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party, see, e.g., Richards, 517 U. S., at 798799.  Second, a partys representation of a nonparty is adequate for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see Hansberry, 311 U. S., at 43, and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the nonpartys interests, see Richards, 517 U. S., at 801802.  Adequate representation may also require (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented.  See id., at 801.  In the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23s procedural safeguards.  But an expansive virtual representation doctrine would recognize a common-law kind of class action shorn of these protections.  Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.  Pp.1519.


(3)Finally, the FAA contends that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in public-law litigation than in private-law controversies.  First, the FAA points to Richards acknowledgment that when a taxpayer challenges an alleged misuse of public funds or other public action, the suit has only an indirect impact on [the plaintiffs] interests, 517 U. S., at 803, and the States have wide latitude to establish procedures [limiting] the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained, ibid.  In contrast to the public-law litigation contemplated in Richards, however, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.  Furthermore, Richards said only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States were free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.  While it appears equally evident that Congress can adopt such procedures, it hardly follows that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.  Second, the FAA argues that, because the number of plaintiffs in public-law cases is potentially limitless, it is theoretically possible for several persons to coordinate a series of vexatious repetitive lawsuits.  But this risk does not justify departing from the usual nonparty preclusion rules.  Stare decisis will allow courts to dispose of repetitive suits in the same circuit, and even when stare decisis is not dispositive, the human inclination not to waste money should discourage suits based on claims or issues already decided.  Pp.1922.


2.The remaining question is whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified based on one of the six the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.  With one exception, those grounds plainly have no application here.  Respondents argue that Taylors suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herricks claim.  That argument justifies a remand to allow the courts below the opportunity to determine whether the fifth ground for nonparty preclusionpreclusion because a nonparty to earlier litigation has brought suit as an agent of a party bound by the prior adjudicationapplies to Taylors suit.  But courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on the basis of agency.  A mere whiff of tactical maneuvering will not suffice; instead, principles of agency law indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agents conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  Finally, the Court rejects Fairchilds suggestion that Taylor must bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herricks agent.  Claim preclusion is an affirmative defense for the defendant to plead and prove.  Pp. 2225.

06-937|"QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., etal. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 06937.Argued January 16, 2008Decided June 9, 2008
The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion limits the patent rights that survive the initial authorized sale of a patented item.  Respondent (LGE) purchased, inter alia, the computer technology patents at issue (LGE Patents): One discloses a system for ensuring that most current data are retrieved from main memory, one relates to the coordination of requests to read from and write to main memory, and one addresses the problem of managing data traffic on a set of wires, or bus, connecting two computer components.  LGE licensed the patents to Intel Corporation (Intel), in an agreement (License Agreement) that authorizes Intel to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets using the LGE Patents (Intel Products) and that does not purport to alter patent exhaustion rules.  A separate agreement (Master Agreement) required Intel to give its customers written notice that the license does not extend to a product made by combining an Intel Product with a non-Intel product, and  provided that a breach of the agreement would not affect the License Agreement.  Petitioner computer manufacturers (Quanta) purchased microprocessors and chipsets from Intel.  Quanta then manufactured computers using Intel parts in combination with non-Intel parts, but did not modify the Intel components.  LGE sued, asserting that this combination infringed the LGE Patents.  The District Court granted Quanta summary judgment, but on reconsideration, denied summary judgment as to the LGE Patents because they contained method claims.  The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, agreeing with the District Court that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not apply to method patents, which describe operations to make or use a product; and concluding, in the alternative, that exhaustion did not apply because LGE did not license Intel to sell the Intel Products to Quanta to combine with non-Intel products.  
Held:Because the doctrine of patent exhaustion applies to method patents, and because the License Agreement authorizes the sale of components that substantially embody the patents in suit, the exhaustion doctrine prevents LGE from further asserting its patent rights with respect to the patents substantially embodied by those products.  Pp.519.
(a)The patent exhaustion doctrine provides that a patented items initial authorized sale terminates all patent rights to that item.  See, e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539.  In the Courts most recent discussion of the doctrine, United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S. 241, patents for finished eyeglass lenses, held by the respondent (Univis), did not survive the sale of lens blanks by the licensed manufacturer to wholesalers and finishing retailers who ground the blanks into patented finished lenses.  The Court assumed that Univis patents were practiced in part by the wholesalers and finishing retailers, concluding that the traditional bar on patent restrictions following an items sale applies when the item sufficiently embodies the patenteven if it does not completely practice the patentsuch that its only and intended use is to be finished under the patents terms.  The parties arguments here are addressed with this patent exhaustion history in mind.  Pp.58.


(b)Nothing in this Courts approach to patent exhaustion supports LGEs argument that method claims, as a category, are never exhaustible.  A patented method may not be sold in the same way as an article or device, but methods nonetheless may be embodied in a product, the sale of which exhausts patent rights.  The Court has repeatedly found method patents exhausted by the sale of an item embodying the method.  See Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309 U. S. 436, 446, 457; Univis, supra, at 248251.  These cases rest on solid footing.  Eliminating exhaustion for method patents would seriously undermine the exhaustion doctrine, since patentees seeking to avoid exhaustion could simply draft their claims to describe a method rather than an apparatus.  On LGEs theory here, for example, although Intel is authorized to sell a completed computer system that practices the LGE Patents, downstream purchasers could be liable for patent infringement, which would violate the longstanding principle that, when a patented item is once lawfully made and sold, there is no restriction on [its] use to be implied for the [patentees] benefit, Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453, 457.  Pp.911.


(c)The Intel Products embodied the patents here.  Univis governs this case.  There, exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention, 316 U. S., at 249251.  Each of those attributes is shared by the microprocessors and chipsets Intel sold to Quanta under the License Agreement.  First, LGE has suggested no reasonable use for the Intel Products other than incorporating them into computer systems that practice the LGE Patents: A microprocessor or chipset cannot function until it is connected to buses and memory.  And as in Univis, the only apparent object of Intels sales was to permit Quanta to incorporate the Intel Products into computers that would practice the patents.  Second, like the Univis lens blanks, the Intel Products constitute a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practice the patent.  The only step necessary to practice the patent is the application of common processes or the addition of standard parts.  Everything inventive about each patent is embodied in the Intel Products.  LGEs attempts to distinguish Univis are unavailing.  Pp.1116.


(d)Intels sale to Quanta exhausted LGEs patent rights.  Exhaustion is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder.  Univis, supra, at 249.  LGE argues that this sale was not authorized because the License Agreement does not permit Intel to sell its products for use in combination with non-Intel products to practice the LGE Patents.  But the License Agreement does not restrict Intels right to sell its products to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts.  Intel was required to give its customers notice that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents, but neither party contends that Intel breached that agreement.  In any event, the notice provision is in the Master Agreement, and LGE does not suggest that a breach of that agreement would constitute a License Agreement breach.  Contrary to LGEs position, the question whether third parties may have received implied licenses is irrelevant, because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion, and exhaustion turns only on Intels own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.  LGEs alternative argument, invoking the principle that patent exhaustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on making an article, is simply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel Products with other components adds more than standard finishing to complete a patented article.  Pp.1618.

But the License Agreement does not restrict Intels right to sell its products to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts.  Intel was required to give its customers notice that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents, but neither party contends that Intel breached that agreement.  In any event, the notice provision is in the Master Agreement, and LGE does not suggest that a breach of that agreement would constitute a License Agreement breach.  Contrary to LGEs position, the question whether third parties may have received implied licenses is irrelevant, because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion, and exhaustion turns only on Intels own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.  LGEs alternative argument, invoking the principle that patent exhaustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on making an article, is simply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel Products with other components adds more than standard finishing to complete a patented article.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 07210.Argued April 14, 2008Decided June 9, 2008
Each year the Cook County Treasurers Office holds a public auction to sell its tax liens on delinquent taxpayers property.  To prevent any one buyer from obtaining a disproportionate share of the liens, the county adopted the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule (Rule), which requires each buyer to submit bids in its own name, prohibits a buyer from using apparent agents, employees, or related entities to submit simultaneous bids for the same parcel, and requires a registered bidder to submit a sworn affidavit affirming its compliance with the Rule.  Petitioners and respondents regularly participate in the tax sales.  Respondents filed suit, alleging that petitioners fraudulently obtained a disproportionate share of liens by filing false compliance attestations.  As relevant here, they claim that petitioners violated and conspired to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) through a pattern of racketeering activity involving mail fraud, which occurred when petitioners sent property owners various notices required by Illinois law.  The District Court dismissed the RICO claims for lack of standing, finding that respondents were not protected by the mail fraud statute because they did not receive the alleged misrepresentations.  Reversing, the Seventh Circuit based standing on the injury respondents suffered when they lost the chance to obtain more liens, and found that respondents had sufficiently alleged proximate cause because they were immediately injured by petitioners scheme.  The court also rejected petitioners argument that respondents are not entitled to relief under RICO because they had not received, and therefore had not relied on, any false statements.
Held:A plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendants alleged misrepresentations.  Pp.621.
(a)In 18 U. S.C. 1964(c), RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages to [a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation, as pertinent here, of 1962(c), which makes it unlawful for any person employed by or associated with a qualifying enterprise to conduct or participate  in the conduct of such enterprises affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, including mail fraud, 1961(1)(B).  Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, uses the mail for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice.  1341.  The gravamen of the offense is the scheme to defraud, and any mailing  incident to an essential part of the scheme  satisfies the mailing element, Schmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705, 712, even if the mailing contain[s] no false information, id., at 715.  Once the relationship among these statutory provisions is understood, respondents theory of the case is straightforward.  Petitioners nonetheless argue that because the alleged pattern of racketeering activity is predicated on mail fraud, respondents must show that they relied on petitioners fraudulent misrepresentations, which they cannot do because the misrepresentations were made to the county.  Nothing on the statutes face imposes such a requirement.  Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate racketeering act under RICO, even if no one relied on any misrepresentation, see Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 2425; and one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying enterprise through a pattern of such acts without anyone relying on a fraudulent misrepresentation.  Thus, no reliance showing is required to establish that a person has violated 1962(c) by conducting an enterprises affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity predicated on mail fraud.  Nor can a first-party reliance requirement be derived from 1964(c), which, by providing a right of action to [a]ny person injured by a violation of 1962, suggests a breadth of coverage not easily reconciled with an implicit first-party reliance requirement.  Moreover, a person can be injured by reason of a pattern of mail fraud even if he has not relied on any misrepresentations.  For example, accepting respondents allegations as true, they were harmed by petitioners scheme when they lost valuable liens they otherwise would have been awarded.  Pp.610.


(b)None of petitioners argumentsthat under the common-law meaning rule, Congress should be presumed to have made reliance an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on a violation of the mail fraud statute; that a plaintiff bringing a RICO claim based on mail fraud must show reliance on the defendants misrepresentations in order to establish proximate cause; and that RICO should be interpreted to require first-party reliance for fraud-based claims in order to avoid the overfederalization of traditional state-law claimspersuades this Court to read a first-party reliance requirement into a statute that by its terms suggests none.  Pp.1021.

07-214|"ALLISON ENGINE CO., INC., etal. v. UNITED STATES ex rel. SANDERS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit
No. 07214.Argued February 26, 2008Decided June 9, 2008
The Navy contracted with two shipyards to build destroyers, each of which needed generator sets (Gen-Sets) for electrical power.  The shipyards subcontracted with petitioner Allison Engine Company, Inc. (Allison Engine), to build Gen-Sets, Allison Engine subcontracted with petitioner General Tool Company (GTC) to assemble them, and GTC subcontracted with petitioner Southern Ohio Fabricators, Inc. (SOFCO), to manufacture Gen-Set bases and enclosures.  The subcontracts required that each Gen-Set be accompanied by a certificate of conformance (COC) certifying that the unit was manufactured according to Navy specifications.  All of the funds paid under the contracts ultimately came from the U. S. Treasury.  


Former GTC employees Sanders and Thacker (hereinafter respondents) brought this qui tam suit seeking to recover damages from petitioners under the False Claims Act (FCA), which, inter alia, imposes civil liability on any person who knowingly uses a false  statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government, 31 U. S.C. 3729(a)(2), or who conspires to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid, 3729(a)(3).  At trial, respondents introduced evidence that petitioners had issued COCs falsely stating that their work was completed in compliance with Navy specifications and that they had presented invoices for payment to the shipyards.  They did not, however, introduce the invoices the shipyards submitted to the Navy.  The District Court granted petitioners judgment as a matter of law, concluding that, absent proof that false claims were presented to the Government, respondents evidence was legally insufficient under the FCA.  The Sixth Circuit reversed in relevant part, holding, among other things, that respondents 3729(a)(2) and (3) claims did not require proof of an intent to cause a false claim to be paid by the Government; proof of an intent to cause such a claim to be paid by a private entity using Government funds was sufficient.  
Held: 
1.It is insufficient for a plaintiff asserting a 3729(a)(2) claim to show merely that the false statements use resulted in payment or approval of the claim or that Government money was used to pay the false or fraudulent claim.  Instead, such a plaintiff must prove that the defendant intended that the false statement be material to the Governments decision to pay or approve the false claim.  Pp.58.


(a)The Sixth Circuits interpretation of 3729(a)(2) impermissibly deviates from the statutes language, which requires the defendant to make a false statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government.  Because to get denotes purpose, a person must have the purpose of getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government in order to be liable.  Moreover, getting such a claim paid  by the Government is not the same as getting it paid using government funds.  Under 3729(a)(2), a defendant must intend for the Government itself to pay the claim.  Eliminating this element of intent would expand the FCA well beyond its intended role of combating fraud against the Government. Rainwater v. United States, 356 U. S. 590, 592.  Pp.56. 


(b)The Governments contention that paid  by the Government does not mean literal Government payment is unpersuasive.  The assertion that it is customary to say that the Government pays a bill when a recipient of Government funds uses those funds to pay involves a colloquial usage of the phrase paid by that is not customarily employed in statutory drafting, where precision is important and expected.  Section 3729(c)s definition of claim does not support the Governments argument.  The definition allows a request to be a claim even if it is not made directly to the Government, but, under 3729(a)(2), it is necessary that the defendant intend that a claim be paid by the Government, not by another entity.  Pp.67. 


(c)This does not mean, however, that 3729(a)(2) requires proof that a defendants false statement was submitted to the Government.  Because the section requires only that the defendant make the false statement for the purpose of getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government, a subcontractor violates 3729(a)(2) if it submits a false statement to the prime contractor intending that contractor to use the statement to get the Government to pay its claim.  However, if a subcontractor makes a false statement to a private entity but does not intend for the Government to rely on the statement as a condition of payment, the direct link between the statement and the Governments decision to pay or approve a false claim is too attenuated to establish liability.  The Courts reading gives effect to Congress efforts to protect the Government from loss due to fraud but also ensures that a defendant is not answerable for anything beyond the natural, ordinary, and reasonable consequences of his conduct.  Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U. S. 451, 470.  Pp.79.  


2.Similarly, it is not enough under 3729(a)(3) for a plaintiff to show that the alleged conspirators agreed upon a fraud scheme that had the effect of causing a private entity to make payments using money obtained from the Government.  Instead, it must be shown that they intended to defraud the Government.  Where their alleged conduct involved the making of a false statement, it need not be shown that they intended the statement to be presented directly to the Government, but it must be established that they agreed that the statement would have a material effect on the Governments decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.  Pp.810.

07-474|"ENGQUIST v. OREGON DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07474.Argued April 21, 2008Decided June 9, 2008
Petitioner Engquist, an Oregon public employee, filed suit against respondentsher agency, her supervisor, and a co-workerasserting, inter alia, claims under the Equal Protection Clause:She alleged she had been discriminated against based on her race, sex, and national origin, and she also brought a so-called class-of-one claim, alleging that she was fired not because she was a member of an identified class (unlike her race, sex, and national origin claims), but simply for arbitrary, vindictive, and malicious reasons.  The jury rejected the class-membership equal protection claims, but found for Engquist on her class-of-one claim.  The Ninth Circuit reversed in relevant part.  Although recognizing that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal protection challenge to state legislative and regulatory action in Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U. S. 562, the court below emphasized that this Court has routinely afforded government greater leeway when it acts as employer rather than regulator.  The Court concluded that extending the class-of-one theory to the public-employment context would lead to undue judicial interference in state employment practices and invalidate public at-will employment.    
Held:The class-of-one theory of equal protection does not apply in the public employment context.  Pp.416.
(a)There is a crucial difference between the government exercising the power to regulate or license, as lawmaker, and acting as proprietor, to manage [its] internal operation.  Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896.  Thus, in the public-employment context, the Court has recognized that government has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than in bringing its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.  See, e.g., OConnor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 721722.  The relevant precedent establishes two main principles: First, government employees do not lose their constitutional rights when they go to work, but those rights must be balanced against the realities of the employment context.  See, e.g., id., at 721.  Second, in striking the appropriate balance, the Court considers whether the claimed employee right implicates the relevant constitutional provisions basic concerns, or whether the right can more readily give way to the requirements of the government as employer.  See, e.g., Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138.  Pp.48. 


(b)The Courts equal protection jurisprudence has typically been concerned with governmental classifications that affect some groups of citizens differently than others.  McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425.  Olech did recognize that a class-of-one equal protection claim can in some circumstances be sustained.  Its recognition of that theory, however, was not so much a departure from the principle that the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with arbitrary government classification, as it was an application of that principle to the facts in that case: The government singled Olech out with regard to its regulation of property, and the cases upon which the Court relied concerned property assessment and taxation schemes that were applied in a singular way to particular citizens.  What seems to have been significant in Olech and the cited cases was the existence of a clear standard against which departures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed.  This differential treatment raised a concern of arbitrary classification, and therefore required that the State provide a rational basis for it.  There are some forms of state action, however, which by their nature involve discretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective, individualized assessments.  In such cases treating like individuals differently is an accepted consequence of the discretion granted to governmental officials.  This principle applies most clearly in the employment context, where decisions are often subjective and individualized, resting on a wide array of factors that are difficult to articulate and quantify.  Unlike the context of arms-length regulation, such as in Olech, treating seemingly similarly situated individuals differently in the employment context is par for the course.  It is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective and individualized decision that it was subjective and individualized.  That the Court has never found the Equal Protection Clause implicated in this area is not surprising, given the historical understanding of the at-will nature of government employment.  See, e.g., Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896.  Recognition of a claim that the State treated an employee differently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all, is simply contrary to the at-will concept.  The Constitution does not require repudiating that familiar doctrine.  Finally, the Court is guided, as in the past, by the common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.  Connick, supra, at 143.  If class-of-one claims were recognized in the employment context, any personnel action in which a wronged employee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment would suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional claim.  The Equal Protection Clause does not require [t]his displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.  Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 423.  Pp.816.
478 F.3d 985, affirmed.

It is no proper challenge to what in its nature is a subjective and individualized decision that it was subjective and individualized.  That the Court has never found the Equal Protection Clause implicated in this area is not surprising, given the historical understanding of the at-will nature of government employment.  See, e.g., Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896.  Recognition of a claim that the State treated an employee differently from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all, is simply contrary to the at-will concept.  The Constitution does not require repudiating that familiar doctrine.  Finally, the Court is guided, as in the past, by the common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.  Connick, supra, at 143.  If class-of-one claims were recognized in the employment context, any personnel action in which a wronged employee can conjure up a claim of differential treatment would suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional claim.  The Equal Protection Clause does not require [t]his displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.  Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 423.  Pp.816.

06-1005|"UNITED STATES v. SANTOS etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 061005.Argued October 3, 2007Decided June 2, 2008
In an illegal lottery run by respondent Santos, runners took commissions from the bets they gathered, and some of the rest of the money was paid as salary to respondent Diaz and other collectors and to the winning gamblers.  Based on these payments to runners, collectors, and winners, Santos was convicted of, inter alia, violating the federal money-laundering statute, 18 U. S.C. 1956, which prohibits the use of the proceeds of criminal activities for various purposes, including engaging in, and conspiring to engage in, transactions intended to promote the carrying on of unlawful activity, 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and 1956(h).  Based on his receipt of salary, Diaz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed the convictions.  On collateral review, the District Court ruled that, under intervening Circuit precedent interpreting the word proceeds in the federal money-laundering statute, 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) applies only to transactions involving criminal profits, not criminal receipts.  Finding no evidence that the transactions on which respondents money-laundering convictions were based involved lottery profits, the court vacated those convictions.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
461 F.3d 886, affirmed. 
Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Parts IIII and V that the term proceeds in 1956(a)(1) means profits, not receipts.  Pp.314, 1617.


(a)The rule of lenity dictates adoption of the profits reading.  The statute nowhere defines proceeds.  An undefined term is generally given its ordinary meaning.  Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187.  However, dictionaries and the Federal Criminal Code sometimes define proceeds to mean receipts and sometimes profits.  Moreover, the many provisions in the federal money-laundering statute that use the word proceeds make sense under either definition.  The rule of lenity therefore requires the statute to be interpreted in favor of defendants, and the profits definition of proceeds is always more defendant-friendly than the receipts definition.  Pp. 36.


(b)The Governments contention that the profits interpretation fails to give the money-laundering statute its intended scope begs the question; the Governments contention that the profits interpretation hinders effective enforcement of the law is exaggerated.  Neither suffices to overcome the rule of lenity.  Pp. 614.


(c)None of the transactions on which respondents money-laundering convictions were based can fairly be characterized as involving the lotterys profits.  Pp.1617.  


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part IV that Justice Stevens position that proceeds should be interpreted to mean profits for some predicate crimes, receipts for others, is contrary to this Courts precedents holding that judges cannot give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases, see Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371.  Pp.1416.


Justice Stevens concluded that revenue a gambling business uses to pay essential operating expenses is not proceeds under 18 U. S.C. 1956.  When, as here, Congress fails to define potentially ambiguous statutory terms, it effectively delegates the task to federal judges.  See Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104.  Because Congress could have required that proceeds have one meaning when referring to some of the specified unlawful activities listed in 1956(c)(7) and a different meaning when referring to others, judges filling statutory gaps may also do so, as long as they are conscientiously endeavoring to carry out Congress intent.  Section 1956s legislative history makes clear that proceeds includes gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales, but sheds no light on how to identify the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gambling venture.  Furthermore, the consequences of applying a gross receipts definition of proceeds to respondents are so perverse that Congress could not have contemplated them: Allowing the Government to treat the mere payment of an illegal gambling business operating expenses as a separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business.  Accordingly, the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination, and in that respect the pluralitys opinion is persuasive.  Pp.16.

06-1456|"REGALADO CUELLAR v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 061456.Argued February 25, 2008Decided June 2, 2008
Arrested after a search of the car he was driving through Texas toward Mexico revealed nearly $81,000 bundled in plastic bags and covered with animal hair in a secret compartment under the rear floorboard, petitioner was charged with, and convicted of, attempting to transport funds from a place in the United States to  a place outside the United States  knowing that the  funds  represent the proceeds of  unlawful activity and  that such transportation  is designed  to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of  the money, in violation of the federal money laundering statute, 18 U. S.C. 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).  Affirming, the Fifth Circuit rejected as inconsistent with the statutory text petitioners argument that the Government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, but held that his extensive efforts to prevent the funds detection during transportation showed that he sought to conceal or disguise their nature, location, source, ownership, or control.    
Held:Although 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) does not require proof that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, neither can it be satisfied solely by evidence that the funds were concealed during transport.  The statutory text makes clear that a conviction requires proof that the transportations purposenot merely its effectwas to conceal or disguise one of the listed attributes: the funds nature, location, source, ownership, or control.  Pp.517.
(a)The statute contains no appearance of legitimate wealth requirement.  Although petitioner is correct that taking steps to make funds appear legitimate is the common meaning of money laundering, this Court must be guided by a statutes words, not by its titles common meaning, to the extent they are inconsistent, see Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212.  Here, Congress used broad language that captures more than classic money laundering: In addition to concealing or disguising the nature or source of illegal funds, Congress also sought to reach transportation designed to conceal or disguise the funds location, ownership, or control.  Nor does the Court find persuasive petitioners attempt to infuse a money-laundering requirement into the listed attributes.  Only the attribute nature is coextensive with the funds illegitimate character, but that does not mean that Congress intended nature to swallow the other attributes.  The Court is likewise skeptical of petitioners argument that violating the statutes elements would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate than they did before.  It is not necessarily true that concealing or disguising any one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the funds appear more legitimate by impeding law enforcements ability to identify illegitimate funds.  Finally, the Court disagrees with petitioners argument that 1956(a)(2) must be aimed at something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds because that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling statute, 31 U. S.C. 5332.  Even if 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) has no appearance of legitimate wealth requirement, the two statutes nonetheless target distinct conduct, in that 5332(a)(1) encompasses, inter alios, a defendant who, with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement  , knowingly conceals more than $10,000  and transports [it] from  the United States to a place outside the country.  Pp.69.


(b)The evidence that petitioner concealed the money during transportation is not sufficient to sustain his conviction.  In determining whether he knew that such transportation, 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), was designed to conceal or disguise the specified attributes of the illegally obtained funds, the critical transportation was not the transportation of the funds within this country on the way to the border, but transportation from a place in the United States to  a place outside the United States, ibid.here, from this country to Mexico.  Therefore, what the Government had to prove was that petitioner knew that taking the funds to Mexico was designed, at least in part, to conceal or disguise their nature, location, source, ownership, or control.  The Court agrees with petitioner that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute, even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money.  This conclusion turns on 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)s text, particularly the term design, which the dictionaries show means purpose or plan; i.e., the transportations intended aim.  Congress wrote knowing that such transportation is designed  to conceal or disguise a listed attribute, and when an act is designed to do something, the most natural reading is that it has that something as its purpose.  Because the Fifth Circuit used design to refer not to the transportations purpose but to the manner in which it was carried out, its use of the term in this context was consistent with the alternate meaning of design as structure or arrangement.  It is implausible, however, that Congress intended this meaning.  If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing knowing that such transportation conceals or disguises, rather than the more complex formulation knowing that such transportation  is designed  to conceal or disguise.  1956(a)(2)(B)(i).  It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to focus exclusively on how a defendant structured the transportation.  In addition, the structural meaning of design is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would capture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid illicit funds en route to turn them over to law enforcement); yet it would exclude individuals who fully intended to move the funds in order to impede detection by law enforcement but failed to hide them during transport.  


In this case, evidence that petitioner transported the cash bundled in plastic bags and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair was plainly probative of an underlying goal to prevent the funds detection during the drive into Mexico.  However, even with the abundant evidence that petitioner had concealed the money in order to transport it, the Governments own expert testified that the transportations purpose was to compensate the Mexican leaders of the operation.  Thus, the evidence suggested that the transportations secretive aspects were employed to facilitate it, but not necessarily that secrecy was its purpose.  Because petitioners extensive efforts to conceal the funds en route to Mexico was the only evidence the Government introduced to prove that the transportation was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the [funds] nature,  location,  source,  ownership, or  control, petitioners conviction cannot stand.

06-1717|"RICHLIN SECURITY SERVICE CO. v. CHERTOFF, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 061717.Argued March 19, 2008Decided June 2, 2008
After prevailing against the Government on a claim originating in the Department of Transportations Board of Contract Appeals, petitioner (Richlin) filed an application with the Board for reimbursement of attorneys fees, expenses, and costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  The Board concluded, inter alia, that Richlin was not entitled to recover paralegal fees at the rates at which it was billed by its law firm, holding that EAJA limited such recovery to the attorneys cost, which was lower than the billed rate.  In affirming, the Federal Circuit concluded that the term fees, for which EAJA authorizes recovery at prevailing market rates, embraces only the fees of attorneys, experts, and agents.
Held:A prevailing party that satisfies EAJAs other requirements may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates.  Pp.418.
(a)EAJA permits a prevailing party to recover fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with administrative proceedings, 5 U. S.C. 504(a)(1), including the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project  , and reasonable attorney or agent fees, and bases the amount of such fees on prevailing market rates, 504(b)(1)(A).  Because Richlin incurred fees for paralegal services in connection with its action before the Board, a straightforward reading of the statute demonstrates that Richlin was entitled to recover fees for the paralegal services it purchased at the market rate for such services.  The Governments contrary readingthat expenditures for paralegal services are other expenses recoverable only at reasonable costis unpersuasive.  Section 504(b)(1)(A) does not clearly distinguish between the rates at which fees and other expenses are reimbursed.  Even if the statutory text supported the Governments dichotomy, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as expenses rather than as fees.  Paralegals are surely more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects.  Even if the Court agreed that EAJA limited paralegal fees to reasonable cost, it would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the partys attorney rather than the client.  By providing that an agency shall award a prevailing party fees and other expenses  incurred by that party (emphasis added), 504(a)(1) leaves no doubt that Congress intended the reasonable cost of 504(b)(1)(A)s items to be calculated from the litigants perspective.  It is unlikely that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from their employers perspective.  It seems more plausible that Congress intended all fees and other expenses to be recoverable at the litigants reasonable cost, subject to the proviso that reasonable cost would be deemed to be prevailing market rates when such rates could be determined.  Pp.48.


(b)To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, this Court need look no further to resolve it than Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, where the Court addressed a similar question with respect to the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act of 1976which provides that a court may allow the prevailing party  a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs, 42 U. S.C. 1988finding it self-evident that attorneys fee embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys, 491 U. S., at 285.  EAJA, like 1988, entitles certain parties to recover reasonable attorney  fees, 504(b)(1)(A), and makes no mention of the paralegals, secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client, 491 U. S., at 285.  Thus, EAJA, like 1988, must be interpreted as using the term attorney  fees to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorneys personal labor, making self-evident that Congress intended that term to embrace paralegal fees.  Since 504 generally provides for recovery of attorneys fees at prevailing market rates, it follows that paralegal fees must also be recoverable at those rates.  The Governments contention that Jenkins found paralegal fees recoverable as attorneys fee[s] because 1988 authorized no other recoverable expenses finds no support in Jenkins itself, which turned not on extratextual policy goals, but on the self-evident proposition that attorneys fee[s] had historically included paralegal fees.  Indeed, this Court rejected the Governments interpretation of Jenkins in West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, concluding that a petitioner seeking expert witness fees under 1988 could not rely on Jenkins for the proposition that 1988s broad remedial purposes allowed recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute.  Pp.811.


(c)Even assuming that some residual ambiguity in the statutory text justified resorting to extratextual authorities, the legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlins interpretation.  Pp.1118. 
472 F.3d 1370, reversed and remanded.

Even if the statutory text supported the Governments dichotomy, it would hardly follow that amounts billed for paralegal services should be classified as expenses rather than as fees.  Paralegals are surely more analogous to attorneys, experts, and agents than to studies, analyses, reports, tests, and projects.  Even if the Court agreed that EAJA limited paralegal fees to reasonable cost, it would not follow that the cost should be measured from the perspective of the partys attorney rather than the client.  By providing that an agency shall award a prevailing party fees and other expenses  incurred by that party (emphasis added), 504(a)(1) leaves no doubt that Congress intended the reasonable cost of 504(b)(1)(A)s items to be calculated from the litigants perspective.  It is unlikely that Congress, without even mentioning paralegals, intended to make an exception of them by calculating their cost from their employers perspective.  It seems more plausible that Congress intended all fees and other expenses to be recoverable at the litigants reasonable cost, subject to the proviso that reasonable cost would be deemed to be prevailing market rates when such rates could be determined.  Pp.48.


(b)To the extent that some ambiguity subsists in the statutory text, this Court need look no further to resolve it than Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, where the Court addressed a similar question with respect to the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act of 1976which provides that a court may allow the prevailing party  a reasonable attorneys fee as part of the costs, 42 U. S.C. 1988finding it self-evident that attorneys fee embraced the fees of paralegals as well as attorneys, 491 U. S., at 285.  EAJA, like 1988, entitles certain parties to recover reasonable attorney  fees, 504(b)(1)(A), and makes no mention of the paralegals, secretaries, messengers, librarians, janitors, and others whose labor contributes to the work product for which an attorney bills her client, 491 U. S., at 285.  Thus, EAJA, like 1988, must be interpreted as using the term attorney  fees to reach fees for paralegal services as well as compensation for the attorneys personal labor, making self-evident that Congress intended that term to embrace paralegal fees.  Since 504 generally provides for recovery of attorneys fees at prevailing market rates, it follows that paralegal fees must also be recoverable at those rates.  The Governments contention that Jenkins found paralegal fees recoverable as attorneys fee[s] because 1988 authorized no other recoverable expenses finds no support in Jenkins itself, which turned not on extratextual policy goals, but on the self-evident proposition that attorneys fee[s] had historically included paralegal fees.  Indeed, this Court rejected the Governments interpretation of Jenkins in West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, concluding that a petitioner seeking expert witness fees under 1988 could not rely on Jenkins for the proposition that 1988s broad remedial purposes allowed recovery of fees not expressly authorized by statute.  Pp.811.


(c)Even assuming that some residual ambiguity in the statutory text justified resorting to extratextual authorities, the legislative history cited by the Government does not address the question presented and policy considerations actually counsel in favor of Richlins interpretation.  Pp.1118.

06-1321|"GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER, POSTMASTER GENERAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 061321.Argued February 19, 2008Decided May 27, 2008
Petitioner, a 45-year-old postal worker, filed suit claiming that her employer had violated the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S.C. 633a(a)which requires that [a]ll personnel actions affecting employees  at least 40 years of age  be made free from any discrimination based on ageby subjecting her to various forms of retaliation after she filed an administrative ADEA complaint.  The District Court granted respondent summary judgment.  The First Circuit affirmed on the ground that 633a(a)s prohibition of discrimination based on age does not cover retaliation.  
Held:Section 633a(a) prohibits retaliation against a federal employee who complains of age discrimination.  Pp.316.
(a)In so concluding, the Court follows the reasoning of two prior decisions ruling that retaliation is covered by similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes.  First, in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229, 237, the Court held that a retaliation claim could be brought under 42 U. S.C. 1982, which provides that [a]ll citizens  shall have the same right  as is enjoyed by white citizens  to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.  While 1982 does not use the phrase discrimination based on race, that is its plain meaning.  See, e.g., Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 177.  Second, the Jackson Court, id., at 173174, relied on Sullivan in holding that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S.C. 1681(a), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs receiving federal aid, reached retaliation against a public school teacher for complaining about sex discrimination in his schools athletic program.  544 U. S., at 176177.  The ADEA language at issue (discrimination based on age) is not materially different from the language at issue in Jackson and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in Sullivan, see Jackson, supra, at 177.  And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases: remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.  Respondent neither asks the Court to overrule Sullivan or Jackson nor questions those decisions reasoning, and the Government, both in Jackson and in CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, p. ___, has specifically urged the Court to follow Sullivans reasoning.  Pp.36. 


(b)The three grounds on which the First Circuit sought to distinguish Jackson in support of the Circuits perception that there is a clear difference between causes of action for discrimination and for retaliation are not persuasive.  Pp.69.


(1)The Circuit places too much reliance on the fact that the ADEA expressly creates a private right of action, whereas the right of action under Title IX, the statute at issue in Jackson, is implied and not express, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677.  The assertion that this distinction allowed the Jackson Court greater leeway to adopt an expansive interpretation of Title IX improperly conflates the analytically distinct questions whether a statute confers a private right of action and whether the statutes substantive prohibition reaches a particular form of conduct.  Moreover, confusing these questions would lead to exceedingly strange results.  For example, Title IXs prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex either does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a private right of action cannot alter 1681(a)s scope.  Pp.67. 


(2)Also unavailing is the Circuits attempt to distinguish Jackson on the ground that retaliation claims play a more important role under Title IX than under the ADEA.  This argument ignores the basis for Jackson, which did not hold that Title IX prohibits retaliation because such claims are important as a policy matter, but, instead, relied on an interpretation of the text of Title IX.  544 U. S., at 173, 178.  Jacksons statement that teachers  are often in the best position to vindicate [student] rights, id., at 181, did not address the question whether the statutory term discrimination encompasses retaliation, but was made in response to the school boards argument that only a victim of the discrimination, not third parties, should be allowed to assert a retaliation claim, id., at 179182.  P.8. 


(3)Finally, the Circuits attempt to distinguish Jackson on the ground that Title IX was adopted in response to Sullivan, whereas there is no evidence in the ADEAs legislative history that 633a was adopted in a similar context, is rejected.  Jackson did not identify any legislative history evidence, but merely observed that because Congress enacted Title IX just three years after Sullivan, it was realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan] and  expected [Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].  544 U. S., at 176.  What Jackson said about the relationship between Sullivan and Title IXs enactment can also be said about the relationship between Sullivan and 633as enactment, since the latter provision was enacted just five years after Sullivan was decided and two years after Title IX was enacted.  Pp.89.  


(c)Respondents other arguments supporting the contention that 633a(a) does not encompass retaliation claims are rejected.  Pp.1016. 


(1)Respondent places too much reliance on the presence of an ADEA provision specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals complaining about private-sector age discrimination, 623(d), and the absence of a similar provision in 633a.  Because 623 and 633a were enacted seven years apart rather than simultaneously, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330, and because they are couched in very different termswith 623(a)(1)(3) listing specific forbidden employer practices in contrast to 633a(a)s broad prohibition of discriminationthe absence of a federal-sector provision similar to 623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart from Sullivan and Jackson.  Pp.1012. 


(2)There is even less merit in respondents reliance on 633a(f), which provides that personnel actions by a federal entity covered by 633a shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter other than 633a and 631(b), which restricts ADEA coverage to persons at least 40 years old.  Respondents contention that recognizing federal-sector retaliation claims would make 623(d) applicable to federal-sector employers in contravention of 633a(f) is unsound because the Courts holding today is not based on 623(d) but on 633a(a) itself, unaffected by other [ADEA] sections, Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 168.  P.13. 


(3)Also unavailing is respondents argument that the history of congressional and Executive Branch responses to discrimination in federal employment demonstrates that when Congress enacted 633a, it anticipated that the pre-existing reprisal regulations of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) would be extended to cover federal-sector age discrimination and be the exclusive avenue for asserting retaliation claims.  This argument is not supported by direct evidence, but rests on unsupported speculation, and, in any event, is self-contradictory in that, if 633a(a) does not confer an antiretaliation right, there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the CSC to issue new regulations prohibiting retaliation.  Pp.1314. 


(4)Respondents final argumentthat sovereign immunity principles require that 633a(a) be read narrowly as prohibiting substantive age discrimination but not retaliationis unpersuasive.  The rule of construction requiring that [a] waiver of the Federal Governments sovereign immunity  be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and strictly construed  in favor of the sovereign, Lane v. Pe&nacute;a, 518 U. S. 187, 192, is satisfied here by 633a(c), which unequivocally waives sovereign immunity for a claim brought by [a]ny person aggrieved by a 633a violation.  Unlike 663a(c), 633a(a) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing discrimination.  That the 633a(c) waiver applies to 633a(a) claims does not mean that 633a(a) must surmount the same high hurdle as 633a(c).  Pp.1516.  
476 F.3d 54, reversed and remanded.

06-1431|"CBOCS WEST, INC. v. HUMPHRIES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 061431.Argued February 20, 2008Decided May 27, 2008
Claiming that petitioner CBOCS West, Inc., dismissed him because he is black and because he complained to managers that a black co-employee was also dismissed for race-based reasons, respondent Humphries filed suit charging that CBOCS actions violated both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U. S.C. 1981, the latter of which gives [a]ll persons  the same right  to make and enforce contracts  as is enjoyed by white citizens.  The District Court dismissed the Title VII claims for failure to timely pay filing fees and granted CBOCS summary judgment on the 1981 claims.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed on the direct discrimination claim, but remanded for a trial on Humphries 1981 retaliation claim, rejecting CBOCS argument that 1981 did not encompass such a claim.  
Held:Section 1981 encompasses retaliation claims.  Pp.214.
(a)Because this conclusion rests in significant part upon stare decisis principles, the Court examines the pertinent interpretive history.  (1) In 1969, Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229, 237, as later interpreted and relied on by Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 176, recognized that retaliation actions are encompassed by 42 U. S.C. 1982, which provides that [a]ll citizens  shall have the same right,  , as is enjoyed by white citizens  to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.  (2) This Court has long interpreted 1981 and 1982 alike because they were enacted together, have common language, and serve the same purpose of providing black citizens the same legal rights as enjoyed by other citizens.  See, e.g., Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 183, 197, 190.  (3) In 1989, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 177, without mention of retaliation, narrowed 1981 by excluding from its scope conduct occurring after formation of the employment contract, where retaliation would most likely be found.  Subsequently, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which was designed to supersede Patterson, see Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U. S. 369, 383, by explicitly defining 1981s scope to include post-contract-formation conduct, 1981(b).  (4) Since 1991, the Federal Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted 1981 as encompassing retaliation actions.  Sullivan, as interpreted by Jackson, as well as a long line of related cases where the Court construes 1981 and 1982 similarly, lead to the conclusion that the view that 1981 encompasses retaliation claims is well embedded in the law.  Stare decisis considerations strongly support the Courts adherence to  that view.  Such considerations impose a considerable burden on those who would seek a different interpretation that would necessarily unsettle many Court precedents.  Pp.28.


(b)CBOCS several arguments, taken separately or together, cannot justify a departure from this well-embedded interpretation of 1981.  First, while CBOCS is correct that 1981s plain text does not expressly refer to retaliation, that alone is not sufficient to carry the day, given this Courts long recognition that 1982 provides protection against retaliation; Jacksons recent holding that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 includes an antiretaliation remedy, despite Title IXs failure to use the word retaliation, 544 U. S., at 173174, 176; and Sullivans refusal to embrace a similar argument, see 396 U. S., at 241.  Second, contrary to CBOCS assertion, Congress failure to include an explicit antiretaliation provision in its 1991 amendment of 1981 does not demonstrate an intention not to cover retaliation, but is more plausibly explained by the fact that, given Sullivan and the new statutory language nullifying Patterson, there was no need to include explicit retaliation language.  Third, the argument that applying 1981 to employment-related retaliation actions would create an overlap with Title VII, allegedly allowing a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent Title VIIs detailed administrative and procedural mechanisms and thereby undermine their effectiveness, proves too much.  Precisely the same kind of Title VII/1981 overlap and potential circumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct discrimination, yet Congress explicitly and intentionally created that overlap, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, 4849.  Fourth, contrary to its arguments, CBOCS cannot find support in Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 63, and Dominos Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U. S. 470.  While Burlington distinguished discrimination based on status (e.g., as women or black persons) from discrimination based on conduct (e.g., whistle-blowing that leads to retaliation), it did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.  Moreover, while Dominos Pizza and other more recent cases may place greater emphasis on statutory language than did Sullivan, any arguable change in interpretive approach would not justify reexamination of well-established prior law under stare decisis principles.  Pp.914. 
474 F.3d 387, affirmed.

Second, contrary to CBOCS assertion, Congress failure to include an explicit antiretaliation provision in its 1991 amendment of 1981 does not demonstrate an intention not to cover retaliation, but is more plausibly explained by the fact that, given Sullivan and the new statutory language nullifying Patterson, there was no need to include explicit retaliation language.  Third, the argument that applying 1981 to employment-related retaliation actions would create an overlap with Title VII, allegedly allowing a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent Title VIIs detailed administrative and procedural mechanisms and thereby undermine their effectiveness, proves too much.  Precisely the same kind of Title VII/1981 overlap and potential circumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct discrimination, yet Congress explicitly and intentionally created that overlap, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, 4849.  Fourth, contrary to its arguments, CBOCS cannot find support in Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 63, and Dominos Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, 546 U. S. 470.  While Burlington distinguished discrimination based on status (e.g., as women or black persons) from discrimination based on conduct (e.g., whistle-blowing that leads to retaliation), it did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.  Moreover, while Dominos Pizza and other more recent cases may place greater emphasis on statutory language than did Sullivan, any arguable change in interpretive approach would not justify reexamination of well-established prior law under stare decisis principles.

appeal from the united states district court for the middle district of alabama
No. 0777.Argued March 24, 2008Decided May 27, 2008
Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) requires covered jurisdictions to obtain preclearance from the District Court for the District of Columbia or the Department of Justice (DOJ) before enact[ing] or seek[ing] to administer any changes in their practices or procedures affecting voting.  


Alabama is a covered jurisdiction.  As of its November 1, 1964 coverage date, state law provided that midterm vacancies on county commissions were to be filled by gubernatorial appointment.  In 1985, the state legislature passed, and the DOJ precleared, a local law providing that Mobile County Commission midterm vacancies would be filled by special election rather than gubernatorial appointment.  In 1987, the Governor called a special election for the first midterm opening on the Commission postpassage of the 1985 Act.  A Mobile County voter, Willie Stokes, filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin the election, but the state trial court denied his request.  Although Stokes immediately appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, the special election went forward and the winner took office.  Subsequently, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial courts judgment, finding that the 1985 Act violated the State Constitution.


When the next midterm Commission vacancy occurred in 2005, the method of filling the opening again became the subject of litigation.  In 2004, the state legislature had passed, and the DOJ had precleared, a law providing for gubernatorial appointment as the means to fill county commission vacancies unless a local law authorized a special election. When the vacancy arose, appellee voters and state legislators (hereinafter Kennedy) filed suit against the Governor in state court, asserting that the 2004 Act had revived the 1985 Act and cured its infirmity under the Alabama Constitution.  Adopting Kennedys view, the trial court ordered the Governor to call a special election.  Before the election took place, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial courts order, holding that the 2004 Act did not resurrect the 1985 Act.  The Governor therefore filled the vacancy by appointment, naming Commissioner Chastang to the open seat.  Kennedy then commenced this suit in Federal District Court.  Invoking 5 of the VRA, she sought declaratory relief and an injunction barring the Governor from filling the Commission vacancy by appointment unless and until Alabama gained preclearance of the Stokes and Kennedy decisions.  A three-judge District Court granted the requested declaration in August 2006.  It determined that the baseline against which any change should be measured was the 1985 Acts provision requiring special elections, a measure both precleared and put into force or effect with the special election in 1987.  It followed, the District Court reasoned, that the gubernatorial appointment called for by Stokes and Kennedy ranked as a change from the baseline practice; consequently, those decisions should have been precleared.  Deferring affirmative relief, the District Court gave the State 90 days to obtain preclearance.  When the DOJ denied the States request for preclearance, Kennedy returned to the District Court and filed a motion for further relief.  On May 1, 2007, the District Court vacated the Governors appointment of Chastang to the Commission, finding it unlawful under 5 of the VRA.  The Governor filed a notice of appeal in the District Court on May 18.  
Held: 
1.Because the District Court did not render its final judgment until May 1, 2007, the Governors May 18 notice of appeal was timely.  Under 5, any appeal from the decision of a three-judge district court shall lie to the Supreme Court, 42 U. S.C. 1973c(a), but the appeal must be filed within 60 days of a district courts entry of a final judgment, see 28 U. S.C. 2101(b).  Kennedy maintains that the District Courts August 2006 order qualified as a final judgment, while the Governor maintains that the District Courts final judgment was the May 1 order vacating Chastangs appointment.  A final judgment ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.  Catlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233.  The August 2006 order declared that preclearance was required for the Stokes and Kennedy decisions, but left unresolved Kennedys demand for injunctive relief.  An order resolving liability without addressing a plaintiffs requests for relief is not final.  See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, 424 U. S. 737, 742743.  Pp.910.


2.For 5 purposes, the 1985 Act never gained force or effect.  Therefore, Alabamas reinstatement of its prior practice of gubernatorial appointment did not rank as a change requiring preclearance.  Pp.1020.


(a)In order to determine whether an election practice constitutes a change as defined in this Courts 5 precedents, the practice must be compared with the covered jurisdictions baseline, i.e., the most recent practice both precleared and in force or effector, absent any change since the jurisdictions coverage date, the practice in force or effect on that date.  See Young v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 282283.  Pp.1012. 


(b)While not controlling here, three precedents addressing 5s term of art in force or effect provide the starting point for the Courts inquiry.  In Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, the question was what practice had been in force or effect in Canton, Mississippi, on that States 1964 coverage date.  A 1962 state law required at-large elections for city aldermen, but Canton had elected aldermen by wards in 1961 and again in 1965.  This Court held that the citys 1969 attempt to move to at-large elections was a change requiring preclearance because election by ward was the procedure in fact in force or effect in Canton on the coverage date.  Id., at 395.  Similarly, in City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, the question was what practice had been in force or effect in Lockhart, Texas, on the relevant coverage date.  The city had used a numbered-post system to elect its city council for more than 50 years.  Though the numbered-post systems validity under state law was not entirely clear, id., at 132, [t]he proper comparison [wa]s between the new system and the system actually in effect on the coverage date, regardless of what state law might have required, ibid.  Finally, in Young v. Fordice, the question was whether a provisional voter registration plan precleared and implemented by Mississippi election officials, who believed that the state legislature was about to amend the relevant law, had been in force or effect.  See 520 U. S., at 279.  As it turned out, the state legislature failed to pass the amendment, and voters who had registered under the provisional plan were required to reregister.  This Court held that the provisional plan was a temporary misapplication of state law that, for 5 purposes, was never in force or effect.  Id., at 282.  Young thus qualified the general rule of Perkins and Lockhart:A practice best characterized as nothing more than a temporary misapplication of state law, is not in force or effect, even if actually implemented by state election officials, 520 U. S., at 282.  Pp.1215.


(c)If the only relevant factors were the length of time a practice was in use and the degree to which it was implemented, this would be a close case under Perkins, Lockhart, and Young.  But an extraordinary circumstance not present in any past case is operative here, impelling the conclusion that the 1985 Act was never in force or effect: The Act was challenged in state court at first opportunity, the lone election was held in the shadow of that legal challenge, and the Act was ultimately invalidated by the Alabama Supreme Court.  These characteristics plainly distinguish this case from Perkins and Lockhart, where the state judiciary had no involvement.  The prompt legal challenge and the State Supreme Courts decision also provide strong cause to conclude that, in the 5 context, the 1985 Act was never in force or effect.  A States highest court is unquestionably the ultimate exposito[r] of state law.  Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691.  And because the State Supreme Courts prerogative to say what Alabama law is merits respect in federal forums, a law challenged at first opportunity and invalidated by Alabamas highest court is properly regarded as null and void ab initio, incapable of effecting any change in Alabama law or establishing a voting practice under 5.  There is no good reason to hold otherwise simply because Alabamas highest court did not render its decision until after an election was held.  To the contrary, practical considerations sometimes require courts to allow elections to proceed despite pending legal challenges.  Cf. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 56 (per curiam).  Ruling otherwise would have the anomalous effect of binding Alabama to an unconstitutional practice because of the state trial courts error.  The trial court misconstrued the States law and, due to that courts error, an election took place.  That sequence of events, the District Court held, made the 1985 Act part of Alabamas 5 baseline.  In essence, the District Courts decision gave controlling effect to the erroneous trial court ruling and rendered the Alabama Supreme Courts corrections inoperative.  That sort of interference with a state supreme courts ability to determine the content of state law is more than a hypothetical concern.  The realities of election litigation are such that lower state courts often allow elections to proceed based on erroneous interpretations of state law later corrected on appeal.  The Court declines to adopt a rigid interpretation of in force or effect that would deny state supreme courts the opportunity to correct similar errors in the future.  Pp.1519.


(d)Although this Courts reasoning and the facts of this case should make the narrow scope of the holding apparent, some cautionary observations are in order.  First, the presence of a judgment by Alabamas highest court invalidating the 1985 Act under the State Constitution is critical here.  The outcome might be different were a potentially unlawful practice simply abandoned by state officials after initial use in an election.  Cf. Perkins, 400 U. S., at 395.  Second, the 1985 Act was challenged the first time it was invoked and struck down shortly thereafter.  The same result would not necessarily follow if a practice were invalidated only after enforcement without challenge in several previous elections.  Cf. Young, 520 U. S., at 283.  Finally, the consequence of the Alabama Supreme Courts Stokes decision was to reinstate a practicegubernatorial appointmentidentical to the States 5 baseline.  Preclearance might well have been required had the court instead ordered the State to adopt a novel practice.  Pp.1920.
Reversed and remanded.

06-1646|"UNITED STATES v. RODRIQUEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 061646.Argued January 15, 2008Decided May 19, 2008
Upon respondents federal conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U. S.C. 922(g)(1), he had three prior Washington state convictions for delivery of a controlled substance.  At the time of those convictions, Washington law specified a maximum 5-year prison term for the first such offense.  A recidivist provision, however, set a 10-year ceiling for a second or subsequent offense, and the state court had sentenced respondent to concurrent 48-month sentences on each count.  The Government contended in the federal felon-in-possession case that respondent should be sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 924(e), which sets a 15-year minimum sentence [i]n the case of a person who violates [922(g)] and has three previous convictions  for a  serious drug offense, 924(e)(1).  Because a state drug-trafficking conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense if a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law for the offense, 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), and the maximum term on at least two of respondents Washington crimes was 10 years under the state recidivist provision, the Government argued that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA.  The District Court disagreed, holding that the maximum term of imprisonment for 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) purposes is determined without reference to recidivist enhancements.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.   
Held:The maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law for the state drug convictions at issue was the 10-year maximum set by the applicable state recidivist provision.  Pp.314.
(a)This reading is compelled by a straightforward application of 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)s three key terms: offense, law, and maximum term.  The offense was the crime charged in each of respondents drug-delivery cases.  And because the relevant law is the state statutes prescribing 5- and 10-year prison terms, the maximum term prescribed for at least two of respondents state drug offenses was 10 years.  The Ninth Circuits holding that the maximum term was 5 years contorts ACCAs plain terms.  Although the state court sentenced respondent to 48 months, there is no dispute that state law permitted a sentence of up to 10 years.  The Circuits interpretation is also inconsistent with how the concept maximum term of imprisonment is customarily understood by participants in the criminal justice process.  Pp.35. 


(b)Respondents textual argumentthat because offense generally describes a crimes elements, while prior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not typically elements, such convictions are not part of the ACCA offense, and the maximum term for the convictions at issue was the 5-year ceiling for simply committing the drug offense elementsis not faithful to the statutory text, which refers to the maximum 10-year term prescribed by Washington law for each of respondents two relevant offenses.  Respondents manifest purpose argumentthat because ACCA uses the maximum state-law penalty as shorthand for conduct sufficiently serious to trigger the mandatory penalty, while an offenses seriousness is typically gauged by the nature of the defendants conduct, the offenses elements, and the crimes impact, a defendants recidivist status has no connection to whether his offense was seriousrests on the erroneous proposition that a prior record has no bearing on an offenses seriousness.  Respondents understanding of recidivism statutes has been has squarely rejected.  See, e.g., Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747.  Pp.57. 


(c)Respondents argument that the Courts ACCA interpretation produces a perverse bootstrapping whereby a defendant is punished under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law is rejected.  The Courts reading is bolstered by the fact that ACCA is itself a recidivist statute, so that Congress must have understood that the maximum penalty prescribed by [state] law could be increased by state recidivism provisions.  Contrary to respondents suggestion, United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751in which the Court held that the phrase maximum term authorized in 28 U. S.C. 994(h) refers to all applicable statutes, including recidivist enhancementssupports the Courts ACCA interpretation.  Respondents reliance on Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, is also misplaced: There is no connection between the issue there (the meaning of burglary in 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the meaning of maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law in 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  Respondent argues unpersuasively that, under todays interpretation, offenses that are not really serious will be included as serious drug offense[s] because of recidivist enhancements.  Since Congress presumably thought that state lawmakers must consider a crime serious when they provide a 10-year sentence for it, this Courts holding poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be treated as serious without satisfying the standard Congress prescribed.  Pp.79. 


(d)Also rejected is respondents argument that the Courts holding will often require federal courts to engage in difficult inquiries regarding novel state-law questions and complex factual determinations about long-past state-court proceedings.  Respondent greatly exaggerates the difficulties because (1) receipt of a recidivist enhancement will necessarily be evident from the sentences length in some cases; (2) the conviction judgment will sometimes list the maximum possible sentence even where the sentence actually imposed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without recidivist enhancement; (3) some jurisdictions require the prosecution to submit a publicly available charging document to obtain a recidivist enhancement; (4) a plea colloquy will often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty; and (5) where the records do not show that the defendant faced a recidivist enhancement, the Government may well be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense.  Merely because future cases might present difficulties cannot justify disregarding ACCAs clear meaning.  Pp.1011. 


(e)Also unavailing is respondents argument that if recidivist enhancements can increase the maximum term under ACCA, then mandatory guidelines systems capping sentences can decrease the maximum term, whereas Congress cannot have wanted to make the maximum term dependent on the complexities of state sentencing guidelines.  The phrase maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law for the offense could not have been meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range because (1) such a sentence is generally not really the maximum because guidelines systems typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances; and (2) in all of the many statutes predating ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 that used the concept of the maximum term prescribed by law, the concept necessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guideline range.  United States v. R.L.C., 503 U. S. 291, 295, n.1, 299, distinguished.  Pp.1114.

A recidivist provision, however, set a 10-year ceiling for a second or subsequent offense, and the state court had sentenced respondent to concurrent 48-month sentences on each count.  The Government contended in the federal felon-in-possession case that respondent should be sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 924(e), which sets a 15-year minimum sentence [i]n the case of a person who violates [922(g)] and has three previous convictions  for a  serious drug offense, 924(e)(1).  Because a state drug-trafficking conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense if a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law for the offense, 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), and the maximum term on at least two of respondents Washington crimes was 10 years under the state recidivist provision, the Government argued that these convictions had to be counted under ACCA.  The District Court disagreed, holding that the maximum term of imprisonment for 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) purposes is determined without reference to recidivist enhancements.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.   
Held:The maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law for the state drug convictions at issue was the 10-year maximum set by the applicable state recidivist provision.  Pp.314.
(a)This reading is compelled by a straightforward application of 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)s three key terms: offense, law, and maximum term.  The offense was the crime charged in each of respondents drug-delivery cases.  And because the relevant law is the state statutes prescribing 5- and 10-year prison terms, the maximum term prescribed for at least two of respondents state drug offenses was 10 years.  The Ninth Circuits holding that the maximum term was 5 years contorts ACCAs plain terms.  Although the state court sentenced respondent to 48 months, there is no dispute that state law permitted a sentence of up to 10 years.  The Circuits interpretation is also inconsistent with how the concept maximum term of imprisonment is customarily understood by participants in the criminal justice process.  Pp.35. 


(b)Respondents textual argumentthat because offense generally describes a crimes elements, while prior convictions required for recidivist enhancements are not typically elements, such convictions are not part of the ACCA offense, and the maximum term for the convictions at issue was the 5-year ceiling for simply committing the drug offense elementsis not faithful to the statutory text, which refers to the maximum 10-year term prescribed by Washington law for each of respondents two relevant offenses.  Respondents manifest purpose argumentthat because ACCA uses the maximum state-law penalty as shorthand for conduct sufficiently serious to trigger the mandatory penalty, while an offenses seriousness is typically gauged by the nature of the defendants conduct, the offenses elements, and the crimes impact, a defendants recidivist status has no connection to whether his offense was seriousrests on the erroneous proposition that a prior record has no bearing on an offenses seriousness.  Respondents understanding of recidivism statutes has been has squarely rejected.  See, e.g., Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747.  Pp.57. 


(c)Respondents argument that the Courts ACCA interpretation produces a perverse bootstrapping whereby a defendant is punished under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law is rejected.  The Courts reading is bolstered by the fact that ACCA is itself a recidivist statute, so that Congress must have understood that the maximum penalty prescribed by [state] law could be increased by state recidivism provisions.  Contrary to respondents suggestion, United States v. LaBonte, 520 U. S. 751in which the Court held that the phrase maximum term authorized in 28 U. S.C. 994(h) refers to all applicable statutes, including recidivist enhancementssupports the Courts ACCA interpretation.  Respondents reliance on Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, is also misplaced: There is no connection between the issue there (the meaning of burglary in 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and the meaning of maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law in 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).  Respondent argues unpersuasively that, under todays interpretation, offenses that are not really serious will be included as serious drug offense[s] because of recidivist enhancements.  Since Congress presumably thought that state lawmakers must consider a crime serious when they provide a 10-year sentence for it, this Courts holding poses no risk that a drug-trafficking offense will be treated as serious without satisfying the standard Congress prescribed.  Pp.79. 


(d)Also rejected is respondents argument that the Courts holding will often require federal courts to engage in difficult inquiries regarding novel state-law questions and complex factual determinations about long-past state-court proceedings.  Respondent greatly exaggerates the difficulties because (1) receipt of a recidivist enhancement will necessarily be evident from the sentences length in some cases; (2) the conviction judgment will sometimes list the maximum possible sentence even where the sentence actually imposed did not exceed the top sentence allowed without recidivist enhancement; (3) some jurisdictions require the prosecution to submit a publicly available charging document to obtain a recidivist enhancement; (4) a plea colloquy will often include a statement by the trial judge regarding the maximum penalty; and (5) where the records do not show that the defendant faced a recidivist enhancement, the Government may well be precluded from establishing that a conviction was for a qualifying offense.  Merely because future cases might present difficulties cannot justify disregarding ACCAs clear meaning.  Pp.1011. 


(e)Also unavailing is respondents argument that if recidivist enhancements can increase the maximum term under ACCA, then mandatory guidelines systems capping sentences can decrease the maximum term, whereas Congress cannot have wanted to make the maximum term dependent on the complexities of state sentencing guidelines.  The phrase maximum term of imprisonment  prescribed by law for the offense could not have been meant to apply to the top sentence in a guidelines range because (1) such a sentence is generally not really the maximum because guidelines systems typically allow a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that exceeds the top of the guidelines range under appropriate circumstances; and (2) in all of the many statutes predating ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 that used the concept of the maximum term prescribed by law, the concept necessarily referred to the maximum term prescribed by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guideline range.  United States v. R.L.C., 503 U. S. 291, 295, n.1, 299, distinguished.  Pp.1114.

certiorari to the court of appeals of kentucky
No. 06666.Argued November 5, 2007Decided May 19, 2008
Kentucky exempts from state income taxes interest on bonds issued by it or its political subdivisions but not on bonds issued by other States and their subdivisions.  After paying state income tax on out-of-state municipal bonds, respondents sued petitioners (hereinafter Kentucky) for a refund, claiming that Kentuckys differential tax impermissibly discriminated against interstate commerce.  The trial court ruled for Kentucky, relying in part on a market-participation exception to the dormant Commerce Clause limit on state regulation.  The State Court of Appeals reversed, finding that Kentuckys scheme ran afoul of the Commerce Clause.  
Held:The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.  
197 S.W. 3d 557, reversed and remanded.
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IIIB, concluding that Kentuckys differential tax scheme does not offend the Commerce Clause.  Pp.713, 2028.


(a)Modern dormant Commerce Clause law is driven by concern about economic protectionismthat is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors, New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273274but that concern is limited by federalism favoring a degree of local autonomy.  Under the resulting analysis, a discriminatory law is virtually per se invalid.  Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99.  An exception covers States that go beyond regulation and themselves participat[e] in the market to exercis[e] the right to favor [their] own citizens over others, Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 810, reflecting a basic distinction  between States as market participants and States as market regulators, Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 436.  Last Term, in a case decided independently of the market participant exception, this Court upheld an ordinance requiring trash haulers to deliver solid waste to a public authoritys processing plant, finding that it addressed what was both typically and traditionally a local government function, and did not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause, United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U. S. ___, ___.  Pp.710. 


(b)United Haulers provides a firm basis for reversal here.  The logic that a government function is not susceptible to standard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny because it is likely motivated by legitimate objectives distinct from simple economic protectionism applies with even greater force to laws favoring a States municipal bonds, since issuing debt securities to pay for public projects is a quintessentially public function, with a venerable history.  Bond proceeds are a way to shoulder the cardinal civic responsibilities listed in United Haulers: protecting citizens health, safety, and welfare.  And United Haulers apprehension about unprecedented  interference with a traditional government function is warranted here, where respondents would have this Court invalidate a century-old taxing practice presently employed by 41 States and supported by all.  In fact, emphasizing an enterprises public character is just one step in addressing the fundamental element of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence that any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities, id., at ___.  Viewed through the lens of Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592, there is no forbidden discrimination because Kentucky, as a public entity, does not have to treat itself as being substantially similar to other bond issuers in the market.  Pp.1113.


(c)A look at the specific markets in which the exemptions effects are felt confirms that no traditionally forbidden discrimination is underway and points to the tax policys distinctive character.  In both the interstate market as most broadly conceivedissuers and holders of all fixed-income securitiesand the more specialized marketcommerce solely in federally tax-exempt municipal bonds, often conducted through interstate municipal bond fundsnearly every taxing State believes its public interests are served by the same tax-and-exemption feature which is supported in this Court by every State.  These facts suggest that no State perceives any local advantage or disadvantage beyond the permissible ones open to a government and to those who deal with that government when it enters the market.  An equally significant perception emerges from examining the market for municipal bonds within the issuing State, a large proportion of which market is managed by one or more single-state funds.  An important feature of such markets is that intrastate funds absorb securities issued by smaller or lesser known municipalities that interstate markets tend to ignore.  Many single-state funds would likely disappear if the current differential tax schemes were upset, and there is no suggestion that the interstate markets would welcome the weaker municipal issues that would lose their local market homes after a Davis victory.  Financing for long-term municipal improvements would thus change radically if the differential tax feature disappeared.  The fact that the differential tax scheme is critical to the operation of an identifiable segment of the current municipal financial market demonstrates that the States unanimous desire to preserve the scheme is a far cry from the private protectionism that has driven the dormant Commerce Clauses development.  Pp.2023.


(e)The Court generally applies the rule in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142, that even nondiscriminatory burdens on commerce may be struck down on a showing that they clearly outweigh the benefits of a state or local practice.

06-694|"UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 06694.Argued October 30, 2007Decided May 19, 2008
After this Court found facially overbroad a federal statutory provision criminalizing the possession and distribution of material pandered as child pornography, regardless of whether it actually was that, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U. S. 234, Congress passed the pandering and solicitation provision at issue, 18 U. S.C. 2252A(a)(3)(B).  Respondent Williams pleaded guilty to this offense and others, but reserved the right to challenge his pandering convictions constitutionality.  The District Court rejected his challenge, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed, finding the statute both overbroad under the First Amendment and impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause.
Held: 
1.Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) is not overbroad under the First Amendment.  Pp.618.


(a)A statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.  Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) generally prohibits offers to provide and requests to obtain child pornography.  It targets not the underlying material, but the collateral speech introducing such material into the child-pornography distribution network.  Its definition of material or purported material that may not be pandered or solicited precisely tracks the material held constitutionally proscribable in New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, and Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15: obscene material depicting (actual or virtual) children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, and any other material depicting actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.  The statutes important features include:(1) a scienter requirement; (2) operative verbs that are reasonably read to penalize speech that accompanies or seeks to induce a child pornography transfer from one person to another; (3) a phrasein a manner that reflects the belief, ibid.that has both the subjective component that the defendant must actually have held the belief that the material or purported material was child pornography, and the objective component that the statement or action must manifest that belief; (4) a phrasein a manner  that is intended to cause another to believe, ibid that has only the subjective element that the defendant must intend that the listener believe the material to be child pornography; and (5) a sexually explicit conduct definition that is very similar to that in the New York statute upheld in Ferber.  Pp.611.


(b)As thus construed, the statute does not criminalize a substantial amount of protected expressive activity.  Offers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded from First Amendment protection.  E.g., Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commn on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376, 388.  The Eleventh Circuit mistakenly believed that this exclusion extended only to commercial offers to provide or receive contraband.   The exclusions rationale, however, is based not on the less privileged status of  commercial speech, but on the principle that offers to give or receive what it is unlawful to possess have no social value and thus enjoy no First Amendment protection.  The constitutional defect in Free Speech Coalitions pandering provision was that it went beyond pandering to prohibit possessing material that could not otherwise be proscribed.  The Eleventh Circuits erroneous conclusion led it to apply strict scrutiny to 2252A(a)(3)(B), lodging three fatal objections that lack merit.  Pp.1118.


2.Section 2252A(a)(3)(B) is not impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause.  A conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703, 732.  In the First Amendment context plaintiffs may argue that a statute is overbroad because it is unclear whether it regulates a substantial amount of protected speech.  Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 494495, and nn. 6 and 7.  The Eleventh Circuit mistakenly believed that in a manner that reflects the belief and in a manner  that is intended to cause another to believe were vague and standardless phrases that left the public with no objective measure of conformance.  What renders a statute vague, however, is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved; but rather the indeterminacy of what that fact is.  See, e.g., Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 614.  There is no such indeterminacy here.  The statutes requirements are clear questions of fact.  It may be difficult in some cases to determine whether the requirements have been met, but courts and juries every day pass upon the reasonable import of a defendants statements and upon knowledge, belief and intent.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07455.Argued March 25, 2008Decided May 19, 2008
After respondent gave false information on his customs form while attempting to enter the United States, a search of his car revealed explosives that he intended to detonate in this country.  He was convicted of, inter alia, (1) feloniously making a false statement to a customs official in violation of 18 U. S.C. 1001, and (2) carr[ying] an explosive during the commission of that felony in violation of 844(h)(2).  The Ninth Circuit set aside the latter conviction because it read during in 844(h)(2) to include a requirement that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony.
Held:Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated 1001, he was carrying them during the commission of that felony.  The most natural reading of 844(h)(2) provides a sufficient basis for reversal.  It is undisputed that the items in respondents car were explosives, and that he was carr[ying] those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official in violation of 1001.  Dictionary definitions need not be consulted to arrive at the conclusion that he engaged in 844(h)(2)s precise conduct.  [D]uring denotes a temporal link.  Because his carrying of explosives was contemporaneous with his 1001 violation, he carried them during that violation.  The statutes history further supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend a relational requirement in 844(h) as presently written.  Pp.26

			"|"UNITED STATES v. RESSAM
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07455.Argued March 25, 2008Decided May 19, 2008
After respondent gave false information on his customs form while attempting to enter the United States, a search of his car revealed explosives that he intended to detonate in this country.  He was convicted of, inter alia, (1) feloniously making a false statement to a customs official in violation of 18 U. S.C. 1001, and (2) carr[ying] an explosive during the commission of that felony in violation of 844(h)(2).  The Ninth Circuit set aside the latter conviction because it read during in 844(h)(2) to include a requirement that the explosive be carried in relation to the underlying felony.
Held:Since respondent was carrying explosives when he violated 1001, he was carrying them during the commission of that felony.  The most natural reading of 844(h)(2) provides a sufficient basis for reversal.  It is undisputed that the items in respondents car were explosives, and that he was carr[ying] those explosives when he knowingly made false statements to a customs official in violation of 1001.  Dictionary definitions need not be consulted to arrive at the conclusion that he engaged in 844(h)(2)s precise conduct.  [D]uring denotes a temporal link.  Because his carrying of explosives was contemporaneous with his 1001 violation, he carried them during that violation.  The statutes history further supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend a relational requirement in 844(h) as presently written.  Pp.26
474 F.3d 597, reversed.

06-11612|"GONZALEZ v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit
No. 0611612.Argued January 8, 2008Decided May 12, 2008
If the parties consent, a federal magistrate judge may preside over the voir dire and jury selection in a felony criminal trial.  Peretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923, 933.  Before petitioners federal trial on felony drug charges, his counsel consented to the Magistrate Judges presiding over jury selection.  Petitioner was not asked for his own consent.  After the Magistrate Judge supervised voir dire without objection, a District Judge presided at trial, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.  Petitioner contended for the first time on appeal that it was error not to obtain his own consent to the Magistrate Judges voir dire role.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed the convictions, concluding, inter alia, that the right to have a district judge preside over voir dire could be waived by counsel.
Held:Express consent by counsel suffices to permit a magistrate judge to preside over jury selection in a felony trial, pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U. S.C. 636(b)(3), which states: A magistrate judge may be assigned such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Under Gomez v. United States, 490 U. S. 858, 870, 875876, and Peretz, supra, at 933, 935936, such additional duties include presiding at voir dire if the parties consent, but not if there is an objection.  Generally, where there is a full trial, there are various points at which rights either can be asserted or waived.  This Court has indicated that some of these rights require the defendants own consent to waive.  See, e.g., New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110, 114115.  The Court held in Hill, however, that an attorney, acting without indication of particular consent from his client, could waive his clients statutory right to a speedy trial because [s]cheduling matters are plainly among those for which agreement by counsel generally controls.  Ibid.  Similar to the scheduling matter in Hill, acceptance of a magistrate judge at the jury selection phase is a tactical decision well suited for the attorneys own decision.  The presiding judge has significant discretion over jury selection both as to substancethe questions askedand toneformal or informaland the judges approach may be relevant in light of the approach of the attorney, who may decide whether to accept a magistrate judge based in part on these factors.  As with other tactical decisions, requiring personal, on-the-record approval from the client could necessitate a lengthy explanation that the client might not understand and that might distract from more pressing matters as the attorney seeks to prepare the best defense.  Petitioner argues unconvincingly that the decision to have a magistrate judge for voir dire is a fundamental choice, cf. Hill, supra, at 114, or, at least, raises a question of constitutional significance so that the Act should be interpreted to require explicit consent.  Serious concerns about the Acts constitutionality are not present here, and petitioner concedes that magistrate judges are capable of competent and impartial performance when presiding over jury selection.  Gomez, supra, at 876, distinguished.  Pp. 212. 
483 F. 3d 390, affirmed.
Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.J., and Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito, JJ., joined.  Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.  Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

07-21|"CRAWFORD etal. v. MARION COUNTY ELECTION BOARD etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 0721.Argued January 9, 2008Decided April 28, 2008*
After Indiana enacted an election law (SEA 483) requiring citizens voting in person to present government-issued photo identification, petitioners filed separate suits challenging the laws constitutionality.  Following discovery, the District Court granted respondents summary judgment, finding the evidence in the record insufficient to support a facial attack on the statutes validity.  In affirming, the Seventh Circuit declined to judge the law by the strict standard set for poll taxes in Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, finding the burden on voters offset by the benefit of reducing the risk of fraud.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.  
472 F.3d 949, affirmed.
Justice Stevens, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that the evidence in the record does not support a facial attack on SEA 483s validity.  Pp.520. 


(a)Under Harper, even rational restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they are unrelated to voter qualifications.  However, even handed restrictions protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself satisfy Harpers standard.  Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n.9.  A state laws burden on a political party, an individual voter, or a discrete class of voters must be justified by relevant and legitimate state interests sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation.  Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288289.  Pp.57.


(b)Each of Indianas asserted interests is unquestionably relevant to its interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process.  The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter fraud.  Indiana has a valid interest in participating in a nationwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures criticized as antiquated and inefficient.  Indiana also claims a particular interest in preventing voter fraud in response to the problem of voter registration rolls with a large number of names of persons who are either deceased or no longer live in Indiana.  While the record contains no evidence that the fraud SEA 483 addressesin-person voter impersonation at polling placeshas actually occurred in Indiana, such fraud has occurred in other parts of the country, and Indianas own experience with voter fraud in a 2003 mayoral primary demonstrates a real risk that voter fraud could affect a close elections outcome.  There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of a States interest in counting only eligible voters votes.  Finally, Indianas interest in protecting public confidence in elections, while closely related to its interest in preventing voter fraud, has independent significance, because such confidence encourages citizen participation in the democratic process.  Pp.713. 


(c)The relevant burdens here are those imposed on eligible voters who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483.  Because Indianas cards are free, the inconvenience of going to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for a photograph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters right to vote, or represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting.  The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that may be placed on a limited number of personse.g., elderly persons born out-of-state, who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificateis mitigated by the fact that eligible voters without photo identification may cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they execute the required affidavit at the circuit court clerks office.  Even assuming that the burden may not be justified as to a few voters, that conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners right to the relief they seek.  Pp.1316.


(d)Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to invalidate SEA 483 in all its applications.  This Courts reasoning in Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. ___, applies with added force here.  Petitioners argue that Indianas interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who cannot afford or obtain a birth certificate and who must make a second trip to the circuit court clerks office, but it is not possible to quantify, based on the evidence in the record, either that burdens magnitude or the portion of the burden that is fully justified.  A facial challenge must fail where the statute has a plainly legitimate sweep. Id., at ___.  When considering SEA 483s broad application to all Indiana voters, it imposes only a limited burden on voters rights.  Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 439.  The precise interests advanced by Indiana are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners facial challenge.  Id., at 434.  Pp.1620.


(e)Valid neutral justifications for a nondiscriminatory law, such as SEA 483, should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators.  P. 20.


Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas and Justice Alito, was of the view that petitioners premise that the voter-identification law might have imposed a special burden on some voters is irrelevant.  The law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and justified.  A law respecting the right to vote should be evaluated under the approach in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, which calls for application of a deferential, important regulatory interests standard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving strict scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote, id., at 433434.  The different ways in which Indianas law affects different voters are no more than different impacts of the single burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters: To vote in person, everyone must have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free.  This is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation.  The laws universally applicable requirements are eminently reasonable because the burden of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free photo identification is not a significant increase over the usual voting burdens, and the States stated interests are sufficient to sustain that minimal burden.  Pp.16.

06-1082|"VIRGINIA v. MOORE
certiorari to the supreme court virginia
No. 061082.Argued January 14, 2008Decided April 23, 2008
Rather than issuing the summons required by Virginia law, police arrested respondent Moore for the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license.  A search incident to the arrest yielded crack cocaine, and Moore was tried on drug charges.  The trial court declined to suppress the evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds.  Moore was convicted.  Ultimately, the Virginia Supreme Court reversed, reasoning that the search violated the Fourth Amendment because the arresting officers should have issued a citation under state law, and the Fourth Amendment does not permit search incident to citation.
Held:The police did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they made an arrest that was based on probable cause but prohibited by state law, or when they performed a search incident to the arrest.  Pp.313.
(a)Because the founding eras statutes and common law do not support Moores view that the Fourth Amendment was intended to incorporate statutes, this is not a case in which the claimant can point to a clear answer [that] existed in 1791 and has been generally adhered to by the traditions of our society ever since, Atwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 345.  Pp.35.


(b)Where history provides no conclusive answer, this Court has analyzed a search or seizure in light of traditional reasonableness standards by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individuals privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.  Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300.  Applying that methodology, this Court has held that when an officer has probable cause to believe a person committed even a minor crime, the arrest is constitutionally reasonable.  Atwater, supra, at 354.  This Courts decisions counsel against changing the calculus when a State chooses to protect privacy beyond the level required by the Fourth Amendment.  See, e.g., Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 35.  United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, distinguished.  Pp.68.


(c)The Court adheres to this approach because an arrest based on probable cause serves interests that justify seizure.  Arrest ensures that a suspect appears to answer charges and does not continue a crime, and it safeguards evidence and enables officers to conduct an in-custody investigation.  A States choice of a more restrictive search-and-seizure policy does not render less restrictive ones unreasonable, and hence unconstitutional.  While States are free to require their officers to engage in nuanced determinations of the need for arrest as a matter of their own law, the Fourth Amendment should reflect administrable bright-line rules.  Incorporating state arrest rules into the Constitution would make Fourth Amendment protections as complex as the underlying state law, and variable from place to place and time to time.  Pp.811.


(d)The Court rejects Moores argument that even if the Constitution allowed his arrest, it did not allow the arresting officers to search him.  Officers may perform searches incident to constitutionally permissible arrests in order to ensure their safety and safeguard evidence.  United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218.  While officers issuing citations do not face the same danger, and thus do not have the same authority to search, Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, the officers arrested Moore, and therefore faced the risks that are an adequate basis for treating all custodial arrests alike for purposes of search justification, Robinson, supra, at 235.

06-11429|"BURGESS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 0611429.Argued March 24, 2008Decided April 16, 2008
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) doubles the mandatory minimum sentence for certain federal drug crimes if the defendant was previously convicted of a felony drug offense.  21 U. S.C. 841(b)(1)(A).  Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term felony to mean any offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony, while 802(44) defines the compound term felony drug offense to mea[n] an offense [involving specified drugs] that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.


Petitioner Burgess pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, an offense that ordinarily carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.  Burgess had a prior South Carolina cocaine possession conviction, which carried a maximum sentence of two years but was classified as a misdemeanor under state law.  The Federal Government argued that Burgess minimum federal sentence should be enhanced to 20 years under 841(b)(1)(A) because his South Carolina conviction was punishable by more than one years imprisonment.  Burgess countered that because felony drug offense incorporates the term felony, a word separately defined in 802(13), a prior drug offense does not warrant an enhanced 841(b)(1)(A) sentence unless it is both (1) classified as a felony under the law of the punishing jurisdiction, per 802(13); and (2) punishable by more than one years imprisonment, per 802(44).  Rejecting that argument, the District Court ruled that 802(44) alone controls the meaning of felony drug offense under 841(b)(1)(A).  The Fourth Circuit affirmed.   
Held:Because the term felony drug offense in 841(b)(1)(A) is defined exclusively by 802(44) and does not incorporate 802(13)s definition of felony, a state drug offense punishable by more than one year qualifies as a felony drug offense, even if state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor.  Pp.411.
(a)The CSAs language and structure indicate that Congress used felony drug offense as a term of art defined by 802(44) without reference to 802(13).  First, a definition such as 802(44)s that declares what a term means generally excludes any meaning that is not stated.  E.g., Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 392393, n.10.   Second, because felony is commonly defined to mean a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, see, e.g., 18 U. S.C. 3559(a), 802(44)s definition of felony drug offense as an offense  punishable by imprisonment for more than one year leaves no blank for 802(13) to fill.  Third, if Congress wanted felony drug offense to incorporate 802(13)s definition of felony, it easily could have written 802(44) to state: The term felony drug offense means a felony that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year .  Fourth, the Courts reading avoids anomalies that would arise if both 802(13) and 802(44) governed application of 841(b)(1)(A)s sentencing enhancement.  Section 802(13) includes only federal and state offenses and would exclude enhancement based on a foreign offense, notwithstanding the express inclusion of foreign offenses in 841(b)(1)(A).  Furthermore, Burgess compound definition of felony drug offense leaves unanswered the appropriate classification of drug convictions in state and foreign jurisdictions that do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors.  Finally, the Courts reading of 802(44) hardly renders 802(13) extraneous; the latter section serves to define felony for the many CSA provisions using that unadorned term.  Pp.48.  


(b)The CSAs drafting history reinforces the Courts reading.  In 1988, Congress first defined felony drug offense as, inter alia, an offense that is a felony under  any law of a State (emphasis added), but, in 1994, it amended the statutory definition to its present form.  By recognizing 802(44) as the exclusive definition of felony drug offense, the Courts reading serves an evident purpose of the 1994 revision: to eliminate disparities resulting from divergent state classifications of offenses by adopting a uniform federal standard based on the authorized term of imprisonment.  By contrast, Burgess reading of the 1994 alteration as merely adding a length-of-imprisonment requirement to a definition already requiring designation of an offense as a felony by the punishing jurisdiction would attribute to the amendment little practical effect and encounters formidable impediments: the statutes text and history.  Pp.810.


(c)Burgess argument that the rule of lenity should be applied in determining whether felony drug offense incorporates 802(13)s definition of felony is rejected.  The touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.  E.g., Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387.  Because Congress expressly defined felony drug offense in a manner that is coherent, complete, and by all signs exclusive, there is no ambiguity for the rule of lenity to resolve here.  Pp.1011. 
478 F.3d 658, affirmed.

			"|"BURGESS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 0611429.Argued March 24, 2008Decided April 16, 2008
The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) doubles the mandatory minimum sentence for certain federal drug crimes if the defendant was previously convicted of a felony drug offense.  21 U. S.C. 841(b)(1)(A).  Section 802(13) defines the unadorned term felony to mean any offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony, while 802(44) defines the compound term felony drug offense to mea[n] an offense [involving specified drugs] that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country.


Petitioner Burgess pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, an offense that ordinarily carries a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.  Burgess had a prior South Carolina cocaine possession conviction, which carried a maximum sentence of two years but was classified as a misdemeanor under state law.  The Federal Government argued that Burgess minimum federal sentence should be enhanced to 20 years under 841(b)(1)(A) because his South Carolina conviction was punishable by more than one years imprisonment.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit
No. 0611543.Argued January 15, 2008Decided April 16, 2008
The Armed Career Criminal Act (Act) imposes a special mandatory 15-year prison term upon a felon who unlawfully possesses a firearm and who has three or more prior convictions for committing certain drug crimes or a violent felony.  18 U. S.C. 924(e)(1).  The Act defines violent felony as, inter alia, a crime punishable by more than one years imprisonment that is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (hereinafter clause (ii)).  After petitioner Begay pleaded guilty to felony possession of a firearm, his presentence report revealed he had 12 New Mexico convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), which state law makes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it.  Based on these convictions, the sentencing judge concluded that Begay had three or more violent felony convictions and, therefore, sentenced him to an enhanced 15-year sentence.  The Tenth Circuit rejected Begays claim that DUI is not a violent felony under the Act.
Held: New Mexicos felony DUI crime falls outside the scope of the Acts clause (ii) violent felony definition.  Pp.310.
(a)Whether a crime is a violent felony is determined by how the law defines it and not how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.  Pp. 34.


(b)Even assuming that DUI involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another under clause (ii), the crime falls outside the clauses scope because it is simply too unlike clause (ii)s example crimes to indicate that Congress intended that provision to cover it.  Pp.410.


(i)Clause (ii)s listed examplesburglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosivesshould be read as limiting the crimes the clause covers to those that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.  Their presence in the statute  indicates that Congress meant for the statute to cover only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  If Congress meant the statute to be all encompassing, it would not have needed to include the examples at all.  Moreover, if clause (ii) were meant to include all risky crimes, Congress likely would not have included clause (i), which includes crimes that have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.  And had Congress included the examples solely for quantitative purposes, demonstrating no more than the degree of risk of physical injury sufficient to bring a crime within the statutes scope, it would likely have chosen examples that better illustrated the degree of risk it had in mind rather than these that are far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.  The Governments argument that the word otherwise just after the examples is sufficient to demonstrate that they do not limit the clauses scope is rejected because otherwise can refer to a crime that is, e.g., similar to the examples in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the way or manner in which it produces that risk.  Pp. 47.  


(ii)DUI differs from the example crimes in at least one important respect: The examples typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, whereas DUI statutes typically do not.  When viewed in terms of the Acts purposes, this distinction matters considerably.  The Act looks to past crimes to determine which offenders create a special danger by possessing a gun.  In this respect, a history of crimes involving purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, which shows an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point a gun and pull the trigger, is different from a history of DUI, which does not involve the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.

07-5439|"BAZE etal. v. REES, COMMISSIONER, KENTUCKY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, etal.
certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky
No. 075439.Argued January 7, 2008Decided April 16, 2008
Lethal injection is used for capital punishment by the Federal Government and 36 States, at least 30 of which (including Kentucky) use the same combination of three drugs:The first, sodium thiopental, induces unconsciousness when given in the specified amounts and thereby ensures that the prisoner does not experience any pain associated with the paralysis and cardiac arrest caused by the second and third drugs, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.  Among other things, Kentuckys lethal injection protocol reserves to qualified personnel having at least one years professional experience the responsibility for inserting the intravenous (IV) catheters into the prisoner, leaving it to others to mix the drugs and load them into syringes; specifies that the warden and deputy warden will remain in the execution chamber to observe the prisoner and watch for any IV problems while the execution team administers the drugs from another room; and mandates that if, as determined by the warden and deputy, the prisoner is not unconscious within 60 seconds after the sodium thiopentals delivery, a new dose will be given at a secondary injection site before the second and third drugs are administered.


Petitioners, convicted murderers sentenced to death in Kentucky state court, filed suit asserting that the Commonwealths lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishments.  The state trial court held extensive hearings and entered detailed factfindings and conclusions of law, ruling that there was minimal risk of various of petitioners claims of improper administration of the protocol, and upholding it as constitutional.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the protocol does not violate the Eighth Amendment because it does not create a substantial risk of wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain, torture, or lingering death.  
Held:The judgment is affirmed.
217 S.W. 3d 207, affirmed.  
Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justice  Kennedy and Justice Alito, concluded that Kentuckys lethal injection protocol satisfies the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.824.  


1.To constitute cruel and unusual punishment, an execution method must present a substantial or objectively intolerable risk of serious harm.  A States refusal to adopt proffered alternative procedures may violate the Eighth Amendment only where the alternative procedure is feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.  Pp.814.


(a) This Court has upheld capital punishment as constitutional.  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 177.  Because some risk of pain is inherent in even the most humane execution method, if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure, the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain.  Petitioners contend that the Eighth Amendment prohibits procedures that create an unnecessary risk of pain, while Kentucky urges the Court to approve the substantial risk test used below.  Pp.89.  


(b)This Court has held that the Eighth Amendment forbids punishments of torture,  and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136, such as disemboweling, beheading, quartering, dissecting, and burning alive, all of which share the deliberate infliction of pain for the sake of pain, id., at 135.  Observing also that [p]unishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death[,]  something inhuman and barbarous [and]  more than the mere extinguishment of life, the Court has emphasized that an electrocution statute it was upholding was passed in the effort to devise a more humane method of reaching the result.  In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447.  Pp.910. 


(c)Although conceding that an execution under Kentuckys procedures would be humane and constitutional if performed properly, petitioners claim that there is a significant risk that the procedures will not be properly followedparticularly, that the sodium thiopental will not be properly administered to achieve its intended effectresulting in severe pain when the other chemicals are administered.  Subjecting individuals to a substantial risk of future harm can be cruel and unusual punishment if the conditions presenting the risk are sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers.  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 33, 3435.  To prevail, such a claim must present a substantial risk of serious harm, an objectively intolerable risk of harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 842, 846, and n.9.  For example, the Court has held that an isolated mishap alone does not violate the Eighth Amendment, Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 463464, because such an event, while regrettable, does not suggest cruelty or a substantial risk of serious harm.  Pp.1012. 


(d)Petitioners primary contention is that the risks they have identified can be eliminated by adopting certain alternative procedures.  Because allowing a condemned prisoner to challenge a States execution method merely by showing a slightly or marginally safer alternative finds no support in this Courts cases, would embroil the courts in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise, and would substantially intrude on the role of  state legislatures in implementing execution procedures, petitioners proposed unnecessary risk standard is rejected in favor of Farmers substantial risk of serious harm test.  To effectively address such a substantial risk, a proffered alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.  A States refusal to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages, without a legitimate penological justification for its current execution method, can be viewed as cruel and unusual.  Pp.1214. 


2.Petitioners have not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol, and the failure to adopt untried and untested alternatives, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Pp.1423.


(a)It is uncontested that failing a proper dose of sodium thiopental to render the prisoner unconscious, there is a substantial, constitutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the administration of pancuronium bromide and of pain from potassium chloride.  It is, however, difficult to regard a practice as objectively intolerable when it is in fact widely tolerated.  Probative but not conclusive in this regard is the consensus among the Federal Government and the States that have adopted lethal injection and the specific three-drug combination Kentucky uses.  Pp.1415.


(b)In light of the safeguards Kentuckys protocol puts in place, the risks of administering an inadequate sodium thiopental dose identified by petitioners are not so substantial or imminent as to amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.  The charge that Kentucky employs untrained personnel unqualified to calculate and mix an adequate dose was answered by the state trial courts finding, substantiated by expert testimony, that there would be minimal risk of improper mixing if the manufacturers thiopental package insert instructions were followed.  Likewise, the IV line problems alleged by petitioners do not establish a sufficiently substantial risk because IV team members must have at least one year of relevant professional experience, and the presence of the warden and deputy warden in the execution chamber allows them to watch for IV problems.  If an insufficient dose is initially administered through the primary IV site, an additional dose can be given through the secondary site before the last two drugs are injected.  Pp.1517. 


(c)Nor does Kentuckys failure to adopt petitioners proposed alternatives demonstrate that the state execution procedure is cruel and unusual.  Kentuckys continued use of the three-drug protocol cannot be viewed as posing an objectively intolerable risk when no other State has adopted the one-drug method and petitioners have proffered no study showing that it is an equally effective manner of imposing a death sentence.  Petitioners contend that Kentucky should omit pancuronium bromide because it serves no therapeutic purpose while suppressing muscle movements that could reveal an inadequate administration of sodium thiopental.  The state trial court specifically found that thiopental serves two purposes:(1) preventing involuntary convulsions or seizures during unconsciousness, thereby preserving the procedures dignity, and (2) hastening death.  Petitioners assert that their barbiturate-only protocol is used routinely by veterinarians for putting animals to sleep and that 23 States bar veterinarians from using a neuromuscular paralytic agent like pancuronium bromide.  These arguments overlook the States legitimate interest in providing for a quick, certain death, and in any event, veterinary practice for animals is not an appropriate guide for humane practices for humans.  Petitioners charge that Kentuckys protocol lacks a systematic mechanism, such as a Bispectral Index monitor, blood pressure cuff, or electrocardiogram, for monitoring the prisoners anesthetic depth.  But expert testimony shows both that a proper thiopental does obviates the concern that a prisoner will not be sufficiently sedated, and that each of the proposed alternatives presents its own concerns.  Pp.1723. 


Justice Stevens concluded that instead of ending the controversy, this case will generate debate not only about the constitutionality of the three-drug protocol, and specifically about the justification for the use of pancuronium bromide, but also about the justification for the death penalty itself.  States wishing to decrease the risk that future litigation will delay executions or invalidate their protocol would do well to reconsider their continued use of pancuronium bromide.  Moreover, although experience demonstrates that imposing that penalty constitutes the pointless and needless extinction of life with only negligible social or public returns, this conclusion does not justify a refusal to respect this Courts precedents upholding the death penalty and establishing a framework for evaluating the constitutionality of particular execution methods, under which petitioners evidence fails to prove that Kentuckys protocol violates the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.118.


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that the pluralitys formulation of the governing standard finds no support in the original understanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause or in this Courts previous method-of-execution cases; casts constitutional doubt on long-accepted methods of execution; and injects the Court into matters it has no institutional capacity to resolve.  The historical practices leading to the Clauses inclusion in the Bill of Rights, the views of early commentators on the Constitution, and this Courts cases, see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135136, all demonstrate that an execution method violates the Eighth Amendment only if it is deliberately designed to inflict pain.  Judged under that standard, this is an easy case: Because it is undisputed that Kentucky adopted its lethal injection protocol in an effort to make capital punishment more humane, not to add elements of terror, pain, or disgrace to the death penalty, petitioners challenge must fail.  Pp.115.  


Justice Breyer concluded that there cannot be found, either in the record or in the readily available literature, sufficient grounds to believe that Kentuckys lethal injection method creates a significant risk of unnecessary suffering.  Although the death penalty has serious riskse.g., that the wrong person may be executed, that unwarranted animus about the victims race, for example, may play a role, and that those convicted will find themselves on death row for many yearsthe penaltys lawfulness is not before the Court.  And petitioners proof and evidence, while giving rise to legitimate concern, do not show that Kentuckys execution method amounts to cruel and unusual punishmen[t].  Pp.17.

A States refusal to adopt proffered alternative procedures may violate the Eighth Amendment only where the alternative procedure is feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.  Pp.814.


(a) This Court has upheld capital punishment as constitutional.  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 177.  Because some risk of pain is inherent in even the most humane execution method, if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure, the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain.  Petitioners contend that the Eighth Amendment prohibits procedures that create an unnecessary risk of pain, while Kentucky urges the Court to approve the substantial risk test used below.  Pp.89.  


(b)This Court has held that the Eighth Amendment forbids punishments of torture,  and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136, such as disemboweling, beheading, quartering, dissecting, and burning alive, all of which share the deliberate infliction of pain for the sake of pain, id., at 135.  Observing also that [p]unishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death[,]  something inhuman and barbarous [and]  more than the mere extinguishment of life, the Court has emphasized that an electrocution statute it was upholding was passed in the effort to devise a more humane method of reaching the result.  In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447.  Pp.910. 


(c)Although conceding that an execution under Kentuckys procedures would be humane and constitutional if performed properly, petitioners claim that there is a significant risk that the procedures will not be properly followedparticularly, that the sodium thiopental will not be properly administered to achieve its intended effectresulting in severe pain when the other chemicals are administered.  Subjecting individuals to a substantial risk of future harm can be cruel and unusual punishment if the conditions presenting the risk are sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers.  Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 33, 3435.  To prevail, such a claim must present a substantial risk of serious harm, an objectively intolerable risk of harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 842, 846, and n.9.  For example, the Court has held that an isolated mishap alone does not violate the Eighth Amendment, Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 463464, because such an event, while regrettable, does not suggest cruelty or a substantial risk of serious harm.  Pp.1012. 


(d)Petitioners primary contention is that the risks they have identified can be eliminated by adopting certain alternative procedures.  Because allowing a condemned prisoner to challenge a States execution method merely by showing a slightly or marginally safer alternative finds no support in this Courts cases, would embroil the courts in ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise, and would substantially intrude on the role of  state legislatures in implementing execution procedures, petitioners proposed unnecessary risk standard is rejected in favor of Farmers substantial risk of serious harm test.  To effectively address such a substantial risk, a proffered alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.  A States refusal to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages, without a legitimate penological justification for its current execution method, can be viewed as cruel and unusual.  Pp.1214. 


2.Petitioners have not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol, and the failure to adopt untried and untested alternatives, constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Pp.1423.


(a)It is uncontested that failing a proper dose of sodium thiopental to render the prisoner unconscious, there is a substantial, constitutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the administration of pancuronium bromide and of pain from potassium chloride.  It is, however, difficult to regard a practice as objectively intolerable when it is in fact widely tolerated.  Probative but not conclusive in this regard is the consensus among the Federal Government and the States that have adopted lethal injection and the specific three-drug combination Kentucky uses.  Pp.1415.


(b)In light of the safeguards Kentuckys protocol puts in place, the risks of administering an inadequate sodium thiopental dose identified by petitioners are not so substantial or imminent as to amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.  The charge that Kentucky employs untrained personnel unqualified to calculate and mix an adequate dose was answered by the state trial courts finding, substantiated by expert testimony, that there would be minimal risk of improper mixing if the manufacturers thiopental package insert instructions were followed.  Likewise, the IV line problems alleged by petitioners do not establish a sufficiently substantial risk because IV team members must have at least one year of relevant professional experience, and the presence of the warden and deputy warden in the execution chamber allows them to watch for IV problems.  If an insufficient dose is initially administered through the primary IV site, an additional dose can be given through the secondary site before the last two drugs are injected.  Pp.1517. 


(c)Nor does Kentuckys failure to adopt petitioners proposed alternatives demonstrate that the state execution procedure is cruel and unusual.  Kentuckys continued use of the three-drug protocol cannot be viewed as posing an objectively intolerable risk when no other State has adopted the one-drug method and petitioners have proffered no study showing that it is an equally effective manner of imposing a death sentence.  Petitioners contend that Kentucky should omit pancuronium bromide because it serves no therapeutic purpose while suppressing muscle movements that could reveal an inadequate administration of sodium thiopental.  The state trial court specifically found that thiopental serves two purposes:(1) preventing involuntary convulsions or seizures during unconsciousness, thereby preserving the procedures dignity, and (2) hastening death.  Petitioners assert that their barbiturate-only protocol is used routinely by veterinarians for putting animals to sleep and that 23 States bar veterinarians from using a neuromuscular paralytic agent like pancuronium bromide.  These arguments overlook the States legitimate interest in providing for a quick, certain death, and in any event, veterinary practice for animals is not an appropriate guide for humane practices for humans.  Petitioners charge that Kentuckys protocol lacks a systematic mechanism, such as a Bispectral Index monitor, blood pressure cuff, or electrocardiogram, for monitoring the prisoners anesthetic depth.  But expert testimony shows both that a proper thiopental does obviates the concern that a prisoner will not be sufficiently sedated, and that each of the proposed alternatives presents its own concerns.  Pp.1723. 


Justice Stevens concluded that instead of ending the controversy, this case will generate debate not only about the constitutionality of the three-drug protocol, and specifically about the justification for the use of pancuronium bromide, but also about the justification for the death penalty itself.  States wishing to decrease the risk that future litigation will delay executions or invalidate their protocol would do well to reconsider their continued use of pancuronium bromide.  Moreover, although experience demonstrates that imposing that penalty constitutes the pointless and needless extinction of life with only negligible social or public returns, this conclusion does not justify a refusal to respect this Courts precedents upholding the death penalty and establishing a framework for evaluating the constitutionality of particular execution methods, under which petitioners evidence fails to prove that Kentuckys protocol violates the Eighth Amendment.  Pp.118.


Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that the pluralitys formulation of the governing standard finds no support in the original understanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause or in this Courts previous method-of-execution cases; casts constitutional doubt on long-accepted methods of execution; and injects the Court into matters it has no institutional capacity to resolve.  The historical practices leading to the Clauses inclusion in the Bill of Rights, the views of early commentators on the Constitution, and this Courts cases, see, e.g., Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135136, all demonstrate that an execution method violates the Eighth Amendment only if it is deliberately designed to inflict pain.  Judged under that standard, this is an easy case: Because it is undisputed that Kentucky adopted its lethal injection protocol in an effort to make capital punishment more humane, not to add elements of terror, pain, or disgrace to the death penalty, petitioners challenge must fail.  Pp.115.  


Justice Breyer concluded that there cannot be found, either in the record or in the readily available literature, sufficient grounds to believe that Kentuckys lethal injection method creates a significant risk of unnecessary suffering.  Although the death penalty has serious riskse.g., that the wrong person may be executed, that unwarranted animus about the victims race, for example, may play a role, and that those convicted will find themselves on death row for many yearsthe penaltys lawfulness is not before the Court.  And petitioners proof and evidence, while giving rise to legitimate concern, do not show that Kentuckys execution method amounts to cruel and unusual punishmen[t].  Pp.17.

REVENUE etal.
certiorari to the appellate court of illinois, first district
No. 061413.Argued January 16, 2008Decided April 15, 2008
A State may tax an apportioned share of the value generated by a multistate enterprises intrastate and extrastate activities that form part of a unitary business.  Hunt-Wesson, Inc. v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 528 U. S. 458, 460.  Illinois taxed a capital gain realized by Mead, an Ohio corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner, when Mead sold its Lexis business division.  Mead paid the tax and sued in state court.  The trial court found that Lexis and Mead were not unitary because they were not functionally integrated or centrally managed and enjoyed no economies of scale.  It nevertheless concluded that Illinois could tax an apportioned share of Meads capital gain because Lexis served an operational purpose in Meads business.  Affirming, the State Appellate Court found that Lexis served an operational function in Meads business and thus did not address whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business.  
Held:  
1.The state courts erred in considering whether Lexis served an operational purpose in Meads business after determining that Lexis and Mead were not unitary.  Pp. 613.


(a)The Commerce and Due Process Clauses impose distinct but parallel limitations on a States power to tax out-of-state activities, and each subsumes the broad inquiry whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state, ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho Tax Commn, 458 U. S. 307, 315.  Because the taxpayer here did business in the taxing State, the inquiry shifts from whether the State may tax to what it may tax.  Under the unitary business principle developed to answer that question, a State need not isolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business but may tax an apportioned sum of the corporations multistate business if the business is unitary.  Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768, 772.  Pp.68.


(b)To address the problem arising from the emergence of multistate business enterprises such as railroad and telegraph companiesnamely, that a State could not tax its fair share of such a business value by simply taxing the capital within its bordersthe unitary business principle shifted the constitutional inquiry from the niceties of geographic accounting to the determination of a taxpayers business unit.  If the value the State wished to tax derived from a unitary business operated within and without the State, the State could tax an apportioned share of that business value instead of isolating the value attributable to the intrastate operation.  E.g., Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 223.  But if the value derived from a discrete business enterprise, Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 439, the State could not tax even an apportioned share.  E.g., Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 165166.  This principle was extended to a multistate business that lacked the physical unity of wires or rails but exhibited the same unity in the use of the entire property for the specific purpose, with the same elements of value arising from such use, Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, 165 U. S. 194, 221; and it has justified apportioned taxation of net income, dividends, capital gain, and other intangibles.  Confronting the problem of how to determine exactly when a business is unitary, this Court found in Allied-Signal that the principle is not so inflexible that as new [finance] methods  and new [business] forms  evolve it cannot be modified or supplemented where appropriate, 504 U. S., at 786, and explained that situations could occur in which apportionment might be constitutional even though the payee and the payor [were] not  engaged in the same unitary business, id., at 787.  In that context, the Court observed that an asset could form part of a taxpayers unitary business if it served an operational rather than an investment function in the business, ibid.; and noted that Container Corp., supra, at 180, n.19, made the same point.  Pp.811.


(c)Thus, the operational function references in Container Corp. and Allied-Signal were not intended to modify the unitary business principle by adding a new apportionment ground.  The operational function concept simply recognizes that an asset can be a part of a taxpayers unitary business even without a unitary relationship between the payor and payee.  In Allied-Signal and in Corn Products Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U. S. 46, the conclusion that an asset served an operational function was merely instrumental to the constitutionally relevant conclusion that the asset was a unitary part of the business conducted in the taxing State rather than a discrete asset to which the State had no claim.  Container Corp. and Allied-Signal did not announce a new ground for constitutional apportionment, and the Illinois Appellate Court erred in concluding otherwise.  Here, where the asset is another business, a unitary relationships hallmarks are functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale.  See Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at 438.  The trial court found each hallmark lacking in finding that Lexis was not a unitary part of Meads business.  However, the appellate court made no such determination.  Relying on its operational function test, it reserved the unitary business question, which it may take up on remand.  Pp.1113. 


2.Because the alternative ground for affirmance urged by the State and its amicithat the record amply demonstrates that Lexis did substantial business in Illinois and that Lexis own contacts with the State suffice to justify the apportionment of Meads capital gainwas neither raised nor passed upon in the state courts, it will not be addressed here.  The case for restraint is particularly compelling here, since the question may impact other jurisdictions laws.  Pp.1314.
371 Ill. App. 3d 108, 861 N.E. 2d 1131, vacated and remanded.
Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.  Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 07308.Argued March 24, 2008Decided April 15, 2008
The Internal Revenue Code requires a taxpayer seeking a refund of taxes unlawfully assessed to file an administrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) before filing suit against the Government, see 26 U. S.C. 7422(a).  Such claim must be filed within three years of the filing of a tax return or two years of the taxs payment, whichever is later, see 6511(a).  In contrast, the Tucker Act allows claims to be brought against the Government within six years of the challenged conduct.  Respondent coal companies paid taxes on coal exports under a portion of the Code later invalidated under the Export Clause of the Constitution.  They filed timely administrative claims and recovered refunds of their 19971999 taxes, but sought a refund of their 19941996 taxes in the Court of Federal Claims without complying with the Codes refund procedures.  Nevertheless, the court allowed them to proceed directly under the Export Clause and the Tucker Act.  Affirming in relevant part, the Federal Circuit ruled that the companies could pursue their Export Clause claim despite their failure to file timely administrative refund claims.
Held:The plain language of 26 U. S.C. 7422(a) and 6511 requires a taxpayer seeking a refund for a tax assessed in violation of the Export Clause, just as for any other unlawfully assessed tax, to file a timely administrative refund claim before bringing suit against the Government.  Pp.412.
(a)Because the companies did not file a refund claim with the IRS for the 19941996 taxes, they may, under 7422(a), bring [n]o suit in any court to recover any internal revenue tax or any sum alleged to have been wrongfully collected in any manner.  Moreover, 6511s time limits for filing administrative refund claimsset forth in an unusually emphatic form, United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350apply to any tax imposed by [Title 26], 6511(a) (emphasis added).  Contrary to the companies claim that these statutes are ambiguous, the provisions clearly state that taxpayers must comply with the Codes refund scheme before bringing suit, including the filing of a timely administrative claim.  Indeed, this question was all but decided in United States v. A. S. Kreider Co., 313 U. S. 443, where the Court held that the limitations period in the Revenue Act then in effect, not the Tucker Acts longer period, applied to tax refund actions.  As was the case there, the current Codes refund scheme would have no meaning whatever, id., at 448, if taxpayers failing to comply with it were nonetheless allowed to bring suit subject only to the Tucker Acts longer time bar.  Pp.46.


(b)The companies nonetheless assert that their claims are exempt from the Code provisions broad sweep because the claims derive from the Export Clause.  The principles that a constitutional claim can become time-barred just as any other claim can, Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 292, and that Congress has the authority to require administrative exhaustion before allowing a suit against the Government, even for a constitutional violation, see, e.g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1018, are fully applicable to unconstitutional taxation claims.  The companies attempt to distinguish Export Clause claims on the ground that the Clause is not simply a limitation on taxing authority but a prohibition carving particular economic activity out of Congresss power is without substance and totally manipulable.  There is no basis for treating taxes collected in violation of that Clause differently from taxes challenged on other grounds.  Because the companies acknowledge that their claims are subject to the Tucker Acts time bar, the question is not whether their refund claim can be limited, but rather which limitation applies.  Their argument that, despite explicit and expansive statutory language, the Codes refund scheme does not apply to their case as a matter of statutory interpretation is unavailing.  They claim that Congress could not have intended it to apply a constitutionally dubious refund scheme to taxes assessed in violation of the Export Clause, but the statutory language emphatically covers the facts of this case.  In any event, there is no constitutional problem.  Congresss detailed scheme is designed to advise the appropriate officials of the demands or claims intended to be asserted, so as to insure an orderly administration of the revenue, United States v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., 283 U. S. 269, 272, to provide that refund claims are made promptly, and to allow the IRS to avoid unnecessary litigation by correcting conceded errors.  Even when a taxs constitutionality is challenged, taxing authorities have an exceedingly strong interest in financial stability, McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 37, that they may pursue through provisions of the sort at issue.  There is no reason why invoking the Export Clause would deprive Congress of the power to protect this interest.  The companies claim that the Code procedures are excessively burdensome is belied by their own invocation of those procedures for taxes paid within the Codes limitations period, which resulted in full refunds with interest.  Pp.610.


(c)The companies fallback argumentthat even if the refund scheme applies to Export Clause cases generally, it does not apply when taxes are unconstitutional on their faceis rejected.  Enochs v. Williams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U. S. 1, distinguished.  Pp.1012.

There is no reason why invoking the Export Clause would deprive Congress of the power to protect this interest.

06-984|"MEDELLIN v. TEXAS
certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas
No. 06984.Argued October 10, 2007Decided March 25, 2008
In the Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (Avena), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated Article 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention) by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals, including petitioner Medelln, of their Vienna Convention rights.  The ICJ found that those named individuals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their U. S. state-court convictions and sentences regardless of their failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.  In Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331issued after Avena but involving individuals who were not named in the Avena judgmentthis Court held, contrary to the ICJs determination, that the Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules.  The President then issued a memorandum (Presidents Memorandum or Memorandum) stating that the United States would discharge its international obligations under Avena by having State courts give effect to the decision.


Relying on Avena and the Presidents Memorandum, Medelln filed a second Texas state-court habeas application challenging his state capital murder conviction and death sentence on the ground that he had not been informed of his Vienna Convention rights.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medellns application as an abuse of the writ, concluding that neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the States limitations on filing successive habeas applications.  
Held:Neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  Pp.837.  
1.The Avena judgment is not directly enforceable as domestic law in state court.  Pp.827. 


(a)While a treaty may constitute an international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be self-executing and is ratified on that basis.  See, e.g., Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314.  The Avena judgment creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sourcesthe Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statutecreates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such legislation has been enacted. 


The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision, does not commit signatories to comply therewith, and is silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.N. Charter, which provides that [e]ach  Member  undertakes to comply with the [ICJs] decision  in any case to which it is a party.  The phrase undertakes to comply is simply a commitment by member states to take future action through their political branches.  That language does not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. 


This reading is confirmed by Article 94(2)the enforcement provisionwhich provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the U.N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an express diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts.  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 347.  Even this quintessentially international remed[y], id., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security Council resolution, and the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any such resolution.  Medellns construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.


The ICJ Statute, by limiting disputes to those involving nations, not individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force except between those nations, provides further evidence that the Avena judgment does not automatically constitute federal law enforceable in U. S. courts.  Medelln, an individual, cannot be considered a party to the Avena decision.  Finally, the United States interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight, Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S., at 184185, and the Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.  Pp.817. 


(b)The foregoing interpretive approachparsing a treatys text to determine if it is self-executingis hardly novel.  This Court has long looked to the language of a treaty to determine whether the President who negotiated it and the Senate that ratified it intended for the treaty to automatically create domestically enforceable federal law.  See, e.g., Foster, supra.  Pp.1820. 


(c)The Courts conclusion that Avena does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the postratification understanding of signatory countries.  See Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medelln nor his amici have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.  The lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 343344, and n.3.  


The Courts conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  Given that the forum states procedural rules govern a treatys implementation absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, see e.g., id., at 351, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated any intent to give ICJ judgments such effect.  There is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports this notion.  Moreover, the consequences of Medellns argument give pause: neither Texas nor this Court may look behind an ICJ decision and quarrel with its reasoning or result, despite this Courts holding in Sanchez-Llamas that [n]othing in the [ICJs] structure or purpose  suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on  our courts. id., at 354.  Pp.2024.


(d)The Courts holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments.   An agreement to abide by the result of an international adjudication can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Medelln contends that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments, but the judgment Medelln asks us to enforce is hardly typical: It would enjoin the operation of state law and force the State to take action to review and reconside[r] his case.  Foreign judgments awarding injunctive relief against private parties, let alone sovereign States, are not generally entitled to enforcement.  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States 481, Comment b, p. 595 (1986).  Pp. 2427.


2.The Presidents Memorandum does not independently require the States to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals named in Avena without regard to state procedural default rules.  Pp. 2737.  


(a)The President seeks to vindicate plainly compelling interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law.  But those interests do not allow the Court to set aside first principles.  The Presidents authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585. 


Justice Jacksons familiar tripartite scheme provides the accepted framework for evaluating executive action in this area.  First, [w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, [w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.  Id., at 637.  In such a circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.  Ibid.  Finally, [w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, and the Court can sustain his actions only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.  Id., at 637638.  Pp.2829. 


(b)The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the Presidents authority to establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.  The United States argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the Avena judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an independent international dispute-resolution power.  We find these arguments, as well as Medellns additional argument that the Presidents Memorandum is a valid exercise of his Take Care power, unpersuasive.  Pp.2937.  


(i)The United States maintains that the Presidents Memorandum is implicitly authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.N. Charter.  But the responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress, not the Executive.  Foster, 2 Pet., at 315.  It is a fundamental constitutional principle that [t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.  Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 591.  A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the Presidentacting on his ownto achieve precisely the same result.  Accordingly, the Presidents Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the Youngstown framework.  Indeed, because the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so, the Presidents assertion of authority is within Youngstowns third category, not the first or even the second.


The United States maintains that congressional acquiescence requires that the Presidents Memorandum be given effect as domestic law.  But such acquiescence is pertinent when the Presidents action falls within the second Youngstown category, not the third.  In any event, congressional acquiescence does not exist here.  Congress failure to act following the Presidents resolution of prior ICJ controversies does not demonstrate acquiescence because in none of those prior controversies did the President assert the authority to transform an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displace state law.  The United States reliance on the Presidents related statutory responsibilities and on his established role in litigating foreign policy concerns is also misplaced.  The Presidents statutory authorization to represent the United States before the U.N., the ICJ, and the U.N. Security Council speaks to his international responsibilities, not to any unilateral authority to create domestic law.


The combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation does not preclude the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation by other means, so long as those means are consistent with the Constitution.  But the President may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law.  Pp.3035.  


(ii)The United States also claims thatindependent of the United States treaty obligationsthe Memorandum is a valid exercise of the Presidents foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes.  See, e.g., American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 415.  This Courts claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  They are based on the view that a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, can raise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.  Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 668.  But [p]ast practice does not, by itself, create power.  Ibid.  The Presidents Memoranduma directive issued to state courts that would compel those courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state lawsis not supported by a particularly longstanding practice.  The Executives limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far.  Pp.3537.


(iii)Medellns argument that the Presidents Memorandum is a valid exercise of his power to Take Care that the laws be faithfully executed, U. S. Const., Art. II, 3, fails because the ICJs decision in Avena is not domestic law.  P.37.
223 S.W. 3d 315, affirmed.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medellns application as an abuse of the writ, concluding that neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the States limitations on filing successive habeas applications.  
Held:Neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  Pp.837.  
1.The Avena judgment is not directly enforceable as domestic law in state court.  Pp.827. 


(a)While a treaty may constitute an international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be self-executing and is ratified on that basis.  See, e.g., Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314.  The Avena judgment creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sourcesthe Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statutecreates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such legislation has been enacted. 


The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision, does not commit signatories to comply therewith, and is silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.N. Charter, which provides that [e]ach  Member  undertakes to comply with the [ICJs] decision  in any case to which it is a party.  The phrase undertakes to comply is simply a commitment by member states to take future action through their political branches.  That language does not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. 


This reading is confirmed by Article 94(2)the enforcement provisionwhich provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the U.N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an express diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts.  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 347.  Even this quintessentially international remed[y], id., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security Council resolution, and the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any such resolution.  Medellns construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.


The ICJ Statute, by limiting disputes to those involving nations, not individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force except between those nations, provides further evidence that the Avena judgment does not automatically constitute federal law enforceable in U. S. courts.  Medelln, an individual, cannot be considered a party to the Avena decision.  Finally, the United States interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight, Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S., at 184185, and the Executive Branch has unfailingly adhered to its view that the relevant treaties do not create domestically enforceable federal law.  Pp.817. 


(b)The foregoing interpretive approachparsing a treatys text to determine if it is self-executingis hardly novel.  This Court has long looked to the language of a treaty to determine whether the President who negotiated it and the Senate that ratified it intended for the treaty to automatically create domestically enforceable federal law.  See, e.g., Foster, supra.  Pp.1820. 


(c)The Courts conclusion that Avena does not by itself constitute binding federal law is confirmed by the postratification understanding of signatory countries.  See Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 226.  There are currently 47 nations that are parties to the Optional Protocol and 171 nations that are parties to the Vienna Convention.  Yet neither Medelln nor his amici have identified a single nation that treats ICJ judgments as binding in domestic courts.  The lack of any basis for supposing that any other country would treat ICJ judgments as directly enforceable as a matter of their domestic law strongly suggests that the treaty should not be so viewed in our courts.  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 343344, and n.3.  


The Courts conclusion is further supported by general principles of interpretation.  Given that the forum states procedural rules govern a treatys implementation absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, see e.g., id., at 351, one would expect the ratifying parties to the relevant treaties to have clearly stated any intent to give ICJ judgments such effect.  There is no statement in the Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statute that supports this notion.  Moreover, the consequences of Medellns argument give pause: neither Texas nor this Court may look behind an ICJ decision and quarrel with its reasoning or result, despite this Courts holding in Sanchez-Llamas that [n]othing in the [ICJs] structure or purpose  suggests that its interpretations were intended to be conclusive on  our courts. id., at 354.  Pp.2024.


(d)The Courts holding does not call into question the ordinary enforcement of foreign judgments.   An agreement to abide by the result of an international adjudication can be a treaty obligation like any other, so long as the agreement is consistent with the Constitution.  In addition, Congress is up to the task of implementing non-self-executing treaties, even those involving complex commercial disputes.  Medelln contends that domestic courts generally give effect to foreign judgments, but the judgment Medelln asks us to enforce is hardly typical: It would enjoin the operation of state law and force the State to take action to review and reconside[r] his case.  Foreign judgments awarding injunctive relief against private parties, let alone sovereign States, are not generally entitled to enforcement.  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States 481, Comment b, p. 595 (1986).  Pp. 2427.


2.The Presidents Memorandum does not independently require the States to provide review and reconsideration of the claims of the 51 Mexican nationals named in Avena without regard to state procedural default rules.  Pp. 2737.  


(a)The President seeks to vindicate plainly compelling interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of international law.  But those interests do not allow the Court to set aside first principles.  The Presidents authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585. 


Justice Jacksons familiar tripartite scheme provides the accepted framework for evaluating executive action in this area.  First, [w]hen the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 635 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Second, [w]hen the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain.  Id., at 637.  In such a circumstance, Presidential authority can derive support from congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence.  Ibid.  Finally, [w]hen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, and the Court can sustain his actions only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.  Id., at 637638.  Pp.2829. 


(b)The United States marshals two principal arguments in favor of the Presidents authority to establish binding rules of decision that preempt contrary state law.  The United States argues that the relevant treaties give the President the authority to implement the Avena judgment and that Congress has acquiesced in the exercise of such authority.  The United States also relies upon an independent international dispute-resolution power.  We find these arguments, as well as Medellns additional argument that the Presidents Memorandum is a valid exercise of his Take Care power, unpersuasive.  Pp.2937.  


(i)The United States maintains that the Presidents Memorandum is implicitly authorized by the Optional Protocol and the U.N. Charter.  But the responsibility for transforming an international obligation arising from a non-self-executing treaty into domestic law falls to Congress, not the Executive.  Foster, 2 Pet., at 315.  It is a fundamental constitutional principle that [t]he power to make the necessary laws is in Congress; the power to execute in the President.  Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 591.  A non-self-executing treaty, by definition, is one that was ratified with the understanding that it is not to have domestic effect of its own force.  That understanding precludes the assertion that Congress has implicitly authorized the Presidentacting on his ownto achieve precisely the same result.  Accordingly, the Presidents Memorandum does not fall within the first category of the Youngstown framework.  Indeed, because the non-self-executing character of the relevant treaties not only refutes the notion that the ratifying parties vested the President with the authority to unilaterally make treaty obligations binding on domestic courts, but also implicitly prohibits him from doing so, the Presidents assertion of authority is within Youngstowns third category, not the first or even the second.


The United States maintains that congressional acquiescence requires that the Presidents Memorandum be given effect as domestic law.  But such acquiescence is pertinent when the Presidents action falls within the second Youngstown category, not the third.  In any event, congressional acquiescence does not exist here.  Congress failure to act following the Presidents resolution of prior ICJ controversies does not demonstrate acquiescence because in none of those prior controversies did the President assert the authority to transform an international obligation into domestic law and thereby displace state law.  The United States reliance on the Presidents related statutory responsibilities and on his established role in litigating foreign policy concerns is also misplaced.  The Presidents statutory authorization to represent the United States before the U.N., the ICJ, and the U.N. Security Council speaks to his international responsibilities, not to any unilateral authority to create domestic law.


The combination of a non-self-executing treaty and the lack of implementing legislation does not preclude the President from acting to comply with an international treaty obligation by other means, so long as those means are consistent with the Constitution.  But the President may not rely upon a non-self-executing treaty to establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law.  Pp.3035.  


(ii)The United States also claims thatindependent of the United States treaty obligationsthe Memorandum is a valid exercise of the Presidents foreign affairs authority to resolve claims disputes.  See, e.g., American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 415.  This Courts claims-settlement cases involve a narrow set of circumstances: the making of executive agreements to settle civil claims between American citizens and foreign governments or foreign nationals.  They are based on the view that a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned, can raise a presumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.  Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 668.  But [p]ast practice does not, by itself, create power.  Ibid.  The Presidents Memoranduma directive issued to state courts that would compel those courts to reopen final criminal judgments and set aside neutrally applicable state lawsis not supported by a particularly longstanding practice.  The Executives limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far.  Pp.3537.


(iii)Medellns argument that the Presidents Memorandum is a valid exercise of his power to Take Care that the laws be faithfully executed, U. S. Const., Art. II, 3, fails because the ICJs decision in Avena is not domestic law.  P.37.
223 S.W. 3d 315, affirmed.

			"|"MEDELLIN v. TEXAS
certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas
No. 06984.Argued October 10, 2007Decided March 25, 2008
In the Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (Avena), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held that the United States had violated Article 36(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention or Convention) by failing to inform 51 named Mexican nationals, including petitioner Medelln, of their Vienna Convention rights.  The ICJ found that those named individuals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their U. S. state-court convictions and sentences regardless of their failure to comply with generally applicable state rules governing challenges to criminal convictions.  In Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U. S. 331issued after Avena but involving individuals who were not named in the Avena judgmentthis Court held, contrary to the ICJs determination, that the Convention did not preclude the application of state default rules.  The President then issued a memorandum (Presidents Memorandum or Memorandum) stating that the United States would discharge its international obligations under Avena by having State courts give effect to the decision.


Relying on Avena and the Presidents Memorandum, Medelln filed a second Texas state-court habeas application challenging his state capital murder conviction and death sentence on the ground that he had not been informed of his Vienna Convention rights.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed Medellns application as an abuse of the writ, concluding that neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum was binding federal law that could displace the States limitations on filing successive habeas applications.  
Held:Neither Avena nor the Presidents Memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of successive habeas petitions.  Pp.837.  
1.The Avena judgment is not directly enforceable as domestic law in state court.  Pp.827. 


(a)While a treaty may constitute an international commitment, it is not binding domestic law unless Congress has enacted statutes implementing it or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be self-executing and is ratified on that basis.  See, e.g., Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314.  The Avena judgment creates an international law obligation on the part of the United States, but it is not automatically binding domestic law because none of the relevant treaty sourcesthe Optional Protocol, the U.N. Charter, or the ICJ Statutecreates binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation, and no such legislation has been enacted. 


The most natural reading of the Optional Protocol is that it is a bare grant of jurisdiction.  The Protocol says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision, does not commit signatories to comply therewith, and is silent as to any enforcement mechanism.  The obligation to comply with ICJ judgments is derived from Article 94 of the U.N. Charter, which provides that [e]ach  Member  undertakes to comply with the [ICJs] decision  in any case to which it is a party.  The phrase undertakes to comply is simply a commitment by member states to take future action through their political branches.  That language does not indicate that the Senate, in ratifying the Optional Protocol, intended to vest ICJ decisions with immediate legal effect in domestic courts. 


This reading is confirmed by Article 94(2)the enforcement provisionwhich provides the sole remedy for noncompliance: referral to the U.N. Security Council by an aggrieved state.  The provision of an express diplomatic rather than judicial remedy is itself evidence that ICJ judgments were not meant to be enforceable in domestic courts.  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U. S., at 347.  Even this quintessentially international remed[y], id., at 355, is not absolute.  It requires a Security Council resolution, and the President and Senate were undoubtedly aware that the United States retained the unqualified right to exercise its veto of any such resolution.  Medellns construction would eliminate the option of noncompliance contemplated by Article 94(2), undermining the ability of the political branches to determine whether and how to comply with an ICJ judgment.


The ICJ Statute, by limiting disputes to those involving nations, not individuals, and by specifying that ICJ decisions have no binding force except between those nations, provides further evidence that the Avena judgment does not automatically constitute federal law enforceable in U. S. courts.  Medelln, an individual, cannot be considered a party to the Avena decision.  Finally, the United States interpretation of a treaty is entitled to great weight, Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U.

06-989|"HALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L. L. C. v. MATTEL, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06989.Argued November 7, 2007Decided March 25, 2008
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.C. 911, provides expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards.  Under 9, a court must confirm an award unless it is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in 10 and 11.  Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, including where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means, and where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct, or exceeded their powers.  Under 11, the grounds for modifying or correcting an award include evident material miscalculation, evident material mistake, and imperfect[ions] in [a] matter of form not affecting the merits.


After a bench trial sustained respondent tenants (Mattel) right to terminate its lease with petitioner landlord (Hall Street), the parties proposed to arbitrate Hall Streets claim for indemnification of the costs of cleaning up the lease site.  The District Court approved, and entered as an order, the parties arbitration agreement, which, inter alia, required the court to vacate, modify, or correct any award if the arbitrators conclusions of law were erroneous.  The arbitrator decided for Mattel, but the District Court vacated the award for legal error, expressly invoking the agreements legal-error review standard and citing the Ninth Circuits LaPine decision for the proposition that the FAA allows parties to draft a contract dictating an alternative review standard.  On remand, the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street, and the District Court largely upheld the award, again applying the parties stipulated review standard.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding the case controlled by its Kyocera decision, which had overruled LaPine on the ground that arbitration-agreement terms fixing the mode of judicial review are unenforceable, given the exclusive grounds for vacatur and modification provided by FAA 10 and 11.   
Held: 
1.The FAAs grounds for prompt vacatur and modification of awards are exclusive for parties seeking expedited review under the FAA.  The Court rejects Hall Streets two arguments to the contrary.  First, Hall Street submits that expandable judicial review has been accepted as the law since Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427.  Although a Wilko statementthe interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation, id., at 436437 (emphasis added)arguably favors Hall Streets position, arguable is as far as it goes.  Quite apart from the leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the Wilko statement expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrators legal errors.  Moreover, Wilkos phrasing is too vague to support Hall Streets interpretation, since manifest disregard can be read as merely referring to the 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them, see, e.g., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 656, or as shorthand for the 10 subsections authorizing vacatur when arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or exceeded their powers.  Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is motivated by a congressional desire to enforce such agreements.  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 220.  This argument comes up short because, although there may be a general policy favoring arbitration, the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review once the arbitration is over.  Even assuming 10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand their uniformly narrow stated grounds to the point of legal review generally.  But 9 makes evident that expanding 10s and 11s detailed categories at all would rub too much against the grain: 9 carries no hint of flexibility in unequivocally telling courts that they must confirm an arbitral award, unless it is vacated or modified as prescribed by 10 and 11.  Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see 911 as the substance of a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitrations essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.  Dean Witter, supra, at 217, 219, distinguished.  Pp.712.


2.In holding the 10 and 11 grounds exclusive with regard to enforcement under the FAAs expedited judicial review mechanisms, this Court decides nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of awards.  Accordingly, this case must be remanded for consideration of independent issues.  Because the arbitration agreement was entered into during litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of litigation procedure, and was adopted by the court as an order, there is some question whether it should be treated as an exercise of the District Courts authority to manage its cases under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16.  This Court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue, but the parties supplemental arguments implicate issues that have not been considered previously in this litigation and could not be well addressed for the first time here.  Thus, the Court expresses no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand.  Pp.1315.

Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is motivated by a congressional desire to enforce such agreements.  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 220.  This argument comes up short because, although there may be a general policy favoring arbitration, the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review once the arbitration is over.  Even assuming 10 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand their uniformly narrow stated grounds to the point of legal review generally.  But 9 makes evident that expanding 10s and 11s detailed categories at all would rub too much against the grain: 9 carries no hint of flexibility in unequivocally telling courts that they must confirm an arbitral award, unless it is vacated or modified as prescribed by 10 and 11.  Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see 911 as the substance of a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitrations essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.  Dean Witter, supra, at 217, 219, distinguished.  Pp.712.


2.In holding the 10 and 11 grounds exclusive with regard to enforcement under the FAAs expedited judicial review mechanisms, this Court decides nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of awards.  Accordingly, this case must be remanded for consideration of independent issues.  Because the arbitration agreement was entered into during litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of litigation procedure, and was adopted by the court as an order, there is some question whether it should be treated as an exercise of the District Courts authority to manage its cases under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16.  This Court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue, but the parties supplemental arguments implicate issues that have not been considered previously in this litigation and could not be well addressed for the first time here.  Thus, the Court expresses no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand.  Pp.1315.

certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana
No. 0610119.Argued December 4, 2007Decided March 19, 2008
During voir dire in petitioners capital murder case, the prosecutor used peremptory strikes to eliminate black prospective jurors who had survived challenges for cause.  The jury convicted petitioner and sentenced him to death.  Both on direct appeal and on remand in light of Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U. S. 231, the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected petitioners claim that the prosecutions peremptory strikes of certain prospective jurors, including Mr. Brooks, were based on race, in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79.
 Held:The trial judge committed clear error in rejecting the Batson objection to the strike of Mr. Brooks.  Pp.313.  
(a)Under Batsons three-step process for adjudicating claims such as petitioners, (1) a defendant must make a prima facie showing that the challenge was based on race; (2) if so, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question; and (3) in light of the parties submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.  Miller-El, supra, at 277 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 328329).  Unless it is clearly erroneous, the trial courts ruling must be sustained on appeal.  The trial courts role is pivotal, for it must evaluate the demeanor of the prosecutor exercising the challenge and the juror being excluded.  Pp.34.


(b)While all of the circumstances bearing on the racial-animosity issue must be consulted in considering a Batson objection or reviewing a ruling claimed to be a Batson error, the explanation given for striking Mr. Brooks, a college senior attempting to fulfill his student-teaching obligation, is insufficient by itself and suffices for a Batson error determination.  Pp.413.


(1)It cannot be presumed that the trial court credited the prosecutions first race-neutral reason, that Mr. Brooks looked nervous.  Deference is owed to a trial judges finding that an attorney credibly relied on demeanor in exercising a strike, but here, the trial judge simply allowed the challenge without explanation.  Since Mr. Brooks was not challenged until the day after he was questioned and thus after dozens of other jurors had been called, the judge might not have recalled his demeanor.  Or he may have found such consideration unnecessary, instead basing his ruling on the second proffered reason for the strike.  P.6.


(2)That reasonMr. Brooks student-teaching obligationfails even under the highly deferential standard of review applicable here.  Mr. Brooks was 1 of more than 50 venire members expressing concern that jury service or sequestration would interfere with work, school, family, or other obligations.  Although he was initially concerned about making up lost teaching time, he expressed no further concern once a law clerk reported that the schools dean would work with Mr. Brooks if he missed time for a trial that week, and the prosecutor did not question him more deeply about the matter.  The proffered reason must be evaluated in light of the circumstances that the colloquy and law clerk report took place on Tuesday, the prosecution struck Mr. Brooks on Wednesday, the trials guilt phase ended on Thursday, and its penalty phase ended on Friday.  The prosecutors scenariothat Mr. Brooks would have been inclined to find petitioner guilty of a lesser included offense to obviate the need for a penalty phaseis both highly speculative and unlikely.  Mr. Brooks would be in a position to shorten the trial only if most or all of the jurors had favored a lesser verdict.  Perhaps most telling, the trials brevity, which the prosecutor anticipated on the record during voir dire, meant that jury service would not have seriously interfered with Mr. Brooks ability to complete his student teaching.  The dean offered to work with him, and the trial occurred relatively early in the fall term, giving Mr. Brooks several weeks to make up the time.  The implausibility of the prosecutors explanation is reinforced by his acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks.  Under Batsons third stage, the prosecutions pretextual explanation gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  There is no need to decide here whether, in Batson cases, once a discriminatory intent is shown to be a motivating factor, the burden shifts to the prosecution to show that the discriminatory factor was not determinative.  It is enough to recognize that a peremptory strike shown to have been motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent could not be sustained based on any lesser showing by the prosecution.  The record here does not show that the prosecution would have pre-emptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on his nervousness alone, and there is no realistic possibility that the subtle question of causation could be profitably explored further on remand more than a decade after petitioners trial.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 06713.Argued October 1, 2007Decided March 18, 2008
After the Ninth Circuit invalidated Washingtons blanket primary system on the ground that it was nearly identical to the California system struck down in California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, state voters passed an initiative (I872), providing that candidates must be identified on the primary ballot by their self-designated party preference; that voters may vote for any candidate; and that the two top votegetters for each office, regardless of party preference, advance to the general election.  Respondent political parties claim that the new law, on its face, violates a partys associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse.  The District Court granted respondents summary judgment, enjoining I872s implementation.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
Held:I872 is facially constitutional.  Pp.616.
(a)Facial challenges, which require a showing that a law is unconstitutional in all of its applications, are disfavored: They often rest on speculation; they run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied, Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 483; and they threaten to shortcircuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented consistent with the Constitution.  Pp.68.


(b)If I872 severely burdens associational rights, it is subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581, 586.  Contrary to petitioners argument, this Courts presumption in Jonesthat a nonpartisan blanket primary where the top two votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of party would be a less restrictive alternative to Californias system because it would not nominate candidatesis not dispositive here.  There, the Court had no occasion to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidates party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties nominees.  Respondents arguments that I872 imposes a severe burden are flawed.  They claim that the law is unconstitutional under Jones because it allows primary voters unaffiliated with a party to choose the partys nominee, thus violating the partys right to choose its own standard bearer.  Unlike Californias primary, however, the I872 primary does not, by its terms, choose the parties nominees.  The choice of a party representative does not occur under I872.  The two top primary candidates proceed to the general election regardless of their party preferences.  Whether the parties nominate their own candidate outside the state-run primary is irrelevant.  Respondents counter that voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are their preferred nominees; and that even if voters do not make that assumption, they will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, the nominees.  However, those claims depend not on any facial requirement of I872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning of the party-preference designation.  This is sheer speculation.  Even if voters could possibly misinterpret the designations, I872 cannot be struck down in a facial challenge based on the mere possibility of voter confusion.  The State could implement I872 in a variety of ways, e.g., through ballot design, that would eliminate any real threat of confusion.  And without the specter of widespread voter confusion, respondents forced association and compelled speech arguments fall flat.  Pp.815.


(c)Because I872 does not severely burden respondents, the State need not assert a compelling interest.  Its interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot is easily sufficient to sustain the provision.  P.15.

06-1509|"BOULWARE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 061509.Argued January 8, 2008Decided March 3, 2008
One element of tax evasion under 26 U. S.C. 7201 is the existence of a tax deficiency.  Sansone v. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 351.  Petitioner Boulware was charged with criminal tax evasion and filing a false income tax return for diverting funds from a closely held corporation, HIE, of which he was the president, founder, and controlling shareholder.  To support his argument that the Government could not establish the tax deficiency required to convict him, Boulware sought to introduce evidence that HIE had no earnings and profits in the relevant taxable years, so he in effect received distributions of property that were returns of capital, up to his basis in his stock, which are not taxable, see 26 U. S.C. 301 and 316(a).  Under 301(a), unless the Internal Revenue Code requires otherwise, a distribution of property made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock shall be treated in the manner provided in [301(c)].  Section 301(c) provides that the portion of the distribution that is a dividend, as defined by 316(a), must be included in the recipients gross income; and the portion that is not a dividend is, depending on the shareholders basis for his stock, either a nontaxable return of capital or a taxable capital gain.  Section 316(a) defines dividend as a distribution out of earnings and profits.  The District Court granted the Governments in limine motion to bar evidence supporting Boulwares return-of-capital theory, relying on the Ninth Circuits Miller decision that a diversion of funds in a criminal tax evasion case may be deemed a return of capital only if the taxpayer or corporation demonstrates that the distributions were intended to be such a return.  The court later found Boulwares proffer of evidence insufficient under Miller and declined to instruct the jury on his theory.  In affirming his conviction, the Ninth Circuit held that Boulwares proffer was properly rejected under Miller because he offered no proof that the amounts diverted were intended as a return of capital when they were made.
Held:A distributee accused of criminal tax evasion may claim return-of-capital treatment without producing evidence that, when the distribution occurred, either he or the corporation intended a return of capital.  Pp.617.
(a)Tax classifications like dividend and return of capital turn on a transactions objective economic realities, not the particular form the parties employed.  Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, 435 U. S. 561, 573.  In economic reality, a shareholders informal receipt of corporate property  may be as effective a means of distributing profits among stockholders as the formal declaration of a dividend, Palmer v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 63, 69, or as effective a means of returning a shareholders capital, see ibid.  Economic substance remains the touchstone for characterizing funds that a shareholder diverts before they can be recorded on a corporations books.  Pp.68.


(b)Millers view that a return-of-capital defense requires evidence of a corresponding contemporaneous intent sits uncomfortably not only with the tax laws economic realism, but also with the particular wording of 301 and 316(a).  As these sections are written, the tax consequences of a corporations distribution made with respect to stock depend, not on anyones purpose to return capital or get it back, but on facts wholly independent of intent: whether the corporation had earnings and profits, and the amount of the taxpayers basis for his stock.  The Miller court could claim no textual hook for its contemporaneous intent requirement, but argued that it avoided supposed anomalies.  The court, however, mistakenly reasoned that applying 301 and 316(a) in criminal cases unnecessarily emphasizes the deficiencys amount while ignoring the willfulness of the intent to evade taxes.  Willfulness is an element of the crimes because the substantive provisions defining tax evasion and filing a false return expressly require it, see, e.g., 7201.  Nothing in 301 and 316(a) relieves the Government of the burden of proving willfulness or impedes it from doing so if there is evidence of willfulness.  The Miller court also erred in finding it troublesome that, without a contemporaneous intent requirement, a shareholder distributee would be immune from punishment if the corporation had no earnings and profits but convicted if the corporation did have earning and profits.  An acquittal in the former instance would in fact result merely from the Governments failure to prove an element of the crime.  The fact that a shareholder of a successful corporation may have different tax liability from a shareholder of a corporation without earnings and profits merely follows from the way 301 and 316(a) are written and from 7201s tax deficiency requirement.  Even if there were compelling reasons to extend 7201 to cases in which no taxes are owed, Congress, not the Judiciary, would have to do the rewriting.  Pp.812.


(c)Miller also suffers from its own anomalies.  First, 301 and 316 are odd stalks for grafting a contemporaneous intent requirement.  Correct application of their rules will often become possible only at the end of the corporations tax year, regardless of the shareholder or corporations understanding months earlier when a particular distribution may have been made.  Moreover, 301(a), which expressly provides that distributions made with respect to stock shall be treated in the manner provided in [301(c)], ostensibly provides for all variations of tax treatment of such distributions unless a separate Code provision requires otherwise.  Yet Miller effectively converts the section into one of merely partial coverage, leaving the tax status of one class of distributions in limbo in criminal cases.  Allowing 61(a) of the Code, which defines gross income, [e]xcept as otherwise provided, as all income from whatever source derived, to step in where 301(a) has been pushed aside would sanction yet another eccentricity: 301(a) would not cover what it says it shall, (distributions with respect to stock for which no more specific provision is made), while 61(a) would have to apply to what by its terms it should not (a receipt of funds for which tax treatment is otherwise provided in 301(a)). Miller erred in requiring contemporaneous intent, and the Ninth Circuits judgment here, relying on Miller, is likewise erroneous.  Pp. 1214. 


(d)This Court declines to address the Governments argument that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that before any distribution may be treated as a return of capital, it must first be distributed to the shareholder with respect to  stock.  The facts in this case have not been raked over with that condition in mind, and any canvas of evidence and Boulwares proffer should be made by a court familiar with the entire evidentiary record.  Nor will the Court take up in the first instance the question whether an unlawful diversion may ever be deemed a distribution  with respect to [a corporations] stock.  Pp.1417.
470 F.3d 931, vacated and remanded.

Commissioner, 302 U. S. 63, 69, or as effective a means of returning a shareholders capital, see ibid.  Economic substance remains the touchstone for characterizing funds that a shareholder diverts before they can be recorded on a corporations books.  Pp.68.


(b)Millers view that a return-of-capital defense requires evidence of a corresponding contemporaneous intent sits uncomfortably not only with the tax laws economic realism, but also with the particular wording of 301 and 316(a).  As these sections are written, the tax consequences of a corporations distribution made with respect to stock depend, not on anyones purpose to return capital or get it back, but on facts wholly independent of intent: whether the corporation had earnings and profits, and the amount of the taxpayers basis for his stock.  The Miller court could claim no textual hook for its contemporaneous intent requirement, but argued that it avoided supposed anomalies.  The court, however, mistakenly reasoned that applying 301 and 316(a) in criminal cases unnecessarily emphasizes the deficiencys amount while ignoring the willfulness of the intent to evade taxes.  Willfulness is an element of the crimes because the substantive provisions defining tax evasion and filing a false return expressly require it, see, e.g., 7201.  Nothing in 301 and 316(a) relieves the Government of the burden of proving willfulness or impedes it from doing so if there is evidence of willfulness.  The Miller court also erred in finding it troublesome that, without a contemporaneous intent requirement, a shareholder distributee would be immune from punishment if the corporation had no earnings and profits but convicted if the corporation did have earning and profits.  An acquittal in the former instance would in fact result merely from the Governments failure to prove an element of the crime.  The fact that a shareholder of a successful corporation may have different tax liability from a shareholder of a corporation without earnings and profits merely follows from the way 301 and 316(a) are written and from 7201s tax deficiency requirement.  Even if there were compelling reasons to extend 7201 to cases in which no taxes are owed, Congress, not the Judiciary, would have to do the rewriting.  Pp.812.


(c)Miller also suffers from its own anomalies.  First, 301 and 316 are odd stalks for grafting a contemporaneous intent requirement.  Correct application of their rules will often become possible only at the end of the corporations tax year, regardless of the shareholder or corporations understanding months earlier when a particular distribution may have been made.  Moreover, 301(a), which expressly provides that distributions made with respect to stock shall be treated in the manner provided in [301(c)], ostensibly provides for all variations of tax treatment of such distributions unless a separate Code provision requires otherwise.  Yet Miller effectively converts the section into one of merely partial coverage, leaving the tax status of one class of distributions in limbo in criminal cases.  Allowing 61(a) of the Code, which defines gross income, [e]xcept as otherwise provided, as all income from whatever source derived, to step in where 301(a) has been pushed aside would sanction yet another eccentricity: 301(a) would not cover what it says it shall, (distributions with respect to stock for which no more specific provision is made), while 61(a) would have to apply to what by its terms it should not (a receipt of funds for which tax treatment is otherwise provided in 301(a)). Miller erred in requiring contemporaneous intent, and the Ninth Circuits judgment here, relying on Miller, is likewise erroneous.  Pp. 1214. 


(d)This Court declines to address the Governments argument that the judgment should be affirmed on the ground that before any distribution may be treated as a return of capital, it must first be distributed to the shareholder with respect to  stock.  The facts in this case have not been raked over with that condition in mind, and any canvas of evidence and Boulwares proffer should be made by a court familiar with the entire evidentiary record.  Nor will the Court take up in the first instance the question whether an unlawful diversion may ever be deemed a distribution  with respect to [a corporations] stock.  Pp.1417.

06-1322|"FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 061322.Argued November 6, 2007Decided February 27, 2008
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) requires that [n]o civil action  be commenced  until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 29 U. S.C. 626(d), but does not define the term charge.  After petitioner delivery service (FedEx) initiated programs tying its couriers compensation and continued employment to certain performance benchmarks, respondent Kennedy (hereinafter respondent), a FedEx courier over age 40, filed with the EEOC, in December 2001, a Form 283 Intake Questionnaire and a detailed affidavit supporting her contention that the FedEx programs discriminated against older couriers in violation of the ADEA.  In April 2002, respondent and others filed this ADEA suit claiming, inter alia, that the programs were veiled attempts to force out, harass, and discriminate against older couriers.  FedEx moved to dismiss respondents action, contending she had not filed the charge required by 626(d).  Respondent countered that her Form 283 and affidavit constituted a valid charge, but the District Court disagreed and granted FedExs motion.  The Second Circuit reversed.  
Held:  
1.In addition to the information required by the implementing regulations, i.e., an allegation of age discrimination and the name of the charged party, if a filing is to be deemed a charge under the ADEA it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employees rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee.  Pp.313.


(a)There is little dispute that the EEOCs regulationsso far as they goare reasonable constructions of the statutory term charge and are therefore entitled to deference under Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843845.  However, while the regulations give some content to the term charge, they fall short of a comprehensive definition.  Thus, the issue is the guidance the regulations give.  Title 29 CFR 1626.3 says: charge shall mean a statement filed with the [EEOC] which alleges that the named prospective defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in acts in violation of the Act.  Section 1626.8(a) identifies information a charge should contain, including:  the employees and employers names, addresses, and phone numbers; an allegation that the employee was the victim of age discrimination; the number of employees of the charged employer; and a statement indicating whether the charging party has initiated state proceedings.  Section 1626.8(b), however, seems to qualify these requirements by stating that a charge is sufficient if it meets the requirements of 1626.6i.e., if it is in writing and  name[s] the prospective respondent and  generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).  That the meaning of charge remains unclear, even with the regulations, is evidenced by the differing positions of the parties and the Courts of Appeals on the matter.  Pp.35. 


(b)Just as this Court defers to reasonable statutory interpretations, an agency is entitled to deference when it adopts a reasonable interpretation of its regulations, unless its position is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.  The Court accords such deference to the EEOCs position that its regulations identify certain requirements for a charge but do not provide an exhaustive definition.  It follows that a document meeting 1626.6s requirements is not a charge in every instance.  The language in 1626.6 and 1626.8 cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the regulations.  While the regulations structure is less than clear, the relevant provisions are grouped under the title, ProceduresAge Discrimination in Employment Act.  A permissible reading is that the regulations identify the procedures for filing a charge but do not state the full contents of a charge.  Pp.56. 


(c)That does not resolve this case because the regulations do not state what additional elements are required in a charge.  The EEOC submits, in accordance with a position it has adopted in internal directives over the years, that the proper test is whether a filing, taken as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for the EEOC to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights.  Pp.68. 


(d)The EEOC acted within its authority in formulating its request-to-act requirement.  The agencys policy statements, embodied in its compliance manual and internal directives, interpret not only its regulations but also the statute itself.  Assuming these interpretive statements are not entitled to full Chevron deference, they nevertheless are entitled to a measure of respect under the less deferential standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, see Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487, whereby the Court considers whether the agency has consistently applied its position, e.g., United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228.  Here, the relevant interpretive statement has been binding on EEOC staff for at least five years.  True, the agencys implementation has been uneven; e.g., its field office did not treat respondents filing as a charge, and, as a result, she filed suit before the EEOC could initiate conciliation with FedEx.  Such undoubted deficiencies are not enough, however, to deprive an agency that processes over 175,000 inquiries a year of all judicial deference.  Moreover, the charge must be defined in a way that allows the agency to fulfill its distinct statutory functions of enforcing antidiscrimination laws, see 29 U. S.C. 626(d), and disseminating information about those laws to the public, see, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, 705(i), 705(g)(3).  Pp.812.


(e)FedExs view that because the EEOC must act [u]pon receiving  a charge, 29 U. S.C. 626(d), its failure to do so means the filing is not a charge, is rejected as too artificial a reading of the ADEA.  The statute requires the aggrieved individual to file a charge before filing a lawsuit; it does not condition the individuals right to sue upon the agency taking any action.  Cf. Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 112113.  Moreover, because the filing of a charge determines when the ADEAs time limits and procedural mechanisms commence, it would be illogical and impractical to make the definition of charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over which the parties have no control.  Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 444.  Pp.1213.


2.The agencys determination that respondents December 2001 filing was a charge is a reasonable exercise of its authority to apply its own regulations and procedures in the course of the routine administration of the statute it enforces.  Pp.1317.


(a)Respondents completed Form 283 contained all the information outlined in 29 CFR 1626.8, and, although the form did not itself request agency action, the accompanying affidavit asked the EEOC to force [FedEx] to end [its] age discrimination plan.  FedEx contends unpersuasively that, in context, the latter statement is ambiguous because the affidavit also stated: I have been  assur[ed] by [the EEOC] that this Affidavit will be considered confidential  and will not be disclosed  unless it becomes necessary  to produce the affidavit in a formal proceeding.  This argument reads too much into the nondisclosure assurances.  Respondent did not request the EEOC to avoid contacting FedEx, but stated only her understanding that the affidavit itself would be kept confidential and, even then, consented to disclosure of the affidavit in a formal proceeding.  Furthermore, respondent checked a box on the Form 283 giving consent for the EEOC to disclose her identity to FedEx.  The fact that respondent filed a formal charge with the EEOC after she filed her District Court complaint is irrelevant because postfiling conduct does not nullify an earlier, proper charge.  Pp.1315. 


(b)Because the EEOC failed to treat respondents filing as a charge in the first instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEAs informal dispute resolution process.  The court that hears the merits can attempt to remedy this deficiency by staying the proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation and settlement.  While that remedy is imperfect, it is unavoidable in this case.  However, the ultimate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more consistent process lies with the EEOC, which should determine, in the first instance, what revisions to its forms and processes are necessary or appropriate to reduce the risk of future misunderstandings by those who seek its assistance.  Pp.1617.

06-1463|"PRESTON v. FERRER
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district
No. 061463.Argued January 14, 2008Decided February 20, 2008
A contract between respondent Ferrer, who appears on television as Judge Alex, and petitioner Preston, an entertainment industry attorney, requires arbitration of any dispute  relating to the [contracts] terms  or the breach, validity, or legality thereof  in accordance with [American Arbitration Association (AAA)] rules.  Preston invoked this provision to gain fees allegedly due under the contract.  Ferrer thereupon petitioned the California Labor Commissioner (Labor Commissioner) for a determination that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under Californias Talent Agencies Act (TAA) because Preston had acted as a talent agent without the required license.  After the Labor Commissioners hearing officer denied Ferrers motion to stay the arbitration, Ferrer filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin arbitration, and Preston moved to compel arbitration.  The court denied Prestons motion and enjoined him from proceeding before the arbitrator unless and until the Labor Commissioner determined she lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.  While Prestons appeal was pending, this Court held, in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 446, that challenges to the validity of a contract requiring arbitration of disputes ordinarily should be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.  Affirming the judgment below, the California Court of Appeal held that the TAA vested the Labor Commissioner with exclusive original jurisdiction over the dispute, and that Buckeye was inapposite because it did not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.  
Held:When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.C. 1 et seq., supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.  Pp.416.
(a)The issue is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.  Instead, the question is simply who decidesthe arbitrator or the Labor Commissionerwhether Preston acted as an unlicensed talent agent in violation of the TAA, as Ferrer claims, or as a personal manager not governed by the TAA, as Preston contends.  P.4.


(b)FAA 2 declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution.  Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1,10.  That national policy appli[es] in state as well as federal courts and foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.  Id., at 16.  The FAAs displacement of conflicting state law has been repeatedly reaffirmed.  See, e.g., Buckeye, 546 U. S., at445446; Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272.   A recurring question under 2 is who should decide whether grounds  exist at law or in equity to invalidate an arbitration agreement.  In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403404, which originated in federal court, this Court held that attacks on an entire contracts validity, as distinct from attacks on the arbitration clause alone, are within the arbitrators ken.  Buckeye held that the same rule applies in state court.  See 546 U. S., at 446.


Buckeye largely, if not entirely, resolves the present dispute.  The contract at issue clearly evidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce under 2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the contracts written arbitration provision falls within 2s purview.  Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole.  He made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause, and thus sought to override that clause on a ground Buckeye requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.  Pp. 56. 


(c)Ferrer attempts to distinguish Buckeye, urging that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration.  This argument is unconvincing.  Pp.612.


(1)Procedural prescriptions of the TAA conflict with the FAAs dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: (1) One TAA provision grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see Buckeye, 546 U. S., at446; (2) another imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see Doctors Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687.   Pp.78. 


(2)Ferrer contends that the TAA is compatible with the FAA because the TAA provision vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Labor Commissioner merely postpones arbitration.  That position is contrary to the one Ferrer took in the California courts and does not withstand examination.  Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioners decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress intent to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 22.  Pp.810.


(3)Ferrer contends that the conflict between the arbitration clause and the TAA should be overlooked because Labor Commissioner proceedings are administrative rather than judicial.  The Court rejected a similar argument in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 2829.  Pp.1012.


(d)Ferrers reliance on Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, is misplaced for two reasons.  First, arbitration was stayed in Volt to accommodate litigation involving third parties who were strangers to the arbitration agreement.  Because the contract at issue in Volt did not address the order of proceedings and included a choice-of-law clause adopting California law, the Volt Court recognized as the gap filler a California statute authorizing the state court to stay either third-party court proceedings or arbitration proceedings to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue.  Here, in contrast, the arbitration clause speaks to the matter in controversy; both parties are bound by the arbitration agreement; the question of Prestons status as a talent agent relates to the validity or legality of the contract; there is no risk that related litigation will yield conflicting rulings on common issues; and there is no other procedural void for the choice-of-law clause to fill.  Second, the Court is guided by its decision in Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52.  Although the Volt contract provided for arbitration in accordance with AAA rules, 489 U. S., at470, n.1, Volt never argued that incorporation of those rules by reference trumped the contracts choice-of-law clause, so this Court never addressed the import of such incorporation.  In Mastrobuono, the Court reached that open question, declaring that the best way to harmonize a New York choice-of-law clause and a clause providing for arbitration in accordance with privately promulgated arbitration rules was to read the choice-of-law clause to encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, but not to include [New Yorks] special rules limiting [arbitrators] authority.  514 U. S., at6364.  Similarly here, the best way to harmonize the Ferrer-Preston contracts adoption of the AAA rules and its selection of California law is to read the latter to encompass prescriptions governing the parties substantive rights and obligations, but not the States special rules limiting [arbitrators] authority.

			"|"PRESTON v. FERRER
certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district
No. 061463.Argued January 14, 2008Decided February 20, 2008
A contract between respondent Ferrer, who appears on television as Judge Alex, and petitioner Preston, an entertainment industry attorney, requires arbitration of any dispute  relating to the [contracts] terms  or the breach, validity, or legality thereof  in accordance with [American Arbitration Association (AAA)] rules.  Preston invoked this provision to gain fees allegedly due under the contract.  Ferrer thereupon petitioned the California Labor Commissioner (Labor Commissioner) for a determination that the contract was invalid and unenforceable under Californias Talent Agencies Act (TAA) because Preston had acted as a talent agent without the required license.  After the Labor Commissioners hearing officer denied Ferrers motion to stay the arbitration, Ferrer filed suit in state court seeking to enjoin arbitration, and Preston moved to compel arbitration.  The court denied Prestons motion and enjoined him from proceeding before the arbitrator unless and until the Labor Commissioner determined she lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.  While Prestons appeal was pending, this Court held, in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 446, that challenges to the validity of a contract requiring arbitration of disputes ordinarily should be considered by an arbitrator, not a court.  Affirming the judgment below, the California Court of Appeal held that the TAA vested the Labor Commissioner with exclusive original jurisdiction over the dispute, and that Buckeye was inapposite because it did not involve an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction over a disputed issue.  
Held:When parties agree to arbitrate all questions arising under a contract, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S.C. 1 et seq., supersedes state laws lodging primary jurisdiction in another forum, whether judicial or administrative.  Pp.416.
(a)The issue is not whether the FAA preempts the TAA wholesale.  Instead, the question is simply who decidesthe arbitrator or the Labor Commissionerwhether Preston acted as an unlicensed talent agent in violation of the TAA, as Ferrer claims, or as a personal manager not governed by the TAA, as Preston contends.  P.4.


(b)FAA 2 declare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration when the parties contract for that mode of dispute resolution.  Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1,10.  That national policy appli[es] in state as well as federal courts and foreclose[s] state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.  Id., at 16.  The FAAs displacement of conflicting state law has been repeatedly reaffirmed.  See, e.g., Buckeye, 546 U. S., at445446; Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272.   A recurring question under 2 is who should decide whether grounds  exist at law or in equity to invalidate an arbitration agreement.  In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403404, which originated in federal court, this Court held that attacks on an entire contracts validity, as distinct from attacks on the arbitration clause alone, are within the arbitrators ken.  Buckeye held that the same rule applies in state court.  See 546 U. S., at 446.


Buckeye largely, if not entirely, resolves the present dispute.  The contract at issue clearly evidenc[ed] a transaction involving commerce under 2, and Ferrer has never disputed that the contracts written arbitration provision falls within 2s purview.  Ferrer sought invalidation of the contract as a whole.  He made no discrete challenge to the validity of the arbitration clause, and thus sought to override that clause on a ground Buckeye requires the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.  Pp. 56. 


(c)Ferrer attempts to distinguish Buckeye, urging that the TAA merely requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before the parties proceed to arbitration.  This argument is unconvincing.  Pp.612.


(1)Procedural prescriptions of the TAA conflict with the FAAs dispute resolution regime in two basic respects: (1) One TAA provision grants the Labor Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide an issue that the parties agreed to arbitrate, see Buckeye, 546 U. S., at446; (2) another imposes prerequisites to enforcement of an arbitration agreement that are not applicable to contracts generally, see Doctors Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687.   Pp.78. 


(2)Ferrer contends that the TAA is compatible with the FAA because the TAA provision vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Labor Commissioner merely postpones arbitration.  That position is contrary to the one Ferrer took in the California courts and does not withstand examination.  Arbitration, if it ever occurred following the Labor Commissioners decision, would likely be long delayed, in contravention of Congress intent to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 22.  Pp.810.


(3)Ferrer contends that the conflict between the arbitration clause and the TAA should be overlooked because Labor Commissioner proceedings are administrative rather than judicial.  The Court rejected a similar argument in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 2829.  Pp.1012.

ESTATE OF RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 06179.Argued December 4, 2007Decided February 20, 2008
The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) created a scheme of federal safety oversight for medical devices while sweeping back state oversight schemes.  The statute provides that a State shall not establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under [federal law] to the device, and  (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under relevant federal law.  21 U. S.C. 360k(a).  The MDA calls for federal oversight of medical devices that varies with the type of device at issue.  The most extensive oversight is reserved for Class III devices that undergo the premarket approval process.  These devices may enter the market only if the FDA reviews their design, labeling, and manufacturing specifications and determines that those specifications provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.  Manufacturers may not make changes to such devices that would affect safety or effectiveness unless they first seek and obtain permission from the FDA.  


Charles Riegel and his wife, petitioner Donna Riegel, brought suit against respondent Medtronic after a Medtronic catheter ruptured in Charles Riegels coronary artery during heart surgery.  The catheter is a Class III device that received FDA premarket approval.  The Riegels alleged that the device was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law.  The District Court held that the MDA pre-empted the Riegels claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter, and their claim of negligent manufacturing insofar as the claim was not premised on the theory that Medtronic had violated federal law.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  
Held:The MDAs pre-emption clause bars common-law claims challenging the safety or effectiveness of a medical device marketed in a form that received premarket approval from the FDA.  Pp.817.
(a)The Federal Government has established requirement[s] applicable  to Medtronics catheter within 360k(a)(1)s meaning.  In Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 495, 500501, the Court interpreted the MDAs pre-emption provision in a manner substantially informed by an FDA regulation, 21 CFR 808.1(d), which says that state requirements are pre-empted only when the FDA has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device under federal law.  Premarket approval imposes specific requirements applicable to a particular device.  The FDA requires that a device that has received premarket approval be marketed without significant deviations from the specifications in the devices approval application, for the reason that the FDA has determined that those specifications provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.  Pp.810. 


(b)Petitioners common-law claims are pre-empted because they are based upon New York requirement[s] with respect to Medtronics catheter that are different from, or in addition to the federal ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness, 360k(a).  Pp.1017.


(i)Common-law negligence and strict-liability claims impose requirement[s] under the ordinary meaning of that term, see, e.g., Lohr, supra, at 503505, 512, Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 521523, 548549.  There is nothing in the MDA that contradicts this normal meaning.  Pp.1012. 


(ii)The Court rejects petitioners contention that the duties underlying her state-law tort claims are not pre-empted because general common-law duties are not requirements maintained with respect to devices.  Petitioners suit depends upon New Yorks continu[ing] in effect general tort duties with respect to Medtronics catheter.  Title 21 CFR 808.1(d)(1)which states that MDA pre-emption does not extend to [s]tate or local requirements of general applicability [whose] purpose  relates either to other products in addition to devices  or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devicesdoes not alter the Courts interpretation.  Pp.1417. 


(c)The Court declines to address in the first instance petitioners argument that this lawsuit raises parallel claims that are not pre-empted by 360k under Lohr, supra, at 495, 513.  P.17.  
451 F.3d 104, affirmed.

06-457|"ROWE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MAINE v. NEW HAMPSHIRE MOTOR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit
No. 06457.Argued November 28, 2007Decided February 20, 2008
Although a provision of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 forbids States to enact or enforce a law  related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier, 49 U. S.C. 14501(c)(1), see also 41713(b)(4)(a), Maine adopted a law which, inter alia, (1) specifies that a state-licensed tobacco shipper must utilize a delivery company that provides a recipient-verification service that confirms the buyer is of legal age, and (2) adds, in prohibiting unlicensed tobacco shipments into the State, that a person is deemed to know that a package contains tobacco if it is marked as originating from a Maine-licensed tobacco retailer or if it is received from someone whose name appears on an official list of un-licensed tobacco retailers distributed to package-delivery companies.  In respondent carrier associations suit, the District Court and the First Circuit agreed with respondents that Maines recipient-verification and deemed-to-know provisions were pre-empted by federal law.   
Held:Federal law pre-empts the two state-law provisions at issue.  Pp.311.
(a)In interpreting the 1994 federal Act, the Court follows Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378, in which it interpreted similar language in the pre-emption provision of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.  Voiding state enforcement of consumer fraud statutes against deceptive airline-fare advertisements, Morales determined, inter alia, that the federal Act pre-empted state actions having a connection with carrier rates, routes, or services, id., at 384; that pre-emption may occur even if a state law has only an indirect effect on rates, routes, or services, id., at 386; and that pre-emption occurs at least where state laws have a significant impact related to Congress deregulatory and pre-emption-related objectives, id., at 390.  The Court also emphasized that the airline Acts overarching goal of helping assure that transportation rates, routes, and services reflects maximum reliance on competitive market forces, id., at 378, and stated that federal law might not pre-empt state laws affecting fares only tenuously, remotely, or peripherally, but did not say where, or how, it would draw the line on borderline questions, id., at 390.  Pp.35. 


(b)In light of Morales, the Maine laws at issue are pre-empted.  In regulating delivery service procedures, the recipient-verification provision focuses on trucking and similar services, thereby creating a direct connection with motor carrier services.  See 504 U. S., at 384.  It also has a significant and adverse impact in respect to the federal Acts ability to achieve its pre-emption-related objectives, id., at 390, because it requires carriers to offer a system of services that the market does not now provide (and which the carriers would prefer not to offer).  Even were that not so, the law would freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future, thereby producing the very effect the federal law sought to avoid, i.e., a States direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces in determining (to a significant degree) the services that motor carriers will provide.  Id., at 378.  Maines deemed-to-know provision applies yet more directly to motor carrier services by creating a conclusive presumption of carrier knowledge that a shipment contains tobacco in the specified circumstances.  That presumption means that the law imposes civil liability upon the carrier, not simply for its knowing transport of (unlicensed) tobacco, but for the carriers failure sufficiently to examine every package.  The provision thus requires the carrier to check each shipment for certain markings and to compare it against the list of proscribed shippers, thereby directly regulating a significant aspect of the motor carriers package pick-up and delivery service and creating the kind of state-mandated regulation that the federal Act pre-empts.  Pp.57. 


(c)Maines primary arguments for an exception from pre-emptionthat its laws help prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes and thereby protect its citizens public healthare unavailing.  The federal law does not create a public health exception, but, to the contrary, explicitly lists a set of exceptions that do not include public health.  See, e.g., 14501(c)(2) to (c)(3).  Nor does its legislative history mention specific state enforcement methods or suggest that Congress made a firm judgment about, or even focused upon, the issue here.  Maines inability to find significant support for such an exception is not surprising, given the number of States through which carriers travel, the number of products carried, the variety of potential adverse public health effects, the many different kinds of regulatory rules potentially available, and the difficulty of finding a legal criterion for separating permissible from impermissible public-health-oriented regulations.  Although federal law does not generally pre-empt state public health regulation, the state laws at issue are not general, their impact on carrier rates, routes, or services is significant, and their connection with trucking is not tenuous, remote, or peripheral: They aim directly at the carriage of goods, a commercial field where carriage by commercial motor vehicles plays a major role.  From the perspective of pre-emption, this case is no more borderline than was Morales.  Maines argument that to set aside its regulations will seriously harm its efforts to prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes is unpersuasive in light of other legislative alternatives available to the State.  Regardless, given Morales holding that federal law pre-empts state consumer-protection laws, federal law must also pre-empt Maines efforts directly to regulate carrier services.  Pp.711. 
448 F.3d 66, affirmed.

Although federal law does not generally pre-empt state public health regulation, the state laws at issue are not general, their impact on carrier rates, routes, or services is significant, and their connection with trucking is not tenuous, remote, or peripheral: They aim directly at the carriage of goods, a commercial field where carriage by commercial motor vehicles plays a major role.  From the perspective of pre-emption, this case is no more borderline than was Morales.  Maines argument that to set aside its regulations will seriously harm its efforts to prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes is unpersuasive in light of other legislative alternatives available to the State.  Regardless, given Morales holding that federal law pre-empts state consumer-protection laws, federal law must also pre-empt Maines efforts directly to regulate carrier services.  Pp.711.

certiorari to the supreme court of minnesota
No. 068273.Argued October 31, 2007Decided February 20, 2008
After this Court announced a new rule for evaluating the reliability of testimonial statements in criminal cases, see Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 6869, petitioner sought state postconviction relief, arguing that he was entitled to a new trial because admitting the victims taped interview at his trial violated Crawfords rule.  The Minnesota trial and appeals courts concluded that Crawford did not apply retroactively under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.  The State Supreme Court agreed, and also concluded that state courts are not free to give a decision of this Court announcing a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure broader retroactive application than that given by this Court.   
Held:Teague does not constrain the authority of state courts to give broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure than is required by that opinion.  Pp.427.
(a)Crawford announced a new ruleas defined by Teaguebecause its result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendants conviction became final, Teague, 489 U. S., at 301 (plurality opinion).  It was not, however, a rule of [this Courts] own devising or the product of its own views about sound policy, Crawford, 541 U. S., at 67.  Pp.46.


(b)The Court first adopted a retroactivity standard in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 629, but later rejected that standard for cases pending on direct review, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, and on federal habeas review, Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.  Under Teague, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure may not be applied retroactively to cases on federal habeas review unless they place certain primary individual conduct beyond the States power to proscribe or are watershed rules of criminal procedure.  Id., at 310 (plurality opinion).  Pp.611.


(c)Neither Linkletter nor Teague explicitly or implicitly constrained the States authority to provide remedies for a broader range of constitutional violations than are redressable on federal habeas.  And Teague makes clear that its rule was tailored to the federal habeas context and thus had no bearing on whether States could provide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings.  Nothing in Justice OConnors general nonretroactivity rule discussion in Teague asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligible for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of a state agency or state court to extend a new rules benefit to a broader class than she defined.  Her opinion also clearly indicates that Teagues general nonretroactivity rule was an exercise of this Courts power to interpret the federal habeas statute.  Since Teague is based on statutory authority that extends only to federal courts applying a federal statute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation on state courts.  The opinions text and reasoning also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas petitions challenging state-court criminal convictions.  The federal interest in uniformity in the application of federal law does not outweigh the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees.  The Teague rule was intended to limit federal courts authority to overturn state convictions not to limit a state courts authority to grant relief for violations of new constitutional law rules when reviewing its own States convictions.  Subsequent cases confirm this view.  See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 412.  Pp.1118.


(d)Neither Michigan v. Payne, 412 U. S. 47, nor American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, cast doubt on the state courts authority to provide broader remedies for federal constitutional violations than mandated by  Teague.  Pp.1824.


(e)No federal rule, either implicitly announced in Teague, or in some other source of federal law, prohibits States from giving broader retroactive effect to new rules of criminal procedure.  Pp. 2426.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit
No. 06856.Argued November 26, 2007Decided February 20, 2008
Petitioner, a participant in a defined contribution pension plan, alleged that the plan administrators failure to follow petitioners investment directions depleted his interest in the plan by approximately $150,000 and amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The District Court granted respondents judgment on the pleadings, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  Relying on Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, the Circuit held that ERISA 502(a)(2) provides remedies only for entire plans, not for individuals.
Held:Although 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries, it does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participants individual account.  Section 502(a)(2) provides for suits to enforce the liability-creating provisions of 409, concerning breaches of fiduciary duties that harm plans.  The principal statutory duties imposed by 409 relate to the proper management, administration, and investment of plan assets, with an eye toward ensuring that the benefits authorized by the plan are ultimately paid to plan participants.  The misconduct that petitioner alleges falls squarely within that category, unlike the misconduct in Russell.  There, the plaintiff received all of the benefits to which she was contractually entitled, but sought consequential damages arising from a delay in the processing of her claim.  Russells emphasis on protecting the entire plan reflects the fact that the disability plan in Russell, as well as the typical pension plan at that time, promised participants a fixed benefit.  Misconduct by such a plans administrators will not affect an individuals entitlement to a defined benefit unless it creates or enhances the risk of default by the entire plan.  For defined contribution plans, however, fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the entire plans solvency to reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.  Whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants or only to particular individuals, it creates the kind of harms that concerned 409s draftsmen.  Thus, Russells entire plan references, which accurately reflect 409s operation in the defined benefit context, are beside the point in the defined contribution context.  Pp.48.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
No. 069130.Argued October 29, 2007Decided January 22, 2008
The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the United States sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees, see 28 U. S.C. 1346(b)(1), but, as relevant here, exempts from that waiver [a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any  property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, 2680(c).  Upon his transfer from an Atlanta federal prison to one in Kentucky, petitioner noticed that several items were missing from his personal property, which had been shipped to the new facility by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  Alleging that BOP officers had lost his property, petitioner filed this suit under, inter alia, the FTCA, but the District Court dismissed that claim as barred by 2680(c).  Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit rejected petitioners argument that the statutory phrase any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer applies only to officers enforcing customs or excise laws.  
Held:Section 2680(c)s text and structure demonstrate that the broad phrase any other law enforcement officer covers all law enforcement officers.  Petitioners argument that 2680(c) is focused on preserving sovereign immunity only for officers enforcing customs and excise laws is inconsistent with the statutes language.  Read naturally, the word any has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.  United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5.  For example, in considering a provision imposing an additional sentence that was not to run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, 18 U. S.C. 924(c)(1), the Gonzales Court held that, notwithstanding the subsections initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, the expansive word any and the absence of restrictive language left no basis in the text for limiting the phrase any other term of imprisonment to federal sentences.  520 U. S., at 5.  To similar effect, see Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 588589, in which the Court held that there was no indication whatever that Congress intended to limit the expansive language any other final action to particular kinds of agency action.  The reasoning of Gonzales and Harrison applies equally to 28 U. S.C. 2680(c): Congress use of any to modify other law enforcement officer is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.  To be sure, the texts references to tax or customs duty and officer[s] of customs or excise indicate an intent to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officers enforcement of tax and customs laws.  The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from the detention of property, and there is no indication of any intent that immunity for those claims turns on the type of law being enforced.  Recent amendments to 2680(c) restoring the sovereign immunity waiver for officers enforcing any federal forfeiture law, see 2680(c)(1), support the Courts conclusion by demonstrating Congress view that, prior to the amendments, 2680(c) covered all law enforcement officers.  Against this textual and structural evidence, petitioners reliance on the canons of statutory construction ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis and on the rule against superfluities is unconvincing.  The Court is unpersuaded by petitioners attempt to create ambiguity where the statutes structure and text suggest none.  Had Congress intended to limit 2680(c)s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written any other law enforcement officer acting in a customs or excise capacity.  Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase any other law enforcement officer.  This Court must give effect to the text Congress enacted.  Pp.313.

TESTAMENTARY TRUST v. COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 061286.Argued November 27, 2007Decided January 16, 2008
Individuals may subtract from their federal taxable income certain itemized deductions, 26 U. S.C. 63(d), but only to the extent the deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income, 67(a).  A trust may also take such deductions subject to the 2% floor, 67(e), except that when the relevant cost is paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the  trust and would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust, the cost may be deducted without regard to the floor, 67(e)(1).  After petitioner Knight (Trustee), the trustee of a testamentary trust (Trust), hired the Warfield firm to advise as to Trust investments, the Trust deducted in full on its fiduciary income tax return the investment advisory fees paid to Warfield.  Respondent Commissioner found the fees subject to the 2% floor and therefore allowed the deduction only to the extent the fees exceeded 2% of the Trusts adjusted gross income.  The Tax Court decided for the Commissioner, and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that because such fees were costs of a type that could be incurred if the property were held individually rather than in trust, their deduction by the Trust was subject to the 2% floor.  
Held:Investment advisory fees generally are subject to the 2% floor when incurred by a trust.  Pp.513.
(a)In asking whether a particular type of cost incurred by a trust would not have been incurred if the property were held by an individual, 67(e)(1) excepts from the 2% floor only those costs that it would be uncommon (or unusual, or unlikely) for such a hypothetical individual to incur.  The question whether a trust-related expense is fully deductible turns on a prediction about what would happen if a fact were changedspecifically, if the property were held by an individual rather than by a trust.  Predictions are based on what would customarily or commonly occur.  Thus, in the context of making such a prediction, when there is uncertainty about the answer, the word would is best read to express concepts such as custom, habit, natural disposition, or probability.  Although the statutory text does not expressly ask whether expenses are customarily incurred outside of trusts, that is the direct import of the language in context.  The Second Circuits approach, which asks whether the cost at issue could have been incurred by an individual, flies in the face of the statutory language.  Had Congress intended the Court of Appeals reading, it easily could have replaced would with could in 67(e)(1), and presumably would have.  The Trustees argument that the proper inquiry is whether a particular expense of a particular trust was caused by the fact that the property was held in trust fails because the statute by its terms does not establish a straightforward causation test, but instead looks to the counterfactual question whether an individual would have incurred such costs in the absence of a trust.  Further, under the Trustees approach, every trust-related expense would be fully deductible, thus allowing the exception to the 2% floor in 67(e)(1) to swallow the general rule.  Pp. 510. 


(b)The Trusts investment advisory fees are subject to the 2% floor.  The Trusteewho has the burden of establishing entitlement to the deduction, see, e.g., INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U. S. 79, 84has not demonstrated that it is uncommon or unusual for individuals to hire an investment adviser.  His argument is that individuals cannot incur trust investment advisory fees, not that individuals do not commonly incur investment advisory fees.  Indeed, his essential point is that he engaged an investment adviser because of his fiduciary duties under Connecticut law, which requires a trustee to invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would.  This prudent investor standard plainly does not refer to a prudent trustee, but looks instead to what a prudent investor with the same investment objectives handling his own affairs would doi.e., a prudent individual investor.  Because a hypothetical prudent investor in petitioners position would reasonably have solicited investment advice, it is quite difficult to say that the investment advisory fees would not have been incurredi.e., that it would be unusual or uncommon for such fees to have been incurredif the property were held by an individual investor with the same objectives as the Trust in handling his own affairs.  While Congresss decision to phrase the pertinent inquiry in terms of a prediction about a hypothetical situation inevitably entails some uncertainty, that is no excuse for judicial amendment of the statute.  The Code elsewhere poses similar questions, see, e.g., 162(a), 212, and the inquiry is in any event what 67(e)(1) requires.  Although some trust-related investment advisory fees may be fully deductible if an investment adviser were to impose a special, additional charge applicable only to its fiduciary accounts, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Warfield did so, or treated the Trust any differently than it would have treated an individual with similar objectives, because of the Trustees fiduciary obligations.  Nor does the Trust assert that its investment objectives or balancing of competing interests were so distinctive that any comparison with those of an individual investor would be improper.  Pp.1013.
467 F.3d 149, affirmed.  
Roberts, C.J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The question whether a trust-related expense is fully deductible turns on a prediction about what would happen if a fact were changedspecifically, if the property were held by an individual rather than by a trust.  Predictions are based on what would customarily or commonly occur.  Thus, in the context of making such a prediction, when there is uncertainty about the answer, the word would is best read to express concepts such as custom, habit, natural disposition, or probability.  Although the statutory text does not expressly ask whether expenses are customarily incurred outside of trusts, that is the direct import of the language in context.  The Second Circuits approach, which asks whether the cost at issue could have been incurred by an individual, flies in the face of the statutory language.  Had Congress intended the Court of Appeals reading, it easily could have replaced would with could in 67(e)(1), and presumably would have.  The Trustees argument that the proper inquiry is whether a particular expense of a particular trust was caused by the fact that the property was held in trust fails because the statute by its terms does not establish a straightforward causation test, but instead looks to the counterfactual question whether an individual would have incurred such costs in the absence of a trust.  Further, under the Trustees approach, every trust-related expense would be fully deductible, thus allowing the exception to the 2% floor in 67(e)(1) to swallow the general rule.  Pp. 510. 


(b)The Trusts investment advisory fees are subject to the 2% floor.  The Trusteewho has the burden of establishing entitlement to the deduction, see, e.g., INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U. S. 79, 84has not demonstrated that it is uncommon or unusual for individuals to hire an investment adviser.  His argument is that individuals cannot incur trust investment advisory fees, not that individuals do not commonly incur investment advisory fees.  Indeed, his essential point is that he engaged an investment adviser because of his fiduciary duties under Connecticut law, which requires a trustee to invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would.  This prudent investor standard plainly does not refer to a prudent trustee, but looks instead to what a prudent investor with the same investment objectives handling his own affairs would doi.e., a prudent individual investor.  Because a hypothetical prudent investor in petitioners position would reasonably have solicited investment advice, it is quite difficult to say that the investment advisory fees would not have been incurredi.e., that it would be unusual or uncommon for such fees to have been incurredif the property were held by an individual investor with the same objectives as the Trust in handling his own affairs.  While Congresss decision to phrase the pertinent inquiry in terms of a prediction about a hypothetical situation inevitably entails some uncertainty, that is no excuse for judicial amendment of the statute.  The Code elsewhere poses similar questions, see, e.g., 162(a), 212, and the inquiry is in any event what 67(e)(1) requires.  Although some trust-related investment advisory fees may be fully deductible if an investment adviser were to impose a special, additional charge applicable only to its fiduciary accounts, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Warfield did so, or treated the Trust any differently than it would have treated an individual with similar objectives, because of the Trustees fiduciary obligations.  Nor does the Trust assert that its investment objectives or balancing of competing interests were so distinctive that any comparison with those of an individual investor would be improper.  Pp.1013.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit
No. 06766.Argued October 3, 2007Decided January 16, 2008
Under New Yorks current Constitution, State Supreme Court Justices are elected in each of the States judicial districts.  Since 1921, New Yorks election law has required parties to select their nominees by a convention composed of delegates elected by party members.  An individual running for delegate must submit a 500-signature petition collected within a specified time.  The conventions nominees appear automatically on the general-election ballot, along with any independent candidates who meet certain statutory requirements.  Respondents filed suit, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that New Yorks convention system violates the First Amendment rights of challengers running against candidates favored by party leaders and an injunction mandating a direct primary election to select Supreme Court nominees.  The Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction, pending the enactment of a new state statutory scheme, and the Second Circuit affirmed. 
Held:New Yorks system of choosing party nominees for the State Supreme Court does not violate the First Amendment.  Pp.512.
(a)Because a political party has a First Amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes, and to choose a candidate-selection process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform, a States power to prescribe party use of primaries or conventions to select nominees for the general election is not without limits.  California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 577.  However, respondents, who claim their own associational right to join and have influence in the party, are in no position to rely on the right that the First Amendment confers on political parties.  Pp.57.


(b)Respondents contention that New Yorks electoral system does not assure them a fair chance of prevailing in their parties candidate-selection process finds no support in this Courts precedents.  Even if Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51, 57, which acknowledged an individuals associational right to vote in a party primary without undue state-imposed impediment, were extended to cover the right to run in a party primary, the New York laws signature and deadline requirements are entirely reasonable.  A State may demand a minimum degree of support for candidate access to a ballot, see Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431, 442.  P.7.


(c)Respondents real complaint is that the convention process following the delegate election does not give them a realistic chance to secure their partys nomination because the party leadership garners more votes for its delegate slate and effectively determines the nominees.  This says no more than that the party leadership has more widespread support than a candidate not supported by the leadership.  Cases invalidating ballot-access requirements have focused on the requirements themselves, and not on the manner in which political actors function under those requirements.  E.g., Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134.  Those cases do not establish an individuals constitutional right to have a fair shot at winning a partys nomination.  Pp.710.


(d)Respondents argument that the existence of entrenched one-party rule in the States general election demands that the First Amendment be used to impose additional competition in the parties nominee-selection process is a novel and implausible reading of the First Amendment.  Pp.1012.

SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA, INC., etal.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
No. 0643.Argued October 9, 2007Decided January 15, 2008
Alleging losses after purchasing Charter Communications, Inc., common stock, petitioner filed suit against respondents and others under 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 10b5.  Acting as Charters customers and suppliers, respondents had agreed to arrangements that allowed Charter to mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial statement affecting its stock price, but they had no role in preparing or disseminating the financial statement.  Affirming the District Courts dismissal of respondents, the Eighth Circuit ruled that the allegations did not show that respondents made misstatements relied upon by the public or violated a duty to disclose.  The court observed that, at most, respondents had aided and abetted Charters misstatement, and noted that the private cause of action this Court has found implied in 10(b) and Rule 10b5, Superintendent of Ins. of N.Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U. S. 6, 13, n.9, does not extend to aiding and abetting a 10(b) violation, see Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 191.  
Held:The 10(b) private right of action does not reach respondents because Charter investors did not rely upon respondents statements or representations.  Pp.516.
(a)Although Central Bank prompted calls for creation of an express cause of action for aiding and abetting, Congress did not follow this course.  Instead, in 104 of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), it directed the SEC to prosecute aiders and abettors.  Thus, the 10(b) private right of action does not extend to aiders and abettors.  Because the conduct of a secondary actor must therefore satisfy each of the elements or preconditions for 10(b) liability, the plaintiff must prove, as here relevant, reliance upon a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant.  Pp.57. 


(b)The Court has found a rebuttable presumption of reliance in two circumstances.  First, if there is an omission of a material fact by one with a duty to disclose, the investor to whom the duty was owed need not provide specific proof of reliance.  Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U. S. 128, 153154.  Second, under the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, reliance is presumed when the statements at issue become public.  Neither presumption applies here: Respondents had no duty to disclose; and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the investing public during the relevant times.  Petitioner, as a result, cannot show reliance upon any of respondents actions except in an indirect chain that is too remote for liability.  P.8. 


(c)Petitioners reference to so-called scheme liability does not, absent a public statement, answer the objection that petitioner did not in fact rely upon respondents deceptive conduct.  Were the Court to adopt petitioners concept of reliancei.e., that in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to a security but also upon the transactions those statements reflectthe implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business.  There is no authority for this rule.  Reliance is tied to causation, leading to the inquiry whether respondents deceptive acts were immediate or remote to the injury.  Those acts, which were not disclosed to the investing public, are too remote to satisfy the reliance requirement.  It was Charter, not respondents, that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements; nothing respondents did made it necessary or inevitable for Charter to record the transactions as it did.  The Courts precedents counsel against petitioners attempt to extend the 10(b) private cause of action beyond the securities markets into the realm of ordinary business operations, which are governed, for the most part, by state law.  See, e.g., Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U. S. 551, 556.  The argument that there could be a reliance finding if this were a common-law fraud action is answered by the fact that 10(b) does not incorporate common-law fraud into federal law, see, e.g., SEC v. Zandford, 535 U. S. 813, 820, and should not be interpreted to provide a private cause of action against the entire marketplace in which the issuing company operates, cf. Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 733, n.5.  Petitioners theory, moreover, would put an unsupportable interpretation on Congress specific response to Central Bank in PSLRA 104 by, in substance, reviving the implied cause of action against most aiders and abettors and thereby undermining Congress determination that this class of defendants should be pursued only by the SEC.  The practical consequences of such an expansion provide a further reason to reject petitioners approach.  The extensive discovery and the potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit could allow plaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies.  See, e.g., Blue Chip, supra, at 740741.  It would also expose to such risks a new class of defendantsoverseas firms with no other exposure to U. S. securities lawsthereby deterring them from doing business here, raising the cost of being a publicly traded company under U. S. law, and shifting securities offerings away from domestic capital markets.  Pp.813. 


(d)Upon full consideration, the history of the 10(b) private right of action and the careful approach the Court has taken before proceeding without congressional direction provide further reasons to find no liability here.  The 10(b) private cause of action is a judicial construct that Congress did not direct in the text of the relevant statutes.  See, e.g., Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, 358359.  Separation of powers provides good reason for the now-settled view that an implied cause of action exists only if the underlying statute can be interpreted to disclose the intent to create one, see, e.g., Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286287.  The decision to extend the cause of action is thus for the Congress, not for this Court.  This restraint is appropriate in light of the PSLRA, in which Congress ratified the implied right of action after the Court moved away from a broad willingness to imply such private rights, see, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 381382, and n. 66.  It is appropriate for the Court to assume that when PSLRA 104 was enacted, Congress accepted the 10(b) private right as then defined but chose to extend it no further.  See, e.g., Alexander, supra, at 286287.  Pp.1315.

06-1164|"JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit
No. 061164.Argued November 6, 2007Decided January 8, 2008
In a Court of Federal Claims action, petitioner argued that various federal activities on land for which it held a mining lease amounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights.  The Government initially asserted that the claims were untimely under the court of claims statute of limitations, but later effectively conceded that issue and won on the merits.  Although the Government did not raise timeliness on appeal, the Federal Circuit addressed the issue sU. S.onte, finding the action untimely.  
Held:The court of claims statute of limitations requires sU. S.onte consideration of a lawsuits timeliness, despite the Governments waiver of the issue.  Pp.29.
(a)This Court has long interpreted the statute as setting out a more absolute, jurisdictional limitations period.  For example, in 1883, the Court concluded with regard to the current statutes predecessor that it [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.  Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123, 125126.  See also Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227, and Soriano v. United States, 352 U. S. 270.  That the statutes language has changed slightly since 1883 makes no difference here, for there has been no expression of congressional intent to change the underlying substantive law.  Pp.26.


(b)Thus, petitioner can succeed only by convincing the Court that it has overturned, or should overturn, its earlier precedent.  Pp.69.


(1)The Court did not do so in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, where it applied equitable tolling to a limitations statute governing employment discrimination claims against the Government.  While the Irwin Court noted the similarity of that statute to the court of claims statute, the civil rights statute is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation.  Moreover, the Irwin Court mentioned Soriano, which reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, but said nothing about overturning it or any other case in that line.  Finally, just as an equitable tolling presumption could be rebutted by statutory language demonstrating Congress contrary intent, it should be rebutted by a definitive earlier interpretation finding a similar congressional intent.  Language in Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145, describing the court of claims statute as unexceptional and citing Irwin for the proposition that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties refers only to the statutes claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioners contention that Irwin overruled earlier cases.  Pp.67.


(2)Stare decisis principles require rejection of petitioners argument that the Court should overturn Kendall, Finn, Soriano, and related cases.  Any anomaly such old cases and Irwin together create is not critical, but simply reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing national interests.  Moreover, the earlier cases do not produce unworkable law, see, e.g., United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856.  Stare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation also has special force.  Congress, which remains free to alter what [the Court has] done, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172173, has long acquiesced in the interpretation given here.  Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on the earlier cases, reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful.  Overturning a decision on the belief that it is no longer right would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others, and such willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability.  Pp.89.
457 F.3d 1345, affirmed.

(b)Thus, petitioner can succeed only by convincing the Court that it has overturned, or should overturn, its earlier precedent.  Pp.69.


(1)The Court did not do so in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, where it applied equitable tolling to a limitations statute governing employment discrimination claims against the Government.  While the Irwin Court noted the similarity of that statute to the court of claims statute, the civil rights statute is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation.  Moreover, the Irwin Court mentioned Soriano, which reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, but said nothing about overturning it or any other case in that line.  Finally, just as an equitable tolling presumption could be rebutted by statutory language demonstrating Congress contrary intent, it should be rebutted by a definitive earlier interpretation finding a similar congressional intent.  Language in Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145, describing the court of claims statute as unexceptional and citing Irwin for the proposition that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties refers only to the statutes claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioners contention that Irwin overruled earlier cases.  Pp.67.


(2)Stare decisis principles require rejection of petitioners argument that the Court should overturn Kendall, Finn, Soriano, and related cases.  Any anomaly such old cases and Irwin together create is not critical, but simply reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing national interests.  Moreover, the earlier cases do not produce unworkable law, see, e.g., United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856.  Stare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation also has special force.  Congress, which remains free to alter what [the Court has] done, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172173, has long acquiesced in the interpretation given here.  Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on the earlier cases, reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful.  Overturning a decision on the belief that it is no longer right would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others, and such willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability.  Pp.89.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the united
states court of appeals for the ninth circuit
No. 07110.Decided January 7, 2008
Per Curiam.

Respondent Maxwell Hoffman was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  See State v. Hoffman, 123 Idaho 638, 851 P.2d 934 (1993).  Hoffman sought federal habeas relief on the grounds that, inter alia, his counsel had been ineffective during both pretrial plea bargaining and the sentencing phase of his trial.  The District Court, finding that Hoffman had received ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing but not during plea bargaining, granted Hoffmans federal habeas petition in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence him.  Civ. Action No. 940200SBLW (Mar. 30, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 65.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Courts decision regarding ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing,* but reversed with respect to the ineffective assistance claim during plea negotiations.  455 F.3d 926, 942 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit thus granted the writ, ordering the District Court to direct the State either to release Hoffman or to offe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the same material terms offered in the original plea agreement.  Id., at 943.  The State sought, and we granted, certiorari.  552 U. S. ___ (2007).


Hoffman now abandons his claim that counsel was ineffective during plea bargaining.  See Respondents Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause as Moot.  He no longer seeks or desires the relief ordered by the Court of Appeals with respect to the plea offer.  Id., at 3.  Rather, Hoffman now wishes to withdraw his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with plea bargaining and asks this Court to dismiss his appeal with prejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with the resentencing ordered by the District Court.  Ibid. 


The State, in its response, notes that Hoffmans requested relief is virtually identical to the request made by the state in its Petition for Certiorari.  Response to Respondents Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause as Moot, p. 3.  The State therefore agrees that the instant motion to vacate and dismiss with prejudice moots Hoffmans claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations and asks that the motion be granted.


We grant respondents motion.  Because his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea bargaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals to the extent that it addressed that claim.  The case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with directions that it instruct the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to dismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.  Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 200201 (1988); United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 3940 (1950).
It is so ordered.
*The State initially cross-appealed the District Courts grant of Hoffmans habeas petition for ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.  The State, however, subsequently withdrew that cross-appeal, leaving in place the District Courts order granting habeas relief as to Hoffmans death sentence.  455 F.3d 926, 931 (CA9 2006).

07-212|"RANDALL WRIGHT, SHERIFF, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN v. JOSEPH L. VAN PATTEN
on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit
No. 07212.Decided January 7, 2008
Per Curiam.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that respondent Joseph Van Patten was entitled to relief under 28 U. S.C. 2254, reasoning that his lawyers assistance was presumptively ineffective owing to his participation in a plea hearing by speaker phone.  Van Patten v. Deppisch, 434 F.3d 1038 (2006).  We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. ___ (2006).  On remand, the Seventh Circuit adhered to its original decision, concluding that [n]othing in Musladin requires that our 2006 opinion be changed.  Van Patten v. Endicott, 489 F.3d 827, 828 (2007).  We grant the petition for certiorari now before us and this time reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.
I

Van Patten was charged with first-degree intentional homicide and pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide.  His counsel was not physically present at the plea hearing but was linked to the courtroom by speaker phone.  After the state trial court imposed the maximum term of 25 years in prison, Van Patten retained different counsel and moved in the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to withdraw his no-contest plea.  The thrust of the motion was that Van Pattens Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated by his trial counsels physical absence from the plea hearing.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals noted that, under state law, a postconviction motion to withdraw a no-contest plea will be granted only if a defendant establishes manifest injustice by clear and convincing evidence.  See State v. Van Pattten, No. 963036CR (Wis. App., May 28, 1997), App. to Pet. for Cert. A47A48.  While the court acknowledged that the violation of the defendants Sixth Amendment right to counsel may constitute a manifest injustice, id., at A48, it found that the absence of Van Pattens lawyer from the plea hearing did not violate his right to counsel:
The plea hearing transcript neither indicates any deficiency in the plea colloquy, nor suggests that Van Pattens attorneys participation by telephone interfered in any way with [Van Pattens] ability to communicate with his attorney about his plea.  Van Patten confirmed that he had thoroughly discussed his case and plea decision with his attorney and was satisfied with the legal representation he had received.  The court gave Van Patten the opportunity to speak privately with his attorney over the phone if he had questions about the plea, but Van Patten declined.  Further, when Van Patten exercised his right to allocution at sentencing, in the personal presence of his attorney, he raised no objection to his plea.  Id., at A49A50.

Applying Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), the court concluded that [t]he record does not support, nor does Van Pattens appellate brief include, any argument that counsels performance was deficient or prejudicial, No. 963036CR, App. to Pet. for Cert. A51, and denied Van Pattens motion.


After the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined further review, Van Patten petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.C. 2254 in Federal District Court.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.  It held that Van Pattens Sixth Amendment claim should have been resolved, not under Stricklands two-pronged test (which requires a showing of deficient performance and prejudice to the defendant), but under the standard discussed in United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648 (1984) (under which prejudice may be presumed).  Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that this case presents [a] novel  question, Deppisch, 434 F.3d, at 1040, and conceded that [u]nder Strickland, it seems clear [that] Van Patten would have no viable claim, id., at 1042, the court concluded that it is clear to us that Van Pattens case must be resolved under Cronic, id., at 1043.  The resolution was in Van Pattens favor.


While the prison wardens petition for certiorari was pending, this Court decided Musladin, supra.  Musladin had invoked this Courts cases recognizing that certain courtroom practices are so inherently prejudicial that they deprive the defendant of a fair trial, id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  The issue was the significance of these precedents in a case under 2254, which bars relief on any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless the state courts decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1).


The prejudicial conduct involved in Musladin was courtroom conduct of private actors.  We held that the inheren[t] prejudic[e] test, which we thus far have applied only in cases involving government-sponsored conduct, see, e.g., Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S. 501 (1976); Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986), did not clearly extend to the conduct of independently acting courtroom spectators.  See Musladin, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5) ([A]lthough the Court articulated the test for inherent prejudice that applies to state conduct in Williams and Flynn, we have never applied that test to spectators conduct.  Indeed, part of the legal test of Williams and Flynnasking whether the practices furthered an essential state interestsuggests that those cases apply only to state-sponsored practices).  For that reason, we reversed the Court of Appeals grant of habeas relief.


Musladins explanation of the clearly established Federal law requirement prompted us to remand Van Pattens case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration.  A majority of the panel reaffirmed its original judgment, however, on the ground that [u]nlike Musladin, this case does not concern an open constitutional question, because [t]he Supreme Court has long recognized a defendants right to relief if his defense counsel was actually or constructively absent at a critical stage of the proceedings.  489 F.3d, at 828.  Judge Coffey disagreed, observing that the United States Supreme Court has never held that an attorney is presumed to be ineffective if he participates in a plea hearing by speaker phone rather than by physical appearance.  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  He found that [t]he Majority Opinion does not comport with Musladin, ibid., and dissented from the courts erroneous decision to allow its original opinion to stand as written, id., at 829.  We reach the same conclusion.
II

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984) ordinarily applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea hearing stage.  See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 58 (1985) ([T]he two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel).  And it was in a different context that Cronic recognized a narrow exception to Stricklands holding that a defendant who asserts ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate not only that his attorneys performance was deficient, but also that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.  Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 190 (2004) (discussing Cronic).  Cronic held that a Sixth Amendment violation may be found without inquiring into counsels actual performance or requiring the defendant to show the effect it had on the trial, Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 695 (2002), when circumstances [exist] that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified, Cronic, supra, at 658.  Cronic, not Strickland, applies when  the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial, 466 U. S., at 659660,* and one circumstance warranting the presumption is the complete denial of counsel, that is, when counsel [is] either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding, id., at 659, and  n.25.
No decision of this Court, however, squarely addresses the issue in this case, see Deppisch, supra, at 1040 (noting that this case presents [a] novel  question), or clearly establishes that Cronic should replace Strickland in this novel factual context.  Our precedents do not clearly hold that counsels participation by speaker phone should be treated as a complete denial of counsel, on par with total absence.  Even if we agree with Van Patten that a lawyer physically present will tend to perform better than one on the phone, it does not necessarily follow that mere telephone contact amounted to total absence or prevented [counsel] from assisting the accused, so as to entail application of Cronic.  The question is not whether counsel in those circumstances will perform less well than he otherwise would, but whether the circumstances are likely to result in such poor performance that an inquiry into its effects would not be worth the time.  Cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 7) (Sixth Amendment ensures effective (not mistake-free) representation (emphasis in original)).  Our cases provide no categorical answer to this question, and for that matter the several proceedings in this case hardly point toward one.  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held counsels performance by speaker phone to be constitutionally effective; neither the Magistrate Judge, the District Court, nor the Seventh Circuit disputed this conclusion; and the Seventh Circuit itself stated that [u]nder Strickland, it seems clear Van Patten would have no viable claim.  Deppisch, 434 F.3d, at 1042.


Because our cases give no clear answer to the question presented, let alone one in Van Pattens favor, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.  Musladin, 549 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting 28 U. S.C. 2254(d)(1)).  Under the explicit terms of 2254(d)(1), therefore, relief is unauthorized.
***

Petitioner tells us that [i]n urging review, [the State] does not condone, recommend, or encourage the practice of defense counsel assisting clients by telephone rather than in person at court proceedings, even in nonadversarial hearings such as the plea hearing in this case, Pet. for Cert. 5, and he acknowledges that [p]erhaps, under similar facts in a direct federal appeal, the Seventh Circuit could have properly reached the same result it reached here, ibid.  Our own consideration of the merits of telephone practice, however, is for another day, and this case turns on the recognition that no clearly established law contrary to the state courts conclusion justifies collateral relief.
The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
*Cronic also applies when there [is] a breakdown in the adversarial process, 466 U. S., at 662, such that counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecutions case to meaningful adversarial testing, id., at 659.  We have made clear that [w]hen we spoke in Cronic of the possibility of presuming prejudice based on an attorneys failure to test the prosecutors case, we indicated that the attorneys failure must be complete.  Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 696697 (2002).  It is undisputed that this standard has not been met here.
